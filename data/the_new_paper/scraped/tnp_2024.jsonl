He moved from Michael Clements to trainer Jason Ong in September 2023.\n\nST PHOTO: SYAMIL SAPARI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 31, 2024, 02:27pm\n\nReturn at a Prosperous time\n\n2022 QEII Cup winner begins campaign for new trainer on Feb 3, before Fortune Bowl\n\nShare this article\n\nJason Ong is looking forward to racing recent high-profile stable transfer Prosperous Return for the first time on Feb 3.\n\nWithout taking anything away from rank-and-file but consistent horses like Major King, Top Field or Roda Robot that helped the Singaporean trainer land his first champion crown in 2023, this newcomer is in a slightly different league.\n\nAt 96 points, the Fighting Sun six-year-old shot straight to the top of the charts among Ong's string of 54 horses when he arrived upon Michael Clements' Singapore exit in September.\n\nUnlike Ong, Prosperous Return does boast a Group win feather to his cap - the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup (1,800m) on Oct 15, 2022, incidentally the last time he was sighted at Kranji.\n\nBut to the sixth-year trainer, the Tivic Stable ward is not the godsend to fill a glaring gap, which might, otherwise, feel even more pressing with the impending closure of Singapore racing on Oct 5.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe said breaking his feature hoodoo would be nice, but he would not lose sleep over it if he did not.\n\n\"With his high rating, he's definitely a horse who can represent me in feature races,\" said Ong.\n\n\"It'd be nice to tick that Group win box, but to be honest, I don't go chasing that.\n\n\"Besides, he'll be racing against young smart horses. But we're in it to win it, we'll give it our best shot.\"\n\nOng has actually already circled in red a feature race befitting the gelding's name - the Group 3 Fortune Bowl (1,400m) on Feb 11.\n\nNeedless to say, headline writers would have a field day should Prosperous Return win the traditional Chinese New Year race, which is also back after a three-year hiatus.\n\nOng is, however, not throwing the seven-time winner in at the deep end, especially not after a 16-month layoff.\n\nHe picked the $85,000 Class 2 (1,000m) on Feb 3 as the Fortune Bowl prelude, although, ideally, he would have preferred at least two weeks between runs. Brazil's Vitor Espindola rode him at the trials, and takes the race ride, too.\n\n\"Michael gave him a long spell after a knee surgery. He was just one week back from that spell when he came to me shortly after Michael left in September,\" said Ong.\n\n\"That was why I was always mindful how I would train him. I actually trained him differently from the other horses.\n\n\"I fed him a bit differently as I didn't want him to get too fat and put pressure on his joints.\n\n\"I don't weigh my horses, but I think he was lighter than usual. He was still in the right physical frame at his three trials.\n\n\"I wanted to keep him fit and fresh at the same time. That's why it took a while longer to get him back to the races.\n\n\"There aren't many options for highly-rated horses either. So this run over 1,000m will be a good blowout towards the Fortune Bowl.\n\n\"It should not be a problem based on his current condition. He's mature, relaxed and smart, stepping up to 1,400m one week later will not be an issue.\"\n\nWhile a \"prosperous return\" first-up will surprise, Ong can still come away with the spoils. He also saddles Major King in the race.\n\nThe all-Polytrack five-time winner (1,000m to 1,200m) maps better for that contest, but has two factors against him.\n\nThe Per Incanto five-year-old's turn of foot has been a touch blunted since stepping up to Class 2 and Group company. He also jumps from an awkward alley in nine.\n\n\"He had excuses at his last run. He didn't get into a good spot,\" said Ong, referring to his unplaced run in the Group 3 New Year Cup (1,200m) on Jan 6.\n\n\"We wanted him to relax behind the speed, but the pace was different from what we expected.\n\n\"He had also come to the end of his preparation. So, he's had four weeks between runs and he's come back fresher.\n\n\"It's a good gap. He didn't have to do too much, he's sharp. I'm very happy with him.\n\n\"The wide draw is the only downside he will have to overcome, otherwise, he's in very good condition.\"\n\nMajor King will be partnered by Marc Lerner who rode his first winner for Ong on Jan 27, Starboy.\n\n\"I got Marc to gallop Major King last week. I was impressed with how he kept the horse's head down,\" said Ong.\n\n\"He's a strong horse and can overrace in the morning. But Marc had his strides going nice and easy. He suits this horse.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3e2217c6d9156f896ef0495c681ed5376ccfeb27d04026c8d74460d7e627a39b/mlreturn01.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Prosperous Return (Jake Bayliss) has not raced since his Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup (1,800m) triumph on Oct 15, 2022.

But, to his credit, he has shown up and placed in the races which matter.\n\nLike that runner-up spot behind Lim's Lightning in the 2021 version of the Lion City Cup.\n\nAnd that third placing in the Kranji Mile of that same year.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nMore recently he again took third in the 2023 Merlion Trophy and it kept his ratings in the 90s.\n\nHowever, the win, to add to the four that he has already garnered, has not been forthcoming.\n\nBut, as they say, the cream always rises to the top.\n\nAnd we saw it on Jan 30 when, at the trials, Rocket Star with his lofty rating of 91, beat the daylights out of his rivals over the 1,000m.\n\nArya Pakuan - with a rating of 49 - took second in that hit-out, a short head in front of Ejaz (72 points).\n\nBut if you were on hand to watch the proceedings, you would have said there was no way Rocket Star was going to come up tops.\n\nUnder Krisna Thangamani, he was sluggish coming out of the gates and although he did make up ground, he still had just one behind him when they fanned out for the run home.\n\nTaken to the outside for clear running, he fashioned a run at the furlong mark and soon had the field covered.\n\nHe then took off, hit the front and just like that, he put lengths between himself and the chasing pack.\n\nThankfully for his rivals, the finish line came up soon enough and they were spared a real spanking.\n\nStill, to win by almost five lengths over the short and sharp trip was something else.\n\nIf anything, it told us that there is still plenty of racing left in those ageing legs.\n\nThat trial on Jan 30 was his third since Dec 28 and it would have topped him up sufficiently for that next outing.\n\nHopefully, he will live up to his flashy name and blast off.\n\nWhat about the beaten brigade?\n\nWell, although finishing in third spot, Ejaz caught the eye.\n\nRidden by Manoel Nunes, he was never asked to do more than was necessary.\n\nHe was in third spot for most of the trip and looked to be striding out rather nicely at the business end of things.\n\nEjaz is, quite definitely, a star in the making. Then again, any galloper who has won four races from just five outings must be something special.\n\nHowever, he has not faced the starter in close to 11 months.\n\nHis last race which brought up his fourth win was on March 12, and the trial on Jan 30 was his first since that victory.\n\nStill, there was nothing to suggest that the layoff affected him.\n\nThere was no rustiness in that chestnut frame of his. He galloped freely and Nunes would have had only good things to report back to trainer Steve Burridge.\n\nIndeed, come Feb 3, Ejaz will have his first race outing under Burridge who inherited the galloper when Michael Clements pulled the plug on his Kranji operations in September.\n\nEjaz has been entered for the Class 2 sprint over the flying 1,000m and victory there would bring up his fifth win on the trot.\n\nOn paper, it may look like the Street Boss four-year-old could be short of a run. But his showing at the trials tells us a different story.\n\nEjaz is back near his best and although it is a big jump from Class 4 to Class 2, his four wins to date do seem to suggest that we have yet to see him at his best and, yes, in his case anything is possible.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e4af989d3a6419512a994c9796dc6a5588a68cc0f52fc357a4a874f45ddb5a37/bmtrials01.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Rocket Star (Krisna Thangamani) skipping away to an easy 4 1/4-length win in a barrier trial at Kranji on Jan 30.\n", "caption": "Rocket Star (Krisna Thangamani) skipping away to an easy 4 1/4-length win in a barrier trial at Kranji on Jan 30.

District Judge Brenda Tan granted his request.\n\nWhen Mr Chua asked if Vang will face more charges, the police prosecutor said he did not have the information.\n\nVang was among nine men and one woman arrested by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) on Aug 15 and charged the next day. The value of assets seized or frozen by the authorities now stands at over $3 billion.\n\nAccording to past court hearings, cryptocurrency worth more than $3.8 million was withdrawn from Vang's Binance account on Aug 17. The CAD did not know about these assets until it was told by foreign authorities.\n\nVang was previously charged with one count of using a forged document and four counts of money laundering.\n\nHe had allegedly submitted a forged bank statement to Citibank Singapore in March 2021 as supporting documentation.\n\nThe money laundering charges relate to about $2.4 million held in four bank accounts. The sums are purportedly benefits from an unlicensed moneylending business in China.\n\nVang's brother, Wang Shuiting, is one of eight fugitives wanted by the Singapore police in connection with the case. The two brothers are on China's wanted list for illegal gambling activities.\n\nHigh Court judge Vincent Hoong had refused bail for Vang on Oct 12, 2023, saying his offer to be placed under 24-hour surveillance did not satisfactorily address the significant flight risk he posed.\n\nJudge Hoong added that Vang had obtained passports from Turkey, Vanuatu and Cambodia by making donations and financial contributions to those countries.\n\nThis amplifies the risk of Vang being able to abscond, whether by using the Cambodian passport - which, at the time, had not been found - or by procuring a new passport through similar methods, the judge said.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor David Koh mentioned in a previous hearing that assets worth more than $240 million in the name of Vang and his wife had been seized or subject to prohibition orders in Singapore.\n\nThe DPP added that Vang also had more than $35.5 million in assets overseas.\n\nVang will return to court for a pre-trial conference on Feb 1.\n\nWong Shiying\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nmoney laundering\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nHome & Decor Singapore\n\n5 Living Room Wellness Hacks You’ll Wish You Knew Sooner!\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/097fe8120c76f9132436c73bb1b6821fc888eb954c28908fcba92fc44206df86/screenshot_693.png?w=965", "alt_text": "Vang Shuiming allegedly submitted forged financial statements from three companies.

More than 13,000 residents are living in evacuation centres, according to the Ishikawa government.\n\nMs Chisa Terashita, a mother of three who evacuated from her wrecked home in Suzu, and her husband said that immediately after the quake, they drank as little water as possible to conserve what they had, and still face tough decisions on how to ration water to keep the family healthy.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"The one non-negotiable I have is washing and sanitising our hands after going to the toilet, given it's the season when infections can spread quickly,\" she added.\n\nBitter cold is also posing a challenge, especially for scores of residents who are sleeping in their cars after their homes were wrecked. The area was hit by heavy snow over the past week and the authorities have warned of a risk of landslides.\n\n\"This life is becoming the norm - I think we can get through it,\" Ms Terashita said. \"Well, we have no other choice.\"\n\nMore than 900 deaths from the devastating Kobe earthquake of 1995 happened after the quake, due in part to the spread of influenza and lack of medical care at evacuation centres, according to public health experts.\n\nThe authorities in Ishikawa prefecture are set to begin vaccinating evacuees for influenza on Feb 1.\n\nAround mid-afternoon on Jan 30 at a primary school in Suzu, where around 4,800 houses still have no water, children played on the swings while locals gathered around a communal water tank that has become a lifeline for many.\n\nAs evening fell, residents gathered to bathe in a makeshift public bath set up at the school by soldiers sent in to help with relief work - an improvement from immediately after the quake, when people would queue for an hour in the rain for five litres of water. - REUTERS\n\nJapan\n\nEARTHQUAKES\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH AND HYGIENE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2025, 07:40am\n\nFormer S'pore basketball coach's wife, missing for 2 years, confirmed dead in Japan\n\nMay 20, 2025, 12:18am\n\nS'pore man arrested in Japan for allegedly committing indecent acts involving boy in onsen\n\nApr 6, 2025, 04:16am\n\nSingaporeans believed to be among 47 injured in bus collision on Tokyo expressway\n\nApr 3, 2025, 12:30am\n\nMFA officer who took nude photos of male customers in Tokyo bathhouse dismissed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Business Accounts in Singapore: Make Your Company’s Idle Cash Work Harder\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a8fddd2b0c61a5df8a20b4c57a87c9ecf2ea42f5db16e51e05638952911bbd86/2024-01-31T054727Z1060167533RC2ES5AOENVMRTRMADP3JAPAN-QUAKE-WATER.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Locals filling up bottles from the communal water tank for Noto earthquake survivors in Suzu, Ishikawa prefecture, Japan, on Jan 30.

Every year before the Spring Festival, they would return to Chongqing together.\n\nHowever in 2024, due to her grandmother's illness, Ms Li's father returned to their hometown early, leaving her mother alone in Jinjiang, Fujian, where she works at a shoe factory.\n\nOver a video call, Ms Li's mother told her daughter that she wouldn't be coming home for the New Year holiday this year. On one hand, her mother wanted to earn more money, and on the other hand, it might be difficult for her to travel alone as she was not familiar with pu'bpublic.\n\nThinking about her mother spending the Spring Festival alone away from home, Ms Li immediately bought a plane ticket bound for Jinjiang and decided to bring her mother back home.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:31am\n\nS'pore travellers flock to popular destinations amid record heat\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Someone asked me why I had to go and pick her up myself. Why not just buy her a ticket so she could come home by herself?\" Ms Li said in the video.\n\n\"Because my mother rarely goes out while working away from home. For over 20 years, she has been working in the village. She doesn't know how to take a taxi, ride a bus or use navigation. As her daughter, I feel it is my responsibility to personally go and bring her back. How could I let her spend Spring Festival alone in another place?\" she said.\n\nAfter making the decision, Ms Li kept it a secret from her mother, hoping to surprise her.\n\nDuring the journey, she could not contain her excitement.\n\n\"The moment the plane took off, I seemed to understand the meaning of growing up. Although I can't yet provide a better life for my parents, when my mother needs me, I will immediately rush to her side,\" Ms Li said.\n\nOn the evening of Jan 20, Ms Li got off the plane and went directly to her mother's home.\n\nStanding quietly outside, Ms Li made a video call and found her mother eating dinner. After hanging up the phone, Ms Li nervously knocked on the door. When her mother opened the door, she first looked surprised, then laughed before bursting into tears.\n\nThe video has deeply moved many netizens.\n\nSome netizens said: \"I must go home this Spring Festival to visit my parents.\"\n\nOthers made online \"agreements\" that if they encounter someone's parents in need while working away from home, they will lend a helping hand. - CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nChina\n\nchinese new year\n\nTRAVEL AND LEISURE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 30, 2025, 03:04am\n\nSelf-driving public shuttles in Punggol by fourth quarter\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:52pm\n\nSingapore's first private assisted-living pilot ready by 2026\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:14am\n\nSingapore actress Eleanor Lee accused online of insulting China, allegedly dropped from Chinese show\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The overall rate was 2 per cent.\n\nWhile employment prospects might be looking up, MOM cautions that as downside risks in the global economy remain, business reorganisation or restructuring will continue and may lead to further retrenchments.\n\nCheow Sue-Ann\n\nBusiness Correspondent\n\nLABOUR MARKET\n\nEmployment\n\nretrenchment\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 28, 2025, 03:33am\n\nSingapore's Q1 unemployment up slightly\n\nJan 27, 2025, 05:40am\n\nRetrenchments rose in 2024 Q4 but still lower than 2023 year on year\n\nDec 9, 2024, 03:32am\n\nJob vacancies fell over Q3 but year-end may see more demand\n\nOct 29, 2024, 03:13am\n\nS'pore employment rate up in Q3 2024, retrenchments down\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It will be my first time in Singapore and I have heard many good things about the city.\n\n\"From what I saw from last year, it will be a tough race with the heat and humidity but a great environment to race in that has so many beautiful sights along the route, while allowing you to hear spectators cheering right next to you.\"\n\nHaving returned to competitive action towards the end of 2023 after an ankle issue kept him out for most of the season, the 35-year-old is hoping to stay injury-free this season. Before that, a stress fracture in his femur and illness had affected his 2022 season.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 2, 2025, 11:29pm\n\nS'pore triathlete Ben Khoo smashes his own national Ironman record in Hamburg\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe said: \"My aim for the first half of the season is to be fit and healthy and to train consistently. I then aim to build on this during the second part of the season.\"\n\nThe inaugural Singapore T100 in 2023, previously known as the Professional Triathletes Organisation (PTO) Asian Open, was won by Tokyo 2020 gold medallist Kristian Blummenfelt and PTO women's world No. 1 Ashleigh Gentle.\n\nThe Singapore leg in 2024 is part of the eight-event T100 Triathlon World Tour, jointly launched by the PTO and governing body World Triathlon. It features races comprising a 2km swim, 80km bike and 18km run.\n\nEach race offers US$250,000 in prizemoney, with the winner taking home US$25,000. The overall men's and women's winners will receive US$210,000.\n\nBrownlee also voiced his support for the PTO's rebrand, saying: \"I want to see more people watching top-level long-distance triathlon and being inspired by seeing the top athletes racing… It's tough to create something new but ultimately, it will benefit every triathlete.\n\n\"So having the PTO work closely with World Triathlon to put on these great races in great locations that allow athletes to flourish and race to the best of their ability, while broadcasting it around the world in the right manner, has got to be the way to go to bring in new fans and people who want to engage in the sport in a new way.\"\n\nGentle could also return to the Republic. The Australian, 32, said: \"Singapore was my favourite race in 2023 and I'm looking forward to racing there again… I would love to be able to retain at least one PTO title. It'll be harder than ever but that's always a goal.\n\n\"I've been quite successful on the PTO Tour so I'd love to be able to keep standing on those podiums and be competitive at the top end of the sport. I also want to keep enjoying myself and loving training and racing.\"\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nTriathlon\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nOlympics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 2, 2025, 01:27am\n\nAlec Kuok, Singapore triathlon pioneer, dies at 84\n\nJan 6, 2025, 11:53pm\n\nLuke Chua goes pro in bid to win SEA Games, qualify for Olympics\n\nJun 21, 2024, 01:10am\n\nDuo qualify for 70.3 Ironman World C'ship\n\nApr 12, 2024, 02:58am\n\nHeat a major concern for triathletes racing at S'pore T100\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

In May 2023, she was forced to cancel a string of shows scheduled for 2023 and 2024, saying she was not strong enough to tour.\n\n\"This last couple of years has been such a challenge for me, the journey from discovering my condition to learning how to live with and manage it, but not to let it define me,\" Dion said in the statement which was shared on her social media accounts.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"As the road to resuming my performing career continues, I have realised how much I have missed it, of being able to see my fans.\"\n\nThe Grammy-winning singer of hits such as Because You Loved Me (1996) and My Heart Will Go On (1997) added: \"During this absence, I decided I wanted to document this part of my life, to try to raise awareness of this little-known condition, to help others who share this diagnosis.\"\n\nThose with SPS experience stiff muscles in the torso, arms and legs, with noise or emotional distress known to trigger spasms. Other symptoms can include slurred speech and double vision.\n\nThere is no cure for the progressive disorder, but treatment can help control symptoms. According to the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH), SPS affects twice as many women as men.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of an autoimmune response gone awry in the brain and spinal cord, according to NIH.\n\nThe documentary, directed by Irene Taylor, features footage from more than a year of filming.\n\nDion has sold more than 250 million albums during her decades-long career. The Quebec-born star's Courage World Tour began in 2019, and she had completed 52 shows before the Covid-19 pandemic put the remainder on hold.\n\nThe singer appeared in the 2023 rom-com film Love Again and recorded several new songs for the soundtrack. - AFP\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nDOCUMENTARIES\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nCanada\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She had to call a towing service to take the car to a workshop for repairs.\n\nMs Quek, who moved to a flat at Hougang Avenue 8 in 2021, said other residents who have lived there longer told her they have had similar experiences and that the estate had been plagued with rat infestation for about five years.\n\n\"I noticed the rat issue during my first few months living in this estate. But I brushed it off since it's a very old estate - around 35 years old - as I thought it's common to see pests around,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she said she became very concerned after seeing more rats scurrying around the estate in the last three years.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:16pm\n\nNParks trials use of dead bird effigies to prevent crows from congregating\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"When you come back in the night, no matter where you are, you will see rats running around. They will run into the drains, across the car park and hide under cars.\"\n\nShe said after pleas for help from residents, the Ang Mo Kio Town Council (AMKTC) has tried to tackle the issue, such as by placing traps and rat poison around the estate. But she added that the recent damage to her car showed that more needed to be done.\n\nIn response to queries, an AMKTC spokesman said it was aware of a rodent infestation problem in the car park at Block 628, Hougang Avenue 8.\n\nThe town council sent its pest control team to conduct an inspection of the car park for rat burrows, he said, adding: \"Our pest control officer has informed us that there are no active burrows in the car park and rodent treatment will be carried out in the surrounding area.\"\n\nThe town council is following up with its insurance company as well as Ms Quek on the rat-induced damage to her car for an insurance claim submission, he added.\n\nThe car towing service on Jan 6 cost Ms Quek $70, while mending the engine's wires cost $50.\n\nMr Eddie Ng, the director of Choon's Motor Works - the workshop Ms Quek enlisted - said that while the damage to her car was \"not too bad\" and needed only half a day to fix, future repairs could cost $2,000 to $3,000 if the rats were to attack the same spots again.\n\nAdditional reporting by Michelle Chin\n\nChristie Chiu\n\nPEST CONTROL\n\nhougang\n\nTown Councils\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 15, 2025, 06:09am\n\n12 rubbish bins filled in cleaning up Whampoa flat\n\nFeb 15, 2025, 12:43am\n\nTighter enforcement against managers, owners of places with rat problems from April 1\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:12am\n\nNEA found 'extensive rodent droppings' at Beauty World Food Centre\n\nJan 26, 2025, 12:20am\n\nDog owners beware: Rodenticide in Serangoon Central\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

By Jan 30, some of the groups had changed their names or were no longer available on the platform.\n\nWhen contacted, a spokeswoman for SGX Group said on Jan 29 that it does not provide stock recommendations nor collect deposits for investments.\n\n\"We also do not run any chat groups on social media platforms, and do not communicate one-on-one via Telegram or WhatsApp,\" she said.\n\nThe spokeswoman said SGX works with a cyber-security agency and social media and messaging platform administrators to monitor and remove social media pages, websites, apps and chat groups which misuse or impersonate SGX Group and its employees.\n\nShe added that the firm has reported known fake accounts to the authorities, like the police and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, especially when there are potentially fraudulent activities involving fund transfers.\n\n\"We urge investors to stay alert and be wary of scams that can take the form of online stock recommendations from unofficial sources or informal chat groups.\n\n\"Some scammers use compromised or spoofed social media accounts to spread and disseminate false information.\"\n\nAng Qing\n\nFraud\n\nSGX\n\nGIC\n\nINTERNET CRIMES AND SCAMS\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 2, 2025, 02:52am\n\nNvidia chips probe: Man allegedly linked to case out on $1m bail, may face more charges\n\nApr 23, 2025, 01:39am\n\nPolice investigate 88 for suspected involvement in registering SIM cards for criminal activities\n\nApr 17, 2025, 03:03am\n\nBriton in Netflix show Con Mum offered $50k bail; alleged offences involve around $500k\n\nApr 15, 2025, 10:17am\n\nSingaporean woman nabbed in Taiwan for alleged scam, money laundering offences\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But we don't rush,\" Klopp told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"If you could rush the healing process then Thiago wouldn't have been out for 10 months. You do what you can do and, whilst that happens, we have to wait,\" Klopp added. \"Mo's not ready for this game or the next. He's injured and a muscle injury takes time.\"\n\nSalah, the league's joint top scorer this season with Manchester City's Erling Haaland on 14 goals each, suffered a hamstring injury in Egypt's 2-2 draw with Ghana at the Africa Cup of Nations on Jan. 18 and returned to Merseyside for treatment.\n\n\"It could have been a lot worse, but he's not available and he's having rehabilitation,\" Klopp said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nLiverpool are on 48 points from 21 games, five points clear of City but having played one more game than the champions.\n\nChelsea are ninth on 31 points and have won four of their last five league matches.\n\nThe 56-year-old Klopp announced on Friday that he would leave Liverpool at the season's end. He suggested on Tuesday that reporters had made too much of defender Virgil van Dijk's comment that he was unsure about his own future after the German manager's departure.\n\n\"It's completely normal,\" said Klopp. \"It's clear the outside world will not give you a second to process.\n\n\"A week ago no-one knew about my situation. There was still 18 months on (players') contracts and no-one asked. No-one has to worry. Write what you want, the club is stable. Everything will be fine, I'm 100% sure. I would recommend to stay calm.\"\n\nAfter Liverpool's 5-2 win over Norwich City in their fourth-round FA Cup game on Sunday, Van Dijk was asked whether he sees himself as part of Liverpool's post-Klopp era.\n\n\"That's a big question. Well, I don't know,\" Van Dijk said.\n\nWhen told he had only 18 months left on his contract, the player said: \"That is correct - good maths.

She was 91.\n\nRivera died in New York after a \"brief illness,\" her daughter Lisa Mordente said in a statement released by publicist Merle Frimark.\n\nTrained in voice, piano and ballet from a young age, Rivera was dancing on Broadway before she was 20 and kept at it all the way into her early 80s.\n\nRivera became one of the most nominated actors in the history of the Tony Awards, Broadway's highest prizes - with 10 nods.\n\nIn 2002, she earned Kennedy Centre honours - a top US arts distinction - and was feted at the White House in 2009 with the presidential medal of freedom.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nAnxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas\n\n1\n\nMore related stories\n\nSensual and with a brassy stage presence, Rivera played some of Broadway's most acclaimed roles, and worked under legendary talents including Leonard Bernstein, Bob Fosse, Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins.\n\nShe and fellow actress Rita Moreno paved the way for other stars of Puerto Rican descent, such as actor-songwriter-playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda of Hamilton fame - to conquer Broadway.\n\nRivera earned the breakout role in 1957 of Anita in West Side Story, the 20th century American adaptation of the Shakespeare tale Romeo And Juliet, which made her a star and earned her a first Tony nomination.\n\nBut when the film was made, the role of Anita went to Moreno.

But it was just as impressive.\n\nAs for Eruption, he put himself into the equation when he, too, turned in a smart workout, covering the 600m in 40.3 on a hold.\n\nWith a name which intimidates, Eruption has had five Kranji starts for a win, a second, a third and a fourth placing.\n\nNow, that is nothing to be sniffed at, and Fitzsimmons has had him ticking over like a time bomb.\n\nWell, the time bomb misfired at that last start on Jan 14.\n\nThat day, when backed down to $20, he was fractious at the start, broke through the gates, was passed fit to race and finished a well-beaten fourth to Strike Gold.\n\nOff to the trials he went and under Manoel Nunes, he won that hit-out, beating Thunderstorm by a neck.\n\nFitzsimmons would have been satisfied. More so after that smart-looking gallop on the morning of Jan 30.\n\nSame, too, with Axel. Logan has been patient with her \"veteran\".\n\nAfter putting together his ninth victory on Nov 4, she gave him two more races in 2023. Both times, he finished out of the top five.\n\nNo worries there. Between Jan 1 and his next race start on Jan 20, she had him galloping thrice.\n\nIt topped him up and his 10th win came with a dominant show at that last start.\n\nRidden by in-form apprentice Jamil Sarwi, Axel came from last to first, beating Creative Dreams by 1½ lengths over the 1,400m.\n\nSure, he is getting long in the tooth but he has not lost his navigational skills. He still knows where the winning post is and that is where he heads - with gusto.\n\nLogan and the Te Akau Racing Stable tasted success at the recently concluded meeting on Jan 27.\n\nThat day, they sent out six-year-old Our Secret Weapon to open proceedings with a win.\n\nThey could taste victory again. This time with Axel, who loves the 1,400m.\n\nAs for Ace Of Diamonds, he is shooting for his fourth win off the reel - and he might just get it.\n\nThe son of Swiss Ace impressed with his work on Jan 29 and he will carry a ton of form into that exciting Class 4 contest.\n\nIf anything, that last-start win over Makin was first-rate stuff. He fought out the finish and prevailed by a short head.\n\nRight now, Le Grange has him in a \"good place\". He is all synched up and he seems to be improving with every outing.\n\nFour on the trot is not an impossibility. So do not go betting against him. It might cost you dearly.\n\nThat Class 4 race aside, watch out for City Gold Star in the Class 3 sprint over the 1,200m.\n\nHe was another \"star\" on the training track. If he manages to bring that form to the races, he could give trainer David Kok even more reason to smile.\n\nKok took out the last race on Jan 27, saddling Pacific MV who won under Vlad Duric.\n\nHe can continue from where he left off and City Gold Star can give the stable another reason to cheer.\n\nWith Marc Lerner doing the steering on the training track, the sparingly raced five-year-old by Written Tycoon ran out the 600m in 39.1, leaving little to the imagination.\n\nAlready a three-time winner from just nine races, City Gold Star is well-placed to run a huge race on Feb 3.\n\nSure, he meets some real \"talents\" like Lord's Command, and even Flying Nemo.\n\nBut track and trip should suit City Gold Star as he has won in Class 3 - and over the 1,200m on grass.\n\nSo give him plenty of thought. He deserves your utmost attention.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\njan30gallops.pdf\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He gets his chance, especially with no weight and over a suitable distance. The one to beat.\n\n3 Ai One\n\ncan return to form after being withdrawn recently. He is a solid operator, particularly in this grade. A mid-race move is on the cards.\n\n12 Golden Fairy\n\ncould easily lead. He also slots in light and should be giving this group something to reel in.\n\n8 Diamond Winner\n\ncontinues to fly late and this test should not be an exception. He can make his presence felt once again.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 2 (1,200m)\n\n4 Timestorm\n\nshould already be a winner. He gets another chance to finally get on the board, especially with the 10lb (4.5kg)-claiming Ellis Wong engaged.\n\n3 Colonel\n\nmakes the step down to Class 5. He has been competitive in the grade above but this should seriously see him become a winning chance.\n\n2 Hercules\n\nhas the gate to overcome, but is suited in this grade. He has gone close several times this term.\n\n11 Double Show\n\nhas the right gate and should do next no work throughout.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n6 Fast As Rocket\n\nwas given no hope on debut. Expect him to atone for that effort, especially from another good draw with that run under his belt. His trials have been sound and there is clearly some ability there.\n\n10 High Percentage\n\nis still yet to win but has shown his class. He gets an opportunity from the good gate.\n\n4 Lyrical Motion\n\nhas been a revelation of late, with a pair of wins and several minor placings. He can remain at the level of form in this grade.\n\n3 Gallant Valour\n\nwon well two runs back. Next best.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\n10 Circuit Seven\n\ndraws ideally and can race forward to lead this group under Matthew Poon. He has led and won before over this trip. The one they must catch.\n\n2 Harmony Fire\n\nis improving. He is suited in this class and Hugh Bowman's pairing is an added bonus. Can contend strongly.\n\n8 Oversubscribed\n\nhas a powerful finish on his day and should be decent value.\n\n5 Savvy Delight\n\ncontinues to race well with consistency on his side. Next in line.\n\nRace 5 (1,650m)\n\n3 Snowalot\n\nwill need luck from the gate but they should run this race along at a slick pace. If so, he will get every possible chance to roar home from a touch worse than midfield. Take a chance on him.\n\n4 Super Baby\n\nis one of those who should roll forward and lead. He was a tidy winner two runs back.\n\n8 Turin Warrior\n\nis looking to snap a frustrating stretch. He has yet to win in Hong Kong, but is consistent and tough. He should get his chance.\n\n7 Sure Joyful\n\nis after back-to-back wins. He should inject some pace into this one.\n\nRace 6 (1,200m)\n\n6 Great Achiever\n\nis trending in the right direction and should prove hard to beat. He is third-up in Hong Kong, following two solid efforts to commence his career in the city.\n\n5 King Eccellente\n\nis aiming to snap a pair of runner-up efforts. He is closing in for another win.\n\n3 Happy Golf\n\nhas lost his way a touch, but a good gate and Bowman's services could easily see him bounce back.\n\n1 Jumbo Legend\n\nhas Wong's 10lb claim in use. He gets an opportunity.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n12 One For All\n\nwas well supported first-up. He can atone for that defeat. From barrier one, he is expected to fly forward and take up a prominent position on the speed. Top chance.\n\n5 Celestial Colours\n\ncontinues to make headway. He can take another forward step with Zac Purton engaged.\n\n11 Jumbo Fortune\n\nis racing well and is favoured from gate 6 under the light weight.\n\n1 Superb Capitalist\n\ncan mix his form. He was tough on the speed last start and can do similar again.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n2 Brave Star\n\nhas consistency on his side and has been knocking on the door all season. Drawn ideally, he should get the right run throughout. The one to beat.\n\n5 Power Koepp\n\nhas an inside draw and is much better suited in this grade. He made a bit of ground late last start and the inside gate is a big advantage.\n\n7 Beauty Waves\n\ncontinues to race well and can do so again. He has shown a stack of ability already and is a winner in waiting.\n\n9 Righteous Arion\n\nslots in light and is next in line.\n\nRace 9 (1,650m)\n\n8 Simply Maverick\n\nhas shown he is ready to be tested in Class 3. He was dominant last start and has drawn ideally for his first try in the grade. He has plenty of scope for further improvement.\n\n10 Thesis\n\ncontinue\n\ns to race well and has done so all season. He looks a threat in this grade over this course and distance.\n\n6 Lean Hero\n\nis a four-time winner at this track. He comes into this in the right vein of form and links favourably with Bowman.\n\n1 Gallant Waking\n\nis chasing back-to-back successes.

One of the judge's reasons was that the subject matter of their application was not susceptible to judicial review.\n\nThe four then filed further applications in an attempt to appeal against the High Court's decision.\n\nMr Kassimatis and Mr Fitzgerald subsequently applied for ad hoc admission to act for the four.\n\nThe two King's Counsel filed written submissions and made oral submissions before Justice Woo through Datchinamurthy on Nov 23, 2023.\n\nUnder the Legal Profession Act, a foreign counsel seeking ad hoc admission must first meet certain requirements before the court considers whether there is a special reason to admit them.\n\nOne of the mandatory requirements states that the individual must have special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case.\n\nIn the present case, Justice Woo found that Mr Fitzgerald has special experience in cases involving judicial review, but Mr Kassimatis did not meet this requirement.\n\nAs for whether there were special reasons, Justice Woo said the mere fact that the case raised issues of public importance was not sufficient to admit the two foreign lawyers.\n\nThe inmates had argued that a special reason exists as they have been unable to find local lawyers to represent them.\n\nJustice Woo said the reasons for the unsuccessful efforts to engage local counsel were relevant.\n\nThe judge highlighted that the inmates' friends had approached two local lawyers, who stated that \"the facts of the four cases are such that the pending challenge has no merit\".\n\nJustice Woo said it would be incongruous to allow foreign lawyers to be admitted when local counsel are of the view that there is no merit on the facts.\n\nThe judge added that the four inmates have been able to access substantive legal assistance, even without formal representation.\n\nHe noted that a Malaysian lawyer had prepared some documents for them, and that the written submissions they filed were drafted with legal terms and arguments.\n\nJustice Woo said there was nothing to prevent foreign counsel from taking part in the preparation of the written submissions.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nLAWYERS\n\nDEATH PENALTY/CAPITAL PUNISHMENT\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 25, 2025, 12:49am\n\nLawyer charged with drink driving\n\nJun 20, 2024, 06:17pm\n\nJail for ex-cop who forged witness statements, lied to court\n\nApr 7, 2024, 04:09am\n\nWhat will happen to assets surrendered in $3b money laundering case?\n\nJan 8, 2024, 07:49am\n\nDPPs handling death penalty cases must undergo mental health checks\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Eleven other charges were taken into consideration during his sentencing.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Shaun Lim said the offender was an agent representing insurance firm AXA from Aug 28, 2017, to Nov 24, 2019.\n\nXie's name could not be found on the General Insurance Association's website when The Straits Times conducted a search on Jan 30.\n\nOne of the clients he cheated was a research fellow at a local university. He sold her two policies in either late 2018 or early 2019.\n\nSome time before June 16, 2019, Xie told her that she could enjoy better returns if she paid her yearly premiums for the next three years in advance as a lump sum.\n\nHe told her that he could make the payments for her if she handed over the money to him. She transferred $30,000 between June 16 and July 8, 2019.\n\nThe DPP said: \"The accused never transferred this money to AXA, and only issued the victim with receipts after she persistently asked him for them.\n\n\"In August 2019, the accused asked to meet with the victim. He admitted that he had never transferred to AXA the money... and had instead lost it in investments.\"\n\nHe has since transferred $10,000 back to her.\n\nAccording to court documents, he cheated most of his other victims in 2019. His aunt was among them and some time before July 10, 2019, he told her that she could invest in shares purportedly offered by Temasek Holdings.\n\nHe claimed returns were guaranteed and she could withdraw her principal investment at any time.\n\nXie told her that she could receive returns of $1,000 for every $10,000 invested and showed her documents, supposedly from Temasek Holdings, to convince her to make the so-called investment.\n\nOn five different occasions between July 10 and 25 in 2019, she withdrew a total of $55,000 in cash and handed the amount to him. DPP Lim said: \"He used the money... to repay his AXA clients whom he had taken money from.\n\n\"When the victim tried to withdraw the investment, the accused told her that the application had been filed but did not return her any money.\"\n\nIn late 2019, AXA interviewed Xie over his offences against his clients and the police investigated the case in 2020. He returned $7,500 to his aunt soon after.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

old\n\nJan 30, 2024, 07:56am\n\nOnline Criminal Harms Act to kick in from Feb 1\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Online Criminal Harms Act (Ocha) will come into effect on Feb 1, and will allow the Government to remove criminal content online.\n\nThe Act, which was passed in Parliament on July 5, 2023, seeks to tackle the evolving criminal harms online and makes special provisions for scams and malicious cyber activities.\n\nUnder Ocha, the Government can issue directions and orders, which will restrict and limit the exposure of Singapore users to criminal activities on online platforms.\n\nDirections can be issued to any online service provider, entity or individual, as long as there is reasonable suspicion that an online activity is linked to a specified offence.\n\nExamples of specified offences include those relating to terrorism and internal security, racial and religious harmony, drugs, violence and scams.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 12:20am\n\nGovernment may enhance vaping laws to tackle drug-laced vapes\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe threshold is lower for scams, allowing directions to be issued even if there is only suspicion that certain online activities are in preparation of a scam.\n\nOn Jan 30, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said this was so that scams can be proactively disrupted, even before the public falls prey to them.\n\nThere were 22,339 scam cases reported in the first half of 2023, as compared to 13,576 cases in the same period in 2022.\n\nBetween January 2020 and June 2023, victims in Singapore lost about $2 billion to scams.\n\nThere are five types of directions that can be issued under Ocha.\n\nA Stop Communication direction requires the recipient, which can be an individual or an entity, to stop communicating the specified online content to people in Singapore.\n\nA Disabling direction requires online service providers to disable specified content, such as a post or a page, on their service from being viewed in Singapore.\n\nAn Account Restriction direction requires online service providers to stop an account on their platform from communicating in Singapore and interacting with people in Singapore.\n\nAn Access Blocking direction requires internet service providers to block access to an online location such as a web domain from being viewed here.\n\nAnd an App Removal Direction requires app stores to remove an app from its Singapore storefront to stop further downloads of the app by people here.\n\nMHA said for a start, Ocha directions will be issued against scam websites and egregious online activities, as it develops the necessary systems for it to issue directions for other specified offences.\n\nExamples of egregious offences include those related to threat of death and serious hurt, and threat to law-and-order.\n\nIf the directions are not complied with, an Ocha order can then be issued to restrict access to the service or part of the service, to limit the further exposure of persons in Singapore to the criminal activity.\n\nMHA said the Ocha orders operate alongside other measures the Government can take for the non-compliance of directions, and does not replace measures such as prosecution.\n\nThose who receive an Ocha direction can appeal to a designated officer for it to be reconsidered, while those who receive an Ocha order can appeal to the competent authority.\n\nIf these applications are unsuccessful, the appellant can then appeal to a reviewing tribunal comprising a District Judge or Magistrate appointed by the President, on the advice of the Cabinet.\n\nUnder Ocha, the Government can require information to administer the Act and facilitate investigations and criminal proceedings.\n\nPolice officers and enforcement officers can request online service providers or owners of online locations to provide relevant information to facilitate investigations and criminal proceedings when it is suspected a specified offence has been committed.\n\nThese powers also apply to entities based overseas and to information stored overseas.\n\nMHA said the Act will introduce codes of practice and directives to strengthen partnerships with online services to counter scams and malicious cyber activities, but this will come into force at a later date.\n\nDavid Sun\n\nCrime Correspondent\n\nMinistry of Home

Upon hearing this, its rightful owner stood up to claim it.\n\nYi was arrested when the plane landed at Changi Airport.\n\nOn Jan 30, the 45-year-old offender pleaded guilty to a theft charge and was sentenced to seven months' jail. Two other similar charges were considered during sentencing.\n\nThe incident took place on Dec 15, 2023, on a flight from Phnom Penh.\n\nYi was seated at 9C, ASP Lee in 8A and the victim in 7C.\n\nMidway through the flight. Yi opened the overhead compartment for row 8 when he saw the passengers along that row appeared to be asleep.\n\nWhile still standing at row 9, he stretched out his hand and slid a black haversack in the overhead compartment of row 8 to his own row. The compartments were connected to each other, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Dan Pan.\n\n\"The accused then brought the haversack to an empty seat at the back of the plane and rummaged through it, looking for items of interest to steal. He did not find any item of interest, and... returned the haversack to its original location,\" the DPP said.\n\nUsing a similar method, Yi took a second bag which he also returned when he found nothing to steal from it.\n\nASP Lee saw his antics and alerted his two colleagues who were also on board the same flight.\n\nYi then removed a third bag, containing items including around $250 in cash and three bank card, from an overhead compartment and took it to seat 2C.\n\nAfter the three police officers saw him rummaging through the leather bag, ASP Lee got out of his seat, walked towards Yi and confronted him.\n\nDPP Pan said: \"The accused lied to ASP Lee that the leather bag belonged to him. ASP Lee then warned the accused to tell the truth as he had noticed the accused taking two other bags.\n\n\"The accused then replied that the leather bag was in fact not his and claimed that he was searching for his bag as he could not remember where it was.\"\n\nThe truth emerged after the bag was returned to its rightful owner.\n\nASP Lee then asked Yi for his passport and the latter immediately retrieved it from his own bag, despite his earlier claims that he could not recall where it was.\n\nOn Jan 30, the prosecutor urged the court to sentence him to between seven and eight months' jail, stressing that such offences are difficult to detect.\n\nYi's case was the second one reported in The Straits Times in January involving thieves who targeted their victims while travelling by air.\n\nAnother Chinese national, Zhang Xiuqiang, 52, pleaded guilty to one count of theft on Jan 12 and was sentenced to eight months' jail.\n\nZhang was on board a Scoot flight from Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam to Singapore on Dec 16, 2023, when he stole cash from multiple passengers' carry-on luggage.\n\nAmong other things, he stole items including US$1,000 (S$1,340) in cash from one of them.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nTHEFT/BURGLARY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He died of head injuries hours later.\n\nLooi, a 37-year-old with special needs, was on Jan 30 found guilty of causing grievous hurt by an act which endangers personal safety.\n\nHe was also convicted of three other offences - voluntarily causing hurt which causes grievous hurt, using criminal force with intent to outrage modesty and committing an obscene act.\n\nAnother two counts of committing an obscene act will be taken into consideration for his sentencing on Feb 23.\n\nThe court heard that Looi is autistic, has bipolar disorder and that his intellectual functioning is in the borderline range.\n\nAt around noon on Sept 5, 2023, he was running to catch a bus along a pavement next to Block 101 Tampines Avenue 2 when he ran straight into the elderly man.\n\nClosed circuit television footage that was played in court showed that the victim was flung against a railing before falling to the ground.\n\nInstead of helping the victim, Looi boarded a bus and left. The senior was taken to Changi General Hospital where his condition deteriorated and he fell into a coma. He died on Sept 6.\n\nIn April that year, Looi was leaving a bank in Tampines Central. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sivanathan Jheevanesh said Looi perceived a 67-year-old woman, who was walking towards Looi, to be in his way.\n\nWhen he pushed her hard on her chest, she fell to the ground and lost consciousness momentarily. Looi left without helping her.\n\nShe suffered head injuries, a tailbone fracture and abrasions on her elbows.\n\nIn March 2021, Looi molested a 27-year-old woman who was queuing at a food stall near Pasir Ris MRT station by thrusting himself at her.\n\nWhen she turned around, he repeated the act before fleeing the scene.\n\nA few days later, Looi entered a flat that was left unlocked and urinated in it. He ran away after the unit's owner caught him red-handed.\n\nLooi was assessed by Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist Dr Cheow Enquan in September 2023, who found that he was not of unsound mind when he forcefully collided with the 76-year-old man.\n\nDr Cheow added that Looi was also not in relapse of bipolar disorder.\n\nHowever, his mental conditions were found to have significant contributory links to his molestation offence.\n\nDr Sajith Sreedharan Geetha from IMH found that his behaviour \"appeared to be related to his longstanding intense interest in women wearing leather clothing, and a tendency to behave in a socially inappropriate and impulsive manner\".\n\nDr Geetha added that Looi was aware of, and in control of his actions at the time.\n\nWong Shiying\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nsenior citizens\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f025cf859d58947a6c69a3fea86402b17fccf90fcd31021e7400df23a3872ae/gavelscales.png?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Three of them were each sentenced to 20 strokes of the cane.\n\nOne of these men also invited a seventh man to rape his wife, but the attempt was unsuccessful. The seventh man was jailed for three years.\n\nO was the only one of the seven men to contest the charge he faced instead of pleading guilty.\n\nDuring his trial, J testified that he had invited O over to rape his wife in March 2011 on their third wedding anniversary.\n\nJ testified he and his wife had wine to celebrate the occasion, and he spiked her drink with sleeping pills.\n\nHe said when he saw O having sex with his unconscious and blindfolded wife, he felt anger, thrill, and then guilt.\n\nBut O denied there was an agreement between him and J for him to rape J's wife. He also denied raping the victim.\n\nHe contended the reason J had asked him over was to confront him for having an affair with J's wife. She and O had consensual sex in September 2010, after J gave him her contact details.\n\nO claimed he had \"freaked out\" inside the flat, and when he was asked by J whether he wanted to touch the victim, he pretended to touch himself sexually in an attempt to get out of the situation.\n\nHe said he then chatted with J for a while before leaving the flat.\n\nThese claims were rejected by Justice Chionh, who convicted O in November 2023.\n\nShe said O's account was inconsistent, illogical and implausible, and defied common sense.\n\nThe judge said it made no sense for J to make his wife unconscious if he wanted to confront her and O for having an affair.\n\nShe noted O made no attempt to check on the woman after he saw her lying motionless on the bed, despite his claim that he had gone to the flat out of concern for the victim.\n\nJustice Chionh added O's assertion that J was angry with him was irreconcilable with the fact that in the years following the incident, both men continued to interact with each other to talk about their sexual fantasies.\n\nShe said the prosecution had proved the two men were engaged in a conspiracy.\n\nJ was sentenced to 29 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane in May 2023.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nCRIMES AGAINST WOMEN\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/28cbf7fa4951a03b45e03f333c92a56873ea24568f8c4df735ac89811eedf8fa/jail.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

He would be the third straight Japanese to take charge of the Lions.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 12, 2025, 02:38am\n\nSingapore U-16 boys roar back with 3 goals in 8 minutes to stun Cambodia\n\nMore related stories\n\nNishigaya, 50, was hired on a two-year contract in April 2022 as the replacement for Tatsuma Yoshida, who left in December 2021, a year before his contract was up.\n\nNishigaya was appointed following a hiring process that took more than four months.\n\nHe was recommended to the FAS by the Japan Football Association technical committee, and appointed by a panel comprising then-FAS president Lim Kia Tong, current president Bernard Tan, vice-president Teo Hock Seng, council member Goh Tat Chuan and general secretary Yazeen Buhari.\n\nThis was Nishigaya's first international gig after spells in charge of J2 side Mito Hollyhock and Japan's third-division club SC Sagamihara.\n\nHis tenure as Lions coach ends with eight wins, eight losses and five draws in 21 matches.\n\nA particular low point of his spell was in January 2023, when the Lions were trounced 4-1 by Malaysia before a meek exit in the group stage of the Asean Football Federation (AFF) Championship.\n\nWhile there were three straight wins - over Guam, in a two-legged World Cup qualifier, and Chinese Taipei - last September and October, the Lions have largely looked dismal under Nishigaya.\n\nHis departure does not come as a surprise, given the discontent among fans and some players.\n\nSections of Lions supporters chanted for him to be sacked after Thailand's 3-1 win over Singapore in a World Cup qualifier at the National Stadium on Nov 21, with the sentiments spilling over to social media.\n\nOgura was an assistant coach at Tokyo Verdy, who gained promotion to the Japanese top tier last season. Verdy announced on Jan 12 that Ogura had left the club.\n\nHe was Japan's assistant coach from 2006 to 2010 and was part of the Samurai Blue's 2010 World Cup team who lost to Paraguay on penalties in the round of 16.\n\nHe was then appointed assistant coach of Japan's Olympic team from 2010 to 2012, when they finished fourth in London.\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nSingapore Football\n\nFAS/FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION OF SINGAPORE\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 10:45pm\n\nLions survive late onslaught to claim first win of Asian Cup third-round qualifiers\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMay 18, 2025, 11:06pm\n\nLion City Sailors denied at final hurdle as Sharjah FC clinch AFC Champions League Two title\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:16pm\n\nACL2 trophy is 'something beautiful to fight for', says Lion City Sailors' Hariss Harun\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Sirius (fifth) and Roda Robot (eighth) were later unsuccessful.\n\n\"It's my first win for Jason. It was worth wasting down to 55kg,\" said the Group 1-winning jockey, who rides mainly for Daniel Meagher, Stephen Gray and Jerome Tan.\n\n\"The horse was fit as he didn't run long ago. He was also knocking on the door, and I think he'll get better over more ground.\"\n\nThe Shooting To Win three-year-old mostly slipped under the radar early on, until he chalked up a third under Nunes at his fifth start in a Class 5 race (1,200m) on Dec 2.\n\nNunes went one better on him at his next two starts - both in Open Maiden Polytrack events, but was not to be the one to put the cherry on the top.\n\n\"It was the owner's (Tan Zheng Xuan) decision to put Marc on. Marc rode the horse well,\" said Ong, when probed about the switch.\n\n\"The horse's last start over 1,100m was a really good run, but I always thought he would like to go over a longer distance.\"\n\nThe 1,200m of the Open Maiden still did not make him a shoo-in even if he was punted down to solid $9 favouritism.\n\nOng was a little concerned about Starboy's inclination to get above himself in his races, hoping that Lerner could teach him to settle.\n\n\"It was a good educational run. We wanted to teach him how to chase,\" said Ong.\n\n\"I was just hoping to see him come off the pace and finish strongly. I wasn't worried where he was as I knew he had the turn of foot.\n\n\"Last time, Nunes had to ride him positive, but that was because it was over 1,100m.\"\n\nThe first 200m of the Jan 27 contest did not seem to run counter to that pattern, though.\n\nOff to a bold start from a middle draw, Starboy had only Lim's Sinai (Sazali Ramli) ahead of him upon settling.\n\nBut, as the leader clapped on the speed, and with Central Luzon (Bruno Queiroz) not kicking up on the inside, Starboy was able to tuck in for the perfect trailing position on the rail.\n\nInto the straight, both Starboy and Central Luzon gave chase, but the odds-on favourite was by far the better horse.\n\nDespite Sazali's saddle slipping backwards from the 400m, Lim's Sinai did well to hang on for second place, one length away. Golden Eightyone (A'Isisuhairi Kasim) was third, another ½-length away.\n\nThe winning time was 1min 10.18sec for the 1,200m on the long course.\n\n\"He's a horse with a lot of upside.

He travelled really well throughout,\" said the Australian.\n\n\"Nunes seems to have the key to him. The horse runs very well for him.\n\n\"But I don't like the way he hangs out. He did the same thing at his last win.\n\n\"We need to work on that.\"\n\nNunes is renowned for his horsemanship, but was just as baffled by Easy Breezy's recidivism with his home-straight manners.\n\n\"Under pressure, he hangs out badly. I'm not sure why, maybe it's the track,\" said the five-time Singapore champion jockey.\n\n\"But his win today was still very impressive. We wanted to ride him the same way as last time.\n\n\"The pace was fast. We had a beautiful run and the gap suddenly opened up when I was third or fourth last.\"\n\nThe Brazilian rider was referring to the 700m mark when Combustion (Zyrul Nor Azman) suddenly went around the weakening Smart One (Amirul Ismadi), bumping off the well-backed Elite Jubilation (Vlad Duric) in the process.\n\nSuddenly, the seas parted for Easy Breezy ($13), who in a couple of bounds, zoomed from midfield to the top of the queue.\n\nWhile Duric probably felt he was collateral damage from that scrimmage, Nunes had punched Easy Breezy out to a commanding break faster than you can say ''open sesame\".\n\nWinning Stride tried his best to cut him down, but had to settle for second place, three lengths away. February (Jerlyn Seow) ran third, another neck away.\n\nThe winning time was 1min 47.46sec for the 1,800m on the long course.\n\nConsecutive middle-distance victories can entitle connections to designs on loftier targets, but Meagher remained low-key in his post-race appraisal.\n\nTaking the son of 2003 Durban July winner Dynasty to the current level has not always been a breeze, he said.\n\n\"Long-term, I don't really have any plans for him. Gold Cup? Maybe, but one thing at a time,\" said Meagher, whose champion Lim's Kosciuszko claimed the Group 1 Singapore Gold Cup (2,000m) in 2023.\n\n\"This horse has had a lot of injuries, broken pelvis, cannon bone, seedy toe, he couldn't walk for two months.\n\n\"That's why he's so lightly raced for a seven-year-old. Still, he's not doing anything wrong.\n\n\"It's good for the Lucky Stable and their manager, Richard See. Lucky Stable has been a long-standing owner in Singapore.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f4ebb720cfab36a1340723604ee80ffcaed6895419fc8086a9b365c16ef6737b/mlbreeze30.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Daniel Meagher-trained $13 favourite Easy Breezy (Manoel Nunes) drifting out in the concluding stages of the Class 4 race (1,800m) but still stamps his authority with a three-length romp on Jan 27.\n", "caption": "The Daniel Meagher-trained $13 favourite Easy Breezy (Manoel Nunes) drifting out in the concluding stages of the Class 4 race (1,800m) but still stamps his authority with a three-length romp on Jan 27.

The two incidents took place a few weeks apart in 2013.\n\nThree other charges - one for molesting the girl in 2013 and two for taking photographs of her genitalia while she was sleeping during the Covid-19 circuit breaker period from April 7 to June 1, 2020 - were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nIn handing down the sentence, Justice Pang Khang Chau took into account the extreme youth of the victim, the severe psychological harm caused to her, that the offences were premeditated and that the man came close to completing the offences.\n\nThe first attempted rape occurred while the victim's mother was at work and the man was taking care of the girl and her two younger brothers.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 05:45am\n\nFemale primary school teacher charged over alleged sex acts with male student, 13\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe man told the victim to follow him to a bedroom, locked the door, and tried to rape her after passing her his mobile phone for her to watch videos.\n\nA few weeks later, while the victim's mother was not at home, the man again tried to rape the girl after asking her to follow him into the bedroom.\n\nProsecutors said there were other occasions of attempted rape, but the victim could not give details of these incidents due to the passage of time and her young age.\n\nThe girl suspected what her father had done to her was wrong only after she attended a sexuality education talk in Primary 5.\n\nInitially, she did not tell anyone about the abuse, as she was afraid her friends would avoid her and that her mother would be left alone to support the family if her father was incarcerated.\n\nIn 2021, when she was in Secondary 1, she posted on Instagram about being raped, and also told her best friend that she had been raped.\n\nIn January 2022, the victim's teacher saw cuts on her forearm, and the girl disclosed that she had harmed herself due to \"sexual assault\".\n\nThe school counsellor and child protection officers from the Ministry of Social and Family Development then interviewed the victim, and took her to KK Women's and Children's Hospital for a medical examination.\n\nThe hospital reported the case to the police on Jan 27, 2022, and the man was arrested on the same day.\n\nThe victim underwent 17 counselling sessions between April 12, 2022, and Sept 7, 2022.\n\nIn her victim impact statement, the girl, who is now 15, said she felt \"bad and guilty\" since the police got involved.\n\nShe also felt \"helpless\" that her mother has to bear the family responsibilities and take care of the victim and her brothers on her own.\n\nShe said she wanted someone to comfort her, but also felt that she \"didn't deserve\" to be comforted.\n\nThese emotions caused the victim to harm herself as a form of relief and also to punish herself because she felt she was \"a bad person for causing all these\".\n\n\"I blamed myself for everything,\" she said.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 9, 2025, 06:21am\n\nMy husband arranged for 5 men to rape me.

Another similar charge involving his wife was taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nHe cannot be named to protect the boy's identity as those below 18 years old are covered under the Children and Young Persons Act.\n\nThe mother had accompanied the child to a birthday party on Nov 30, 2022. Before leaving the event, the child told her that the birthday boy had handed him a $50 note.\n\nShe told her son to return the cash when she suspected that he was lying, and the boy complied.\n\nThe woman later told her husband about what had happened, and he decided to discipline the boy.\n\nCourt documents did not disclose if the child had indeed committed theft.\n\nThe man used an umbrella to repeatedly strike the child's palms and thighs. She told her husband to stop hitting their son when the boy began crying.\n\nThe man then ordered the boy to leave their home before closing the door. She again intervened and allowed their son back into their home.\n\nSeeing this, he used a bigger umbrella to hit the boy multiple times.\n\nIn earlier proceedings, Deputy Public Prosecutor Jordy Kay said: \"The accused's wife again tried to stop the accused from hitting their son. However, the accused did not stop, but instead took a cane and continued to hit his son's body.\n\n\"The accused's wife continued to plead with the accused to stop hitting their son.

Under the law, only certain offences can be compounded, such as causing hurt and outrage of modesty.\n\nCompounding an offence requires an agreement with the victim to have the matter compensated, usually with a payment or an apology.\n\nBefore agreeing to the terms, the public prosecutor will also need to consider the public interest, circumstances of the offence and whether there are any aggravating factors.\n\nThe Straits Times has contacted the Attorney-General's Chambers about the terms of the composition.\n\nDr Fernando, who was represented by lawyer Tan Jun Yin from Trident Law Corporation, was charged in March 2023 with one count of molestation.\n\nHe had been accused of molesting a woman by kissing her lips at around 4am on July 4, 2020. There is a gag order on the identity of the victim and the location of the alleged offence.\n\nBoth he and Ms Tan declined comment when asked about their reaction to the outcome of the case.\n\nAccording to earlier reports, Dr Fernando was fired by NUS following an allegation of inappropriate behaviour. NUS also lodged a police report.\n\nIf convicted of molestation, an offender can be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or receive any combination of such punishments.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nOUTRAGE OF MODESTY/INSULTING MODESTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The surrounding road networks will also be upgraded to improve overall traffic flow.\n\nICA said the BKE extension will be aligned with the eastern edge of Marsiling Park, to minimise the impact on a sensitive ecological site in the western side of the park.\n\nTo reduce noise to residential areas near the construction sites, noise barriers will be built, the authority said. Traffic signs will also be put up to guide road users as some road networks will be affected.\n\nThe subsequent phases of redevelopment include building clearance facilities on both acquired and reclaimed land, and retrofitting the current Woodlands Checkpoint.\n\nIsabelle Liew\n\nICA\n\nWOODLANDS CHECKPOINT\n\nLand reclamation\n\nJTC\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 4, 2025, 03:09am\n\nWoodlands Checkpoint extension works to begin in Q3 2025\n\nJun 3, 2025, 08:19am\n\nSole registered voter in Tampines Changkat SMC polling district gets verbal advisory for old address\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:00pm\n\nNearly 200 travellers fined for not declaring large cash amounts, evading GST and taxes on tobacco\n\nMay 31, 2025, 09:52pm\n\nU-turns, bans await motorists who jump queue at land checkpoints\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the images \"alarming\".\n\nOne of the images was seen some 47 million times on X before being removed. As of Jan 28, the platform was still not allowing searches of Swift's name.\n\nThere were still plenty of posts, however, about Swift and the Super Bowl, most of them illustrated with the tender post-game moment she shared with Kelce.\n\nKelce caught 11 passes for 116 yards and a touchdown, surpassing the legendary Jerry Rice in the record books for most all-time post-season catches.\n\nSwift was by Kelce's side as he hoisted the AFC Championship trophy, quoting not his sweetheart but the Beastie Boys when he yelled: \"You've gotta fight for your right to party!\" - AFP\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nCONCERTS\n\nJapan\n\nAMERICAN FOOTBALL/NFL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1c157802aa7d3c8da1ce11297dffffafcd1a5ad2027f7b87c3720cfc8945ec08/ACE-CEL-FBN-SPO-AFC-CHAMPIONSHIP-KANSAS-CITY-CHIEFS-V-BALTIMOR-235001.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Travis Kelce with Taylor Swift after a 17-10 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game in Baltimore, Maryland, on Jan 28.", "caption": "Travis Kelce with Taylor Swift after a 17-10 victory against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game in Baltimore, Maryland, on Jan 28.

SG100K, a comprehensive population health study of 100,000 Singaporeans, is a key partner of the programme.\n\nPrecision medicine is a targeted approach to disease treatment and prevention that takes into account individual differences in genes, environments and lifestyles. Threads of genetic material can unravel clues about a person's risk of cancer or chronic disease, for example.\n\nPatients who happen to carry genetic variants or \"faulty genes\" could have bad reactions to medications intended to treat their health problems.\n\nOne goal of the 10-year precision health programme, which ends in 2027, is to map the genes of around one million people. The programme is currently in its second phase, and the SG100K project is a key component of it.\n\nIn a website post dated Dec 11, 2023, Precise marked the milestone of completing 50,000 genome sequences by recognising its partners from the healthcare sector, academia and industry.\n\nAmong them were Illumina, which also provided the sequencing technology and equipment, and local biotech firm NovogeneAIT, which carries out the whole genome sequencing, churning out more than 760 whole genomes every week.\n\nThe 80,000 participants to date were recruited from four cohort studies, including Health for Life in Singapore (Helios), led by the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine. Helios participants have to undergo a five-hour check-up that includes undergoing a cognitive test, having their biological samples obtained, their body composition measured, and other things. Identifiers, like their NRIC, will be removed.\n\nThe other studies are from the National University of Singapore Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, the Singapore Eye Research Institute and the National Heart Centre Singapore.\n\nAsians, especially South-east Asians, are known to be under-represented in genomic programmes, making up only about 3 per cent of existing population health studies globally.\n\nUnder the 10-year precision medicine programme, a local database containing 10,000 genome sequences was completed a few years ago as part of a pilot.\n\nFrom that cohort, scientists learnt that nearly every individual carries at least one genetic variant that can interact poorly with a drug. This finding was in a 2022 research paper published in the Nature Communications scientific journal.\n\nA predominant drug at play is the blood thinner warfarin, which Asians are known to be sensitive to and need lower dosages for.\n\nFrom the 10,000 sequences, millions of genetic variants - previously undetected in Western studies - were revealed.\n\nPrecise is now calling for researchers to submit proposals that will unearth more health and precision medicine insights from the 50,000 completed sequences.\n\nAccording to Precise's website, applications end on Jan 31.\n\nA strong precision medicine landscape needs genetics professionals, infrastructure and genetics literacy in both people and doctors. These are still being developed in Singapore.\n\nIllumina's head of Singapore, Mr Simon Giuliano, noted that genomics is a new science, and, like other countries in the Asia-Pacific, there is still a shortage of genetics-trained workers in Singapore, from counsellors to bioinformaticians.\n\n\"Patient awareness and understanding, accessibility and cost are common barriers cited across the world for the low uptake of genetic and cascade testing worldwide, especially in oncology,\" he said.\n\nCascade testing refers to screening relatives who may be at risk of genetic conditions, after someone in the family has been diagnosed with a hereditary disease.\n\n\"Since genomics is a relatively new field of medicine, often regulatory frameworks governing how it is deployed in clinical practice are still evolving too.\n\n\"The good news is that education and training are starting to accelerate, and capability in Singapore is advancing,\" added Mr Giuliano.\n\nShabana Begum\n\nGenetics\n\nPOPULATION/DEMOGRAPHICS\n\nDISEASES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Newborns usually weigh between 2.5kg and 3.5kg.\n\nDr Tan said that Chelsea's chances of survival were close to zero at birth.\n\nShe went through a slew of life-sustaining treatments and spent 166 days, or more than five months, in hospital before she was discharged.\n\nMr Kiew said that Chelsea, who turns six in May 2024, is very fortunate as she has no major complications from her premature birth.\n\nShe has a small hole in her heart, which requires regular check-ups.\n\nMr Kiew said: \"We don't see any impact from the hole in her heart. She can still run about, take part in all activities, depending on her mood.\"\n\nBut she is on the smaller side - weighing about 15kg and standing at 1.05m tall.\n\nDr Tan said Chelsea is healthy and growing well. The girl has no medical or health issues apart from hereditary astigmatism, myopia and allergic rhinitis.\n\nOn Jan 9, Minister of State for Home Affairs and Social and Family Development Sun Xueling said that only one baby born at 22 weeks in Singapore in the past decade survived. Ms Sun said this at the second reading of the Stillbirths and Births (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill.\n\nMs Sun did not name the child, whom she described as a \"miracle baby\", but added that such cases are extremely rare. The Straits Times found out that the child is Chelsea.\n\nUnder the Bill, the definition of stillbirth will refer to the death of a baby born after the 24th week of pregnancy. This is up from after the 22nd week now.\n\nThe change comes after doctors expressed concern that the threshold of 22 weeks of pregnancy may be misinterpreted as an indication of foetal viability, which refers to the ability of a baby born prematurely to survive outside the womb.\n\nThis may cause confusion among parents facing difficult and important decisions about medical interventions for their unborn child.\n\nMs Sun said that local medical and scientific evidence points to 24 weeks of pregnancy as the threshold for foetal viability.\n\nShe said reviews by the Ministry of Health in 2018 and 2022 concluded that the survival rate of a premature baby born at 22 weeks is close to zero, while the foetal viability of babies born at 24 weeks is about 50 per cent.\n\nAbout 8 per cent of all babies born in 2022 were premature babies, defined in the Report on Registration of Births and Deaths 2022 as those born at or before 36 weeks.\n\nA total of 112 babies - or 0.3 per cent of all babies - were born at under 28 weeks in 2022, the report published by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority stated.\n\nChelsea's birth came as a shock to her parents. She is their only child.\n\nMadam Lin suddenly went into labour at home and her husband helped to deliver the baby, guided by emergency medical services staff over the phone.\n\nRecounting the experience, Madam Lin said: \"I was petrified. But when I heard her crying, at least I knew she was alive.\"\n\nBoth mother and daughter were rushed to KKH, where doctors told them the prognosis for Chelsea was very poor. She needed 100 per cent oxygen and maximum ventilator support to help her breathe.\n\nThere were a few times during her hospital stay when doctors thought she might not survive, but she pulled through.\n\nMr Kiew said: \"We visited her every day, told her stories and encouraged her to believe in herself and explore the world. We believe such support is crucial for premature babies.\"\n\nDr Tan said that most babies born at 22 weeks show little or no signs of life at birth, and especially so for those born at home - referring to spontaneous deliveries, where no drugs or other techniques are used to induce labour.\n\nBut Chelsea was extremely active at birth, with a good heart rate, among other health indicators, she said.\n\nHer hospital bill eventually came up to $330,000. But the Kiews paid about $3,000 with MediSave, after subsidies and MediShield.\n\nDr Tan said Chelsea had chronic lung disease, which required respiratory support for nine months after her discharge. She later recovered and grew out of the condition.\n\nShe was also fed with a feeding tube for a period of time, Mr Kiew said.\n\nDr Tan said the girl has not had any health nor medical concerns in relation to her premature birth.\n\nHer parents said Chelsea is an independent child, who likes to draw, sing and dance.\n\n\"She's very sensible, like she can see when I come back from office looking tired, and she'll cover me with a blanket,\" Mr Kiew said.\n\n\"She's a bit of an introvert. She will spend a lot of time observing you before she will play with you.\"\n\nTheresa Tan\n\nSenior Social Affairs Correspondent\n\npregnancy\n\nbabies\n\nKK Women's and Children's Hospital\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 09:43am\n\n'She had 3 abortions': S'pore social worker opens up about helping pregnant teens\n\nJun 19, 2025, 07:18am\n\nZika cases detected in Woodlands: What you need to know about the virus\n\nApr 9, 2025, 07:35am\n\nInfluencer Simonboy welcomes baby boy after wife's 45-hour labour\n\nMar 29, 2025, 11:08pm\n\nIVF gives hope to woman after miscarriages, ectopic pregnancy\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cb7fb3d839611f1cc547f8931f6d70cf03cc137f21b91f9e4a16120610eaa5f8/wgt-chelsea-270124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chelsea Kiew was born extremely premature at 22 weeks of pregnancy, and she is the only baby born in Singapore at 22 weeks in the past decade to have survived.

The survey was done to get a sense of Singaporeans' attitudes and views towards issues like family, well-being, work and other areas.\n\nIt found that the young are reporting higher levels of loneliness, and cost of living is top of the list of social issues that Singaporeans are most concerned about.\n\nA representative sample of 2,356 Singapore residents were polled between November and December 2023 in three groups: age 21 to 34, 35 to 49, and 50 to 64.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 08:05am\n\nFewer marriages and births in Singapore in 2024: MSF\n\nMore related stories\n\nWhile 70 per cent of the youngest group thought it was not necessary to get married, 58 per cent of the middle group and 50 per cent of the oldest group concurred.\n\nAnd 72 per cent of the youngest group feel it is not necessary to have children in a marriage, compared to 63 per cent in the middle group and 49 per cent in the oldest group.\n\nDespite this, 68 per cent of the youngest respondents foresee themselves getting married, and 67 per cent hope to have kids.\n\nAcross all age groups, the top two reasons for not dating or getting married are that they have not met the right person yet and that they prefer to remain single.\n\nYounger respondents are more likely to cite having other priorities, such as their job and self-discovery, and a lack of time and energy, as their reasons for not dating, and being deterred from getting married by the cost of doing so. Older respondents are more likely to cite a preference to remain single as their reason for not dating or getting married.\n\nHigh cost and stress emerged as the top reasons for not wanting to have children across all age groups.\n\n\"They almost have checkboxes these days before they can consider marriage and parenthood. They want to check off their job, they want the ability to have their own home and a comfortable life, being able to travel twice or three times a year… And then the rest,\" said Dr Chew Han Ei, senior research fellow at IPS.\n\nDr Kalpana Vignehsa, senior research fellow at IPS who conducted the poll, said: \"So they are raising themselves to not kind of identify so strongly with marriage and parenthood that it affects their fulfilment. Nonetheless, their own aspirations don't necessarily need to match up.\n\n\"It doesn't necessarily have to be a really bad thing because if you can't necessarily control the eventual outcome, you are a little bit protected if you don't, if it's not going to affect your sense of identity and fulfillment.\"\n\nThe young worry about the cost of housing, the middle group about the cost of their kids' education, and the oldest group about the cost of necessities like food and healthcare costs, said Dr Chew.\n\nYounger respondents are more likely to report higher levels of social isolation. More than half of them find it easier to talk to people online and feel anxious if they have to interact with others in person. Only three in 10 of those aged 50 to 64 feel the same way.\n\nYounger respondents are more likely to hope to see greater mental health support in schools and workplaces.\n\nMental health support ranks third on the list of social issues that younger people care about, while this concern comes in the eighth place for the oldest group, which aligns with how this group has a stronger stigma against mental health, said Dr Chew.\n\n\"They are in the life stage when they should be making transitions to the workplace, transitions to higher education, and missed out on a lot of these opportunities during the pandemic. They don't go for orientations, they don't go for their immersion programmes overseas. And there's no water cooler conversations at the workplace,\" he said.\n\nOn concerns around work, younger respondents surveyed are more worried about their work prospects, such as getting their desired salary, position, benefits and working conditions.\n\nGiven the opportunity, 55 per cent of young respondents would move overseas to work, compared to 45 per cent of the middle group and 33 per cent of the oldest group.\n\nThe young feel more prepared for tech disruptions in the workplace, with 53 per cent feeling prepared for the eventual adoption of tech such as generative artificial intelligence, Web3, and blockchain in the workplace, compared to 48 per cent in the middle group and 46 per cent in the oldest group.\n\nYounger respondents polled tend to be more civically engaged, compared to their older counterparts. The younger group participate in such activities both online and offline, and feel more empowered to create change.\n\nShermaine Ang\n\nmarriage\n\nIPS/INSTITUTE OF POLICY STUDIES\n\nSURVEYS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nActress Tay Ying and celebrity chef Wu Sihan hold guo da li ceremony\n\nApr 14, 2025, 04:15am\n\nROM, ROMM to begin Saturday solemnisations at Esplanade Mall interim site\n\nMar 28, 2025, 05:11am\n\nHow to survive renovation: Top tips from SGAG's Xiao Ming and his wife\n\nMar 23, 2025, 12:00am\n\n'I needed to protect her against dark thoughts': Father of 5, whose wife had postnatal depression\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nHair Implant Clinics That Won’t Break Bank\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f405a569af016bda072ff5f21a895944783a8e91fb115efaabdcb23e61415255/rrwedding2901.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "68 per cent of the youngest respondents foresee themselves getting married, and 67 per cent hope to have kids.", "caption": "68 per cent of the youngest respondents foresee themselves getting married, and 67 per cent hope to have kids.

He even returned with a bloodied nose after Winning Stride reared behind the gates and knocked him in the face in Race 9.\n\nBut, the globe-trotting 31-year-old was not complaining about his day - as well as the way his second long-term Singapore stay has panned out thus far.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nAfter his appetite was whetted by a double at his maiden one-day visit in 2017, he chalked up 33 winners at his first full season in 2018.\n\nThough it is still early days, a fourth place at only his second meeting at a high strike rate of 30.77 per cent has set the stage for potentially his best Singapore campaign yet.\n\n\"I've had a lot of support since I arrived, and I hope to keep up the momentum,\" said Curatolo, who last rode in Dubai and US before he kicked off his one-year Singapore licence.\n\n\"I ride for a lot of trainers like Donna Logan, Stephen Gray, Steven Burridge every morning, including most of my rides today, like the maiden October.\n\n\"I thought I had some good bullets today, but I really liked October. If he ran up to form, I knew he'd be in the mix.\"\n\nThe Gray-trained Ocean Park three-year-old was coming off two seconds with Matthew Kellady up in two Open Maiden races.\n\nBesides doing his homework, Curatolo did due diligence by also jumping on the gelding for a spot of pace work, just for that extra insight.\n\nHe liked what sat underneath him, though he felt the chestnut gelding still had some way to go before becoming the finished article.\n\n\"I rode him one morning and he felt good, nice and relaxed,\" said Curatolo.\n\n\"His form is so much better on turf and he was on the right distance, and had a good draw (four).\n\n\"But he was green to the line, he was going right and left. Luckily, he found just enough to put his head in front right on the line.\n\n\"I think 1,400m is his best distance.\"\n\nAssistant trainer Saimee Jumaat, deputising for Gray who was in New Zealand to attend the Karaka Yearling sale, confirmed that it is still taking October a month of Sundays for the penny to drop.\n\n\"He's quite immature and quirky. Like today, he was floating around in the home straight,\" said the former champion jockey.\n\n\"He won a nice trial coming into today's race and has been running well for Matthew Kellady.\n\n\"Matty was supposed to ride him, but he hurt himself in the parade ring last week and is out injured.\n\n\"Ryan has done a good job on him. We may look for a Novice race over 1,400m for him next.\"\n\nWhile the first pin of Curatolo's treble on Our Secret Weapon in the opener, the $30,000 Class 5 Division 1 (1,000m) was rather straightforward, the more laudable handling arguably came aboard the Kuah Cheng Tee-trained Lion Spirit.\n\nGranted, the US-bred seven-year-old was the even-money favourite in the $30,000 Class 5 race (1,600m), but Curatolo had to think on his feet to avoid trouble mid-race behind Pacific Beauty, the mount of Marc Lerner.\n\n\"When two or three went past me and I found myself further back than I thought, I decided to get off the rail,\" he said.\n\n\"I had a good cart behind Marc's horse but when he stopped, I had to keep my horse improving around. He then quickened very well in the last 100m.\n\n\"Our Secret Weapon had to come out quickly to have a chance. It's a big advantage over 1,000m.\n\n\"They didn't put any pressure on him and he just kept going.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2c20259eaace8794d504bfd34152e2508d3d4c47efe87c73ee455e18bd674e7a/mlrayan29.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "French jockey Ryan Curatolo giving the thumbs-up sign on October, the middle leg of his treble at Kranji on Jan 27.

He ended up sixth.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"He (Lucky Sweynesse) didn't jump slow, but he couldn't get into stride and then when the horses got in front of him and backed the speed right off, that made it impossible from where we were,\" said Zac Purton.\n\n\"So, he just lost it in the first part of the race.\"\n\nIt was a rare rebuttal for Purton, who dominated the undercard with six winners - Nicholson Returns, Ace Victory, Beato, Gorgeous Win, Sweet Encounter and Green N White.\n\n\"It's good (the six-timer) - it's been a bit of a grind through the season so far,\" said Purton.\n\n\"There have been a number of factors behind that but, hopefully, the second half of the season can be a bit stronger, like it was today.\"\n\nPurton leads the Hong Kong jockeys' championship with 61 wins, 21 clear of Karis Teetan.\n\nBut it was unquestionably Leung's time to shine as the home-grown talent tasted Group 1 success for the first time since Beauty Generation's 2017 Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Mile (1,600m) victory.\n\n\"It feels great. We draw an outside gate, but we flew out of the gate, so (we) took advantage and just went forward,\" he said.\n\n\"He was quite relaxed after that and, at the 500m, I knew he was going to kick very strong. Very lucky, it was a win.\"\n\nAsked if he was surprised to have led as easily, Leung said: \"Very lucky. It could not be better.\"\n\nWinning trainer Danny Shum, who savoured Group 1 W.S. Cox Plate (2,040m) and Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Cup (2,000m) victories with Romantic Warrior, said he would consider a tilt at the Group 1 Takamatsunomiya Kinen (1,200m) at Chukyo Racecourse in Japan on March 24.\n\n\"I entered him in Japan over 1,200m, so I will see how he pulls up and then decide if I keep him in Hong Kong or send him to Japan in March,\" he said.\n\n\"I've considered Japan for a long time, because it's a left-hand turn. In the morning, his left-hand turn is better than his right-hand turn, so we have to give him a chance overseas.\" HKJC\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

To lift US$500 million (S$670 million) in gold bullion from a plane in mid-air to stop it from being used to fund a terrorist attack.\n\nBut Cyrus' crew is a little more cosmopolitan than what you usually get in Hollywood heist flicks. Its members include Interpol officer Abby (British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw), getaway pilot Camila (Spanish actress Ursula Corbero) and hacker Mi-Sun (K-pop singer-actress Kim Yoon-ji).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nRounding out the cast are French actor Jean Reno as the baddie and Australian star Sam Worthington as Abby's boss.\n\nPutting together this multinational ensemble was part of the vision Hart had for Lift, which was co-produced by his company HartBeat Productions.\n\n\"It was a dream come true to go out and find a group of actors and actresses who can combine and help us achieve the goal of having a global IP (intellectual property),\" the 44-year-old says at the film's premiere in New York City earlier in January.\n\nThe story had to tick several boxes, explains the star, who was a successful touring comedian before making the jump to acting in comedies such as Get Hard (2015) and The Wedding Ringer (2015).\n\nAmerican actor Kevin Hart leads the cast of the action comedy Lift. PHOTO: NETFLIX\n\n\"You want to appeal to the world, you want to make sure you are part of the conversation on diversity, that you're putting women in a position of power, and that you also have a great story and an action adventure people will gravitate towards.\"\n\nAnd having such a mixed group on set was a lot of fun, says Mbatha-Raw.\n\n\"The cast is so international and all the characters really bring their own energy and cultures and that's part of the spirit of the film.\n\n\"It really is this motley crew, and it was really energising to be around everyone,\" says the 40-year-old, who appeared in series such as The Morning Show (2019) and Loki (2021 to present).\n\nThe experience was especially thrilling for Kim, who made her Hollywood debut with this project.\n\nThe 35-year-old South Korean - who goes by the stage name NS Yoon-G - was also tickled that she got to play the brains of the operation.\n\n\"I play this crazy genius computer whizz who can come up with any kind of apparatus on the spot, unlike the real me,\" she says with a laugh.\n\n\"I came in kind of nervous because I've never been away from home for that long,\" she adds. \"But I was super lucky to meet such great people, and it was like going there to have fun, not for work.\"\n\nFor Hart, Lift is part of an ongoing career evolution.\n\nHe already had a string of hit action comedies to his name, including Central Intelligence (2016), the Ride Along franchise (2014 to 2016) and the last two Jumanji films (2017 and 2019).\n\nBut Lift sees him assuming a leading man role and playing it a bit more straight on screen.\n\nKevin Hart plays a renowned thief named Cyrus who, together with a band of criminals, is recruited by Interpol to steal gold bullion from a plane in mid-air.  PHOTO: NETFLIX\n\n\"The projects I've been doing of late have been a little more on the serious side,\" Hart says, pointing to comedy dramas such as The Upside (2017), where he played the caregiver to a paralysed billionaire, and Fatherhood (2021), where he was a newly widowed father.\n\n\"So I've been dropping breadcrumbs and hints that this is the direction I was going.

It's something deeper and our job is to get rid of the cerebral and find the stuff from the heart.\"\n\nBeing a hit on social media has given Odell more time, namely not having to continuously promote his music.\n\n\"When I first started my career... so much of my time was spent promoting the music, flying around, doing radio stuff and TV and I do so little of that now and I think a lot of that is because of social media,\" he said.\n\n\"It's allowed me to have a direct relationship with my audience and I feel very lucky to have that but when I make records, I have to kind of switch that off to some extent.\" - REUTERS\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nALBUMS\n\nBritain\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\n4\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\n1\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\n4\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\n1\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She said jokingly that I fell into a pot of milk as a baby and that is why I'm so fair.\"\n\nHer adoptive mother, who worked as a mid-wife, later told her the truth that she was adopted. Her adoptive parents have a biological son who is nine years older than her.\n\nMrs Devasahayam said she did not mind the fact that she was adopted, adding that her adoptive mother loved her dearly.\n\nDecades later, her origin story piqued her own daughter's interest in the practice of inter-racial adoptions, which was common in the past.\n\nHer daughter, Dr Theresa Devasahayam, a part-time sociology lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences, wrote a book on the topic which was published in December 2023.\n\nThe book, titled Little Drops: Cherished Children Of Singapore's Past, tells the stories of 15 people, who are mostly Chinese girls adopted by a family of another race, in pre-independence Singapore.\n\nThey include lawyer and women's rights activist Anamah Tan, who is a founder member of the Singapore Council of Women's Organisations. She was also a member of the United Nations' Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.\n\nDr Tan, who turns 84 in 2024, was born into a Chinese family, but she was adopted by a Ceylonese Tamil family.\n\nIn 2020, Dr Devasahayam published a journal article on children who were adopted by Indian families in pre-independent Singapore and Malaysia. These children were often girls born to Chinese families.\n\nDr Devasahayam said adoptions were common in Singapore before the Republic became independent in 1965. But there was a lack of data, as most children were adopted without any legal documentation or arrangement.\n\nShe said: \"Inter-racial adoptions were common enough that people didn't bat an eyelid. The older generation of Singaporeans always knew about this trend, but the younger generation is completely clueless about it.\n\n\"So I feel it needs to be documented and put out there.\"\n\nChildren were given up for adoption as their parents often had too many children whom they could not afford to raise, said Dr Devasahayam.\n\nThere was also a strong preference for sons back then, and it was often the girls who were given away, she added.\n\nSome of her interviewees told her they were given to a family of another race as astrologers advised their birth parents to do so, for example, to avoid bringing misfortune to the family.\n\nShe added: \"And the Chinese couples implicitly understand that Malay and Indians love children, and they would treat their child well.\"\n\nBut the child is often not told about the adoption, as there is a real fear that they may run back to their birth parents if they know the truth, she said.\n\nHer own mother, Mrs Devasahayam, has always identified herself as an Indian woman, despite her Chinese roots. This is because of her Indian upbringing, Mrs Devasahayam said.\n\nMrs Devasahayam speaks English, Malay and Tamil, but not Chinese - which often puzzles people.\n\nAbout 50 years ago, she went to her hometown in Malaysia to try to find her biological family, but to no avail.\n\nShe said: \"I don't feel angry with my birth parents for giving me away.

But given current property developments in the area, they said there is no urgency to roll out new homes.\n\nBased on the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) 2019 masterplan, the site is zoned for housing. It has yet to be assigned a gross plot ratio that determines how much development is permitted.\n\nResponding to queries, the Housing Board (HDB) said agencies are studying plans and will announce details when ready.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt added that site preparation is under way and contractors have been appointed for the demolition of structures that will take place \"over the next few years\".\n\nWhen The Straits Times visited the site on Jan 25, notices to residents of nearby HDB blocks in Commonwealth Close, which abuts the site, indicated that demolition works for 402 Commonwealth Drive began on Oct 3, 2023.\n\nA project title board at the site states that works are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2025.\n\nWhile contractors were seen in 121 Queensway, a project title board has yet to be put up, and it is unknown when demolition works will formally start and end.\n\nNew Town Primary School was officially opened on July 26, 1965 by then Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee. It was located alongside Permaisura Primary School, which opened on June 7 that year.\n\nMrs Margaret Anderson, 74, a teacher at New Town Primary for more than 35 years from 1967, said the two schools were originally known as Queenstown North and Queenstown South, before getting their respective names - Permaisura and New Town - as postmen would confuse the schools with Queenstown Primary School in Margaret Drive.\n\nSports matches among pupils, and even teachers, of New Town and Permaisura primary schools were common, she added, noting that there was no fence between their two compounds.\n\nIn 1992, New Town took over Permaisura's campus when the latter closed down. The school relocated to 300 Tanglin Halt Road in January 2009, ending its stay of more than four decades in Commonwealth Drive.\n\nThe campus was then used as the Ministry of Education's Heritage Centre, which opened in 2011 and closed in September 2019, before reopening in Balestier in August 2022.\n\nNew Town Secondary School was founded on Jan 2, 1965, a few months prior to the opening of its neighbour, Baharuddin Vocational School, by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on June 19 that year.\n\nIn 1969, the vocational and secondary schools were merged, with New Town taking over Baharuddin's campus.\n\nMrs Anderson said the two New Town schools decided to build a sports track. She took part in several rounds of fundraising, which eventually led to the track being completed between the two schools in 1975. Plans to build a swimming pool did not materialise due to a lack of funds, she added.\n\nNew Town Secondary School eventually outgrew its Queensway campus, and at end-1998 moved to its current Dover Road site.\n\nThe compound was then used as an interim campus for seven schools over two decades - Queensway Secondary School (2000-2001), Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary) (2002-2003), River Valley High (2005-2006), Clementi Town Secondary School (2007-2008), CHIJ Theresa's Convent (2010-2011), Assumption English School (2013-2015) and CHIJ Kellock (2017-2018).\n\nMr Daniel Lim, 60, who attended New Town Primary School from 1971 to 1976, said it is a pity to see the school go.\n\nThe semi-retired piano teacher fondly recalled times spent with friends, and that the canteen's mee siam was \"very good and cheap\", costing 10 cents per serving.\n\nAlso etched in his memory was a visit to the school's ground-floor dental clinic, where he had a decayed tooth extracted in his lower primary years.\n\n\"The syringes were frighteningly large in those days,\" he added.\n\nMrs Anderson, who was his form teacher in 1974, said the school's doors were originally saloon-style types, which she felt were a safety hazard for pupils who might get hit by the swinging doors.\n\nShe recalled returning to school one morning to find all the doors' copper hinges had been stolen overnight, purportedly by a thief who wanted to sell the metal parts.\n\n\"I will miss the buildings but changes are inevitable,\" said the retiree.\n\nMore reluctant to accept the impending demolition is Commonwealth Close resident Catherine Leong, 72, who feels the schools are part of Queenstown's heritage.\n\nMs Leong, who has lived in Block 84 for about six decades, is concerned that development of the site - the track in particular - would inconvenience residents. They have used it for exercise and as a short cut between their homes and amenities in the town such as Tanglin Halt Market, even when the schools were still in operation.\n\nHaving to skirt the former New Town Primary School - which takes thrice as long - would inconvenience residents, especially seniors, she added.\n\nAsked about the concern, HDB said pedestrian connectivity between Commonwealth estate and Commonwealth MRT station will continue to be available \"during the demolition phase and as part of future development\", but did not address the impact during potential development.\n\nMs Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist at OrangeTee Group, said the site could accommodate two HDB Build-To-Order (BTO) projects, noting that the nearby 973-unit Tanglin Halt Cascadia BTO development occupies about 3.6ha.\n\nProperty portal Mogul.sg's chief research officer Nicholas Mak added that if used entirely for private housing, the site could be divided over three to four plots.\n\nBoth said the gross plot ratio, when assigned, is likely to be on the higher end, with Ms Sun highlighting that many new BTO launches have a plot ratio of 4.2 or more to optimise land use.\n\nMr Mak said a plot ratio of about 4.9 to 5.1 is possible, citing the current range of 2.1 to 5.1 for other residential sites in the area. \"Vacant residential land near an MRT station in the central region is rare and valuable,\" he said, adding that the Commonwealth station is on the \"very popular\" East-West Line, thus increasing the land's value.\n\nGiven the recent completion and ongoing development of new homes in Queenstown, Ms Sun and Mr Mak said they feel there is no urgency for the site to be developed.\n\nTanglin Halt Cascadia was launched in October 2023, while the HDB is slated to roll out another 250 flats as part of an upcoming integrated development in Tanglin Halt in February. These are part of the 5,500 flats that the authorities plan to build in the estate over the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nAhead of the integrated development's construction, URA on Jan 26 published a proposed amendment to its masterplan for the development site, increasing its plot ratio from 2.9 to 3.5. The development is set to comprise shops, a market and hawker centre, as well as a polyclinic.\n\nNg Keng Gene\n\nCorrespondent\n\nhdb\n\nQueenstown\n\nRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 10, 2025, 02:49am\n\nPunggol resident harassed by debt collectors over former owner's loans\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:15am\n\nFrom noise complaints to posting photos: The five-year dispute between Woodlands neighbours\n\nJun 30, 2025, 05:35am\n\nSome 950,000 Singaporean households to get U-Save, S&CC rebates in July\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:36am\n\nToilet ceiling in Queenstown flat collapses as woman showers\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/78e032115ed25687aa543482a471abb5c90d62f152490f1a98bf9ad1b8ecc858/rrcommonwealth2801.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "The former New Town Secondary School campus (left) and the former New Town Primary School will yield roughly 7.6ha of land for housing development.", "caption": "The former New Town Secondary School campus (left) and the former New Town Primary School will yield roughly 7.6ha of land for housing development.

Jane's case was subsequently referred to the Ministry of Social and Family Development's Child Protective Service.\n\nFour lawyers and three counsellors told The Sunday Times they have seen more cases of teenagers under the age of 18 being sexually exploited by people they befriended online.\n\nMr Raphael Louis from Ray Louis Law Corporation said he has seen an estimated 30 to 40 per cent rise in such cases over the last five years, with victims as young as 10 years old.\n\nHe said: \"These cases broadly fall into two categories. First, those involving victims looking for love or attention online who fall prey to the manipulation of predators lurking on social media and dating apps.\n\n\"Second, teens who offer sexual or companionship services, or accept such offers by people they befriend online, in order to make money.\"\n\nCourt cases\n\nAt least three perpetrators were prosecuted earlier in January for sexual penetration of a minor under the age of 16. All three met their victims on social media or dating platforms.\n\nEthan Yan Weilun, 46, was sentenced to 14 months' jail after pleading guilty to having sex with a 15-year-old boy he befriended on a dating app. He offered the teen $50 for sex, and they met four times between October 2021 and February 2022.\n\nLim Kar Heng, 46, was sentenced to 10 months' jail for a similar offence. He offered a different 15-year-old boy $40 to perform an indecent act on him, and the latter did so in October 2021.\n\nMr Josephus Tan from Invictus Law Corporation said that in such cases, the onus is on the adult to take all reasonable steps to ensure that he or she is not sexually involved with a minor.\n\nMr Tan, who saw a 10 to 15 per cent rise in cases involving sexual exploitation of teens by online predators, added: \"There are cases where minors lie about being older than 16 and the accused person accepted it at face value.\n\n\"But ignorance of a child's age is no excuse. The adult must check that the youth is at least 16 before having sex, be it oral or penetrative. For commercial sex, the prostitute is required to be at least 18.\"\n\nST ILLUSTRATION: CEL GULAPA\n\nMr Tan added that apart from age barriers, it is also an offence if the relationship between an adult and minor is exploitative in nature. This is determined by factors such as their age difference and whether the adult has a degree of influence over the younger person.\n\nCounsellors attributed the rise in such cases to teens spending more time online since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nMs Lena Teo, director of programmes and services at Care Singapore, which helps at-risk youth, said many teens looked for company online during the pandemic as they felt isolated, and the trend has persisted ever since.\n\n\"Some of them, who are just 14 years old, are making friends on dating apps without realising there are predators on these platforms,\" she added.\n\nMr Narasimman Tivasiha Mani, co-founder of local charity Impart, said he has seen teens develop unhealthy views on sex and intimacy as they were exposed to pornography from a young age.\n\n\"They are hyper-sexualised and think it's normal for a teenager to have sex. If they watch porn that portrays abusive or misogynistic acts, they may come to view such behaviour as acceptable.\"\n\nStatistics from the Singapore Courts show fewer criminal cases where at least one charge the accused was sentenced for was sexual penetration of a minor.\n\nThere were 57 such cases in 2021, 39 cases in 2022 and 37 cases in 2023, said a Singapore Courts spokesman in response to queries from ST.\n\nSexual penetration is just one form of exploitation. Other offences include molestation and sexual grooming, lawyers said.\n\nSexual penetration of a minor aged above 14 but below 16 carries a maximum punishment of 10 years' jail and a fine. For victims below 14 years old, the maximum jail term is doubled to 20 years and the offender can also be caned.\n\nResponding to the statistics, counsellors said many cases of teen sexual exploitation go unreported.\n\nMs Teo said most victims do not tell their parents they have been violated as they sometimes blame themselves for getting into this state, feel ashamed, or are afraid of getting punished.\n\nShe added that those who lack love and support at home, or have experienced trauma in their past - such as being sexually abused - are particularly vulnerable to being preyed upon.\n\nMr Narasimman said young people curious about sex, or their sexual identities, often go online to look for answers and are at risk of being misled by predators.\n\nHe added: \"Some of them confuse love with lust, as they were told that loving someone means having sex with them.\n\n\"While sex can be a beautiful way to express love, it does not equate to love. Intimacy in a relationship comes from friendship, communication and being vulnerable with each other.\"\n\nDr Sheena Jebal, chief executive and clinical supervisor at NuLife Care and Counselling Services, said predators create a sense of perceived safety with victims to gain their trust.\n\n\"Some perpetrators talk to their victims for a long period of time. They create rapport by sympathising with their problems before initiating sexual conversations or asking to meet them outside,\" she added.\n\nMs Teo cited a recent case she encountered where a man claiming to be in his 20s bonded with a 15-year-old girl over Taylor Swift for weeks and offered to give her tickets to the singer's concert.\n\n\"He put pressure on her to meet him outside to collect the tickets, or he would give them to someone else,\" said the counsellor, who convinced the girl not to accept the offer as she was putting herself at risk of being taken advantage of.\n\nImpact on victims\n\nMr Narasimman said teenagers who were sexually violated, or have underage sex, may feel shame, guilt and regret.\n\nHe said: \"Quite often, they feel responsible for what happened because they had gone on the online platform and took part in the conversation.\"\n\nIf the trauma is left untreated, they may become depressed or even suicidal, he added.\n\nTo protect young people from unsavoury characters online, Dr Sheena said it is important for them to know how to spot the signs of online sexual exploitation and set boundaries.\n\n\"This includes recognising what constitutes an inappropriate message and knowing how to block and report unwelcome advances,\" she added.\n\nMs Teo said parents should supervise and limit the phone use of minors under 16.\n\nShe added: \"Giving a child a phone is like giving someone a credit card with no limit. Parents should keep a close watch on their children's online activities and communicate with them openly so they know when and where to draw the line.\"\n\nWarning signs\n\nCounsellors pointed to signs parents can look out for that may indicate their child is a target of sexual abuse online.\n\n1. Becoming more secretive\n\nWhile developing a need for privacy is normal among young people, it could be a sign of trouble when children frequently shut their room door, become possessive over their devices, frequently hide their screen or use their devices till uncharacteristically late at night.\n\n2. Social changes\n\nThese include leaving home for longer periods of time with little or no explanation as to where they are going, spending a lot more time talking to friends online rather than in real life, and receiving gifts without saying whom they got them from.\n\n3. Emotional changes\n\nYoung people may show changes in mood and personality if they have been sexually violated.

In April, she will head to Europe for competitions, just as she did in 2023, when she raced in Germany, Switzerland and France.\n\nThe 80,000-capacity Stade de France, which will host the Paris Olympics' athletics events from Aug 1-11, will be her final destination for 2024.\n\nPereira told The Sunday Times: \"I have had a good break and now it is all about Paris, because it's the only major competition for me this year. I decided on the US because it is a great environment to train in weather wise and the facilities there are great as well. I am excited for it.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:11pm\n\nShanti Pereira makes history with 'groundbreaking' feats at Asian meet\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe was speaking on the sidelines of a meet-and-greet session on Jan 27 at the Tampines West Community Club, where residents got to meet the Singaporean trail-blazer.\n\nBeyond racing against some of Europe's best, the competitions will also give her an opportunity to secure a 100m spot at the Paris Games by racking up world ranking points. At the world championships in Budapest last August, she had met the Olympic qualifying mark in the 200m after clocking a national-record 22.57sec in the semi-finals.\n\nIndividual athletes have two routes to earn a ticket to Paris till the qualification window closes on June 30. Half of the quota spots will be allocated based on timing, while the other half will be based on world rankings.\n\nOver the course of 2023, Pereira competed in 47 individual races, rewrote the national 100m mark six times and the 200m record four times as she emerged as a national hero.\n\nHer goal for this season is to further eclipse her national records. She had set the 100m mark of 11.20sec en route to winning the gold at the Asian Athletics Championships in July, just weeks before lowering the 200m timing.\n\nShaving off any fraction of a second could help in her Olympic target, which is to better her performance in Hungary, where she finished 17th out of 45 overall in the 200m.\n\nShe said: \"The place I am at, (getting quicker timings) boils down to the smallest details. So we're just really working on getting faster. I'm just excited to continue this progress. I have been working on improving my arms swing and my hip motions.\"\n\nAsian Games women’s 200m sprint champion Shanti Pereira (centre right) taking photos with residents at Tampines West Community Club on Jan 27, 2024. ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM\n\nThe meet-and-greet session, which was organised by Tampines West Community Sports Network, saw Pereira share her experiences candidly with the 100 participants, with some posing questions on the challenges she faced and how she overcame them.\n\nShe then flashed her widest smile as she signed autographs and posed for photographs with every attendee, young or old.\n\nOne of them was property agent Hairul Sahril, who brought along his daughter Hannah Sofea, 11.\n\nHannah Sofea (centre), a Haig Girls’ School pupil who trains in gymnastics, interacting with Shanti Pereira at Tampines West Community Club on Jan 27, 2024.

Shanti is a motivation to all the younger ones who want to do sports and represent the country.\"\n\nHannah, who could not stop smiling after getting a picture taken with Pereira, said: \"It is not every day that you get to meet a national sports hero. I read about how Shanti had a knee injury but still pushed through and I am motivated to always do my best and overcome any issues I have in training.\"\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nshanti pereira\n\nOLYMPICS 2024\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nSingapore's Shanti Pereira wins 100m silver at the Asian Athletics Championships\n\nJul 21, 2024, 03:38am\n\nShanti Pereira's booming slingshot for maximum impact\n\nJul 12, 2024, 04:38pm\n\nShanti Pereira adds 100m to her Paris 2024 programme\n\nJul 11, 2024, 06:18am\n\nSprinter Marc Louis set for Olympics on universality place\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She was taught to check the roads before crossing.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 03:52am\n\nDishwasher, 66, dies after GetGo car crashes into pasar malam\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe street was usually not busy with traffic either, he added, although illegal parking and speeding cars were a problem.\n\nThe maid, an Indonesian in her 30s, said she could not reach Zara in time to prevent her from being hit by the car. All she could do was scream for the driver to stop, but the car stopped only after some time.\n\nDr Orlic, 39, said he was at home, just minutes away from the accident spot, when he got a phone call from the maid, and he raced down to where Zara was.\n\n\"When I saw her, my heart sank. Her skull was shattered. She was bleeding profusely from her nose, mouth and head. And her eyes were closed,\" he said.\n\nSingapore Civil Defence Force paramedics arrived soon after and found that Zara had a faint pulse, he added.\n\nThe child was rushed to hospital, where a surgeon told Dr Orlic that Zara's chances of survival were not good. However, Dr Orlic said, the doctors continued to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Zara for about half an hour.\n\nZara was walking to her River Valley home after pre-school with her two-year-old sister and their maid when a car drove around a nearby street corner and knocked her down.

For example, if an oven's light is turned on without heating or fan, the actual power consumed will be lower than the rated power.\n\nQ: What should I look out for in my monthly electricity bill?\n\nA:\n\nThere are two main things to look out for in an electricity bill, said Dr Foo; the amount of kWh consumed and the electricity price per kWh. The electricity bill for the month is derived by multiplying the amount of kWh with the electricity price.\n\nMr Ee said the power bill also allows for simple analysis.\n\nHe highlighted that the bar graph showing past months of consumption can demonstrate trends and indicate potential changes in energy consumption patterns like higher use of air-conditioning due to the warmer weather, or a new appliance at home.\n\n\"This indicates how a lifestyle change or introduction of new household products affects the overall consumption,\" said Mr Ee.\n\nHouseholds that purchase electricity from national retailer SP Group can also compare their electricity consumption with that of their neighbours or with the national average for similar housing.\n\nSuch comparisons, said Mr Ee, gauge household energy consumption.\n\n\"If a household's consumption is higher than the neighbourhood and national average, the household might not be using electricity efficiently,\" he added.\n\nQ: How can I boost the energy efficiency of my home appliances?\n\nA:\n\nUnder the Mandatory Energy Labelling Scheme, the number of ticks on the energy labels indicates how efficient an appliance is. An appliance is considered more energy-efficient when it uses less electricity to produce a particular output, compared with another appliance that uses more electricity to produce the same output.\n\nWhen considering the energy efficiency of an air-conditioner, room size is key.\n\nThe National Environment Agency recommends that the cooling capacity, expressed in kilowatts, should be five times the total floor area, in square metres, that an air-conditioner needs to cool.\n\nAn air-conditioner with a higher capacity than is needed for a given room would waste electricity, while an undersized air-conditioning system would not be able to deliver the desired cooling effect.\n\nQ: Which air-con settings - cool, eco, dry or auto - provide the most savings?\n\nA:\n\nThermal comfort is affected by both humidity and temperature in a room, said Mr Ee.\n\nDr Foo said dehumidifying the air in dry mode consumes less energy compared with cool mode. In dry mode, the fan unit runs slower, and, most importantly, the compressor unit runs less frequently than when the unit is operating in cool mode.\n\nMr Ee explained that an air-conditioner running in cool mode helps to reduce the temperature in a warm and humid space, while dry mode is recommended for a space which that is humid but at a relatively comfortable temperature - this is because dry mode helps to reduce humidity to approximately 60 per cent while maintaining temperatures.\n\nQ: Will turning on the fan and the air-con at the same time help save electricity?\n\nA:\n\nCombining the use of an air-conditioner with a ceiling fan is an efficient practice in Singapore, said Mr Ee.\n\nThis is because the fan helps distribute the cool air evenly, enhancing the cooling effect and allowing the air-conditioner to be set at a higher temperature. In addition, it helps to draw warm air from the surface faster, reducing the air-conditioner's workload and energy consumption.\n\nQ: LED lights consume less power but are more expensive than non-LED lights. Is buying them still the better option?\n\nA:\n\nWhile LED lights are more expensive, they are the more economical option in the long run, said Ms Wei. This is because they often last longer than non-LED lights.\n\nLynda Hong\n\nSenior Environment Correspondent\n\nENERGY\n\nELECTRICITY AND POWER\n\nELECTRICAL APPLIANCES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 30, 2024, 04:20am\n\nLower electricity and gas prices January to March\n\nDec 13, 2024, 11:46pm\n\nIslandwide Total Defence exercise to return in Feb 2025\n\nNov 24, 2024, 10:51pm\n\nHalf of homes in EMA pilot cut energy usage in Sept when prompted\n\nOct 2, 2024, 08:27am\n\nSmart light system to be installed by mid-2025\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2bbb30a0ce195353ae36b51a05397fec1f95b8848bd1a3a6904e7c4e22d440b9/aaaircon270124.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Combining the use of an air-con with a ceiling fan is an efficient practice in Singapore.", "caption": "Combining the use of an air-con with a ceiling fan is an efficient practice in Singapore.

Because if you all think that age is not a problem, I'll be around.\"\n\nPressed again if he plans to run in the next election, which must be held by November 2025, Dr Tan said: \"I never say no.\"\n\nAsked whether Iswaran's departure from the group representation constituency presented an opportunity for his party, Dr Tan said the PSP had been working the ground since the 2020 General Election, before the corruption probe against Iswaran surfaced in July 2023, and it would continue to do so.\n\nDr Tan said: \"Of course, we hope that (this) will help us, but I think it all depends on the electorate, how we perform, and now we have a (presence in) Parliament for them to assess us.\"\n\nDr Tan (centre), 83, led the PSP in West Coast GRC in 2020, narrowly losing to the PAP team, led by former transport minister S.

And it will be complacent of us to actually think that just because of this one incident, we will have a better chance of getting into Parliament.\"\n\nShe added that much depends on what the PAP does and who they send in to replace Iswaran.\n\nIn a reference to Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat's East Coast Plan during the 2020 General Election, she said: \"They might come up with the West Coast Plan.\"\n\nVolunteers from the PAP's West Coast Branch were also spotted at the hawker centre on Jan 27, including acting branch chairwoman, Ms Chua Wei-Shan, who Dr Tan said he exchanged pleasantries with.\n\nPSP secretary-general Leong Mun Wai told the media the party would ramp up its walkabouts and house visits to West Coast GRC, from a monthly to weekly basis.\n\nMr Leong, who is also an NCMP, said the goal was to convince residents to trust his party to run the town council better than the incumbent.\n\nHe said: \"At the national level, we are able to bring up policies that will improve their lives in general. I think that is the most important; whether we are credible enough to have gained their trust.\"\n\nDr Tan was also asked if he regretted\n\nsupporting presidential candidate Tan Kin Lian\n\nduring the 2023 presidential election in a personal capacity.\n\nMr Tan Kin Lian finished last, winning 13.87 per cent of the votes, compared with President Tharman Shanmugaratnam's landslide 70.4 per cent. Mr Ng Kok Song came in second with 15.72 per cent.\n\nDr Tan said: \"I think there is a principle involved.

Iraq play Jordan and Iran meet Syria next.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann's South Korea would have faced Japan had they topped their group, but they were held 3-3 by Malaysia in their final game and play Roberto Mancini's Saudis on Jan 30.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 21, 2024, 01:39am\n\nAndy Murray snaps six-match losing run in Doha opener\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Taeguk Warriors, who are trying to win the Asian Cup for the first time in 64 years, also drew with Jordan and coach Klinsmann is anticipating a \"battle\".\n\n\"You cannot underestimate any team - every team is tactically very smart, they can hurt you even if you have 85 per cent possession,\" the German warned. \"There is no easy team in Asia to play.\"\n\nSkipper and talisman Son has scored twice in the tournament, both penalties, and called their madcap stalemate with already eliminated Malaysia a \"big wake-up call\".\n\nSaudi Arabia topped their group with two wins and a draw, but they have not really fired in attack and made hard work of defeating nine-man Kyrgyzstan 2-0.\n\n\"We know it will be a very difficult match, not only for us, but also for them,\" said Mancini of the looming clash with South Korea in the round of 16.\n\nIn other matches, Japan play Bahrain, but like the Koreans, they have not lived up to the huge expectations placed on them.\n\nBrighton & Hove Albion winger Kaoru Mitoma is yet to play a single minute and Hajime Moriyasu has refused to put a timeframe on his return from injury.\n\nThe coach admitted he had taken a risk in bringing him to the tournament, saying: \"I don't want to use him until he's ready.\"\n\nMoriyasu will keep faith with Zion Suzuki, 21, despite the inexperienced goalkeeper being culpable for at least two of the five goals Japan conceded in the group stage.\n\nBahrain coach Juan Antonio Pizzi will be seeking personal redemption, after he led Saudi Arabia to a loss against the Japanese at the same stage in 2019.\n\nQatar impressed in tearing through Group A and face Palestine, who defeated Hong Kong 3-0 - their first victory in the competition's history.\n\nThat landmark achievement, against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, also put the Palestinians into the Asian Cup knockout rounds for the first time.\n\nThe hosts will be favourites to reach the last eight and, with home advantage, look set to go deep in the competition.\n\nBut no matter what happens on Jan 29, captain Musab Al-Battat said his team had fulfilled a \"promise to the Palestinian people\". \"We managed to put a smile on the faces of those who follow us... inside or outside Palestine,\" he added.\n\nThe knockout phase begins on Jan 28 when Australia play Indonesia, followed the same day by the United Arab Emirates against tournament debutants Tajikistan. - AFP\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nQatar\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nJapan\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 16, 2024, 01:52am\n\nNaomi Osaka's Qatar title bid ended by Karolina Pliskova\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 08:17am\n\nCentenarian to compete in World Aquatics Masters C'ships\n\nFeb 13, 2024, 01:40am\n\nNaomi Osaka beats Caroline Garcia in Qatar\n\nAug 28, 2023, 04:03am\n\nWest Ham sign Ghana striker Kudus from Ajax\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Barely a month later, the University of Pennsylvania swimmer won the women's 500-yard freestyle final.\n\nIt was a historic victory, made possible by the refusal of the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletics Association), which governs college sports, to apply the new US federation rules.\n\nIn June 2022, World Aquatics announced that it wanted to create an open category for transgender athletes. It limited entry to its women's categories to swimmers who \"became women before puberty\".\n\nOther sports' governing bodies, such as cycling and athletics, have also banned transgender athletes from elite female competition over the past two years. - AFP, REUTERS\n\nSwimming\n\nGENDER ISSUES\n\nSPORTS AND RECREATION\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 14, 2025, 11:55pm\n\nYip Pin Xiu claims bronze in 200m free at Para Swimming World Series in Australia\n\nJan 28, 2025, 12:29am\n\nGirl stung by jellyfish while swimming at Changi Beach\n\nJan 24, 2025, 07:27am\n\nSembawang Park Beach still unsafe for swimming\n\nNov 29, 2024, 09:25pm\n\nS'pore swimmer eyes 2025 world c'ships and 2028 Olympics\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Lots of slippery motions,\" said Ms Chang Feng, a bemused housewife who came to Taipei's popular Ningxia Night Market with her daughter to watch the aspiring trend-setters on a small stage.\n\nNearby, diners waited for oyster omelettes and Taiwan's famed stinky tofu at food stalls, with curious onlookers wandering over to check out the dancers.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 11, 2025, 10:35pm\n\nSingaporean woman given six months' jail in Taiwan for stalking singer, threatening her online\n\n4\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Seems like all the kids know how to dance kemusan - it's a trendy thing I suppose,\" Ms Chang said.\n\nThe dance is believed to have originated from Douyin, China's version of TikTok, with avid users jumping on the trend by performing their versions of it, drawing millions of views.\n\nEven businesses have tried to capitalise on it - like popular hotpot chain Haidilao, whose employees twist and jerk their limbs when customers order \"kemusan\", according to online anecdotes and videos posted on Douyin.\n\nTen-year-old Nancy Wu said she learnt it from the platform.\n\n\"We also dance it at school. It has a demonic attractiveness to it,\" she said with an impish grin.\n\nDance controversy\n\nBut the infectious music and jaunty moves have come with a dose of controversy - some Taiwanese users on Facebook have accused the night market organisers of using the dance as a Chinese propaganda tool to brainwash Taiwanese youth.\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan held an election earlier in January, during which China's claim over the island was a dominant talking point among the presidential hopefuls.\n\nThe winner was the Democratic Progressive Party's independence-leaning Mr Lai Ching-te, who has been slammed by Chinese officials as a dangerous separatist.\n\nNow political chatter appears to have migrated into the territory of viral Internet dances as well.\n\n\"Looks like this is Douyin night market in mainland China,\" commented one user on the post advertising the competition, which drew more than 230 \"thumbs up\".\n\nTaiwanese teenagers and children showing off their loose-limbed moves while executing the viral dance at the Ningxia Night Market, in Taipei on, Jan 25.

The images went viral on X and were still available on other platforms.\n\nOne image of the US megastar was seen 47 million times on X, the former Twitter, before it was removed on Jan 25. According to US media, the post was live on the platform for around 17 hours.\n\n\"It is alarming,\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, when asked about the images.\n\n\"Sadly, we know that lack of enforcement (by the tech platforms) disproportionately impacts women, and they also impact girls who are the overwhelming targets of online harassment,\" Ms Jean-Pierre added.\n\nDeepfake porn images of celebrities are not new, but activists and regulators are worried that easy-to-use tools employing generative AI will create an uncontrollable flood of toxic or harmful content.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nAnxious Harvard-bound Singaporeans press ahead with plans, even as some still do not have visas\n\nMore related stories\n\nNon-celebrities are also victims with increasing reports of young women and teens being harassed on social media with sexually explicit deepfakes that are more and more realistic and easy to manufacture.\n\nThe targeting of Swift, the second most-listened-to artiste in the world on Spotify (narrowly after Canadian rapper Drake), could shine a new light on the phenomenon with her legions of fans outraged at the development.\n\nIn 2023, Swift used her fame to urge her 280 million Instagram followers to vote.\n\nHer fans also pushed US Congress to hold hearings about Ticketmaster when the company bungled the sale of their heroine's concert tickets in late 2022.\n\n\"The only 'silver lining' about it happening to Taylor Swift is that she likely has enough power to get legislation passed to eliminate it. You people are sick,\" wrote influencer Danisha Carter on X.\n\nX is one of the biggest platforms for porn content in the world, analysts say, as its policies on nudity are looser than Meta-owned platforms Facebook or Instagram.\n\nThis has been tolerated by Apple and Google, the gatekeepers for online content through the guidelines they set for their app stores on iPhones and Android smartphones.\n\nIn a statement, X said that posting non-consensual nudity images is strictly prohibited on X, and \"we have a zero-tolerance policy towards such content\".\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nThe Elon Musk-owned platform said that it was \"actively removing all identified images and taking appropriate actions against the accounts responsible for posting them\".\n\nIt was also \"closely monitoring the situation to ensure that any further violations are immediately addressed, and the content is removed\".\n\nThe images, however, continued to be available and shared on Telegram.\n\nSwift's representatives did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe star has also been the subject of right-wing conspiracy theories and even fake videos where she is falsely shown to be promoting high-priced cookware from France.\n\n'Easier and cheaper'\n\n\"What's happened to Taylor Swift is nothing new. For years, women have been targets of deepfakes without their consent,\" said Representative Yvette Clarke, a Democratic from New York, who has backed legislation to fight deepfake porn.\n\n\"And with advancements in AI, creating deepfakes is easier and cheaper,\" she added.\n\nRepresentative Tom Kean, a Republican from New Jersey, warned that \"AI technology is advancing faster than the necessary guardrails. Whether the victim is Taylor Swift or any young person across our country, we need to establish safeguards to combat this alarming trend\",\n\nLegally mandated controls would need the passing of federal laws, which remains a long shot in a deeply divided US Congress.\n\nUS law currently affords tech platforms broad protection from liability for content posted on their sites, and content moderation is voluntary or implicitly imposed by advertisers or the app stores.\n\nMany well-publicised cases of deepfake audio and video have targeted politicians or celebrities, with women by far the biggest targets through graphic and sexually explicit images found easily on the Internet.\n\nCheck out this tweet!\n\nlink\n\nSoftware to create the images is widely available on the Web.\n\nAccording to research cited by Wired magazine, 113,000 deepfake videos were uploaded to the most popular porn websites in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nAnd research in 2019 from a start-up found that 96 per cent of deepfake videos on the Internet were pornographic. - AFP\n\nunited states\n\nAI/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 30, 2025, 07:03am\n\nSingaporeans travelling to US advised to check latest entry requirements and comply: MFA\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nS'poreans looking to pursue studies in US can still submit visa applications: US Embassy\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nConfused, nervous, told to 'wait for updates': Singapore students at Harvard react to US ban\n\nMay 22, 2025, 03:18am\n\nForeign embassies in S'pore should not incite local reactions to global issues\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cf011f8b98b1d50f29bcac6e730929c7d8204802e37776ffd3afab84891f697d/TOPSHOTS-TOPSHOT-US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-TELEVISION-GOLDEN-GLOBE-ARRIVALS-090211.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A sexually explicit AI-generated image of US singer Taylor Swift was viewed 47 million times on X before the account that posted it was suspended.", "caption": "A sexually explicit AI-generated image of US singer Taylor Swift was viewed 47 million times on X before the account that posted it was suspended.

He also helped the polytechnic organise blood donation drives.\n\nUnlike him, many of his peers are not donating blood.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 10, 2024, 02:11am\n\nMigrant workers help supplement S'pore's blood needs\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Some are scared of the needle,\" he said. \"We need to inspire generations of blood donors by starting them young, such as through correcting misconceptions and developing their interest in schools.\"\n\nThe Singapore Red Cross (SRC) and the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) told The Straits Times that the number of youth blood donors aged 16 to 25 continued its downward trend in 2023.\n\nYouth accounted for 15 per cent of the total donor pool in 2023, compared with 17 per cent in 2022. In 2021, they constituted 20 per cent of all donors. More than a decade ago, in 2011, youth accounted for 33 per cent.\n\nThe downward trend comes even as the total number of blood donors has inched up slightly.\n\nIn 2023, there was a total of 77,424 blood donors, who made up 1.87 per cent of Singapore's total population.\n\nThis was slightly higher than in 2022, when there were 74,154 blood donors, or 1.82 per cent of the total population. In 2021, there were 69,032 blood donors, or 1.73 per cent of the population.\n\nSRC said the decrease in youth blood donors worsened during the pandemic, when it cancelled its school outreach and mobile blood drives. These are important avenues for youth donors to learn about blood donation and start their donation journey.\n\n\"While we have resumed these activities, it takes time and effort to build up the momentum and grow the pool of youth blood donors again,\" said SRC's spokesperson.\n\nSRC works with youth organisations, including schools and institutions of higher learning, to promote and educate youth on the importance of blood donation, and to dispel misconceptions such as blood donation being painful and that donors can catch diseases.\n\nThere are also ground-up efforts to empower youth to run public donation drives and organise group donations at the blood banks to encourage peer-to-peer donor recruitment.\n\nThe Singapore Red Cross Youth, a co-curricular activity in schools, recently announced the Youth Blood Donor Programme. It aims to develop blood donation ambassadors and activists, who will reach out to their peers and family members.\n\nSRC also launched a Youthphoria award on World Blood Donor Day in October 2023 to inspire more young people to donate blood regularly. In addition, it rolled out digital initiatives like the DonateBlood app, a Facebook blood donation tool and the Blood Buddy Instagram to reach a more tech-savvy audience and engage the next generation of donors.\n\nWith about 600 donors stopping donations due to age or illnesses each year, it is crucial to constantly increase Singapore's pool of blood donors.\n\n\"We need more youth donors to start donating now, and to make it a lifelong habit,\" said HSA's spokesperson. \"This will ensure the sustainability of our blood supply into the future.\"\n\nIn 2023, more than 114,000 units of blood were transfused. To meet Singapore's blood demand, about 125,000 units of blood have to be collected annually.\n\nThis will increase to more than 160,000 units a year by 2030 due to a super-aged population and increased healthcare needs.\n\nAs people age, they are more prone to developing multiple medical conditions, which can increase their susceptibility to anaemia and the need for blood transfusions. HSA said those aged 60 years and above make up 20 per cent of Singapore's population but accounted for 60 per cent of total red blood cell usage.\n\nOn Jan 25, SRC and HSA issued an appeal for people with O blood type to donate blood during the period leading up to the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday. Stocks of this blood type are currently at critical levels due to high usage and lower-than-normal donor turnout since the start of 2024.\n\nDuring festive seasons such as CNY, blood collection can dip by as much as 20 per cent.\n\nAs the universal blood group, O blood type is required during emergencies when patients' blood groups are unknown.\n\nNearly half of all patients in Singapore have O blood type, and can receive only a similar blood type. If group O blood stocks continue to drop, elective surgery will have to be postponed and life-saving transfusions could also be compromised.\n\nMs Kymn Yee, a 44-year-old lecturer who was diagnosed with thalassaemia when she was a few months old, receives a blood transfusion once every three weeks at the National University Hospital. Each session takes about nine hours, including waiting time.\n\n\"There had been occasions in the past when I was told that there was insufficient blood in the blood bank for me, so I had to go home without blood,\" she said. \"This was really frustrating as it meant I had to go back the following weekend.\"\n\nThe situation is better now, though there are still times when she would get just one or two packets of blood due to supply shortage.\n\nShe needs three packets of blood for her haemoglobin level to be normal. \"I will feel faint, tired and lethargic, and arrangements will have to be made for me to go another day to get the required amount of blood,\" said Ms Yee, who is an avid scuba diver and a yoga practitioner.\n\nFor more information on blood donation, go to the SRC website\n\ngiveblood.sg\n\nChin Soo Fang\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nblood donation\n\nHEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY\n\nRED CROSS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 21, 2024, 06:40am\n\nJail for man with HIV who donated blood and lied\n\nFeb 5, 2024, 03:02am\n\nPublic urged to continue donating blood\n\nFeb 1, 2024, 09:17am\n\nActors Lina Ng, Shaun Chen answer call to donate blood\n\nJan 26, 2024, 01:13am\n\nGroup O blood supply at 'critical levels', donors urgently needed\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Adding to the case of deja vu, Makin is the runner-up at both \"farewell\" races.\n\nTNP PHOTO: SYAMIL SAPARI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 27, 2024, 02:29pm\n\n'Last win is for real this time'\n\nFarewelled on Dec 30, Hong Kong-bound Silo will not leave Kranji without an encore\n\nShare this article\n\nTrainer Stephen Crutchley was adamant there would not be another change of heart after Silo's \"truly last\" win at Kranji on Jan 27.\n\n\"This time, it's for real,\" said the Kiwi handler. \"That was his last race, he's definitely going to Hong Kong.\"\n\nAt the final day of the 2023 Singapore season on Dec 30, after Silo took out the last race, Crutchley broke the news that the smart three-year-old had run his farewell Singapore race and was heading for Hong Kong.\n\nThey had even booked him on a Feb 29 flight.\n\nWith the last chapter to the rich 182-year-old history of Singapore racing coming up on Oct 5, owner Constance Cheng and her Toast Trusts & Silo Stable partners had decided to send Silo to the premier Asian racing jurisdiction to continue his career under Australian trainer Mark Newnham.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut, to the surprise of many, the National Defense colt was one of the nine entries to the $70,000 Class 3 race (1,400m) four weeks later on Jan 27.\n\nIt begged the question if those overseas plans had been shelved - or something else had happened.\n\nFresh hopes that Silo would after all contest the Singapore 3YO races were suddenly rekindled among his growing fan base.\n\nIt turned out that the extra time came about for the sake of the horse's welfare. But, at least, Silo has graced Kranji with an encore before bowing out for good.\n\n\"We didn't want to run him, but all of a sudden, he got too bouncy. We could not keep him in his box,\" said Crutchley, who was incidentally the last of the 18 Kranji trainers to open his 2024 account.\n\n\"The best thing to do was to give him one more race or he could hurt himself. It's great that he's won again.\"\n\nAs much as Silo demolished a Class 4 field with contempt at his \"false farewell\", the manner of his actual last Singapore win was even more impressive to pundits.\n\nWhen Makin (Manoel Nunes), coincidentally the runner-up at his last win, kicked clear hard up against the rails, Silo looked on the ropes, triggering the thought in some quarters he should have quit while he was ahead.\n\nBetween the two class risers, the momentum was swinging towards the Al-Arabiya-owned Makin exacting sweet revenge on Silo.\n\nWhile Makin had taken the shortest way home and was already in full flight, Vlad Duric had to take Silo around the weakening leader Red Dot (Clyde Leck) upon straightening.\n\nBut the $8 favourite showed his class as he reeled Makin in to post another smart win by 1¼ lengths, with Trident (Ryan Curatolo) third another 2¼ lengths away.\n\nThe winning time was 1min 21.15sec for the 1,400m on the long course.\n\n\"He let the leader (Makin) go early, but when that horse kicked on the rails, I thought he had his work cut out,\" said Crutchley.\n\n\"The way he still picked him up was a sign of a very good horse. It was too easy in the end.\n\n\"Too bad we won't get to see him run in the 3YO races here.\"\n\nSilo stamped himself among one of the best two-year-olds in 2023 - only to be beaten fair and square by Greatham Boy in the championship decider, the Group 3 Singapore Golden Horseshoe (1,200m) on July 23.\n\nHe has since improved by leaps and bounds and would have been the likely hot favourite to the 3YO crown in 2024.\n\nDuric, for one, was sorry to see his back, but still wished Cheng and partners well at their colt's future endeavours in his new hunting ground.\n\n\"He's a good horse, he's a genuine little horse,\" said the Australian rider, who even once compared Silo to his 2011 3YO Singapore Triple Crown winner Gingerbread Man.\n\n\"I rode him a bit out of his pattern today. He's better with cover, but because of the small field, I wanted to take bad luck out of the equation.\n\n\"I've not had much luck (with my rides) today, and I didn't want him to be back on the fence and get held up.\n\n\"He'll be a handy horse over there.\"\n\nWhile Duric may not know if he will throw his leg over another exciting youngster, he definitely knows he is only as good as his last winner - who was not Silo that day.\n\nThe four-time Singapore champion jockey went on to ride a race-to-race double aboard Pacific MV ($22) for David Kok in the last race, the $50,000 Class 4 Division 2 race (1,100m).\n\nThe late haul made up for his earlier frustrating run on beaten fancies June (third), Foxship (fourth) and Elite Jubilation (sixth, and badly hampered before the home turn).\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\njan27results.pdf\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Hugh Bowman hops up and it would not surprise to see him make a mid-race move in a bid for victory.\n\n6 Special Hedge\n\nis after consecutive wins.

Expect further improvement from him, especially as he appears to finally be on an upward trajectory.\n\n1 Starship Eighty\n\nhas been consistent of late and should keep up the good work. He is a good each-way proposition.\n\n8 Angels Hunter\n\nis aiming to snap a pair of runner-up efforts this season with a first win. He does step away off a winnable mark.\n\n5 Charmander\n\nis better than his form suggests. Next best.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\n2 Second To None\n\n, who stepped up on his debut fourth to score second-up, is after back-to-back wins. He draws ideally and should get a sweet run throughout. The one to beat.\n\n9 Winning Heart\n\nis improving and can make his presence felt. He should have decent odds and is worth including.\n\n1 Ace Victory\n\nhas further scope for improvement, after finishing fourth last start. But the wide gate is not ideal. He does get the experienced hands of Purton, though.\n\n5 Foremost Teddy\n\nmakes his debut and gets 5lb (2.27kg) off from Angus Chung's apprentice allowance. Keep safe.\n\nRace 4 (1,400m)\n\n10 Panda Legend\n\nis racing well this season and is closing in on a breakthrough success.

He can take another step forward following that performance.\n\nRace 5 (1,600m)\n\n7 Royal Pride\n\nis in the right vein of form. With the 10lb off from Wong's claim, he could be hard to beat with the big weight advantage.\n\n3 Beer Palace\n\nhas been steadily improving with every run. Expect him to put up another good show, as long as he manages to offset the wide draw.\n\n10 Chilli Baba\n\ntends to mix his form but does have the ability, especially as a winner in this grade.\n\n13 Horse Of Good Luck\n\nslots in light and is showing the necessary improvement required.\n\nRace 6 (1,200m)\n\n6 Telecom Dragon\n\nhas the runs on the board and is open to more improvement. He is tracking in the right direction and pairs favourably once more with Bowman.\n\n2 Super Legends\n\ngets a handy 5lb with Chung up. He is lightly raced and is taking the right steps forward.\n\n7 Patch Of Theta\n\nhas hit the ground running across both his two starts.\n\n9 The Khan\n\nmakes his debut. He caught the eye in his latest trial and is worth keeping safe for Caspar Fownes.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n1 Goko Win\n\nsteps down in grade. He should get back in the run and launch a run from there. The wide draw is of no concern. Bowman has had one ride on the horse for one win.\n\n4 Enterprise Attack\n\nwon on debut but, since then, has had setbacks. He has the inside draw and should get every chance.\n\n9 Gorgeous Win\n\nis lightly raced but has a stack of ability. He is a one-time winner who should take aim at this group under Purton.\n\n11 Eighty Light Years\n\nis next in line.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m) Group 1 Centenary Sprint Cup\n\n1 Lucky Sweynesse\n\nis the world's best sprinter. He should defeat this field, as he is in superb form, rates strongly and meets this group at set weights which is a huge advantage.\n\n4 Courier Wonder\n\nis first-up but, if they run along at a decent tempo, he is the one who could benefit. He is the surprise package.\n\n2 Wellington\n\nhas the runs on the board and he will get his opportunity. He can improve third-up for Jamie Richards.\n\n3 Sight Success\n\nis next best. He can bounce back.\n\nRace 9 (1,600m)\n\n13 Star Mac\n\nis a newcomer with his fair share of ability. He continues to catch the eye late and this test should prove to be no exception. He slots in light and is worth taking a chance on.\n\n3 Golden Artie\n\nis competitive and is a winner in this grade already this campaign. He has a tricky draw to overcome, but his recent form has proven sound.\n\n7 Powerful Wings\n\nhas a suitable gate and can make his presence felt.\n\n1 Sweet Encounter\n\nis better suited in this grade. Next in line.\n\nRace 10 (1,400m)\n\n1 Tamra Blitz\n\nhas the class edge over rivals. He is racing well and was a strong winner two runs back over this course and distance. Remaining in superb form, he is the one to beat.\n\n7 Beauty Fit\n\nis nothing short of consistent, even if he could not quite get his nose in front for first position. Expect another strong showing from him.\n\n8 Green N White\n\nstill has several rating points in hand.\n\n3 Sinba\n\n, a one-time winner under Richards, makes his first start for Tony Cruz.

The Australian jockey will not be aboard on Jan 27 as he takes the ride on Foxship instead. A'Isisuhairi Kasim will ride Aniki.\n\nST PHOTO: SHAHRIYA YAHAYA\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 26, 2024, 01:58pm\n\nAniki is going for three wins in a row\n\nTrainer Tan, however, warns that two-time winner has his job cut out in open company\n\nShare this article\n\nWith two wins in three starts, Aniki is a rare model of consistency in trainer Alwin Tan's small yard these days.\n\nThe days of the 2016 Singapore champion trainer's boxes filled with stars of the calibre of War Affair, Speedy Cat or Infantry are long gone.\n\nA flicker of hope with the JHI Stable's fleet of US-breds sparking a stable revival did not last long.\n\nBluejay, Benbo and Schneider did not live up to their promise in 2023. Neither did Cash Cove, once Tan's exciting three-year-old prospect for loyal supporter Ivan Neo.\n\nPerhaps such letdowns have taught Tan to not jump the gun, even if he has been unable to fault Aniki.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe Sydney import earned rave reviews from jockey Vlad Duric at his Open Maiden and Novice wins, but Tan was still preaching caution on the eve of the Outreach four-year-old's first test in open seas.\n\nWith his rating having logically soared to 65 points - and incidentally become Tan's highest-rated horse in his barn of 24 - Aniki will carry the top impost of 58kg in the $50,000 Class 4 race (1,200m).\n\nTan is not overly concerned by the handicap. The athletic individual does not buckle under hefty masses, he was also the topweight at his two wins.\n\nIt is the opposition that Tan sees as a different kettle of fish.\n\n\"Aniki's running against stronger horses in Class 4 this time,\" he said.\n\n\"Last time, he ran in a Maiden race and a Novice race against one-time winners. The form of the horses he beat was average.\n\n\"But he definitely showed some potential. I think he can handle the step-up in class.\"\n\nTan has kept Aniki to the same routine since the last-start one-length win over Gun in the Novice race (1,200m) on Dec 30.\n\nThe only one deviation was beyond his control - the pilot.\n\n\"Duric was already engaged when I asked him if he could ride Aniki this week,\" said Tan.\n\n\"He was booked early on the other horse (the Tim Fitzsimmons-trained Foxship). He said sorry he could not ride Aniki.\"\n\nIndeed, the four-time Singapore champion jockey had nothing but praise after he jumped off Aniki at his last victory.\n\n\"From an Open Maiden to a Novice, it's been a very good effort,\" he said. \"His better form is on turf.\n\n\"He can still be quite aggressive before he comes back.\n\n\"To me, he's more of a 1,200m horse. Beyond that, I'm not sure.\"\n\nTan has heeded that advice - at least, for that next outing. He did let in that he was not against the idea of pushing the envelope, especially with a loftier target looming.\n\n\"If he runs a good race tomorrow and pulls up well, I may even look at the Silver Bowl,\" said Tan.\n\n\"I think he can get 1,400m, but not further at this stage.\"\n\nThe Group 3 Silver Bowl (1,400m) on June 9 is the first of three four-year-old feature races scheduled in Singapore's farewell 2024 season. The other two are the Group 2 Stewards' Cup (1,600m) on June 30 and the Group 1 Singapore Derby (1,800m) on July 21.\n\nBut Tan is not thinking too far ahead. Aniki still has all to prove, like how he runs for other riders.\n\nLosing the jockey who knows Aniki best was a hiccup, but securing a safe pair of hands in A'Isisuhairi Kasim could make up for it.\n\nTan and A'Isisuhairi have not been a common combination at Kranji, especially during Tan's heyday between 2016 and 2019.\n\nBut with the thinner riding ranks these days, Tan has supported the Malaysian lightweight jockey more often. The pair recently combined for Cash Cove's win on Nov 18.\n\n\"When I called Harry, he said he was available,\" said Tan.\n\n\"Our first choice was Duric, but I'm happy to have Harry. He rode the horse at his last gallop on Tuesday, and was very happy with him.\"\n\nAniki had given Tan himself many reasons to smile since the day he spotted him in Australia for first-time owner Lee Shu Huey.\n\nHe then raced as Surreal Leo for Randwick trainer John Thompson.

You have the option of switching the cod to haddock.\n\nIt is important to note that Smiths' fish and chips come without seasoning. Diners can add salt and vinegar to their meal.\n\nAll of Smiths' fish are imported from the UK.\n\nThe cod flesh was firm and flaky, encased in the original crunchy batter recipe from the founders' grandfather in the 1950s.\n\nThe chips had a robust and chewy texture, offering a taste closer to freshly sliced potato rather than the familiar flavour and bite of frozen fries.\n\nCod & Chips ($29.50)\n\nSarah picked the Fabulous Fish Bites ($16.50) from the children's menu. Her meal was served with apple juice and ice cream on the side. The gravy, which we ordered on the recommendation of a wait staffer, was a tasty accompaniment to the platter.\n\nFabulous Fish Bites ($16.50)\n\nInterestingly, my favourite turned out to be the Lamb Doner Meat in Pitabread ($22.20). A generous heap of carved spiced lamb with  a medley of salad, chili and mayo, all snugly tucked into a pita bread pocket.\n\nThe inclusion of pickled whole chilies provided an extra zing that I particularly enjoyed. I was not expecting to enjoy kebabs at a fish and chips eatery, but I would return for this.\n\nLamb Doner Meat in Pitabread ($22.20)\n\nSarah and I shared a plate of Onion Rings ($10.50), fried to perfection - crispy but not greasy, delightfully fluffy and chewy . The onion had a sweet flavour, though I would prefer a higher ratio of onion to batter.\n\nThe Cod & Haddock Fishcakes ($10.50) were scrumptious. Imagine potato croquettes loaded with quality fish, delicately seasoned and spiced. We relished both sides with tartar sauce and chili dip.\n\nOnion Rings ($10.50) and Cod & Haddock Fishcakes ($10.50)\n\nI had my first taste of the Yorkshire pudding and I must say I liked it.\n\nThe Giant Yorkshire Pudding With Caramelized Onions & Gravy ($9) was a golden-brown, bowl-shaped pastry loaded with caramelised onions and drenched in thick, rich gravy. Definitely a great savoury side to share.\n\nGiant Yorkshire Pudding With Caramelized Onions & Gravy ($9)\n\nSmiths offered us the authentic taste of UK-style fish and chips. With generous portions and a comfortable dining space, it's worth a visit especially if you find yourself in the Bukit Timah area.\n\nDaddy and daughter approved!\n\nSmiths Authentic British Fish and Chips\n\n271 Bukit Timah Rd, #01-02, Balmoral Plaza, Singapore 259708 Every day, noon to 9pm Website: smithsfishandchips.com Instagram: smithsfishandchips\n\nCULINARY EXPLORER ON A JOURNEY OF FLAVOURS\n\nEmbarking on a delectable adventure that spans continents, Ray Tan joins our news outlet as an avid food reviewer.

Another 16 similar charges were taken into consideration for his sentencing.\n\nAccording to court documents, he committed the offences with three alleged accomplices - Mr Ong Lea Meng, Mr Sim Beng Chwee and Mr Chan Lip San.\n\nAt the time, Mr Ong Lea Meng was the director of a firm called Elmag, while Mr Chan was the director of another company called Lifttech Corporation.\n\nThe prosecutor said that Mr Sim was then the sole proprietor of a fourth firm called DS Systems & Trading (DSST).\n\nIn 2012, Robby Ong decided to inflate LEPL's turnover to attract investors. However, the firm was facing cash flow issues at the time.\n\nHe then hatched a plan in which he submitted fraudulent documents to banks to apply for trade financing for purported purchases of goods. The banks included OCBC, UOB and DBS.\n\nRobby Ong would then use the loan proceeds to support LEPL's operations instead of genuinely paying for goods.\n\nThe DPP said that he roped in the three other men in the fraudulent scheme.\n\nFor the cases involving Mr Ong Lea Meng and Mr Chan, court documents stated that Robby Ong would get the pair to issue invoices through their own firms to LEPL, to make it appear as though LEPL had bought goods from them.\n\nDPP Lim said: \"The quantum would be decided by (Robby Ong) depending on how much money he needed for LEPL's operational needs. The accused submitted the invoices and applied to the various banks for trade financing facilities.\"\n\nThe prosecutor told the court that the banks would then make payments to the firms linked to Mr Ong Lea Meng and Mr Chan.\n\nOnce the pair's companies received the funds, LEPL would issue invoices to them, making them appear like genuine purchases so that the two men's firms could transfer funds to LEPL, said the DPP.\n\nReferring to Mr Sim as \"Darren\", the prosecutor added: \"The arrangement between the accused and Darren is the same...save that the accused would prepare some of DSST's invoices himself as Darren had e-mailed a soft copy of the invoice to him previously.\n\n\"The accused would also sign on Darren's behalf on those DSST's invoices which he prepared.\"\n\nThe court heard that there were no actual sale or movement of goods between LEPL and the trio's companies.\n\nIn June 2019, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) started an investigation into LEPL over tax offences which were not disclosed in court documents.\n\nAn Iras tax investigator then found that mutual invoices had been exchanged between the firms but no physical goods were involved, said DPP Lim.\n\nShe alerted the Commercial Affairs Department in February 2020.\n\nOn Jan 26, Robby Ong's bail was set at $50,000 and he was ordered to surrender himself at the State Courts on Feb 20 to begin his jail term.\n\nFor each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/28cbf7fa4951a03b45e03f333c92a56873ea24568f8c4df735ac89811eedf8fa/jail.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The Singapore Sports School final-year student attends her lessons that start as early as 8am and between her classes, she zips off to work on her technique in one of the school's dedicated training areas for martial arts.\n\nBy evening, the 18-year-old travels from Woodlands, where her school is, to national training in Bedok. And once training ends, she commutes back to campus, where she squeezes in a little time for revision before heading to bed.\n\nLaw's tireless dedication to her craft led to her being crowned women's taijiquan world champion at the Texas-held World Wushu Championships last November. Her efforts have also been recognised by the International Wushu Federation (IWUF) after she was named the 2023 Wushu Taolu Rising Star of the Year on Jan 23.\n\nThe title was determined by public voting with Law garnering 56,405 votes to narrowly edge fellow finalist, Ukrainian Alina Krysko, who received 55,993 votes.\n\nLaw said: \"It is very heartwarming to know that there are that many people who support me. I did not expect to win but I am very thankful and most importantly, to me it is an acknowledgement of all the hard work that I have been putting in.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 3, 2025, 11:32pm\n\nThrowing punches before he could even do long division\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"It has not been easy, especially in 2023 because I was doing my best to juggle between my studies and wushu. This motivates me to work even harder.\"\n\nThe past year was a real test for Law. She prepped for her World Championships whilst also studying for one half of her International Baccalaureate examinations. The Sports School allows eligible student-athletes to stretch the completion of their IB Diploma Programme longer than the usual two years, in order to balance their sports training and academic requirements.\n\n\"In fact, I would say I made my studies a priority and that whole period was hectic and difficult. I often felt fatigued. But at the end of the day, I am fortunate to be at the Sports School where I am given the best of both worlds,\" said Law.\n\nWith the confidence booster from the recognition, Law hopes to be able to excel in three major competitions in 2024. Law, who made her debut at a major competition during the Hanoi SEA Games in 2022 at the age of 16, will compete in the World Taijiquan Championships in Singapore in August, Asian Wushu Championships in September in Macau and Taolu World Cup in Japan in October.\n\nWhile focused on these upcoming events, Law has already pictured the perfect swansong. On her long-term ambitions, she said: \"To win a gold medal at the 2029 SEA Games on home soil. That is the perfect closure. That would be the dream.\"\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nWushu\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nSEA GAMES 2029\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 25, 2024, 11:47pm\n\nVera Tan, Zeanne Law strike gold at Taijiquan Championships\n\nJul 17, 2024, 02:31am\n\nSinger Aarah Wong wins international tai chi competition\n\nNov 19, 2023, 03:29pm\n\nSingapore's teenage taijiquan exponent Zeanne Law becomes world wushu champion\n\nOct 24, 2023, 02:09pm\n\nCelebrations on hold after Jowen Lim bags wushu bronze at World Combat Games\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f3974a059181919c587fd51b3fa6f0f04dba624bf477738d31bc33634c9cb17e/yaohui-pixseagames12-2498.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Singapore's Zeanne Law competing in the women taijiquan and taijijian combined finals of the wushu competition at the Cambodia SEA Games in May 2023.", "caption": "Singapore's Zeanne Law competing in the women taijiquan and taijijian combined finals of the wushu competition at the Cambodia SEA Games in May 2023.

He missed in the first two sets. I felt like he was not feeling that great on court so I just tried to keep pushing.\"\n\nTen-time champion Djokovic, who had not tasted defeat at the Australian Open since 2018, was gunning for a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title but Sinner ripped up the script in spectacular fashion.\n\nDjokovic had no answer to his 22-year-old opponent early in the match but did not help his own cause, hitting 29 unforced errors during the first two sets in an uncharacteristically sloppy showing, compared with just eight for Sinner.\n\nThe 36-year-old lacked his usual metronomic consistency as the super-cool Sinner, unconcerned at facing a man who had never lost a semi-final at Melbourne Park, raced into a 3-0 lead.\n\nThe Italian broke again in the sixth game and seized the set when Djokovic went long with a forehand.\n\nThe decibel count on centre court rose at the start of the second set and Djokovic settled himself with a convincing hold.\n\nBut his error count continued to mount and Sinner, who had beaten Djokovic in two of their previous three contests, broke in the third game to establish a vice-like grip on the match.\n\nDjokovic urged the crowd to come to his aid and cries of \"Nole\" rang around the packed stadium but he was broken again and slipped two sets down.\n\nThe match was paused at 5-5, 40-40 as medical staff treated a fan in the crowd but Djokovic brushed off the interruption to hold serve and the set went to a tie-break.\n\nThe Serb nudged ahead but Sinner came back to earn his first match point, only to dump a forehand into the net.\n\nDjokovic made no mistake when presented with his chance to take the set, raising his clenched fist to the crowd.\n\nBut the Serbian's serve came under renewed pressure again in the fourth set and he cracked to give Sinner a 3-1 lead.\n\nThe Italian kept his nerve to close out the match and end an era at Melbourne Park. - AFP\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nnovak djokovic\n\nMEN'S TENNIS\n\nWOMEN'S TENNIS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/02e9a23bc9713f1d42aca89ef8d2c99816d6bd7113844b75d7402b771e81dde1/TENNIS-AUS-OPEN-072116.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Italy's Jannik Sinner (right) greets Serbia's Novak Djokovic after victory in the men's singles semi-final match of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on Jan 26.", "caption": "Italy's Jannik Sinner (right) greets Serbia's Novak Djokovic after victory in the men's singles semi-final match of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on Jan 26.

It has currently benefited 8,500 children across 15 towns.\n\nBy the end of 2024, six towns - Hougang, Sengkang, Serangoon, Punggol, Pasir Ris and Tampines - will be part of the KidStart initiative.

Pregnant mothers who join KidStart can expect regular check-ins on their physical and mental well-being as well as guidance on how to care for their newborn from KidStart teams in the hospitals.\"\n\nThe programme is offered at the National University Hospital (NUH) and KK Women's and Children's Hospital when mothers attend their antenatal checks, to reach out to pregnant mothers and their children as early as possible.\n\nMadam Rahayu added that after the child is born, a full-time KidStart practitioner will provide home-based support to the family on child development strategies such as meeting developmental milestones in fine gross motor skills and language skills, until the child is six years old.\n\nKidStart, which currently has 140 practitioners working with families, will hire 100 more in 2024 to support its expansion. They will be trained in child development, as well as the health and social needs of children and families.\n\nBy 2026, it aims to have at least 400 practitioners in total.\n\nElisha Tushara\n\nCorrespondent\n\nSOCIAL SUPPORT\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\npregnancy\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:17am\n\nEvery Sunday, they give back: Maids who spend days off helping others\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:47am\n\nSuccessful ITE graduates to be recognised as part of 3 new fellowships in President's Challenge 2025\n\nMay 23, 2025, 12:00am\n\nGirls' Brigade Singapore to grant 5,000 residents' wishes, from home appliances to school supplies\n\nApr 14, 2025, 02:23am\n\nMan finds shelter and job after being homeless for a year\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a1037a7a2487c8eff96086ea2c01c89ab336884cf8a00c76af5f330ca2a8134a/2024012658238797img1575.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling announced on Jan 26 that KidStart will be expanded to nine more towns by 2025.

In 2021, prices surged by 12.7 per cent.\n\nThis comes on the back of a slower price growth of 1.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, lower than the 1.3 per cent growth seen in the previous quarter, data released by HDB on Jan 26 showed.\n\nSubdued housing demand, higher interest rates and inflationary concerns among buyers likely contributed to the slower price growth in 2023, said Ms Christine Sun, chief researcher and strategist at OrangeTee Group.\n\nIn addition, fewer buyers paid cash over valuation (COV) for their resale flats in 2023, with about 15 per cent doing so in the last three months of the year, according to figures from the Ministry of National Development.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze\n\nMore related stories\n\nThis is down from 30 per cent in the same period in 2022.\n\nCOV is the difference between the sale price of a flat and its actual HDB valuation, which can be paid for only in cash by the buyer.\n\nMs Sun noted that in Q4 2023, average resale prices rose in 14 HDB towns, down from 16 towns in the third quarter, and price gains were mostly less than 2 per cent.\n\nIn Q4 2023, prices of four-room flats grew by 0.7 per cent, followed by three-room and five-room units at 0.6 per cent. Prices of executive flats rose by 0.3 per cent while two-room flats edged up by 0.1 per cent, she added.\n\nHuttons Asia senior director of data analytics Lee Sze Teck said Punggol led the pack with the most HDB resale transactions recorded in 2023 at more than 2,000 units, followed closely by Woodlands, Sengkang, Yishun and Tampines.\n\nIn total, they account for 37.1 per cent of total HDB resale transactions in 2023.\n\nTo date, the most HDB expensive resale unit to change hands is an adjoined flat at 50 Moh Guan Terrace in Tiong Bahru for $1.5 million. The 50-year-old flat was sold in May 2023.\n\nA total of 470 HDB resale flats changed hands for at least $1 million in 2023, an increase from the 369 such units sold in 2022. However, these flats remain the minority, making up around 1.8 per cent of total transactions in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, fewer HDB resale flats changed hands, with the number falling by 4.2 per cent from 27,896 units in 2022 to 26,735 units in 2023.\n\nThe increased number of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats launched by HDB offered buyers more options and drew some demand away from the resale market, said Huttons' Mr Lee.\n\nIn the last three years, HDB put up more than 63,000 BTO flats for sale.\n\nIn 2024, some 19,600 BTO flats will be launched, including 2,800 flats with shorter waiting times of below three years. These will be offered across three sales exercises in February, June and October, down from the previous four launches a year.\n\nMichelle Ng\n\nHousing Correspondent\n\nhdb\n\nHDB PRICES\n\nRESALE PRICES\n\nRESIDENTIAL PROPERTY\n\nSINGAPORE PROPERTY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 10, 2025, 02:49am\n\nPunggol resident harassed by debt collectors over former owner's loans\n\n13\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:15am\n\nFrom noise complaints to posting photos: The five-year dispute between Woodlands neighbours\n\nJun 30, 2025, 05:35am\n\nSome 950,000 Singaporean households to get U-Save, S&CC rebates in July\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:36am\n\nToilet ceiling in Queenstown flat collapses as woman showers\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He now faces 15 charges.\n\nThe immigration offender who allegedly gave him the bribe, Chinese national Chen Guangyun, 37, was also charged with four counts of corruption.\n\nBetween July 2019 and October 2019, Poo purportedly obtained bribes totalling $18,000 for himself or another unknown police officer from Chen, who was being investigated for offences under the Immigration Act.\n\nThe money was allegedly meant as inducement for Poo, or the other police officer, to help Chen reduce punishment or avoid prosecution for the offences.\n\nAlso, between August 2019 and January 2020, Poo is said to have received another $18,000 from Chen to help the latter remain in Singapore after being convicted of a criminal offence.\n\nThese offences were not specified, but Chen was eventually convicted and repatriated to China, said a police prosecutor in court on Jan 26. Charge sheets state Chen was sent out of Singapore in May 2020.\n\nIn September 2020, Poo also allegedly cheated Chen of $10,000, lying to him that Poo required the sum to apply to two Singapore government agencies for Chen to be granted permission to return to Singapore.\n\nChen purportedly entered Singapore again in September 2022 without a valid pass, for which he was charged with two fresh offences under the Immigration Act. This case is still pending.\n\nIn addition, Chen faces two counts of being drunk and incapable of taking care of himself in a public place, and punching another man in the wee hours of April 8, 2023, at 525 Serangoon Road.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, Poo is also said to have received bribes totalling $32,500 from two other men, Cordell Chan Yuen Kwang and Wang Huate.\n\nThe money was allegedly given so that Poo would provide information and assistance to Chan and Wang regarding police investigations against them.\n\nOnce in Aug 2020, Poo allegedly flashed his police warrant card at two police officers patrolling in the area, so that they would not conduct checks on Chan and Wang.\n\nA nightspot owner, Ng Chuan Seng, 52, who helped two individuals to pass a red packet with a $2,000 bribe to Poo, was sentenced to five weeks' jail in Sep 2023.\n\nPoo is represented by Mr K. Jayakumar Naidu of Jay Law Corporation. Chen's lawyer is Mr L. G.

The horns are also often presented as gifts to the elite.\n\nThe prosecutors told the court: \"The poaching of such endangered species had led to unnecessary suffering to these rhinoceroses. Most of the poached rhinoceroses would die instantly.\n\n\"In some cases, horns are cruelly removed from live rhinoceroses, leaving them to die slowly from facial wounds. Such inhumane treatment of rhinoceroses is intolerable.\"\n\nAccording to court documents, Gumede had known Mr Marvatona for two or three years.\n\nSince July 2022, he had known that Mr Marvatona was involved in the illegal rhinoceros horn trade.\n\nMr Marvatona would send images and videos of rhinoceros horns to Gumede via WhatsApp relating to the sale of such items.\n\nSome time in or before September 2022, Mr Marvatona asked Gumede to transport some horns from South Africa to Laos, through Singapore.\n\nHe also told Gumede that he would make his trip \"worthwhile\", providing return tickets as well as an undisclosed amount of cash.\n\nGumede agreed to transport the horns, and he tried to recruit a South African man, Mr Chad Berry, to accompany him to Singapore on Oct 3, 2022.\n\nHowever, he failed to do so, despite offering Mr Berry around $2,230 to fly with what was referred to as their \"package\" to either Laos or Vietnam.\n\nOn Oct 3, 2022, Gumede took a flight from Johannesburg and landed in Singapore at around 7am the next day.\n\nHe had planned to travel to Vientiane in Laos on another flight about two hours later.\n\nHowever, his journey came to a halt when a baggage screening officer, who was examining X-ray images of transit luggage, noticed that two boxes contained multiple organic items shaped like horns.\n\nThe boxes also had baggage tags that bore Gumede's name.\n\nThe officer alerted her supervisor and the boxes were taken for further inspection.\n\nA public announcement was then made asking Gumede to report to the Changi Airport Police Command.\n\nAfter that, he was escorted to an inspection room within the airport and the horns were uncovered.\n\nDNA analysis by experts from the National Parks Board confirmed that they were genuine horns.\n\nAn expert from the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of Pretoria in South Africa also confirmed that the horns came from 15 southern white rhinoceroses and one black rhinoceros.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nENDANGERED/THREATENED SPECIES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/fa52d04a416686e6da3221e394202e44eea915f7216bb5000172e0fcbd4cb186/mdseized06102022.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "18 of these horns, which weighed nearly 32kg in total, were from 15 poached white rhinoceroses, which are endangered.", "caption": "18 of these horns, which weighed nearly 32kg in total, were from 15 poached white rhinoceroses, which are endangered.

He cannot be caned as he is now 50 years old.\n\nHe had earlier pleaded guilty to a charge of rape for forcing the victim to perform an oral sex act on him in 2020.\n\nThe definition of rape in the Penal Code was expanded in 2020 to include oral and anal penetration without consent.\n\nTwo other charges, one each for sexual assault by penetration and outrage of modesty, were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nIn the earlier court hearing on Nov 23, 2023, Deputy Public Prosecutor J. Jayaletchmi told the court that the victim lived with her grandparents when her mother married the accused in October 2017.\n\nIn August 2018, the teen moved in with her mother, stepfather and two step-siblings in a one-room rental flat.\n\nShe gave birth to a daughter in April 2019.\n\nIn 2020, the accused sexually assaulted the victim while her mother, step-siblings, and daughter were asleep.\n\nWhile she was sleeping on a mattress in the living room with the baby, he approached her and pulled her into his room, where he slept alone.\n\nHe told the victim that he wanted to teach her how to protect herself against men, and told her to perform an oral sex act.\n\nThe victim, who felt helpless, complied with his instructions.\n\nAfter the assault, she pretended to be sleepy so that she can leave the room as soon as possible, and was told by the man to go to sleep.\n\nIn late August 2021, the victim's uncle advised her to leave the flat with her daughter, after she told him through text messages that she had been sexually abused by her stepfather.\n\nThe teenager moved back with her grandparents on Sept 6, 2021.\n\nOn Sept 16, 2021, when she visited a family service centre to seek financial assistance for herself and her daughter, she told a social worker about the abuse. She added that she was reluctant to lodge a police report because she was afraid that her stepfather would harm her and her daughter.\n\nThe social worker raised the matter to the Child Protective Service on Oct 5, 2021, and lodged a police report two days later.\n\nThe teen was later seen at the Institute of Mental Health. She was diagnosed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the assault, and the abuse was found to have greatly contributed to her major depressive disorder.\n\nThe psychiatrist also said that the victim \"has strong self-blame over the incident and believes that if she doesn't exist, none of these would have happened\".\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/087561c9ca0d8d3475dd8c688f82db2abefcce3f3793af40f89aed8409b3b11a/yaohui-pixgeneric-2612.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "On Jan 26, the man was sentenced to 10 years’ jail by the High Court.

The idea of the bracelets being welded close was also very interesting for us,\" the nurse told The Straits Times.\n\nBesides couples, some family members and friends are also opting for such jewellery.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 4, 2025, 07:49am\n\nWhen an $8 hair salon visit cost $1k: Chain admits to unfair trade practices targeting the elderly\n\nMore related stories\n\nMr Augustine Yuen, for example, bought for himself and his 61-year-old mother a pair of matching 14K white gold permanent anklets in 2023.\n\nThe 30-year-old financial agent said: \"My mum and I have always been close and I thought permanent anklets would be a symbolic gesture to immortalise our bond.\"\n\nCurious Creatures is one local brand that has been offering permanent jewellery since November 2022. Its co-founder Larissa Tan told ST that she has seen an \"overwhelming response\".\n\n\"For at least six months after launching (the collection), our appointments were always fully booked, and back then we did not have weekend slots available,\" she added.\n\nThe brand has since started offering weekend slots for permanent jewellery welding at its Ion Orchard flagship outlet, and appointments are always fully booked, she said.\n\nAt Singapore-based fine jewellery brand Holly Gray, sales have more than doubled since it offered permanent jewellery in December 2022, said co-founder Hanya Seah, 30.\n\nShe said: \"Customers first get permanent jewellery for its sentimental value. It's a contemporary way of symbolising an enduring friendship or relationship.\n\n\"They also enjoy the convenience of waking up accessorised, without the hassle to put on or take off jewellery.\"\n\nPermanent jewellery is usually made of solid 14K gold as it is durable enough to withstand wear and tear from daily activities and sports, said Ms Tan.\n\nDuring the fitting appointment, customers will first select a chain before a technician measures their wrist and welds their permanent jewellery close. Customers can also personalise their custom-fit chains with charms.\n\nPrices for permanent jewellery like a bracelet or anklet are between $115 and $499 at Curious Creatures; additional charms start at $69.\n\nHolly Gray's Ms Seah said that the welding process is painless as jewellers use a leather pad to protect the customers' skin so they do not feel the light voltage from the welder. The welding takes about a minute.\n\nSherlyn Sim\n\nand\n\nVihanya Rakshika\n\nBEAUTY INDUSTRY\n\nJEWELLERY/GEMSTONES\n\nsocial media\n\nDATING/RELATIONSHIPS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 11, 2025, 11:49pm\n\nBarber shop boss gives free haircuts to seniors and the disabled\n\nFeb 21, 2025, 11:54pm\n\nPopular local brand Skin Inc under fire for abrupt Ion store closure\n\nNov 30, 2024, 11:07pm\n\nHair salons in Geylang offer more than haircut and head massage\n\nSep 28, 2024, 01:16pm\n\n80-year-old granny a finalist at Miss Universe Korea pageant\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/09bc153b6c317a9ea48e47221393f44633c67d74acbc37e381b865c32ffac0ec/HG20Bracelet-253.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "More Singaporeans are opting for “permanent” jewellery, typically in the form of matching, claspless bracelets welded around their wrists.

Myopathy generally refers to any disease that affects the muscles that control voluntary movement in the body.\n\nThe mousedeer died overnight despite Mandai's attempts to stabilise the animal's condition.\n\n\"A post-mortem examination further revealed the severity of its condition, confirming emaciation, pressure sores and broken hooves,\" Dr Mathew said. \"The species is known to succumb to prolonged stress, and as myopathy was suspected, it exacerbated the condition.\"\n\nEarlier, Facebook user Mamat VesPapa said on the social media platform that he had spotted the shivering mousedeer stuck in a drain while he was on a hike on his birthday.\n\nHe then wrapped the animal in a thermal sheet after rescuing it from the drain and called Acres.\n\nMandai's Dr Mathew advised the public to promptly call Acres' hotline on 9783-7782 or the National Parks' Board's 24-hour animal response centre helpline on 1800-476-1600 for assistance, if they see injured animals.\n\nFatimah Mujibah\n\nanimals\n\nWILDLIFE\n\nMandai Wildlife Group\n\nAcres\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 11, 2025, 04:22am\n\nYouth who performed lewd act on cat given probation, must attend intervention\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:52am\n\nWill you give Frodo the Singapore Special a fur-ever home?\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJun 27, 2025, 07:49am\n\nKitten allegedly rolled in container at Tuas adopted, NParks investigating\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f8337df5a7722e18c89ce338dbaa6100f2b0523199b2099d8e554acc8c3e7df0/wgt-mousedeer-250124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The lesser mousedeer is the smallest known hoofed mammal that is widely distributed across South-east Asia.

Should they apply for subsidies to cover their medication, they will get a 75 per cent subsidy without any dollar cap, with the annual limit at $330.\n\nMost Healthier SG enrollees, therefore, will likely not need to switch to the new tier.\n\nAs at Jan 23, about 700,000 Singapore residents have enrolled in Healthier SG.\n\nResidents aged 40 and above can enrol with their preferred Healthier SG GP clinic or polyclinic through the HealthHub app or at any of the 39 enrolment stations located in community centres and clubs or polyclinics.\n\nJudith Tan\n\nCorrespondent\n\nGP/GP CLINIC\n\nPOLYCLINICS\n\nCHRONIC DISEASE\n\nCHAS/COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSIST SCHEME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/13956082f78a45cddcb38048a2f14ec6a857ab729fafeba791a773fed8812b4d/file7rhs7wxods83q2ds8zo.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Under this framework, they will be able to access certain common drugs from their Healthier SG GP clinics at prices comparable with those at polyclinics.", "caption": "Under this framework, they will be able to access certain common drugs from their Healthier SG GP clinics at prices comparable with those at polyclinics.

The digital signature of the same \"managing director\" was also appended to the forged document, which Chua created using Microsoft Word.\n\nThe prosecutor said: \"The accused had forged the deferment letter intending to commit fraud by causing the MHA NS services branch to defer the accused's ICT period on the basis that the accused had been appointed at the company and was needed... to run projects.\"\n\nChua's application for a deferment of his ICT period was approved on Jan 10, 2023.\n\nOn Jan 25, the DPP urged the court to sentence Chua to up to 11 months' jail, stressing that his offences were premeditated.\n\nDefence lawyer Raphael Louis, however, pleaded for his client to be given a shorter jail term. He said his client's offences had caused no financial losses.\n\nChua's bail had been set at $20,000, and he was told to surrender himself at the State Courts on Feb 19 to begin his jail term.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nCOUNTERFEITS/FORGERY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/306213c89ddc7725e4d547c397c8e97818eaf95095932c12fc17dd12c3bdfcca/IMG307720copy.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chua Xianwen Winson submitted false documents including an NS deferment letter to MHA to get approval for deferment from his NS recall.", "caption": "Chua Xianwen Winson submitted false documents including an NS deferment letter to MHA to get approval for deferment from his NS recall.

Shanmugam also noted progress in education and jobs over the years.\n\nPHOTO: BERITA HARIAN\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 26, 2024, 01:24am\n\nDespite progress, long-term reoffending in Malay community still a concern\n\nShare this article\n\nDespite the progress made by the Malay community, the five-year recidivism rate of former offenders is an area of concern, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam on Jan 25.\n\nHe was speaking at the first Malay/Muslim Organisation Rehabilitation Network conference held at the Singapore Expo.\n\nMore than 50 organisations were in attendance at the conference organised by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and Singapore Prison Service (SPS).\n\nMr Shanmugam noted that the two-year recidivism rate for Malay offenders fell from 34.1 per cent among those released in 2010, to 24.7 per cent for those released in 2020.\n\nIn the broader community, he also noted progress in education and jobs over the years.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 9, 2025, 12:36am\n\nOver 20,000 devotees attend Sri Sivan Temple consecration, crowd almost breaks through barricades\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe said it was \"extremely significant\" that 85 per cent of Malay households own their own homes and that more than 60 per cent live in four-room or bigger flats.\n\n\"What does four-room in Singapore mean? To me, four-room is a marker of middle class.\"\n\nHe added that this is because those who retain such flats bought from the Government for some years, would likely have equity of between $150,000 and $250,000.\n\nBut Mr Shanmugam highlighted the five-year recidivism rate as one of the challenges.\n\nIt is the proportion of inmates released from prison who end up reoffending and getting detained, sentenced to jail, or being given a day reporting order within five years of their release.\n\nHe said: \"If we look at it over five years, and whether they reoffend, that remains quite high. That's 50 per cent - one in two go back to jail within five years.\"\n\nAnnual statistics released by SPS in 2023 showed the overall five-year recidivism rate was at 45.2 per cent.\n\nAnother challenge, Mr Shanmugam added, is the increasingly difficult battle against drug abuse, with the growing global supply of drugs, and liberal attitudes towards drugs in other countries that are influencing Singaporeans, especially young people.\n\nNoting that inter-generational offending is also a challenge, he said: \"These are problems that can be solved. Now, we know the statistics. We know who are the children at risk.\n\n\"We should be able to intervene and help them before they get into trouble.

Datuk Seri Anwar has been accused of using the MACC investigation to go after his political foes.\n\nSeparately, Malaysia's top cop has denied an accusation by Tun Dr Mahathir that he was treated like a criminal during questioning by the police a few days ago.\n\nThe Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Razarudin Husain, said the police were just carrying out their duties as part of their investigations into remarks made by the former premier about the Indian and Chinese communities in Malaysia.\n\n\"We will continue with the investigation. This is a police investigation; we need to complete it because if we don't, then we would be seen as biased,\" said Mr Razarudin on Jan 24, adding that the police would need three to four days to complete their investigation paper on Dr Mahathir before handing it over to the Attorney-General's Chambers.\n\nDr Mahathir had on Jan 23 claimed he was being treated like a common criminal for voicing his opinion.\n\nIn an interview with Indian-based channel Thanthi TV, Dr Mahathir had allegedly questioned the loyalties of the Indian and Chinese communities to the country.\n\nHe said the communities did not speak the local language but enrolled their children in their own schools, and spoke their own language, such as Tamil, at home. - THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nmalaysia\n\ncorruption\n\nMahathir Mohamad\n\nanwar ibrahim\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\n3\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\n8\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/90118fa9df0965f637f0168ac60c78f141bed59a1c1ec576bbac31615eedcef1/FW997812SG0810012020DAIMBN202001092509.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Daim Zainuddin, a two-time finance minister, was discharged from hospital on Jan 25, 2024.", "caption": "Daim Zainuddin, a two-time finance minister, was discharged from hospital on Jan 25, 2024.

The former at-risk youth and full-time national serviceman, who carried a 35kg\n\nalagu kavadi\n\n, is optimistic about turning over a new leaf.\n\nHis\n\nalagu kavadi\n\n- a structure made of wood and metal - was held in place by close to 70 hooks pierced into his body. His nine-day fasting and rigorous preparation culminated in the procession, which he took about three hours to complete.\n\nMithesh's mother, Ms Jewel Kala, 47, expressed her joy in seeing his positive transformation through religion. The single mother of three said: \"He is small compared with his kavadi, so there were numerous challenges. I am proud he saved up and bought his own second-hand kavadi, costing $1,000, and is the first in this generation of my family to do so.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 13, 2025, 01:03am\n\nHe's not heavy, he's my brother\n\nMore related stories\n\nMithesh, who plans to pursue veterinary science and hopes to support his mother financially, said: \"Events like Thaipusam are gateways for youth-at-risk who want to mend their ways. I am glad religion and devotion have changed me.\"\n\nBearing a variety of kavadis and milk pots atop their heads, the devotees in yellow and orange garb completed the 4km foot procession from Sri Perumal Temple to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple. All participants had pre-registered as early as a month ago.\n\nThe devotees were undeterred by the festival falling on a weekday in 2024, with some working adults and students taking leave to join the festivities. Despite the mild showers in the afternoon, the devotees persevered with the mostly smooth foot procession.\n\nMr Manikandan, a senior pandaram, honouring Ms Josephine Teo at the sanctum of the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple.PHOTO: AZMI ATHNI\n\nMinister for Communications and Information and Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo joined the festival and highlighted the meaningful participation of non-Hindus, non-Indians and particularly young devotees in the festivities.\n\nDescribing the crowd as multiracial and multicultural, she said: \"It is most encouraging to me that local non-Hindus supporting their family members or friends are here to observe this as a practice, a fabric of our society.\"\n\nMrs Teo, an MP in Jalan Besar GRC, noted the importance of unique cultural and religious practices in modern Singapore.\n\n\"It is important for us as a fairly young nation to think about what binds us together as a nation. In many societies, especially fast-paced, modernised ones, these activities are pushed into the fringes and are forgotten over time, which is a great loss.\"\n\nFive live music stations featured local traditional groups and musicians. New stations in Clemenceau Avenue and opposite Selegie Avenue joined the previous three in Hastings Road, Short Street and Cathay Green. Each music group could carry up to four percussion instruments, up from one in 2023.\n\nFor many of the worshippers, Thaipusam feels complete with the consecration of Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in June 2023, in time for the 2024 festival. They can now access the main sanctum and offer their prayers or offerings. The tradition of serving lunch to the devotees during Thaipusam also returned to Sri Thendayuthapani Temple after three years of bento box distributions.\n\nOne participant, Mr Lionel Tan, has been a bedrock in his childhood friend Paul Singh's 14-year kavadi journey. He returned to Thaipusam in 2024, taking leave from work to help assemble Mr Singh's kavadi and support him throughout the procession.\n\nOther non-Hindus who have been returning to Thaipusam include Mr Ken Ho, Mr Lim Eng Kin, Mr Ken Ng and Mr Edwin Fo, who carried milk pots and pierced alagus. The group, from various walks of life and of different ages, has been attending Thaipusam celebrations for several years. Mr Lim, 65, said: \"When I was young, I was always fascinated by Thaipusam processions. A few years ago, I was introduced to this formally by an Indian friend. It has cleared my conscience and I feel much better.\"\n\nHoping for a successful marriage in 2025 were Mohanrach and Hema Devi, both 29. After her father survived a critical motorbike accident, Ms Hema Devi turned to bearing milk pots with alagu piercings. This is the second year she joined her fiance to demonstrate her gratitude.\n\nThe festivities started at 11.30pm on Jan 24 and ended on the night of Jan 25. Devotees received support from local companies that set up 23 water or drinks booths along the procession route. About 1,500 volunteers and temple staff helped ensure a seamless event.\n\nThe festival was the result of five months of preparations, said Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple's secretary, Mr Sivakumaran Sathappan. Despite the management's doubts about the size of the turnout as Thaipusam 2024 fell on a weekday, the support was remarkable, he said.\n\nThaipusam\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 19, 2024, 01:13am\n\nPain is bliss for Thaipusam devotees\n\nFeb 7, 2023, 11:28am\n\nPost-Thaipusam cleaning crew in KL stumped by sheer number of misplaced shoes\n\nJan 6, 2023, 01:46pm\n\nFoot procession, kavadis returning to Thaipusam after two years\n\nJan 20, 2022, 04:55am\n\nBaby born outside Batu Caves at Thaipusam\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The additional 200m on Jan 27 will suit him to a tee.\n\nST PHOTO:   SYAMIL SAPARI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 25, 2024, 02:54pm\n\nIt's time for Elite Jubilation\n\nThe extra 200m to 1,800m will suit Ricardo Le Grange-trained last-start runner-up\n\nShare this article\n\nIt sure looks like a quick back-up within seven days, but it is always better to strike while the iron is hot.\n\nAn astute judge and horseman, trainer Ricardo Le Grange surely knows what he is doing with Elite Jubilation.\n\nThe South African handler will not proceed with such a quick follow-up if his charge did not pull up well after his race on Jan 20.\n\nObviously, the Elite Performance Stable-owned US-bred galloper has acclimatised to Singapore.\n\nHis four progressive starts in Class 4 at Kranji suggest so. From his debut 11th, he improved to fifth to fourth and then to second.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nLe Grange knows one thing, for sure: Elite Jubilation will relish the 1,800m trip in the $50,000 Class 4 event on Jan 27.\n\nThe five-year-old has the DNA to go the distance.\n\nHe is sired by American Triple Crown winner American Pharoah, who swept the Kentucky Derby (2,000m), Preakness Stakes (1,900m) and Belmont Stakes (2,400m) in 2015.\n\nAlthough Elite Jubilation's sole victory was over 1,504m at Beverley in the United Kingdom, he was second four times up to 2,000m.\n\nIn all, he raced 12 times in the UK and Dubai as Sed Maarib.\n\nHe was brought in with the purpose of competing in the Kranji major staying races.\n\nIn an interview after his second start, Le Grange said: \"They have the big races in mind, but let's take baby steps with him first. I think he can go up to 2,000m. He is a get-back sort, but he did show a bit of speed. He finished off his races in Dubai and UK quite well.\"\n\nCosting €320,000 (S$465,000) as a yearling, Elite Jubilation was given an \"educational\" run over 1,200m at his Kranji debut on Nov 11, 2023.\n\nThe sprint distance definitely was not his cup of tea. Not surprisingly, he ran 11th of 14. That outing shaved off some rough edges.\n\nNext up on Nov 25, he caught the eye by finishing fifth, beaten by only 1½ lengths by Green Star.\n\nHe progressed to 1,800m for his third start on Dec 30, but the penny did not drop yet.\n\nStill adapting to his new environment, he finished fourth, but just 3½ lengths behind trainer Tim Fitzsimmons' Singapore Gold Cup prospect Lightning Strike.\n\nBetter settled in at his last start on Jan 20, he nearly brought joy to his connections.\n\nAfter travelling midfield, he came home with a strong run but just failed to catch the $10 favourite Black Storm by a neck.\n\nThat was over 1,600m. Now that he is getting 1,800m, he is certainly the one to beat on Jan 27.\n\nloon@sph.com.sg\n\nBy\n\nTan Thean Loon\n\nRacing Editor\n\nRead articles by Tan Thean Loon\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThese 5 S-REITs Are Outperforming in 2025 - Here’s Why\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d88b92b63b300f40a6aa1d35f0cd9bc3e45e6c49b583e4c564d8ee32e626569f/tlbest26.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Eltite Jubilation (No. 5) charging home to finish a neck second to Black Storm over 1,600m on Jan 20.

A promising career launched off a debut third looked all but snuffed out after only two runs.\n\nThe e-word (euthanasia) was brought up, but the lady syndication, led by Rosy Zimmermann, Allana Laws and Ivy Pearson, would not have a bar of it.\n\nLogan stood by their decision, but with a caveat that any other horse trainer would also spell out.\n\n\"I was in Europe when I received the phone call no trainer ever wants to hear,\" said the Kiwi horsewoman.\n\n\"It was a horrific and tragic injury. Santino took fright during his hose-down, flipped backwards, and his lead got stuck in the ditch behind the tie-up stall.\n\n\"Of all places, he had open wounds in the drains with all the dirty water. The risks of infection were even higher.\n\n\"It was a huge hole we couldn't stitch. Nothing was holding it together.\n\n\"The vets said his chances of coming through were very remote. I told the owners there was a one in five chance he survives and four he dies.\n\n\"But Rosy was adamant she didn't want to euthanise. I told her we wouldn't do that without her permission, and we would only do it on humane grounds.\"\n\nTeam Santino took a leap of faith, and to this day, Logan is baffled the horse survived.\n\n\"When I returned from my trip, he was still at the stables in one piece. We've kept him on strong antibiotics,\" she said.\n\n\"The vets have done a fantastic job. He had box rest for the next three months, and he was bandaged daily.\n\n\"He didn't have any surgery, he just healed back on his own. I think it's because he's so determined, he has the heart of an elephant.\n\n\"Then we slowly moved from hand-walking to putting a saddle on, trotting, galloping and trialling - and lo and behold, he coped with all of them.\n\n\"I didn't believe he would gallop again, neither did the vets, I think. At best, he could end up as a riding horse in Malaysia.\n\n\"But he beat the odds. He's a miracle horse.\n\n\"Full credit to the Singapore vets and our staff how they managed him and saved his life.\n\n\"I fly to New Zealand for the Karaka yearling sale tomorrow. I hope he's still here and improving when I get back.\n\n\"We'll take small steps with him. He'll need another trial, and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6ff54ae7cc56ee2439cd2be3a4c1f007cde141021afb3111bd90a02cc7968122/mltrial25a.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Lim's Bighorn (Marc Lerner) winning barrier trial No. 5 at Kranji on Jan 25.", "caption": "Lim's Bighorn (Marc Lerner) winning barrier trial No. 5 at Kranji on Jan 25.

CH Assets then alerted the Law Society of Singapore on Sept 15, 2015.\n\nThe DPP said that from September 2015 onwards, Singh made restitution totalling $58,000 to CH Assets over nine payments.\n\nSingh was struck off the rolls on Feb 27, 2018.\n\nDespite this, he agreed to represent a man in divorce proceedings after the latter met him in September 2019.\n\nSingh did not tell him that he had been struck off the rolls.\n\nBetween Sept 7 and 27, 2019, the man paid him $1,750. The following month, Singh sent the man a draft affidavit which the former lawyer had prepared, and it was later filed with the courts.\n\nAfterwards, Singh did not provide the man with any updates on the matter. On Jan 12, 2020, the man asked Singh for a full refund as he no longer wanted his services.\n\nSingh has since returned $1,000 to him, said DPP Yew.\n\nThe former lawyer's bail was set at $100,000 on Jan 25 and he is expected to surrender himself at the State Courts on Feb 15 to begin serving his sentence.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSINGAPORE LAWYERS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0ad9f4fd1abf1e17630afdd0a1cf9e74bc684a1c8319db6bfb28892976a51069/KELL094820copy.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Gurdaib Singh Pala Singh, 70, committed the offences between 2011 and 2016.", "caption": "Gurdaib Singh Pala Singh, 70, committed the offences between 2011 and 2016.

It is sealed and protected by diplomatic immunity and cannot be opened, searched or seized by Customs.\n\nOn Jan 19, 2023, Oh also allegedly lied to then MFA deputy secretary Ong Eng Chuan that the luxury watches in the package carried by Mr Loke into Singapore on Jan 17 that year belonged to Oh's father.\n\nOh's case was heard again on Jan 25, 2024, during which he applied to visit Tokyo from Jan 28 to Feb 20 for leisure.\n\nThe purpose of the trip is to explore and negotiate the possible sale and purchase of property in Tokyo, and to visit his pottery master, who is \"of old age and remains frail\", according to court records.\n\nOh also intends to visit his partner's family during the 24-day trip.\n\nDistrict Judge Brenda Tan granted the request on the condition that Oh provides an additional $10,000 bail on top of his current bail of the same amount.\n\nHe must also give his complete travel itinerary to the investigation officer before his departure, as well as details on where he will be staying and contact numbers.\n\nHe must surrender his passport to the officer within 24 hours upon his return.\n\nOh is represented by Mr Shashi Nathan and Ms Harjeet Kaur from Withers KhattarWong.\n\nHis case will be heard again on Feb 22.\n\nChristine Tan\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/eae877dcba3cf7e1cd37f6b53337eed74df6037364d03ac5ee5084475bdd214a/KELL851720copy.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Gilbert Oh Hin Kwan arriving at the State Courts on Jan 25.", "caption": "Gilbert Oh Hin Kwan arriving at the State Courts on Jan 25.

Soon after, Mr Boey left the bar to have supper with friends at a nearby restaurant while Lim waited for her husband at the bar.\n\nBut her anger did not subside - in fact, she got angrier after she told her husband what happened and wanted to confront the victim.

I've achieved my dream of being able to play in an LPGA Tour event, which is a big goal of mine.\n\n\"It's my first time, I'm anticipating it. It's a lot of emotions, I don't know how to put it into words.\"\n\nJust a year ago, Xingtong had watched some of the world's best golfers, including Thailand's world No. 10 Atthaya Thitikul, in action from outside the ropes.\n\nNow, she is relishing the opportunity to play alongside and learn from these LPGA stars.\n\n\"It'll be a great chance to be able to compare myself with them and learn how they play to improve my game,\" said the 1.72m competitive swimmer turned golfer, whose goal is to make the cut.\n\n\"It was great (to follow them in 2023) but now that I'm able to play on the course that day, it'll be a totally different experience.\"\n\nSingapore Golf Association assistant general manager Samuel Nee noted that Xingtong, who won her first international title at the Selangor Amateur Open golf championship in 2023, is a rare talent.\n\nHe said: \"Her ability to cut out things is good. She's able to get into the zone and focus.\n\n\"They were playing with tournament tees for the qualifiers so to be able to shoot a respectable even-par over two days speaks volumes because she has the length and the finesse around the greens.\n\n\"We're quite excited to see where she can go.\"\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nWomen's golf\n\nGolf tournaments\n\nGolf players\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nTop Money Market Funds in Singapore for Smarter Cash Management\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/239565cadf46d697c14a23a489e250b9b543fb0717c9f0f3887664f808717d07/2024012598440767446890d5-390b-4e59-b403-8deab167417e.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chen Xingtong shot a two-over 74 to card an even-par 144 total to finish four strokes ahead of her rivals.", "caption": "Chen Xingtong shot a two-over 74 to card an even-par 144 total to finish four strokes ahead of her rivals.

Isn't that all there is to say?

But when viewers click on the link, they are directed to a fake news story about Lim, 37, finding a \"new wealth loophole which he (sic) says can transform anyone into a millionaire within three to four months\".\n\nThe page, which mimics news website CNA, has links to a supposed crypto auto-trading programme called Bitcoin Future, which the scammers claim is the actress' No. 1 money-maker.\n\nIn the past few years, there have been many crypto trading scams that use unauthorised images and fabricated quotes of local personalities such as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\n\n,\n\nbusiness magnate Peter Lim and pop star JJ Lin.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nMore related stories\n\nCyber-security firm Group-IB published a study in 2020 on a series of similar scams \"fronted\" by well-known Singaporeans, and reported the pages to the Singapore Cyber Emergency Response Team.\n\nIn the case of the recently surfaced scam page with Rebecca Lim, an average person would find it harder to flag it to the authorities.\n\nIts displayed URL leads to a dummy website with an article about Lim's pregnancy, while its real URL is hidden in the codebase.\n\nTo retrieve the real URL, one must trawl through many lines of codes, which requires time and some expertise.\n\nMr Vladimir Kalugin, the operations director of digital risk protection at cyber-security firm Group-IB, told The Straits Times that scammers have been \"enhancing their evasion techniques to hide their campaigns from the authorities and conventional detection tools\".\n\nSome of them use website redirection or other methods to change the URL of a scam page without reloading its content.\n\nOthers use a camouflage technique called cloaking, where only targeted users are served the fraudulent and malicious content, while everyone else who visits the same page is served harmless content such as a 404 error page, said Mr Kalugin, who is based in Singapore.\n\nScammers have also learnt to prevent crawlers and other Internet bots from accessing their ad content, he added. This makes it harder for the pages to be detected by automated anti-scam tools.\n\n\"To counteract these techniques, authorities and cyber-security experts must work together to embrace advanced monitoring and takedown methods, and increase public awareness of potential online threats,\" Mr Kalugin said.\n\nSarah Koh\n\nINTERNET CRIMES AND SCAMS\n\nCYBER SECURITY\n\nactors\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 01:23am\n\n'Government officials' scammed at least $6.7m in June\n\nJul 1, 2025, 01:42am\n\nSingapore police can now control scam victims' bank accounts\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:36pm\n\nAt least 46 victims duped of $3 million in scam involving fake MAS officers and WhatsApp screen sharing\n\nJun 11, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nOver 1,000 malicious IP addresses in Singapore taken down in Interpol-led crackdown\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b70b2ba892e3099a8ed1c930d9ce9b67a063ffa142e381d9dca9296c4d3bc6a4/rebeccalim.PNG?w=965", "alt_text": "The scam page, which mimics CNA's website, falsely claims that Rebecca Lim endorses a bitcoin trading programme.", "caption": "The scam page, which mimics CNA's website, falsely claims that Rebecca Lim endorses a bitcoin trading programme.

I would pay every cent I've got to make James see again.\"\n\nJames added his central vision is \"blurry\", and that he has difficulty in seeing different colours and lights, although he retains good peripheral vision.\n\nGrowing up, James had hoped to follow Michael - who made his name at Liverpool - and grandfather Terry, who started his career at city rivals Everton, as a professional footballer.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 26, 2024, 08:52am\n\nVincent Kompany praises Bayern's 'outstanding mentality'\n\nMore related stories\n\nBut it was while playing the game that evidence of his condition emerged, with James starting to have difficulty following the ball and the movements of his teammates.\n\nThe condition is inherited, with Michael Owen saying he feared the consequences for James' adult life.\n\n\"As a parent you just want everything to be perfect - and he is - but of course it was a sad time,\" said the 44-year-old.\n\n\"Thinking about the future - will he be able to drive? Will he be able to work? All these things run through your mind.\"\n\nJames, however, said he had learned how to adapt to his condition after struggling with the initial diagnosis.\n\n\"I'll notice what colour my dad's jumper is,\" he said. \"So if I ever go out, then I would be able to recognise him from the colour, not from his face because I struggle with detail.\"\n\nMichael Owen added: \"He's just mentally very, very strong. He's got a great mindset. I've got four children and I'm probably the least worried about James' future.\"\n\nThe Owens will release a new documentary, Football Is For Everyone, via TNT Sports and Discovery Plus on January 30.\n\nIt will tell James' story and follow the visually impaired England futsal team as they compete at the 2023 World Cup in Birmingham. - AFP\n\nENGLAND FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nliverpool\n\nEUROPEAN FOOTBALL\n\nDISABILITIES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2024, 03:28am\n\nEngland eye end to long wait for Euros glory\n\nJul 7, 2024, 07:23pm\n\nEngland no longer fear football's death penalty\n\nJun 20, 2024, 09:05pm\n\nEngland are feeling Euro pressure after drab Denmark draw, says Southgate\n\nJun 14, 2024, 01:32am\n\n'Hungry' England 'want to make history', says captain Harry Kane\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow Much Is Enough to Retire in Singapore Comfortably?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/11296425f2f64e63dff8f798e9e353e01ab22772c7f498f66f6c0ab301ee76bd/2023-11-25T121044Z137365187UP1EJBP0XTU30RTRMADP3SOCCER-ENGLAND-MCI-LIV-REPORT.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Former England forward Michael Owen and his son James will release a new documentary on Jan 30 on the visually impaired England futsal team.", "caption": "Former England forward Michael Owen and his son James will release a new documentary on Jan 30 on the visually impaired England futsal team.

They have since filed salary-related claims with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM).\n\nIn a joint statement on Jan 24, spokespersons for the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and TADM said 37 Stickies employees have filed claims with TADM as at Jan 22.\n\nTADM has arranged for mediation sessions between the company and the affected employees on their claims, the joint statement added.\n\nStickies is a popular local bar in Singapore known for affordable drinks. According to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority, the directors of Stickies are Mr Norman Then and Mr Chong Sing Yong.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 05:04am\n\nAuthorities helping 29 Jollibean workers recover unpaid salaries\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn response to queries from ST, Mr Then said on Jan 24 that the bar has engaged insolvency practitioner Farooq Mann from Mann & Associates in the capacity of an interim judicial manager.\n\nMr Then added that this was to \"protect the going concerns of the business and to look out for the best interest of all the creditors, including the staff\".\n\nOn Jan 15, two of the bar's four outlets - in Aljunied and Keng Cheow Street - were closed with immediate effect, said Mr Calvin Chen, a part-timer at Stickies.\n\nThe 28-year-old added that prior to the closing of the outlets, Stickies had already started retrenching employees.\n\nAt the time of the interview on Jan 22, Mr Chen said Stickies' outlets in Dhoby Ghaut and Sunset Lane were still operating.\n\nHowever, Mr Then told ST on Jan 24 that only the Dhoby Ghaut outlet remains open, and did not provide further information on the one at Sunset Lane.\n\nMr Chen, who currently works full-time in administration, said that the majority of employees were not paid for the month of December.\n\nHe added that payment was supposed to come in on the 7th of every month, but since August 2023, delayed salary payments and wrong amounts of salaries credited had become the norm.\n\nExplaining the situation in December, an employee who wanted to be known only as Cel said Mr Then had said on Jan 11 that employees would receive their December salaries on Jan 15.\n\nHowever, when the day came, employees received a WhatsApp message that indicated that the company would be undergoing debt restructuring, or interim judicial management.\n\nMr Bryan Kuah, a 24-year-old part-timer at the company, said his pay came in two weeks late in September, and even then, he received only 10 per cent of his pay.\n\nHe added that the last time he had received his pay on time was in March 2023, and the last time he received his pay at all was in October.\n\n\"The delayed salary has affected me in my daily needs and spending as I am also a full-time student in university, and do not have much time to earn money for my monthly spending,\" said Mr Kuah.\n\nMs Joey Peh, Stickies' former marketing manager, told ST on Jan 22 that she resigned in December after months of not receiving her pay and CPF contributions on time.\n\n\"It was not just a one-off thing. It started to happen more frequently and that's when the red flags started popping up,\" Ms Peh said, adding that she had tried to raise this issue with higher management before she finally resigned.\n\nMs Peh said her entire team, as well as employees in maintenance, e-commerce and operations, was let go in the week of Jan 1, but was told to stay till Jan 15 with salaries promised.\n\nHowever, she has not received her pay.\n\n\"It's not just me, but many colleagues are actively chasing for their salaries,\" said Ms Peh, adding that she feels for them. \"Their families are suffering. It has been quite a hard time for them, especially for those who are the breadwinner of the family and do not come from financially stable households.\"\n\nAnother part-timer, a 22-year-old university student who wanted to be known only as Joby, said she also has not received her December salary, although the outlet she works at is still operating.\n\nShe told ST on Jan 22 that Stickies' human resources team advised employees to lodge a claim with TADM.\n\nIn a WhatsApp message seen by ST, an HR employee said that this was advice given directly by TADM and that it will \"ensure that the outstanding basic salary is paid and that there is a settlement between both parties\".\n\nOne 23-year-old former part-time employee, who wanted to be known only as Dara, said she had already filed two claims with TADM regarding salary issues, one in Dec 2023 and one in Jan 2024.\n\n\"I am mainly upset at the lack of accountability and transparency,\" said Ms Dara, who had worked at Stickies since 2020.\n\nShe said: \"I am most worried about my colleagues who are full-time and rely on this job for their expenses.\n\n\"Some of them are struggling mentally as this really affects their lives.\"\n\nTADM has directed the matter to MOM for investigations on possible breaches of the Employment Act, the TADM-MOM joint statement said.\n\n\"TADM and MOM have also been working closely to provide affected employees with assistance, including helping them with their salary recovery and linking them up with the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i) if they require employment facilitation,\" the statement said.\n\nBut for now, the affected employees are left in limbo, with no resolution in sight.\n\nMs Peh said: \"I have no choice but to move on and find a new job, but my colleagues and I will never stop fighting for the pay that we deserve.\"\n\nGabrielle Chan\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nemployers\n\nSingapore\n\nLABOUR ISSUES\n\nFOOD AND BEVERAGE SECTOR\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 2, 2025, 01:21am\n\nCertis scraps policy requiring staff on sick leave to share live location after union steps in\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:21am\n\nAttempted misuse of work pass for foreign students or trainees ongoing for years: Industry insiders\n\nJun 10, 2025, 04:24am\n\nMeasles immunity required for maids in households with young children from Sept 1\n\nJun 7, 2025, 03:34am\n\nMOM investigating alleged misuse of work passes meant for foreign students and trainees\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nMyCareersFuture\n\nSkills Or Experience?

Each offence resulted in six demerit points, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) said in a statement on Jan 23.\n\nIt was also fined a total of $6,000 in November 2022.\n\nLicence holders who rack up 12 or more demerit points in a year can have the licence suspended for either two weeks, four weeks or it could even get cancelled, SFA said.\n\nThe SFA statement said: \"All food handlers working in the suspended premises would also be required to re-attend and pass the Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) Food Safety Course Level 1 before they can resume work as food handlers.\n\n\"The licensee is also required to ensure that all food hygiene officers working in the suspended premises, if there are any, re-attend and pass the WSQ Food Safety Course Level 3.\"\n\nIn November 2023, KG Catering was found to have flouted a raft of food safety rules when 92 people came down with food poisoning after consuming food prepared between Sept 20, 2022, and March 11, 2023.\n\nIn addition to the fines and the latest suspension, SFA also issued an immediate suspension on the caterer's operations from Nov 9, 2022 to Feb 1, 2023 for offences linked to the same incident.\n\nThe SFA statement added that food operators need to observe good food and personal hygiene practices at all times, and to engage only registered food handlers.\n\nFirm action will be taken against anyone found to be in violation of the Environmental Public Health Act, SFA added.\n\nAnyone who spots breaches of the law can report the matter via\n\nwww.sfa.gov.sg/feedback\n\nor call SFA on 6805-2871.\n\nFatimah Mujibah\n\nSFA/SINGAPORE FOOD AGENCY\n\nFOOD HYGIENE/SAFETY\n\nFOOD AND DRINK\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9d34362e26c9c7a8b27c71dd2f23c6fa8ba3ac96ab776cead148ec7370cb9bc8/aafood250124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The caterer failed to keep licensed premises free of infestation and sale or preparation of food where food is likely to be contaminated.", "caption": "The caterer failed to keep licensed premises free of infestation and sale or preparation of food where food is likely to be contaminated.

The footfall at malls has been good and jewellery sales have been improving,\" he said.\n\nAlthough gold prices are on the high side currently, Datuk Ng, who is Tomei Consolidated's managing director, said consumers were still buying gold jewellery \"to fit their needs.\"\n\n\"People still buy gold for all kinds of occasions, such as for the coming festive season, weddings and birthdays,\" he added.\n\nMr Ng said he expected the sale of gold jewellery to pick up in February when more tourists from China visit Malaysia during their school holiday and spring break, thanks to the visa-free exemption granted to them by the Malaysian government.\n\n\"Our jewellery is still much cheaper in the region. Besides, tourists won't be taxed when shopping here. So when tourists come, they will certainly spend money at our malls and buy jewellery pieces,\" he added.\n\nMr Mohamad Shaifudeen Mohamed Sirajudeen, chief executive officer of SMS Deen Jewellers said there has been demand for gold jewellery for the Chinese New Year.\n\n\"We are going to usher in the Year of the Dragon and there will be weddings and newborns being welcomed. So we expect more demand as we move into the year,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said compared with the gold rush just before the Goods and Services Tax (GST) began in April 2015, there was \"no panic buying\" now.\n\nMr Mohamad Shaifudeen said the situation could change when the HVGT is confirmed.\n\n\"The price of gold is high now and its outlook is uncertain due to the ongoing geopolitical concerns. Consumers are looking for certainty in the market,\" he said.\n\nHabib group executive chairman Meer Habib concurred, saying that things would be clearer once the HVGT was finalised.\n\n\"Most people from the B40 and M40 groups still have gold as their investment preference and with this upcoming proposed tax, it will really affect them,\" he said, adding that he was hopeful that exemption could be given on gold.\n\nIn October, The Star reported that jewellery worth RM10,000 (S$2,834) and several other luxury items will be taxed at a rate of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent under the HVGT.\n\nDatuk Seri Meer said that the jewellery chain has also seen an increase in sales up to 15 per cent since last Christmas and school holidays.\n\nHe said that among the most popular products were gold and fine jewellery which included diamonds and other crafted jewellery.\n\n\"These items are mainly popular as consumers can keep them as both accessories and investment. They don't mind paying extra for the craftsmanship,\" he said.\n\nMalaysian Indian Goldsmith and Jewellers Association president Abdul Rasul Abdul Razak said even with the gold price being high now, there were still many \"passion buyers\" out there.\n\nHe said many bought gold jewellery not only during the festivities but also for as long-term investment. - THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nJEWELLERY/GEMSTONES\n\nmalaysia\n\nTAXATION\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4ccd433f90444c0020cc31bec8d05365d52999ea9245cbeb2cc228197a8b5f8a/Capture_19.PNG?w=965", "alt_text": "Jewellers say many would be aiming to buy gold earlier as the item is tipped to be included in the new HVGT list.", "caption": "Jewellers say many would be aiming to buy gold earlier as the item is tipped to be included in the new HVGT list.

A sensational six-in-a-row springboarded the son of Dundeel as one of the early favourites to the Singapore Four-Year-Old Challenge in 2023, but he went amiss.\n\nThe rot set in at his first shot at glory. On May 20, he ran unplaced in the Group 1 Kranji Mile (1,600m), which was meant to be the prelude to those 4YO riches.\n\nA high suspensory curtailed those lofty plans, leaving connections wondering if he would have tested eventual Singapore Derby winner Golden Monkey.\n\nAmazingly, they were given a chance to get an answer at Street Of Dreams' comeback in a Class 1 race (1,200m) on Jan 20. Golden Monkey was in the line-up.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nNeither won in the end, with Silent Is Gold refusing to buckle all the way to the line, while receiving 8.5kg from Golden Monkey, the runner-up.\n\nStreet Of Dreams momentarily loomed as a threat when he swung out the widest for Manoel Nunes, but the last 200m lacked the firepower of his \"six-shooter\".\n\nBurridge thought the run was still full of merit, though.\n\n\"Street Of Dreams had eight months off. He put on some weight, though I'm not so sure about the 17kg increase,\" he said.\n\n\"I said all along that whatever he did from that first race, he would improve from it.\n\n\"Maybe he didn't like the soft track, and the outside barrier (10) didn't help either. He was pushed wide at the turn.\n\n\"He's pulled up good and we'll now set him for the Fortune Bowl (over 1,400m on Feb 11), and maybe the Committee's Prize a month later (over 1,600m on March 9).\"\n\nAfter being shelved for a few years during Covid-19, both Group 3 events have been reinstated for one last hurrah in Singapore's final racing season.\n\nWith Nunes committed to Super Salute for the Fortune Bowl, Burridge had been making a few phone calls in search of another rider.\n\nThe veteran Australian trainer has yet to secure a name, but is confident it will not take too long.\n\n\"I first approached jockey Blaike McDougall through (ex-Kranji trainer) Brian Dean's brother Colin Dean, who's a valet in Melbourne,\" said Burridge.\n\n\"They told me he was a good jockey. I was keen to give him a try.\n\n\"At first, he said he would come, but he then took a ride in the Hobart Cup on the same day.\n\n\"So, that didn't work out. I've got a few other names, but until now, I'm still fishing around.\"\n\nOne hoop whose arm he did not have to twist to get back on his Jan 27 runner Makin is Manoel Nunes.\n\nThe five-time Singapore champion jockey only got off at the Written Tycoon four-year-old's last two starts when Burridge put 2kg claimer Yusoff Fadzli on to shave some weight off his big imposts.\n\nThe 2022 Singapore champion apprentice jockey did not lose marks with two second placings, including the last one in the last race of 2023 on Dec 30, when he beat all but the promising Silo.\n\nWith Makin rising in class in the $70,000 Class 3 race (1,400m), a claimer was no more necessary.\n\nBesides the more favourable 53kg, Burridge was also pleased with the lower draw in barrier No. 4 (compared to 12 at his last start).\n\nThere is still one major hurdle to overcome, though - his last-start nemesis Silo.\n\n\"He's up in class, and Silo is hard to beat again. There's not much pull in weights between the two since they last met when Silo beat him - 1½ kg for a 2½-length beating.\n\n\"But he's got a nice weight and he's at least drawn in this time. Last time he drew wide and had to settle at the rear.\"\n\nBurridge is also saddling the resuming Lim's Craft. To be ridden by A'Isisuhairi Kasim, the rising nine-year-old has his job cut out, but his trainer remained upbeat.\n\n\"Lim's Craft will be at his first 2024 race,\" he said.\n\n\"He hasn't raced since Dec 9 because there were no races for him. I didn't want to run him on the Polytrack.\n\n\"He trialled well last week, he ran second to Red Dot. He's drawn barrier No. 1, so fingers crossed.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There was certainly nothing shabby about the trio.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nTogether with newcomer Boardroom, they lined up well and jumped cleanly - except for that other newcomer, Talkintalkintiger, who was slow out of the gates and stayed in last place for all of the journey.\n\nBut there were excuses, Talkintalkintiger was still in the \"education phase\" and learning the ropes.\n\nNot so Ace Of Diamonds and Laksana.\n\nThey knew what it was all about. So too did their riders.\n\nVlad Duric, with all of his experience, was entrusted with the reins on Ace Of Diamonds while A'Isisuhairi Kasim's job was to steer home Laksana.\n\nSo it was, Duric kept Ace Of Diamonds right on the tail of early frontrunner Boardroom.\n\nAnother one having an ORT, Boardroom had Bruno Queiroz doing the navigating and they looked good - for 800m, at least.\n\nAs the trial progressed, there was no change in the order. Boardroom, the grey colt from Ricardo Le Grange's yard held a slim lead over his stablemate Ace Of Diamonds.\n\nLaksana remained in close attendance.\n\nInto the final stretch and with a furlong to travel, Duric released the brakes on Ace Of Diamonds and the Swiss Ace three-year-old quickly ate into Boardroom's lead before holding off a challenge from Laksana.\n\nAce Of Diamonds went on to take the trial by three parts of a length with Boardroom holding down third spot.\n\nIt was a good showing from the newcomer, a Justify three-year-old, who was having his third trial after beating his rivals in his second trial on Nov 7.\n\nIncidentally, Boardroom and Ace Of Diamonds share one other thing in common.\n\nAside from being prepared for the races by Le Grange, they both race in the silks of owner Leonardo Jr Morales Javier.\n\nBack to the trial winner, Ace Of Diamonds, who clocked 1min 0.27sec for the trip. He is a galloper going places.\n\nThrice already - and only from six race starts - he had come out on top.\n\nFrom that runaway 3½-length win in the Restricted ranks on Sept 23, he went on to take the honours in a Novice event over the 1,400m on grass.\n\nThat was on Nov 11 and, among the horses he beat that day were Silo and Black Storm. The latter won a race just recently, on Jan 20.\n\nHe then went on to win a Class 4 sprint, beating Makin by a short head over the 1,400m.\n\nThere is much more to Ace Of Diamonds than what we have seen so far and his rivals in his next race should be very afraid.\n\nLaksana, who held down second spot, is a last-start winner.\n\nTrainer Stephen Gray has nursed the seven-year-old along patiently and to ignore him is to do so at your own peril.\n\nAfter lying dormant for more than a year, he, like an angry volcano, erupted on Dec 30 when winning a Class 5 contest over the 1,800m.\n\nThe handicappers sent him up to Class 4 and he was to run in that Class 4 contest over the 1,800m on Jan 27.\n\nBut Gray decided otherwise and pulled him out of the race.\n\nStill, keep an eye on him and do not be shy having a saver on him the next time he comes under starter's orders. His trial tells us that he will carry form into that race.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f60b2b852da70609a2983e43949e664312d75be8f2ac38b42357eebab31233af/bmtrials25.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ace Of Diamonds (Vlad Duric) finishing the best on the outside to beat Laksana (A'Isisuhairi Kasim) and unraced grey Boardroom (Bruno Queiroz) at the Jan 23 barrier trials.\n", "caption": "Ace Of Diamonds (Vlad Duric) finishing the best on the outside to beat Laksana (A'Isisuhairi Kasim) and unraced grey Boardroom (Bruno Queiroz) at the Jan 23 barrier trials.

I want to start a movement, a shower eating movement… it's going to be such a huge relief for people who are multitasking,\" Biel said.\n\nOne of the tips include having a ledge. \"You can stick your cup, your yogurt container, your coffee, your espresso, whatever it is you're enjoying,\" she explained.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I like to take a bite or a sip and put it on the ledge... it's pretty simple guys, you can do this.

Do not let the shower water in.\"\n\nHer latest TikTok video has garnered more than 141,000 views and more than 230 comments since it was posted on the platform.\n\nIn December 2023, Biel shared her favourite shower-eating food items, such as cereal or yogurt, popsicles, coffee and tea, in a \"Food for thought\" TikTok video.\n\nThe actress first revealed her strange eating habit in 2017 on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.\n\nShe had told host Fallon that being a new mother to a two-year-old meant she needed to manage her time efficiently.

That gives it the right to also lay claim to the creation of the dish, it argues.\n\nDaryaganj shared with Reuters a faded, hand-written partnership document registered in 1949 to back its argument.\n\nThe dispute has captured India's attention, with Indian TV broadcasters running segments on the history of the dish and debate raging on social media.\n\n\"It's an offbeat, unique case. You really don't know who created the first dish of butter chicken. The court will be hard pressed and will need to rely on circumstantial evidence,\" said Mr Ameet Datta, an intellectual property lawyer at India's Saikrishna & Associates.\n\nTestimonies of people who can link the brand to the dish they consumed decades ago could be critical proof, Mr Datta added.\n\nMade with tandoor-cooked chicken pieces mixed in a tomato gravy with dollops of cream and butter, the dish was ranked 43rd in a list of the world's \"best dishes\" by TasteAtlas as rated by nearly 400,000 users.\n\nIt was the second-ranked Indian food after butter garlic naan bread. The two are often paired together.\n\nThe case was first heard by the Delhi High Court last week, and the next hearing is scheduled for May. - REUTERS\n\nINDIAN FOOD\n\nIndia\n\nCOPYRIGHT/INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nRESTAURANTS/EATERIES\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 11, 2025, 11:57pm\n\nBrainless but still good, piping chapati\n\nJul 5, 2024, 06:25am\n\n30 different ways to fill a samosa\n\nDec 8, 2023, 07:14am\n\nBangladeshi man sends family photo of food before meals\n\nDec 22, 2022, 07:05am\n\nChicken tikka masala inventor dies aged 77\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Hopefully we can compete at a higher level than the results we have seen in recent times. We've been there before in our history. And our aim collectively as one Team Singapore is hopefully to replicate conditions to get back there again.\"\n\nWhile a long term ambition under UTR is for the Lions to qualify for the 2034 World Cup, results in the interim have not made for good reading. Fans have also grown disillusioned with poor results and a lack of identity in the various national teams.\n\nThe Republic lost 4-1 to Malaysia at the Asean Football Federation Championship in January 2023 and suffered an early exit from the tournament. Months later in May, the Under-22 team were thrashed 7-0 by their Causeway rivals in a disastrous Cambodia SEA Games campaign which then led to the squad being withdrawn from the Hangzhou Asian Games.\n\nAmong other criticisms of UTR has been the project's slow start. It was announced in March 2021 and the first significant move was in July 2022 when the Schools Football Academy programme was launched with 10 schools.\n\nA year later, the inaugural batch of eight teenage footballers were awarded overseas scholarships shortly after the Junior Development (for those eight to 12) and National Development Centres (13 to 16) for promising youths was set up.\n\nGoh said: \"These are the pieces. And hopefully in a few years, we start to see more support and more interests, and it will then translate into more success on the pitch.\"\n\nSu insisted UTR \"is on track\" and said: \"It is a long term plan...Of course, it takes a longer time for the entire fruits to come to bear.\"\n\nHe added: \"Everyone wants to see winning teams. Everyone wants our senior Lions or Young Lions to be competitive. If we are going on this long journey and we are seeing signs of improvement, we have got to support our Lions...\n\n\"We cannot be giving them wet blankets and demoralize them. We need to be together. And as I said, in another three to five years, if we do this collectively as one… I'm pretty sure that everyone will share the collective fruits of this journey.\"\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nSingapore Football\n\nSport Singapore\n\nFAS/FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION OF SINGAPORE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 10, 2025, 10:45pm\n\nLions survive late onslaught to claim first win of Asian Cup third-round qualifiers\n\n3\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:01pm\n\nLion City Sailors retain Singapore Cup to cement domestic dominance\n\nMay 18, 2025, 11:06pm\n\nLion City Sailors denied at final hurdle as Sharjah FC clinch AFC Champions League Two title\n\nMay 17, 2025, 11:16pm\n\nACL2 trophy is 'something beautiful to fight for', says Lion City Sailors' Hariss Harun\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

this article\n\nA total of 119 people aged between 17 and 72 are being investigated for their suspected involvement in unlicensed moneylending activities.\n\nThis followed a five-day islandwide operation from Jan 15 to 19 by officers from the Criminal Investigation Department and the seven police divisions, the police said in a statement on Jan 24.\n\nPreliminary investigations show that 11 people had allegedly caused harassment at debtors' residences, and 35 people are believed to be runners who had helped unlicensed moneylending businesses carry out ATM transfers.\n\nThe remaining 73 individuals are believed to have opened bank accounts and provided their ATM cards, personal identification numbers or Internet banking tokens to unlicensed moneylenders to facilitate their businesses.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing, said the police.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 05:24am\n\nJail, caning for immigration offender who gave $36k in bribes\n\nMore related stories\n\nUnder the Moneylenders' Act, when a bank account, ATM card or Internet banking token of any person is used to facilitate unlicensed moneylending, that person is presumed to have helped the process.\n\nFirst-time offenders found guilty of the offence of carrying on or assisting in a business of unlicensed moneylending can be jailed for up to four years, fined between $30,000 and $300,000, and given up to six strokes of the cane.\n\nThose found guilty of acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender to commit or attempt to commit any acts of harassment can be jailed for up to five years, fined between $5,000 and $50,000, and punished with three to six strokes of the cane.\n\n\"The police will continue to take tough enforcement action against those involved in the unlicensed moneylending business, regardless of their roles, and ensure that they face the full brunt of the law,\" the statement said.\n\n\"This includes taking action against those who open or give away their bank accounts to aid unlicensed moneylenders.\"\n\nUnlicensed moneylenders are increasingly using text messaging or online platforms to send unsolicited loan advertisements, the police added.\n\nMembers of the public are reminded not to reply or respond to such advertisements and to report these messages as spam.\n\nThey are also advised to stay away from unlicensed moneylenders and not to work with or assist them in any way.\n\nThe public can call 999 or the X-Ah Long hotline on 1800-924-5664 if they suspect or know of anyone who could be involved in unlicensed moneylending

He had no plans to conduct any attacks in Singapore.\n\nHe is the second Singaporean to be dealt with under the ISA for being radicalised by far-right extremist ideologies, said the Internal Security Department (ISD) on Jan 24. The first youth, now 19, was released from detention in January after close to three years.\n\nFor the 16-year-old, the restriction order means he must comply with several conditions. These include not being allowed to change his residence or travel out of Singapore, access the Internet or social media and issue public statements, without the approval of the director of ISD.\n\n\"At the point of (the) investigation, he strongly identified as a white supremacist and pro-white sympathiser, and hoped to be recruited for violent attacks by white supremacist groups overseas to 'fight for the whites',\" said ISD.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 2, 2025, 09:39am\n\nTeen ISIS bride wannabe issued restriction order; first female teen dealt with under ISA\n\nMore related stories\n\nExplaining how the 16-year-old became radicalised, ISD said he had chanced upon videos by foreign far-right political commentator and white supremacist Paul Nicholas Miller and was exposed to violent extremist material online in 2022.\n\nMiller advocates for a race war and has been tied to multiple far-right extremist organisations overseas, including the Proud Boys and the Boogaloo movement.\n\nBy early 2023, the youth had developed an intense hatred of communities targeted by far-right extremists, including African Americans, Arabs and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals.\n\nHe believed African Americans were responsible for a significant percentage of crime in the US, and deserved to \"die a horrible death\", said ISD.\n\nThe youth also perceived illegal Arab immigrants as having committed violent attacks against white populations in Western countries and subscribed to the Great Replacement Theory commonly referenced by far-right terrorists like Christchurch attacker Brenton Tarrant. The theory propagates that the indigenous white population in Western countries are in danger of being replaced by non-white immigrants.\n\nSuch ethno-nationalist beliefs convinced him that non-white communities such as African Americans and Arabs should be driven away from white-majority countries, said ISD.\n\nThe youth participated in far-right online chat groups and channels, where he shared violent anti-African American videos, as doing so gave him a sense of belonging to the white supremacist community.\n\nHe considered travelling to Western countries such as France, Italy, the US and Russia to participate in attacks against the vilified communities, and also expressed interest in a far-right online chat group to conduct a mass shooting in the US in 10 years' time. However, ISD said he did not take steps to actualise his attack aspirations beyond searching online for weapons, because he lacked the money and know-how to do so.\n\nThe youth had not planned to conduct attacks in Singapore as he felt these communities had not caused trouble here, said ISD.\n\nWhile on a restriction order, the youth will have to undergo a rehabilitation programme aimed at countering the violent extremist ideologies he had imbibed online. It will help him learn that his racial supremacist views are incompatible with Singapore's multi-racial and multi-religious society, ISD said.\n\nHe will receive counselling by ISD psychologists to address his propensity for violence and the factors that make him vulnerable to radical influences. Such factors include the regulation of his emotions and identity issues, which fuelled his desire to identify as a white supremacist and be part of a like-minded, seemingly powerful group.\n\nISD case officers will work with his family and school to ensure that he has sufficient support. He has also been assigned two mentors who will provide him with guidance and cyber-wellness skills.\n\nISD said it is working with partners such as the Inter-Agency Aftercare Group to explore community-based programmes which will equip him with pro-social skills.\n\nWith two youths here radicalised by far-right extremist ideology, ISD said there is a need to remain vigilant.\n\n\"Far-right ideologies, which often espouse white supremacist, anti-Islam, xenophobic and anti-immigration beliefs, can be adapted to fit the Singaporean landscape. One example is by advocating for the superiority of specific communities, through the lens of cultural, ethnoreligious, or nationalist supremacy,\" it added.\n\nISD said that such divisive rhetoric can create deep societal divides, amplify prejudices, and encourage acts of violence against minorities.\n\nIt urged members of the public to be vigilant to signs that others have become radicalised.\n\nThese signs include frequently surfing radical websites; posting extremist views on social media platforms; sharing extremist views with friends and relatives; making remarks that promote ill-will or hatred towards people of other races or religions; expressing intent to participate in acts of violence overseas or in Singapore and inciting others to participate in acts of violence.\n\nThose who suspect a person has been radicalised can call the ISD Counter-Terrorism Centre hotline on 1800-2626-473 (1800-2626-ISD).\n\nJean Iau\n\nCorrespondent\n\nINTERNAL SECURITY ACT\n\nFar right\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 10, 2025, 06:29am\n\nStudent, housewife dealt with by ISD\n\nJan 9, 2025, 06:29am\n\nISD detains 3 self-radicalised men who made preparations to fight overseas\n\nNov 22, 2024, 06:04am\n\nS'pore woman under probe for suspected terrorism-related activities\n\nJul 15, 2024, 02:04pm\n\nSelf-radicalised S'porean teen, 14, given ISA restriction orders\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/de7baf459200ed545d44909505056c8309ce2e45d733c118d4277da36aec367c/mha.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The 16-year-old aspired to conduct attacks overseas to further the white supremacist cause, and had no plans to conduct any attacks in Singapore.", "caption": "The 16-year-old aspired to conduct attacks overseas to further the white supremacist cause, and had no plans to conduct any attacks in Singapore.

The police were alerted on Jan 18 afternoon to an assault at a residential unit in Serangoon Central.\n\nOn Jan 24, a handcuffed Yong, wearing a grey T-shirt, attended the court hearing via video-link. He appeared calm throughout court proceedings.\n\nThrough a Mandarin interpreter, he told the court he did not commit the crime and did not sign the \"charge\".\n\nThe police prosecutor said investigations are ongoing, and clarified that the document he refused to sign was a cautioned statement. A cautioned statement is recorded from a person after he is charged with, or informed that he may be prosecuted for, an offence.\n\nYong also asked the police if he could see his mother.\n\nThe prosecutor replied: \"Obviously no, because she is the victim for this case.\"\n\nDistrict Judge Brenda Tan asked the police prosecutor about the condition of Yong's mother, to which the prosecutor said: \"At the moment, I believe it's not life-threatening.\"\n\nAs the proceedings came to an end, Yong asked again if he could see his mother. The prosecutor rejected this second request.\n\nThe prosecutor asked that Yong be remanded at Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre (CMC) for a medical examination.\n\nThis is to determine whether Yong is suffering from any abnormality of mind that may have impaired his mental responsibility regarding the act, said the prosecutor.\n\nThe judge said that Yong may wish to state his case to the investigation officer. She granted the prosecutor's request for him to be remanded at CMC for three weeks.\n\nHis case will be heard again on Feb 14.\n\nIf convicted of attempted murder, Yong faces life imprisonment and caning. He can be also jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned, or both.\n\nChristine Tan\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nMURDER/MANSLAUGHTER\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/52202035aa88ef458cc48fbf9913634938fcaf3e13176a0bce0d413ea6d4fd79/gavelscales.png?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Providers should also differentiate between minor and major emergencies, which will then guide the organisation's response and measures according to the severity and impact of incidents.\n\nThe guide also states that there should be specific roles and responsibilities assigned to individuals in providers' emergency action plans. For instance, an activity leader ought to assume ground leadership, cease the activity and report the incident, among other steps.\n\nThe announcement of these guidelines comes after the death of 15-year-old Jethro Puah Xin Yang, who fell from a high-element course on Feb 3, 2021, at Safra Yishun during a school activity organised by Camelot, an outdoor adventure learning company.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nNov 2, 2024, 12:11am\n\nOver 10,000 S'pore Poly students to get mentorship opportunities\n\nMore related stories\n\nMuhammad Nurul Hakim Mohamed Din, 23, the volunteer outdoor activities facilitator who failed to do a physical check on Jethro's harness,\n\nwas sentenced to six months in jail on Jan 16.\n\nIn addition, a compulsory set of guidelines to address safety in OAE activities is being developed and will be available for public feedback in the second half of 2024. It is expected to be published by 2025.\n\nUpon completion, this national standard for OAE activities will spell out the expected level of care of safety to be practised by activity instructors, and their accountabilities when conducting such activities - land-based, water-based and height activities.\n\nKey stakeholders such as the Institute of Technical Education and Outward Bound Singapore are among the 17 organisational representatives that have been working together with the OAE council to develop these guidelines.\n\nCurrently, OAE providers and instructors offering height-based activities to students need to implement the Ministry of Education's (MOE's) enhanced safety measures, which were published in November 2022.\n\nBy the first quarter of 2025, the OAE sector can expect support to build their skills through a workforce development road map. It will outline the specific job scopes, prerequisites and possibilities for career progression within the OAE sector.\n\nElisha Tushara\n\nCorrespondent\n\nNATIONAL YOUTH COUNCIL\n\nEducation\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 27, 2023, 04:30am\n\nSharing stories to help young people with mental health struggles\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Consumers also complained of discomfort, swelling and itchiness after the treatment.\n\nThe salon had offered to provide refunds to some dissatisfied consumers, but did not honour the agreement, according to Case.\n\nFollowing the complaints, Case invited the salon to sign a Voluntary Compliance Agreement to stop unfair practices and compensate affected customers, but the salon did not do so.\n\nCase said it is now engaging the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore to consider further action against the company.\n\nCase president Melvin Yong also advises consumers to conduct research and look up reviews to gain insight on the standards and track record of beauty salons before making purchases.\n\nConsumers should be wary of products and services marketed as special discounts, trials or one-time only offers. Should consumers feel uncomfortable or uneasy during sales pitches made by staff members, they should stop any ongoing sessions and leave the salon.\n\nConsumers are also advised to patronise CaseTrust-accredited salons which are not allowed to engage in sales pitches during treatments. These salons also offer a five-day cooling-off period for consumers to seek a refund for unutilised services, should they decide not to proceed with the package signed.\n\nThose who have disputes with Diva Lash & Nails may contact Case at 6277-5100 or visit its\n\nwebsite\n\nfor assistance.\n\nKolette Lim\n\nBEAUTY INDUSTRY\n\nCCCS/Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\n\nMALLS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 11, 2025, 11:49pm\n\nBarber shop boss gives free haircuts to seniors and the disabled\n\nFeb 21, 2025, 11:54pm\n\nPopular local brand Skin Inc under fire for abrupt Ion store closure\n\nNov 30, 2024, 11:07pm\n\nHair salons in Geylang offer more than haircut and head massage\n\nSep 28, 2024, 01:16pm\n\n80-year-old granny a finalist at Miss Universe Korea pageant\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f9706ad796c991c59eb9e2472877a61b3c184aec963ce59de0ae4d8020f9e2f8/aidivalash240124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "In 2022 and 2023,  89 complaints were lodged against Diva Lash & Nails, located on the second floor of the mall. ", "caption": "In 2022 and 2023,  89 complaints were lodged against Diva Lash & Nails, located on the second floor of the mall.

He allegedly forged financial statements of NGHG in 2019, and used them to obtain bank loans amounting to $18 million.\n\nOn Jan 24, Loh was handed the 58 new charges and now faces 60 charges in total.\n\nAccording to the new charges, Loh conspired with his employee Wong Soon Yuh, to cheat six banks into believing that audits were performed for NGHG, Novena Global Healthcare, and wine trading and distribution company Giron, thus dishonestly inducing the banks to disburse loans to these firms.\n\nGiron is now defunct. Loh's ex-wife, Lee Chai Hoon, was a director and shareholder.\n\nThe alleged cheating offences took place in July 2019, and involved Maybank, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, DBS, UOB and HSBC.\n\nThe loans disbursed by each bank ranged from $1.5 million to US$12.7 million (S$17 million), totalling about $69 million.\n\nLoh allegedly transferred multiple sums out of Novena Global Healthcare's accounts to other accounts. He faces 48 charges of transferring the benefits of his criminal conduct.\n\nWong, also known as Michael, 44, was handed 12 more charges on Jan 24 relating to forgery, cheating and transferring sums which he had reasonable grounds to believe were benefits from another person's criminal conduct.\n\nThe two men, who have both been remanded for over a year, appeared in court via video-link.\n\nAppearing gaunt in white prison attire, they did not speak during court proceedings except to confirm their names.\n\nThey had left Singapore and went on the run in early September 2020 amid business troubles.\n\nWithin days of their departure, the police received a report that signatures of accounting firm Ernst & Young had been forged on some NGHG financial statements.\n\nA warrant of arrest and an Interpol red notice were later issued against them. The notice is a request to law enforcement units worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or other legal action.\n\nThe police earlier said: \"With the cooperation and assistance of our foreign counterparts in the People's Republic of China, the two men returned to Singapore on Dec 24, 2022, and were arrested by the Commercial Affairs Department on the same day.\"\n\nTheir cases are scheduled for a pre-trial conference on Feb 1.\n\nThose convicted of committing forgery, intending for the document forged to be used for cheating, can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nThe offence of cheating carries a penalty of a jail term for up to 10 years and a fine.\n\nThose who transfer benefits from their criminal conduct, or property which one has reasonable grounds to believe that it is another person's benefits from criminal conduct, can be fined up to $500,000 or jailed for up to 10 years or to both.\n\nChristine Tan\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nCOUNTERFEITS/FORGERY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

There were two reported dengue deaths from April to June, and one from July to September.\n\nIn 2022, Singapore recorded 19 dengue deaths amid a total of 32,325 dengue cases, with the latter the second-highest number in a year on record. In 2021, five dengue deaths were recorded.\n\nLocal dengue cases have also risen for the seventh consecutive week, with 410 cases recorded from Jan 14 to Jan 20, according to the NEA website.\n\nThere were 305 reported cases between Dec 31, 2023, and Jan 6, 2024, and 395 between Jan 7 and Jan 13.

The Boon Lay Place cluster is the biggest with 216 cases, followed by 119 in the Pasir Ris Street 71 cluster.\n\nDengue typically peaks between June and October because of warmer weather, faster multiplication of the virus in mosquitoes and accelerated development of the mosquitoes.\n\nNEA had said previously that Singapore could see a large number of dengue cases in 2024, attributing it to warmer weather due to El Nino - a climate pattern associated with the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean.\n\nWarmer weather caused by El Nino will make it more conducive for mosquitoes to breed, and this may extend the usual dengue peak period that falls between July and October, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment Baey Yam Keng said last October.\n\nIn an earlier Straits Times report, experts said the wet weather in January could lead to a drop in dengue cases, as heavy rain could cause a flushing effect and wash away mosquito larvae.\n\nNEA urged those living in areas with dengue clusters to do their part to stop dengue transmission, and to cooperate with its officers when they inspect properties for mosquito larvae.\n\nThe agency also advised the public to protect themselves from Aedes mosquitoes by using insect repellent, among other methods.\n\nGabrielle Chan\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nDengue fever\n\nmosquito\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 2, 2025, 11:39pm\n\nExpect warm and humid nights in first half of June\n\nMay 26, 2025, 12:19am\n\nAlmost 2,000 dengue cases in Singapore so far in 2025, 74% drop from 2024\n\nMay 23, 2025, 03:52am\n\nJail for man who obtained $900 in bribes from 3 cleaning firm staff when he was an NEA inspector\n\nMay 5, 2025, 06:20am\n\nFlash floods in Holland, Bukit Timah amid heavy downpour\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nParents in Singapore Swear by These Chemistry Tutor TIps\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ca77714b3484e4029a72b5b3537cd936175004e0cc548bf6ebb9e0c00e13d8dc/IMGdengue11N547DJO_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Dengue typically peaks between June and October because of warmer weather.", "caption": "Dengue typically peaks between June and October because of warmer weather.

But she stuck with it and even switched from competitive swimming to golf after deciding to pursue it more seriously a year later.\n\nIn 2020, she joined the Singapore Golf Association's (SGA) future squad comprising selected junior golfers who have done well at its junior events, and made the junior squad the following year.\n\nXingtong said she enjoys golf because \"we're not really competing with other people, we're just trying to minimise mistakes\", adding that \"as long as you play well, you have a fighting chance\".\n\nShe noted: \"It's not like head-to-head kind of competition. You don't know how other people are playing unless you're keeping track, so you can focus on yourself - it appeals to me more.\"\n\nThe teenager's sporting career had initially begun in swimming, but she decided to make the switch owing to the demanding training schedule - from Primary 1 to 3 she had to juggle daily training sessions with her studies and Chinese dance co-curricular activity.\n\nHer training regimen is no less intensive now, but golf holds a different appeal.\n\nSuch is her dedication to the sport that she transferred from Bukit Panjang Government High School midway through Secondary 1 to enrol at the Singapore Sports School, as the latter offered a programme that would allow her to focus on both golf and studies.\n\nThe Secondary 4 student said: \"In golf, there's a lot more of a mental aspect to it, like practice. Because you have to learn how to deal with pressure in a tournament situation.\"\n\nThis season, she is hoping to build on a confidence-boosting maiden international win at the Selangor Amateur Open golf championship in 2023. On Jan 24 and 25, she will compete in the national qualifying tournament for the HSBC Women's World Championship at Sentosa Golf Club, which will stage the tournament proper from Feb 29 to March 3.\n\nXingtong, who is part of a field of nine, said: \"There are a lot of top pros playing, so it'll be a good learning experience for me. For example, if they make a wrong shot or miss a putt, I'll be able to watch and learn how they recover from such setbacks and hopefully be able to incorporate their techniques into my own game as well.\"\n\nAnother golfer eyeing a spot in the US$1.8 million (S$2.4 million) competition is 12-year-old Aamiya Koul, whose love for the game began when she was about four.\n\nUnlike Xingtong, Aamiya hails from a family of golfers - her father introduced her to it and she learnt by hitting balls with a plastic club into a net at her condominium.\n\nWhen she was six, she finished 13th at her first competition and the disappointment motivated her to improve.\n\nThe Singapore American School pupil said: \"I enjoy the competitiveness and the luck involved in the game... I like being able to win.\"\n\nThis fierce desire to win is evident in other aspects of Aamiya's life, particularly when she plays basketball with her club.\n\nIt has also propelled her to victories on the international stage. In December 2023, she won the US Kids Golf Indian Championship title to earn a spot at the 2024 US Kids Golf World Championship.\n\nThe HSBC tournament will be special for Aamiya, who has watched every edition on the course since 2015.\n\nShe said: \"It's cool to be able to play with all the pros. Playing the qualifiers would be a great experience. I want to learn from all the better people playing, like all the pros and top amateurs.\"\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nWomen's golf\n\nGolf tournaments\n\nGolf players\n\nLPGA Tour\n\nHSBC\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5b382798a0b7a0f6a6240f48cc6385bcb4decd510121245af9d73c661021d1d9/Chen20Xingtong20-20Ng20Sor20Luan.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Singaporean golfer Chen Xingtong, 15, used to be a competitive swimmer before getting into golf.", "caption": "Singaporean golfer Chen Xingtong, 15, used to be a competitive swimmer before getting into golf.

Co-developed by the Singapore Food Agency and food solutions provider Sats, the halal meals will use some locally grown bayam (spinach) and abalone mushrooms.\n\nThe three meal options - baked fish with chunky tomato, vegetable ragout, and makhani chicken with briyani rice - are all halal, with the latter two seeking to encourage flexibility in food choices by using plant-based seafood and frozen chicken.\n\nThe distribution of RTE meals to selected secondary schools is the second phase of a pilot programme, following an earlier phase in October 2023 that involved 2,800 students and teachers across 10 secondary schools.\n\nApart from schools, some businesses and organisations here will also be involved in the simulated civil emergency.\n\nAmong them is South Beach Consortium, which will switch off its water features and close off some toilets at South Beach Tower in Beach Rd. Power to air-conditioners and selected lifts and escalators will also be shut off to simulate power cuts.\n\nSome of its tenants will also participate, with the JW Marriott Hotel to carry out limited disruptions to water supply and take part in a food distribution exercise.\n\nTwo of its tenant businesses, consultancy Bain and Company and financial firm Intesa Sanpaolo, will be among 21 organisations conducting a simulated phishing exercise during the period to test cyber-security awareness and weak links in their security posture.\n\nThe organisations will use playbooks launched by the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, which have detailed instructions on how to simulate a phishing exercise on enterprise software, and teach their employees how to spot cyber threats.\n\nMeanwhile, 20 buildings in the civic district will conduct a simulated blackout on Feb 15 by switching off their facade lighting.\n\nThe public can also experience how selected MRT stations can be turned into civil defence shelters during emergencies. The Singapore Civil Defence Force and Land Transport Authority will organise civil defence shelter open houses at Dakota, Potong Pasir and Tan Kah Kee MRT stations on Feb 23, between 10am and 4pm.\n\nIndividual members of the public can turn up to participate, but larger groups of 20 or more will have to\n\nmake a reservation online\n\n.\n\nMike Yeo\n\nCorrespondent\n\nSAF\n\nministry of defence\n\nCivil defence\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 8, 2025, 11:00am\n\nNDP 2025: Tank that bumped into traffic light had faulty part\n\nJul 6, 2025, 06:10am\n\nNDP National Education show: Tank collides into traffic light\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:09am\n\nFather and son to lead NDP 2025 mobile column to celebrate commitment to defence across generations\n\nJun 17, 2025, 02:45am\n\nMan hit by bullet in restricted area near SAF live-firing exercise\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/45bcee3cd47ec6f217f2bb466843fdf3b9f90b80be901828d623b358ab408ba4/yaohui-mytdlaunch22-6154.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Canteen offerings will be replaced with locally made ready-to-eat meals.", "caption": "Canteen offerings will be replaced with locally made ready-to-eat meals.

Dentists, however, can use or prescribe products that have up to 6 per cent.\n\nWhen used in large quantities, hydrogen peroxide can be harmful - particularly if applied to cavities or diseased gums.\n\nBefore whitening, dentists clean teeth to remove any surface discolouration, a process which does not happen for at-home products bought online.\n\nDr Lequart said using too much of these products can cause irritation or even lead gums to recede - an early warning sign of future tooth loss.

He also oversees the dioceses of West Malaysia, Kuching and Sabah. He is the third Singaporean to have taken on the role since the province was formed in 1996.\n\nA province is an autonomous group of Anglican churches, created when churches in a region are established enough to look after their own affairs.\n\nDr Chung was appointed Bishop of Singapore in 2020 and saw the diocese through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:47am\n\nSuccessful ITE graduates to be recognised as part of 3 new fellowships in President's Challenge 2025\n\nMore related stories\n\nSeveral Cabinet ministers and leaders of the Anglican Communion were at the cathedral to witness the ceremony. They included Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, National Development Minister Desmond Lee and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng. Former president Tony Tan, Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh and Workers' Party chairwoman Sylvia Lim were also present.\n\nThe ceremony was followed by a thanksgiving dinner held at Fairmont Singapore, which President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli and Minister of State for Trade and Industry and Culture, Community and Youth Alvin Tan attended.\n\nSpeaking at the dinner, President Tharman described Dr Chung's installation as coming \"at a time of growing fragility around the world\", with political and religious schisms threatening human well-being and security in some countries.\n\n\"All the more in these times, that we should uphold universal humanitarian values, including respect for each other as individuals, an interest in each other's cultures and creeds and faith in our common humanity,\" Mr Tharman said.\n\n\"This has particular importance for us as Singaporeans, whose very identity rests on multiracial and multi-religious harmony,\" he added. \"Our religious leaders play a key role in this regard, as they both guide their flock in understanding their own religious beliefs and responsibilities, and foster positive and shared civic norms and values.\"\n\nThe new archbishop, who holds a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Edinburgh, was ordained as a priest in 1997 after graduating from Trinity Theological College in Singapore.\n\nHe served as a priest and subsequently as vicar at the Chapel of the Holy Spirit from 1997 to 2005, before joining St Andrew's Cathedral in 2009.\n\nTan Wei Xuan\n\nTharman Shanmugaratnam\n\nSingapore\n\nCHURCHES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 22, 2025, 07:50am\n\nPuan Noor Aishah, S'pore's first first lady, remembered for grace and service\n\nMar 29, 2025, 12:28am\n\nPresident Tharman: Stability, expertise key to Singapore's future\n\nMar 9, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nMuis to give $3m of zakat funds to 8,200 beneficiaries\n\nDec 31, 2024, 05:58am\n\nSingaporeans who help others give hope for the future\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She was also disqualified from being a company director for two years.\n\nCourt documents said Zhang got to know one Wu Jinping, a director of JJCA Corporate Services, in 2012. The two were friends and former colleagues.\n\nSome time in 2020, Wu's friend told her about another friend's son, one Mr Li Yilun, who wanted to incorporate a company in Singapore.\n\nAs the inquiry came from a friend, Wu felt reassured to take on Mr Li as a client. JJCA Corporate Services also conducted background checks and found nothing suspicious. They then set up a company for Mr Li, named Moon SNE.\n\nZhang was then appointed to serve as the nominee director of Moon SNE in May 2020. She received $1,000 as remuneration.\n\nBut from then till March 9, 2022, when she relinquished her directorship, Zhang did not meet or speak to Mr Li to ascertain the nature of his business, and did not conduct regular checks on the company's financial affairs.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, management consultancy TMF Singapore H alerted the police that its related company based in South Africa had fallen victim to an impersonation scam, and was scammed of more than US$463,000 (S$620,500).\n\nThe sum was transferred to Moon SNE's bank account. The Commercial Affairs Department seized the account one day after receiving the report.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin called for Zhang to be fined $4,000 and given a disqualification order of three years. Said DPP Wong: \"Other than being a paper director allowing Moon SNE to meet the statutory requirement of having at least one local director, Zhang made no other contribution to Moon SNE whatsoever.\"\n\nZhang's lawyer, Ms Jacintha Gopal of R.S. Solomon, said her client reviewed the background checks on Mr Li and the sales invoices he submitted of his business, and believed his business was legitimate.\n\nSubsequently, UOB approved the opening of the bank account based on those invoices, said the lawyer.\n\nShe added this was not a case where Zhang had missed obvious red flags on the company's financial transactions.\n\nMs Gopal, who asked for a lower fine of $2,000 and a one-year disqualification period, said: \"(Zhang) had nothing to do with the impersonation scam and nothing to do with the proceeds that entered into Moon SNE's bank account. She did not have sinister intentions.\"\n\nWu has been charged with one count of abetting Zhang's offence.\n\nHer case will be heard at a later date.\n\nZhang is one of several nominee directors who were hauled to court recently for failing to exercise diligence in their duties.\n\nIn September 2023, Singaporean Er Beng Hwa was fined $4,000 and disqualified from being a company director for three years. He had been a nominee director of 186 companies, and one firm was used by scammers to launder $3.23 million.\n\nChristine Tan\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

We missed that in the first leg and we were disappointed. Today we were really good and I think that is the difference,\" Pochettino told Sky Sports.\n\nMiddlesbrough, missing key players through injury, could not repeat their defensive heroics of the first leg and, after conceding an own-goal through captain Jonny Howson in the 15th minute, were already 4-0 down by halftime.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 22, 2024, 11:58pm\n\nEx-Man United boss Mourinho says he didn't get the same support as Ten Hag\n\nMore related stories\n\nCole Palmer put away two for Chelsea, in the 42nd and 77th minutes, as the Blues ran rings round their opponents with a sharp, flowing, passing game.\n\n\"I missed three sitters in the first game so it was always in the back of my mind coming into this game. To score two and go through to Wembley, I'm happy,\" Palmer told Sky Sports.\n\n\"We've not had the best of starts, there is no hiding it but to go to Wembley is a great opportunity to get a trophy and we're looking forward to it.\"\n\nPochettino praised Palmer's intelligence on the pitch. The forward has now scored 10 goals in his first season with Chelsea.\n\n\"He is a player with an amazing talent. It is a player that understands the game. He has the quality and the talent to see the situation and to read the game in another aspect,\" the Argentine coach said.\n\nEnzo Fernandez, Axel Disasi and Noni Madueke also got on the scoresheet, while Morgan Rogers scored a consolation goal for Boro in the 88th minute.\n\nChelsea, who have won the trophy five times, most recently in 2015, will meet either Liverpool or Fulham, who play on Jan 24, in the Wembley final on Feb 25.

They will also perform on Jan 24, 26, 27, 30 and 31, making it the quartet's longest Asian stint in their Music Of The Spheres world tour.\n\nGuests who arrived early were treated to an opening set by Indonesian singer Jinan Laetitia at around 6.30pm, before homegrown star Jasmine Sokko took over the reins at 7.15pm.\n\nDecked in black, Sokko was a portrait of sophistication and hypnotism as she belted out tracks such as Hurt and Tired.\n\nShe said Yellow by Coldplay was the first song she learnt and played when she first got her guitar, so opening for the band felt like \"coming full circle\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 7, 2025, 01:04am\n\nSingapore takes centre stage in Coldplay's Man In The Moon video\n\nMore related stories\n\nSingaporean singer Jasmine Sokko opening for Coldplay on Jan 23.TNP PHOTO: CHERLYNN NG\n\nSokko added: \"Thank you, everyone who has believed in me ever since my first song, to all of you today whom I'm meeting for the first time, and to Coldplay for letting me open for their show here. Thank you all.\"\n\nFans got even more hyped up when Coldplay took to the stage and set the venue alight with Higher Power. They also played beloved tunes such as Adventure Of A Lifetime and Paradise.\n\nThe concert was a captivating visual feast as everyone was armed with LED wristbands that changed colours according to the music. It goes without saying that the stadium transformed into a field of gold during Yellow.\n\nColdplay transformed the National Stadium into a sea of colours during the Singapore stop of their Music Of The Spheres world tour.TNP PHOTO: CHERLYNN NG\n\nFans wore wristbands that changed colours according to the music.TNP PHOTO: CHERLYNN NG\n\nDespite technical problems with the piano, the band was undeterred and delivered a perfect rendition of The Scientist on guitar.\n\nFrontman Chris Martin told the crowd: \"We are going to give you all we have, piano or no piano. We are going to give you our hearts.\"\n\nHe also made cheeky references to Singapore's heat, such as: \"I'm sweating so much inside,\" and \"I apologise if I smell bad right now.\"\n\nThe energy was electrifying during Viva La Vida, but took an emotional turn afterwards when a couple were invited on stage by Martin.\n\nMartin told the pair: \"Thank you for coming up on stage. Right now, you represent everybody else. Everybody else is you, you are everybody else, okay?\"\n\nThe couple, who hailed from Jakarta, had with them a sign that said: \"Can you sing Everglow for our Papa in heaven?\"\n\nA fan breaks down in tears over Chris Martin's performance of 'Everglow'.TNP PHOTO: CHERLYNN NG\n\nThe woman explained that her father was supposed to be at the concert but died two months ago.\n\nMartin initially kept the vibe light-hearted by teasing that the couple did not need their phones because \"everyone else is filming\", sparking raucous laughter throughout the audience.\n\nHowever, he soon dove into an emotional performance of Everglow that tugged on heartstrings. The incredibly touching set also saw the woman breaking down in tears.\n\nThings hit a crescendo with My Universe, a musical collaboration between Coldplay and South Korean boyband BTS. Although the K-pop idols were not present, they appeared on sphere-shaped Jumbotron screens whenever their parts were played.\n\nBTS members appeared on screen whenever their parts from 'My Universe' were played. TNP PHOTO: CHERLYNN NG\n\nMost fans were happy to oblige with Martin's special request during A Sky Full Of Stars.\n\nHe said: \"This group of us, this 60,000 and four of us, will never be in the same room all together again. So we would like to remember this, just us, one family, one big band. And the way we'd like to do that…\n\n\"Can we do one song all together, with no cellphones and no cameras and no filming and no recording and no tweeting and no Instagramming, no Snapchatting, no TikToking or whatever, Zooming, nothing. Let's do one song with no devices at all except your body and your soul and your eyes and your ears and each other.\"\n\nRevellers were undeniably overjoyed when Martin started singing: \"When you try your best, but you don't succeed…\" Because what better way to end a remarkable night than with the moving and timeless Fix You?\n\nColdplay made history as the first act to ever play six nights at the National Stadium. They also broke the record for the most tickets sold by an artiste in a single day in Singapore. Both accolades are well-deserved, if their Jan 23 gig is anything to go by.\n\nBy\n\nCherlynn Ng\n\nAssistant Digital Editor\n\nRead articles by Cherlynn Ng\n\ncoldplay\n\nCONCERTS\n\nSingapore National Stadium\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 9, 2016, 10:00pm\n\nMust-see MVs\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Provided, of course, the contenders happen to be headstrong gallopers who are rich in condition.\n\nLike the seven gallopers in that field of nine who are contesting the Class 3 sprint over the 1,400m on Jan 27.\n\nThey were all out on the training track on Jan 23 and each seemed to have an agenda - like wanting to take home the bulk of the $70,000 prize money on offer.\n\nBut we know there can only be one winner. So who is it going to be?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nCan Silo, Red Dot or Trident continue their winning ways?\n\nAll won at their last starts. Indeed, Silo is shooting for a hat-trick, having posted a race-to-race double before coming into this.\n\nAs for Red Dot and Trident, they, too, will be carrying winning form into the event.\n\nAnd the work put in by this talented trio seemed to suggest that they are ready to make a race of it.\n\nSilo had Vad Duric doing the steering when running the 600m in 41.6sec.\n\nRed Dot cantered to loosen up before racing over the same trip in a pedestrian 45.4 but he was forcibly restrained.\n\nTrident went fastest of the three, clocking 39.6 with Yusoff Fadzli in the saddle.\n\nHowever, therein lies a question mark - and it is a big one at that.\n\nAll three horses were winners in Class 4. Can they climb up the ladder and do well in Class 3? Well, they all seem to carry the right credentials.\n\nSilo showed fighting spirit when beating Sacred Buddy in a photo finish on Dec 9. And he followed it up in style, coming from a spot in deep midfield to run down Makin on Dec 30.\n\nBoth races were over the 1,200m and, on the strength of those victories, he should be in the right frame of mind to get that hat-trick.\n\nThat will be a good send-off present before he heads for the rich pickings in Hong Kong.\n\nAs for Trident and Red Dot, they both know that the most important spot on a racetrack is the finish line.\n\nBetween them, they have been there six times.\n\nTrident, from Donna Logan's yard, has won four races from 14 starts, while Red Dot has been successful twice from just four outings.\n\nAnd here is the clincher. Both Red Dot and Trident have raced in Class 3 company.\n\nBefore that last-start success in Class 4 on Jan 4, Trident finished a smack-up fourth to Real Efecto in a nine-horse Class 3 race over the mile.\n\nHe faces off with Real Efecto on Jan 27 and he will be really comfortable over the track and trip.\n\nAs for Real Efecto, he also worked well, running the 600m in 39.3 under Amirul Ismadi.\n\nTo date, he has won six races for trainer David Kok and there could be more in the offing.\n\nBack to Red Dot, the Irish-bred is in a good place. Sure, the rise in class will demand a lot more from him but his recent showings, coupled with his work on Jan 23, does seem to suggest good things to come.\n\nRed Dot won his last race on Dec 30 on the back of two winning trials and Kok has not allowed him to rest on his laurels.\n\nHe set him to the trials on Jan 18 and Red Dot came through with flying colours. He handed his rivals a six-length beating.\n\nRacing in the colours of Lucky Stable, Red Dot has what it takes to build on his current credentials.\n\nAs for the other three runners who worked well ahead of their Class 3 assignment, they, too, cannot be simply brushed aside.\n\nMakin had Manoel Nunes in the saddle when running the 600m in a swift 35.1.\n\nStablemate Lim's Craft took off and clocked 36.7 for the same trip, while Ocean Crossing - though not as speedy - ran out the distance in 43.2.\n\nA four-year-old Australian-bred, Makin has just one win to show from nine starts and he is another one who must defy promotion to win.\n\nCan he do it? Who is to know? His last two starts in Class 4 were more than decent showings. Both times, he ran second - losing out by a short head to Ace Of Diamonds on Dec 17 and then beaten by Silo on Dec 30.\n\nBeing promoted is not ideal but, with just 53kg on his back, he will be right in the mix from go to whoa.\n\nAs for Ocean Crossing, he has \"been there and done that\". A seven-time winner from 42 starts, you just never know when he is going to pop up.\n\nSo toss him into those novelty bets. He could add juice to the payout.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\njan23gallops.pdf\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He looks wound up to peak, especially with solid overseas form before arriving in Hong Kong.\n\n3 Amazing Teens\n\nknows what it takes on this surface.

He should make a bold bid to make all the running, just as he has done previously with great success.\n\n5 Mr Ascendency\n\ndraws ideally and comes out of a strong race on turf. He has the ability to make an impression on dirt.\n\n1 Chancheng Prince\n\nknows what it is all about on this surface. He is a player.\n\nRace 3 (1,650m)\n\n11 Fortune President\n\ncontinues to outperform expectations. He is a winner over this course and distance and has also shown versatility with victories on the turf. He can win under a suitable weight.\n\n1 Viva Hunter\n\nis aided by apprentice Ellis Wong's 10lb (4.54kg) allowance. The dip to Class 4 is another big advantage.\n\n3 Lucky Banner\n\nhas twice missed by narrow margins over the course and distance this season. He gets another shot and is likely to be the favourite with Hugh Bowman up.\n\n10 Noble Win\n\nhas place claims.\n\nRace 4 (1,650m)\n\n3 Asian One\n\nshould get a sweet run in transit from gate 1.

He remains in solid form and can contend once again.\n\n14 Compulsory\n\nis better than his record suggests. He can surprise if they plan to push forward and lead. He can win off a light weight.\n\n4 Go Go Go\n\nhas ability and gets his opportunity.\n\nRace 5 (1,200m)\n\n1 Flying Dragon\n\nhas been knocking on the door for another win all season. He gets a top chance again, especially from a suitable draw under Bowman. Hard to beat.\n\n8 Regent Glory\n\nwas a superb winner two runs back. Expect him to take another step forward.\n\n10 Aca Power\n\nslots in very light and is a winner already this term. In sound form, he gets his chance.\n\n9 Diamond Soars\n\nknows how to win on the dirt and is expected to lead. He could pinch this one.\n\nRace 6 (1,200m)\n\n6 Diamond Flare\n\nshould find the front to try and make all. Luke Ferraris has two rides for two wins aboard this guy and he should get every opportunity by making his own luck. The one to topple.\n\n8 Speedy Smartie\n\nhas shown an affinity to Sha Tin's dirt course. He can make his presence felt after a pair of solid outings.\n\n4 Judy's Great\n\nwas impressive two runs back with victory over this course and distance.\n\n2 Magic Supreme\n\nhas the runs and the experience on the board.\n\nRace 7 (1,200m)\n\n5 All Is Good\n\ngets his chance against this lot. He has shown a bit of quality on the dirt before and will most likely roll forward to try and make it all the way. The inside gate has him favoured under Ferraris.\n\n2 Capital Delight\n\nis after back-to-back wins. He can keep on rising.\n\n9 Mark The Moment\n\nhas yet to win but he has gone close several times. He just needs to overcome the wide draw to make his presence felt.\n\n4 Fiery Diamond\n\nloves the course and distance. He can bounce back, especially with Wong's 10lb claim.\n\nRace 8 (1,650m)\n\n10 Frantanck\n\nslots in light and is looking to go one better, after narrowly missing last time. He likes the dirt, comes from the right stable and pairs with a suitable rider. Hard to beat.\n\n4 Adefill\n\nloves the surface and was an impressive winner last start for in-form trainer Ricky Yiu.\n\n12 Nordic Star\n\ndid similar and is favoured with Purton up.

The charges related to three boys, two of whom were below the age of 14 at the time of the offences.\n\nAnother 18 charges were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 05:45am\n\nFemale primary school teacher charged over alleged sex acts with male student, 13\n\nMore related stories\n\nThese include a charge for molesting a fourth boy, who was below the age of 14, as well as a charge for engaging in sexual activity with one of the boys without informing the victim that he was HIV-positive.\n\nIn a statement on Sept 11, 2023, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) said the man was not and has never been registered under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme (ARS), which means he is not authorised to offer any form of religious instruction or guidance in Singapore.\n\nMuis said the case was a timely reminder to individuals and parents to only seek instruction and guidance from ARS-registered religious teachers.\n\nThe 35-year-old man provided religious and Arabic language home tuition in 2013 after he returned from his studies in Egypt. He also worked part-time as a food delivery rider.\n\nThe man got to know an 11-year-old boy, identified as V1, on a dating app in 2014.\n\nHe told the boy he was a part-time religious teacher, and they chatted about sex.\n\nThey eventually met in person at a toilet cubicle in Hougang Mall, where the man performed oral sex on the boy.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2018, the two continued to meet for mutual sex acts. In July 2019, V1 tested positive for HIV, although it cannot be concluded that the man had transmitted the virus to him.\n\nIn 2017, the man got to know a 12-year-old boy, identified as V2. They played video games and went on e-scooter rides together, and the man often bought V2 and his friends food and cigarettes. He also tutored V2 in maths.\n\nOn three occasions in 2018, when V2 was 13, he allowed the man to perform sex acts on him, in exchange for $30 worth of video game credits each time.\n\nThe third victim, V3, was in primary school in 2016 when he started chatting with the man, who had followed the boy on Instagram.\n\nAfter they met in person, the man often bought V3 presents, including a second-hand video game console.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, the man engaged in sex acts with the boy, when the latter was 14 to 15 years old.\n\nIn June 2019, a few months after the man had tested positive for HIV, he did not inform V3 about it before they engaged in sexual activities.\n\nThe man was arrested later that month in the spot check. He cannot be named under a gag order to protect the identities of the victims.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 9, 2025, 06:21am\n\nMy husband arranged for 5 men to rape me.

It was conceptualised by the Health Ministry (MOH), after feedback from parents and couples who asked for more community resources and support in parenthood.\n\nSaid Mr Carlos, 26, a financial consultant: \"It feels like we have a loving community reaching out to us, instead of us having to source for it.\"\n\nLed by the MOH and Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the pilot programme at Punggol directs people to relevant social services and programmes while they are at the polyclinic, including how to get advice and support in health and wellness of mothers and mothers-to-be, child health and development, and marriage and parenting.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 16, 2025, 08:55am\n\nDad's emotional support after her mum's death helps taekwondo champ fly

Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and Health, said: \"We hope that families with young children in Punggol and the Northeast region will have more convenient access to health and parenting services.\"\n\nThe support programmes are run by by community partners such as the Families for Life (FFL) council, a movement that promotes resilient families which comes under the MSF.\n\nHealthwise, the Punggol polyclinic provides families with young children access to developmental assessment, screening for growth concerns for children, postnatal depression in mothers, maternal emotional health support and lactation support.\n\nMore than 190 referrals have been made to the parenting programmes via the polyclinic since it started in Dec 2023, said Dr Guo Xiaoxuan, clinic director of the polyclinic and programme lead at Punggol.\n\nAriel Yu\n\nFAMILIES\n\npunggol\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 15, 2025,

He had previously pleaded guilty to six charges, including offences under the Women's Charter and Prevention of Human Trafficking Act.\n\nReformative training is a more severe punishment than probation and results in a criminal record. It involves being detained in a reformative training centre for six to 12 months to attend rehabilitative programmes and counselling.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Tay Jia En said the teen was not suitable for probation, but the reasons were not revealed in court.\n\nAfter handing down the sentence, Deputy Principal District Judge Kessler Soh also arranged for the teen to meet a court counsellor.\n\nThe perpetrator and his victims, identified only as V1 and V2 in court documents, cannot be named owing to a gag order.\n\nThe Straits Times previously reported that the teen got to know V1 from a friend, who was the girl's ex-boyfriend and father of her child.\n\nIn June 2022, V1 needed money to support her baby and asked the teen to recommend jobs that paid \"fast cash\".\n\nThe teen became a member of the Telegram chat group in July 2022, and was allowed to post advertisements in the chat.\n\nHe told V1 he had found a \"high-paying\" job for her, but she would need to provide sexual services. She would earn up to $500 from each booking and pay him $100 in commission each time.\n\nHe asked V1 for sexually provocative photos and personal details to advertise her services on the chat group, claiming she was a 17-year-old social escort despite knowing she was only 16.\n\nIn total, he found at least five customers for V1.\n\nIn January 2023, V1 introduced V2 to him, as V2 was also interested in providing sexual services to earn money. The teen subsequently found at least four customers for her.\n\nThe scheme was exposed when a 34-year-old customer, Muhamad Reduan, called the police after engaging V2 for sexual services.\n\nHe said he had been scammed, but it was not clear from court documents what the \"scam\" was.\n\nDPP Tay said Muhamad Reduan and the other customers of the victims will be dealt with separately.\n\nUpon realising his operation had been compromised, the teen changed the title of the chat group to an innocuous name. He also logged out of his Telegram account and deleted chats with customers on his digital devices.\n\nFor this, he was charged with more offences of obstructing the course of justice.\n\nInvestigations revealed that the teen had offered to waive some commissions from V1 and V2 if they had sex with him. They refused and paid him instead.\n\nDPP Tay had called for a reformative training suitability report, saying: \"The conduct of the accused clearly points towards a sustained pattern of criminal conduct which befits a sterner form of rehabilitative sentence.\"\n\nChristine Tan\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f025cf859d58947a6c69a3fea86402b17fccf90fcd31021e7400df23a3872ae/gavelscales.png?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Leong, an avid runner who has taken part in other running events, is in her seventh month of pregnancy.\n\nLeong said she felt excited running the 10km with her baby girl in her tummy, and that the run was slightly strenuous when she was going upslope.\n\n\"I believe I can still handle the run as the baby is not too heavy and not too big,\" she told the media. \"I felt her kicking me while I was running, as if she wanted to give me some encouragement.\"\n\nLeong said her husband, who was there to cheer for her, was concerned about other runners knocking into her and asked her to put a \"Child in car\" sign on the back of her shirt.\n\nShe said other participants did give way to her, with many of them helping her along the way.\n\n\"I have not decided when to stop before giving birth,\" she said. \"I will continue to practise or run shorter distances as long as my physical condition permits.\"\n\nLim Ruey Yan\n\nhong kong\n\nCelebrities\n\nMARATHONS\n\nsocial media\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 19, 2025, 03:00am\n\nWoman, 72, scammed into thinking she's helping Andy Lau and his daughter\n\nJun 1, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n'I have another 8 or 9 years to live': HK star Law Kar Ying battles cancer for 4th time\n\nMay 31, 2025, 01:40am\n\nMay babies: Actress Grace Wong's daughter born in same month as her and husband\n\nMay 14, 2025, 11:50pm\n\nActor Wong He says he was drugged and sexually assaulted twice in 2024 at his friends' homes\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nOutdoor Shades That Transform Spaces\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bbbbd66d80a38bb66f1c5dc79d7bc39ac34eb34cb9d9f95bbba34e23dc5ba2f6/wgt-chowyunfat-220124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Chow Yun Fat spoke to the media after the Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon.

The air-conditioned underground retail strip linked to Esplanade MRT station is operated by SMRT's business arm Stellar Lifestyle.\n\nThe 297 sq m hub comprises 10 unique retail experiences by start-ups focusing on automation, robotics and digital retail services. It was launched on Jan 22 by Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling.\n\nOne concept is 7-Eleven Shop & Go, the convenience store chain's first unmanned and cashier-free store in Singapore where customers can tap into a gantry to pre-authorise their credit cards, pick items off the shelves, and exit.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 26, 2025, 07:09am\n\nHome Team humanoid robots to be rolled out by mid-2027, $100m to be invested: Josephine Teo\n\nMore related stories\n\nTheir credit cards are charged accordingly, and a QR code can be scanned to get an itemised receipt.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technology and smart cameras track and detect customers' shopping behaviour in the store, which can currently hold up to five people at a time.\n\nOther featured concepts include Mr.R Robotics, an adaptive robotics retail store where frozen, chilled and ambient products are picked up by a robotic arm once selected, as well as Le Tach Vending, a vending machine operator that stocks products like herbal teas, bak kwa and fresh fruit.\n\nMs Low noted that tools utilised by these busineses, such as AI, can help alleviate issues like the manpower crunch. \"These innovations can help lower operational costs, boost sales and address manpower and logistics challenges often faced by retailers,\" she said.\n\nQuikBot founder and chief executive Alan Ng said the firm aims to serve 400 buildings in the next four years, servicing about 1.2 million professionals, managers, executives and technicians.\n\n\"Singapore is a stepping stone,\" he added. \"We are a smart city solution, so we are establishing our presence in cities like Dubai in the next three months, and then moving to Tokyo and Seoul.\"\n\nAnjali Raguraman\n\nCorrespondent\n\nROBOTS\n\nSME/SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISE\n\nRETAIL\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 15, 2025, 12:33am\n\nHumanoid robots to take on concierge, office chores in Singapore\n\nDec 6, 2024, 12:19am\n\nAI-powered robot nurses to debut at NUH in 2025\n\nNov 28, 2024, 07:54am\n\nDrunk man picks fight with cleaning robot in CBD\n\nNov 19, 2024, 05:59am\n\nRobot delivers meals on wheels for Bird Paradise residents\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c6ae63b5a5918e7a0c4fdbc146df75396f6e3df2740fd3efeb47144ee4c2effc/20240122106886823img1336.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Bot delivery is part of a host of concepts now in operation under Hive 2.0, a high-tech retail innovation hub at Esplanade Xchange.

He soaked it in. He took a picture with the great Gael Monfils. He found himself a ticket to watch Carlos Alcaraz. And he went to observe the art of his hero, Novak Djokovic, at practice.\n\nIf Djokovic moves fast, then so - in manner of speaking - does Bill, who became the first Singaporean to make it to the Australian Open junior championships. Last July, Chan, once a kid from\n\nAnglo-Chinese School (Independent), was ranked No. 577 in the ITF junior rankings. This year, having rocketed to world No. 63, he is worthy of a competitor's pass in the main draw of the boys' junior doubles.\n\n\"It's a great experience,\" he says. \"Because honestly I didn't see myself in this position many times.\"\n\nBill played alongside Peruvian Luis Jose Nakamine and, as often happens in doubles, they arranged their partnership three days prior. The duo lost a tight match in the super tie-break, 6-2, 3-6, 10-8 to Kaylun Bigun and Jagger Leach, an American pair who held a slight advantage in pedigree. Leach's mum, you see, is former world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport.\n\nBill, who lost in the final round of the boys singles qualifiers, was introduced as a boy to an array of pursuits by his parents. Tennis took his fancy.\n\nNow he schools online and is based in the Belgian town of Hasselt under the sharp gaze of tennis coach Philippe Gelade, fitness coach Jonas Wallens and mental coach Pieter Michiels. In a global, harshly competitive sport, he needs every piece of sophisticated help he can find.\n\nRoughly 1.8m tall now and very polite, Bill, who describes an earlier version of himself as \"short\", is an altered competitor. \"I used to take the ball really early because I was pretty talented. I used a lot of my timing.\" But exposure brings wisdom and now he says, \"as you grow up that doesn't really work so well. You need to work a little bit harder to win points, you need to play differently, play a little bit smarter\".\n\nBelgium has been his education. \"I started training (there) on clay court and that helped my game a lot because the clay-court game is totally different. You have to play from the back a little bit more and it's a lot more physical. My game has changed in the sense that I've gotten a lot faster. I would say I'm an all-rounder. I'm pretty confident from the baseline.\"\n\nBill will soon be thrust into the unforgiving world of senior tennis but first he plans to go to college and \"after that I'm really open to going pro\". Till then he's doing what the game requires, sweating five to six days a week and imitating his steely role model who hails from Serbia.\n\n\"Out of everyone on tour I feel like (Djokovic) works the hardest. His mental strength is insane.\" He even went looking for the Serb, hoping for a selfie, but Djokovic had gone and the moment had passed.\n\nPractice will take Bill places, but what he requires is sponsorship. Tennis comes with a cost - from strings to flights to coaches - and while his peers of his ranking have sponsorships, he only has one. \"Just my parents,\" he quips. \"Singapore is not a country that's so big on tennis.\"\n\nTill he waits for his talent to be supported, he's doing the only thing within his control.

This is among several events to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Total Defence in 2024.\n\nFrom Feb 15 to 29, Exercise SG Ready will simulate an attack on Singapore using a variety of hybrid security threats from an anonymous aggressor deploying cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns and drones against various targets.\n\nThese attacks would cause simulated disruptions to power, water or food supply to all schools on Feb 15 and 16. Emergency food supplies will be provided to some schools during this time.\n\nCommunity facilities and commercial and government buildings will also take turns to run simulated disruptions as part of the exercise over two weeks.\n\nThe simulated disruptions include temporary stoppage of escalators and air-conditioners on various days, while 20 prominent public buildings such as the Treasury, Supreme Court, National Heritage Board museums, Esplanade Theatres and Suntec Convention Centre will switch off their facade lighting to simulate a blackout caused by a cyber attack on the power grid.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 06:45am\n\nNDP 2025: Leopard tank that hit traffic light to return to mobile column after fault identified\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn all, some 500 educational, community, commercial and government buildings will be involved in the exercise.\n\nThe decision to hold the exercise came about as a result of feedback from various government agencies and partners that there is a need to educate Singaporeans on what to do in the event of a crisis, said Brigadier-General Kelvin Fan, deputy secretary (policy) at the Ministry of Defence, on Jan 22 during the launch of the Total Defence 40th anniversary (TD40) events.\n\n\"It is to enhance the readiness, resilience and the unity of Singaporeans whenever there is a crisis\", amid \"increased volatility, increased uncertainty and increased turbulence in the world\", added BG Fan, who is also the chairman of the TD40 organising committee.\n\nHe listed climate change, cyber attacks and supply chain disruptions as some of the challenges the world faces.\n\nGovernment agency Nexus, which is responsible for Total Defence and National Education, has launched an exercise scenario video to set the context for the simulated disruptions happening during the two-week exercise.\n\nMembers of the public who would like more information on the locations and dates of the simulated disruptions for Exercise SG Ready can go to the\n\nSGReadygowhere website.\n\nOther anniversary events include a Total Defence convention, which will be held in April, and a roving Total Defence exhibition showcasing the contributions of Singaporeans to Total Defence over the past 40 years.\n\nThe exhibition will be held throughout Singapore over the year, according to BG Fan. Details of the exhibition will be announced later.\n\nThere will also be a Total Defence dynamic display at the National Day Parade 2024, which will be held at the Padang.\n\nMike Yeo\n\nCorrespondent\n\nministry of defence\n\nDEFENCE AND MILITARY\n\nSAF\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 1, 2025, 12:16am\n\nNSman, 30, dies after training session at Maju camp\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:01am\n\nFire breaks out in empty bunk at Pulau Tekong's Basic Military Training Centre, no injuries\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:00am\n\nCertis officer, 47, dies after collapsing at NDP rehearsal\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:22am\n\nCyclist hit by bullet slug in nature reserve may have tried to cover his tracks from authorities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/170981cfbae589fd7aa5907bf768a23e1053179ebf648554e9495b3ec028fbb9/yaohui-mytdlaunch22-6044.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Brigadier-General Kelvin Fan, Chairman Total Defence 40 (TD40) EXCO/Deputy Secretary (Policy), Mindef, giving a media doorstop after the media brief for the TD40 campaign at the lobby of South Beach Tower on Jan 22, 2024.", "caption": "Brigadier-General Kelvin Fan, Chairman Total Defence 40 (TD40) EXCO/Deputy Secretary (Policy), Mindef, giving a media doorstop after the media brief for the TD40 campaign at the lobby of South Beach Tower on Jan 22, 2024.

A shuttle train service now runs between HarbourFront and Labrador Park, the stop after Telok Blangah, at 10-minute intervals.\n\nThis translates to longer travel times for passengers travelling in both directions.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 11, 2025, 06:56am\n\n12,000 lower-income households to get $60 transport vouchers by end-July\n\nMore related stories\n\nThese changes, announced by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and rail operator SMRT in October 2023, are to facilitate track works to connect Stage 6 of CCL - comprising three stations between HarbourFront and Marina Bay - to the HarbourFront CCL station, closing the loop for the line.\n\nAn average of 43,000 passengers will be affected daily, said LTA and SMRT.\n\nAdditionally, CCL trains will turn back towards Marina Bay alternately at Kent Ridge and Labrador Park stations, instead of HarbourFront, to maintain peak-hour intervals at the busy stretch from Kent Ridge to Paya Lebar.\n\nDuring peak hours, trains running between Kent Ridge and Labrador Park will arrive at five-minute intervals.\n\nBased on The Straits Times' checks at Labrador Park, Telok Blangah and HarbourFront stations from 7am to 10am on the morning of Jan 22, the peak-hour situation was orderly and calm, with staff on standby to control crowds.\n\nTen out of 26 travellers ST spoke to said they were inconvenienced by the slight delays, and would be 10 to 15 minutes late for work or school.\n\nAmong them was Miss Sin Si En, 24, who was travelling towards HarbourFront to get to her workplace in Potong Pasir via a transfer to the North-East Line.\n\nThe quantity surveyor said she would leave her home in Pasir Panjang earlier, before 8am, for the next few months, as she would need to factor in longer wait times - compared with the original train intervals of about three minutes - for the shuttle train service at Labrador Park station.\n\nMr William Leong, 36, was affected as he had to wait for a train transfer at Labrador Park to get to Kent Ridge from Telok Blangah.\n\nThe programme manager had seen the notices displayed at the MRT stations about the changes, but did not understand them.\n\nHe added that it would be better if LTA highlighted the \"key points\" for passengers to understand how they will be affected, instead of the large chunks of information now.\n\nHowever, some passengers were not too affected by the changes.\n\nMr Ignatius Goh was heading to his workplace in one-north from his home in Telok Blangah.\n\nThe 27-year-old data analyst said the extra wait time \"was not a big deal\" to him, adding that he was willing to leave his home five to 10 minutes early to reach work on time.\n\nHousewife Prague Khandelwal, 31, said it was easy for her to navigate the service adjustments with \"lots of people around to help\".\n\nWhile she did not know how to get to her destination after being ushered off the train at Telok Blangah, the station staff patiently directed her to wait for the train shuttle service bound for HarbourFront, where she could hop on the North-East Line to Little India.\n\nST counted nearly 10 SMRT employees each at Labrador Park, Telok Blangah and HarbourFront stations.\n\nSome announced the travel direction of each arriving train using speakers and signs, some addressed passengers' queries, while others ushered people on and off trains.\n\nQueues were observed for the shuttle train service between Labrador Park and HarbourFront, but there was enough room to allow most passengers to board.\n\nAdditionally, ST observed that the express shuttle bus service between HarbourFront and Kent Ridge had only some passengers, with around five to 20 people boarding each double-decker bus from 8.15am to 8.50am.\n\nThese buses, which have been specially catered as an alternative to the CCL, are running at intervals of 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours on weekdays between 6am and 10am, and from 5pm to 9pm.\n\nEsther Loi\n\nPUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nmrt\n\nsmrt\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 01:58am\n\nPower fault halts train service across entire Bukit Panjang LRT line\n\nJul 1, 2025, 08:59am\n\nKovan MRT station to reward commuters for morning off-peak travel\n\nJul 1, 2025, 08:54am\n\nBike-sharing company HelloRide to expand S'pore fleet to 20,000\n\nJun 30, 2025, 03:04am\n\nSelf-driving public shuttles in Punggol by fourth quarter\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8b0e10fc06c8bb0da5f99409e654179713b19d0dd359c42d70ab45fad45d8577/2024012273690482b9be4024-13db-4548-af0e-fa3f16535dd3.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Ten out of 26 commuters ST spoke to said they were inconvenienced by the slight delays, and would be 10 to 15 minutes late for work or school.", "caption": "Ten out of 26 commuters ST spoke to said they were inconvenienced by the slight delays, and would be 10 to 15 minutes late for work or school.

However, an Asian Barbie marketed as 'You can be anything' is set as a violinist or a panda doctor? It seems more like 'You can be anyone your Asian parents want you to be.' This either appears to be a misrepresentation by a non-Asian, playing into stereotypes, or it's designed by an Asian carrying intergenerational trauma,\" said Mr Wu on Weibo.\n\nThe Barbie dolls are manufactured by American toy and entertainment company Mattel.\n\nOwner of one of the strongest portfolios of children's and family entertainment franchises in the world, Mattel said on its website that their purpose is to \"empower the next generation to explore the wonder of childhood and reach their full potential\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:26am\n\n'I consider Chow Yun Fat more a friend than an idol': Li Nanxing\n\nMore related stories\n\nIndeed, many Chinese immigrants in the past have fervently hoped that their children would become doctors, and the violin was often a talent they encouraged.\n\nThe issue with perpetuating stereotypes, even if they seem positive, is that they can limit individual aspirations and reinforce narrow expectations based on race or ethnicity.\n\nWhile being a doctor or a violinist are respectable professions, not all individuals of Asian descent want to pursue these paths, and it's important to recognize and celebrate the diversity of interests and career choices within any community.\n\nIn July 2021, famous US violinist Pinchas Zukerman angered many of the roughly 100 students and teachers during a master class at the Juilliard School, a private performing arts conservatory in New York City, when he invoked racist stereotypes about Asians. The violinist had to apologise for his words.\n\nOnly by actively challenging stereotypes and embracing the richness of diverse experiences, can the US create a more inclusive society where individuals are valued for their unique talents and aspirations. - CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nactors\n\nGENDER ISSUES\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nJul 1, 2025, 07:13am\n\nChow Yun Fat returns to Star Awards after three decades\n\nJun 12, 2025, 07:53am\n\nActor Zhang Yaodong makes TikTok debut to express gratitude for support over being a stallholder\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - Unlock Growth with Smarter Cash Strategies\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/80eb954dceec497d12cac77e1a0fe452255f707af690393857ad4a6c0b306d5b/wgt-barbiesasian-220124.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Daniel Wu's Weibo post included images of a Barbie playing the violin and another Barbie dressed as a doctor wearing a panda-themed outfit.", "caption": "Daniel Wu's Weibo post included images of a Barbie playing the violin and another Barbie dressed as a doctor wearing a panda-themed outfit.

Meanwhile, everything was in the control of our excellent medical team,\" he said, indicating that it made sense for Salah to go back to Liverpool given the Egyptian squad will now be leaving Abidjan in any case to play a last-16 tie in the city of San-Pedro.\n\n\"Given we were going to have to travel, given the temperatures, given that we were going to be going to a different city, maybe it makes sense that Salah should have a place he can go to recover as quickly as possible,\" he said, while expressing annoyance at Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp.\n\n\"We didn't want to alarm anyone.

Both the winning trainer and jockey are no stranger to Singapore racegoers.\n\nMultiple South African champion trainer Mike de Kock needs no introduction for his feats both at home and overseas, especially Dubai.\n\nHe did join the Kranji roll of honour once. He won the now-defunct Group 1 Singapore Airlines International Cup in 2010 with Lizard's Desire, who was ridden by another South African master, the now-retired Kevin Shea.\n\nJockey Muzi Yeni is less known as he has not ridden long at Kranji like Barend Vorster, Robbie Fradd or Ryan Munger and Juan Paul van der Merwe in more recent times.\n\nBut the 37-year-old multiple-Group 1 winner did ride at a Kranji invitational jockeys' series in 2018.\n\nUnfortunately, a second place on Money King was his best showing in 12 rides, but there is no doubt he knows his way to the winning post, just looking at his powerful handling of Iphiko.\n\nFollowing a flying start, they led for most of the way towards the standside of the Turffontein straight, before fighting off a stiff challenge from Mover And Shaker (Denis Schwarz), to prevail by a head.\n\n4Racing, which acquired Phumelela Gaming & Leisure in 2021, were also delighted to host their Singapore counterparts, with whom they began their partnership in 2022.\n\n\"This race meeting is not just about the races, it's a celebration of the close relationship 4Racing has with Singapore Pools and an acknowledgement of the efforts that have brought us to this point,\" said 4Racing CEO Fundi Sithebe.\n\n\"We appreciate (Pools') valuable participation in this journey, and look forward to many more exhilarating races and successful collaborations in 2024.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nThe Underrated Strategy That Keeps Your Investments on Track\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/be05df72557a1e7f6d89171ede425c9b0a6f215cd7ddaff21e8bc5bcd3851f04/mlpools23.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Pools' board director Lee Kwok Cheong (second from left) and wife, 4Racing CEO Fundi Sithebe, assistant trainer Vengi Masawi, trainer Mike de Kock, jockey Muzi Yeni, Pools' chief product officer Simon Leong and senior manager (product content) Steven Tan at Turffontein on Jan 20.\n", "caption": "Pools' board director Lee Kwok Cheong (second from left) and wife, 4Racing CEO Fundi Sithebe, assistant trainer Vengi Masawi, trainer Mike de Kock, jockey Muzi Yeni, Pools' chief product officer Simon Leong and senior manager (product content) Steven Tan at Turffontein on Jan 20.

I'm really pleased he won today,\" he said.\n\n\"He's come with some issues and we've just managed them the best way we could.\n\n\"He remains a day-to-day proposition, but I really wanted to see how he was racing.\n\n\"He's run okay (in five runs) so far, been unlucky a few times.\n\n\"To finally see him win a race is very satisfying as he's proven that he was still competitive.\n\n\"Obviously, we'll go for these bigger races later, even if they'll be much tougher to win.\"\n\nPeters was referring to Group 1 events, with the most immediate being the Kranji Mile (1,600m) on May 18.\n\nThen, there are the obvious \"Big Three\" later in the year, the Raffles Cup (1,600m), Queen Elizabeth II Cup (1,800m) and the one already on his CV - and which will coincide with Singapore's last race day on Oct 5 - the 100th Grand Singapore Gold Cup (2,000m).\n\nFor now, the more modest $85,000 Class 2 (1,600m) was a welcomed first step in the right direction.\n\nThe easier company and the wet weather boded well for a return to winning ways for the $95 shot.\n\n\"I'm really happy. Everything worked out today,\" said Peters.\n\n\"First of all, he was down in Class 2. It's easier waters. The rain also helped. He was back to a wet track.\"\n\nUnder then-apprentice Simon Kok, Big Hearted famously grew fins on a water-logged track when he came from the clouds to win the Gold Cup in 2020.\n\nBut, Peters said the real key factor for a horse whose heyday may be behind him was the small eight-horse field.\n\n\"A small field made it easier. He's not a million lengths behind, and can then make ground on the leaders better,\" he said.\n\n\"He had a freshen-up. He trialled well (third) last week (Jan 11) and I was confident he would run a good race today.\n\n\"Vitor rode him in that trial. Today, I just told him to settle him where he was comfortable.\n\n\"I knew there'd be pace in the race with Fame Star and Mr Black Back.\n\n\"When I saw him improve between runners at the 600m, I knew he'd be there at the finish.\n\n\"But I wasn't quite sure when he hit the front. For a while, he looked like he couldn't go on with the job, but he kept going.\"\n\nEspindola's win counter may not have gone through the roof since his arrival in November, but that third win - his first in 2024 - showed that the young Brazilian was getting the hang of Singapore racing.\n\n\"He's a good horse. I rode him in his trial and I felt he had improved,\" he said.\n\n\"I was quite confident he would run well today, especially when it rained and the track turned soft.\n\n\"He gave me a good feel in the run after he had a good jump.\n\n\"When I pushed him, he kicked straightaway and finished fast.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/97726fa2e5470df5e5b735e0cd8348fcbbc3582807517d3494fbbae1361d50e6/mlpeters23.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Big Hearted (Vitor Espindola) grinding his way to the line to beat Mr Black Back (Manoel Nunes, obscured) by a neck in the Class 2 race (1,600m) on Jan 20.

Korea's low birth rate, babies are still being sent overseas for adoption\n\nShare this article\n\nSEOUL - Born as Yoon-hwa in South Korea in 1974, she became Petra Zwart of the Netherlands at the age of one.\n\nHer adoptive Dutch family provided a warm and welcoming home to both Ms Zwart and her biological brother, who was adopted at the age of five.\n\nEven so, Ms Zwart recalls finding it difficult to fit in as a child, due to her East Asian appearance being different, \"like an ugly duckling\".\n\nShe and her brother are among the nearly 170,000 babies that South Korea has sent overseas for adoption since 1953.\n\nDespite much criticism of transnational adoption from Korea, it has not stopped. In 2022, some 142 Korean babies were sent abroad.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nDec 12, 2024, 11:50pm\n\n'Suay' to one family, 'pakiam' to another\n\nMore related stories\n\nUpon hearing the latest adoption figures, Ms Zwart could not help but ask: \"Why is this still happening?\n\n\"Now that South Korea has become a prosperous country, and we all know a lot more about the consequences of transracial adoption, knowing it is not always in the best interest of the child, isn't it time to take another approach?\"\n\nSouth Korea, according to one study, ranked fifth globally in terms of the number of children sent abroad for international adoption in 2021.\n\nThe history of the country's international adoptions traces back to 1953 when an estimated 100,000 children were orphaned and homeless in the wake of the Korean War. In exceptional circumstances like that, or in the case of a major disaster, it is not uncommon for a large number of overseas adoptions to occur in a short period of time.\n\nHowever, overseas adoption did not subside in South Korea after stability returned. On the contrary, adoptions boomed in the following decades. At its peak in 1985, 8,837 babies were sent overseas, equivalent to 1.35 per cent of babies born in the country that year.\n\nEven today, although the figures are not as high as before, the country still gives up a large number of its children for international adoption. In 2022, 142 babies were sent away for adoption, down from 755 babies in 2012.\n\nAccording to a study by Dr Peter Selman from Newcastle University in the UK, between 2004 and 2021, South Korea was among the top seven nations that placed children up for transnational adoption, with 16,051 children sent away over that period. In 2021, it ranked fifth, after Colombia, India, Ukraine and Thailand.\n\nOf all children who were given new homes through adoption, international match-ups accounted for some 40 per cent to 44 per cent, with the share remaining more or less stable despite the overall decline in total adoptions worldwide.\n\nExperts assert that while there are clear incentives for private adoption agencies to arrange international adoptions, the government has been inactive about improving child welfare and the broader social situation that leads to babies being given up for adoption.\n\nThey say that this reality has resulted in the bitter irony of South Korea continuing to send babies abroad despite its cripplingly low birth rate.\n\nFour agencies handle international adoptions: Holt Children's Services, the Korea Social Service, Korea Welfare Services and the Eastern Social Welfare Society.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2022, the four agencies sent a combined 1,183 children overseas and received a total of 22.1 billion won ($22.2 million) in commission fees, according to the office of Representative Choi Yeon-sook from the People Power Party, citing information from the Welfare Ministry. On average, the fees received by agencies amounted to 18.7 million won per child.\n\nThose fees were on top of the 2.7 million won the agencies received from the government for each adoption arranged. This amount is the same for domestic and international cases.\n\nSoongsil University social welfare professor Noh Hye-ryun, who worked at Holt in 1981, said overseas adoptions are clearly preferred by South Korea's agencies.\n\n\"Compared with domestic adoption, overseas adoption brings in over 10 times the money with much less work. Adoption agencies also don't have to deal with post-adoption matters because the children are taken care of by cooperating agencies in the country where they are adopted,\" said Professor Noh, adding that with the lack of government oversight, the four adoption agencies had been allowed to profit from baby brokering.\n\n\"Korean babies, who were healthy and young, were sent overseas at the highest prices,\" she said, citing her own analysis of the agencies' adoption paperwork in April 2023. - THE KOREA HERALD/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nAdoption\n\nSouth Korea\n\nparenting\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 6, 2024, 11:22pm\n\nComing to terms with being abandoned at birth\n\nJan 28, 2024, 08:10am\n\nInspired by her mother's birth story, she wrote a book about inter-racial adoptions in S'pore\n\nJan 8, 2024, 07:24am\n\nChildhood BFFs turn out to be siblings\n\nOct 27, 2023, 09:32am\n\nWoman in Russia marries adopted son 31 years her junior\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8adcf88fb103fe5d59b2c05dcf341be6248e170bd03a0b964961d32079b85467/202401210001930.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "South Korea has sent almost 170,000 babies overseas for adoption since 1953.

He subsequently called the police.\n\nThis was not the first time he had alerted police about Yeo's conduct.\n\nIn a separate incident earlier in July 2022, Mr Goh was sweeping the corridor outside his unit while Yeo was leaving her house. An argument broke out between the two.\n\nYeo swore at Mr Goh, took the broomstick he was holding and used it to hit him on his back.\n\nMr Goh responded by pointing his middle finger at Yeo and scolding her, using vulgarities. He made a police report the same day. A harassment charge was brought against her in relation to this incident.\n\nYeo had also once poured an antiseptic liquid, Dettol, on Mr Goh's legs from her window in January 2022. This amounted to another charge of using criminal force on him, according to court documents.\n\nDPP Chin asked for Yeo to be fined $5,000 in total, to deter her from committing further offences against Mr Goh in the future.\n\nFor each offence of voluntarily causing hurt, Yeo could have been jailed for up to three years, or fined a maximum of $5,000.\n\nThe two neighbours are currently embroiled in a separate court harassment case that will be heard at a tribunal on Jan 26, in which Yeo is the claimant.\n\nChristine Tan\n\nneighbours\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:15am\n\nFrom noise complaints to posting photos: The five-year dispute between Woodlands neighbours\n\nApr 23, 2025, 03:35am\n\nCouple forget to switch off air-con before going away; neighbouring flats affected\n\nApr 20, 2025, 10:39pm\n\nBedok South hoarder sleeps at void deck as flat fills up\n\nApr 7, 2025, 12:05am\n\nSembawang resident calls police after seeing flies coming from neighbour's flat\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nBuilding Wealth at Every Age: Essential Strategies for Your 20s, 30s, 40s & Beyond\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/52202035aa88ef458cc48fbf9913634938fcaf3e13176a0bce0d413ea6d4fd79/gavelscales.png?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c8992f327e26db8687fa9a3763f80010db6b1fde30c56367d06ba6a595f727ab/TNPKV37.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "69-year-old woman found dead in Changi flat after days of foul smell", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/30be395c2de1a8dffa52a520b611a612983a6775b25070878ab520688cd6e19e/TNPKV36.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "From noise complaints to posting photos: The five-year dispute between Woodlands neighbours", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

A key concern is that they would not be able to see fare deductions and card balances at fare gates and bus card readers with the switch to SimplyGo.\n\nMr Chee apologised for the delays experienced by commuters who tried to convert their older ez-link cards since Jan 9.\n\nThe Straits Times reported that the SimplyGo app became overwhelmed a day after the news broke, with people unable to use some of the app's features. Passengers also faced difficulties in upgrading their ez-link cards to SimplyGo at ticketing offices and machines at MRT stations and bus interchanges, with the problem persisting into Jan 11.\n\n\"This could have been avoided with better preparation,\" Mr Chee acknowledged, adding that LTA has worked to deal with these issues by updating the SimplyGo app and speeding up the card-conversion process.\n\nThose who updated their ez-link cards to SimplyGo between Jan 9 and Jan 22, or bought SimplyGo-compatible ez-link cards during that period, will be able to exchange their cards for those that rely on the older ticketing system for free, if they prefer.\n\nLTA said details about this card exchange will be made public by the end of February, citing the need for preparation time to minimise inconvenience to passengers.\n\nConcession card holders, such as students and seniors, will also be able to revert to non-SimplyGo cards as part of this exchange.\n\nMr Chee said he has given LTA the task of studying ways to improve account-based ticketing cards. In particular, he has asked the agency to look into possible solutions for these newer cards to display fare deductions and card balances at fare gates and bus card readers.\n\nThe minister noted, however, that for the moment, there is no technical solution to this problem, and Singapore is not alone in facing this issue.\n\nLike SimplyGo, account-based transit cards used in London and Hong Kong do not display fare deductions and card balances at fare gates as well, he said.\n\nEarlier, LTA had said in response to media queries that while it was technically possible for fare and card balance information to be shown at fare gates and bus card readers with SimplyGo, it would take a few seconds to retrieve this information from the back-end system, and slow down the entry and exit of passengers. This would result in longer queues.\n\nWith SimplyGo, the idea was for a user to be able to view fare deductions and balances using a smartphone app, which can notify the user once he or she taps out from a bus or MRT stop.\n\nAlternatively, users can also obtain fare information at ticketing machines at MRT stations and bus interchanges.\n\nOther touted benefits of SimplyGo are that users are able to block further transactions through the app if they lose the cards and top up their travel cards on the move.\n\nYet many who still use older ez-link and Nets FlashPay cards expressed frustration over the reduced functionality that came with switching to SimplyGo.

She had funded the investments with her life savings.\n\nHis other victims included a 49-year-old woman who entered into two investment agreements totalling nearly $120,000 with STC. She funded them by refinancing her home in Malaysia.\n\nThe prosecution said Murali had made false representations to the victims by saying their monies would be invested in STC's moneylending business.\n\nHe typically promised the victims returns of between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent that would be paid out monthly, along with a repayment of their investment capital one year from the date of the investment agreement.\n\nMurali then induced his victims to hand over their money, but completely stopped paying dividends to them in early 2013.\n\nTo date, it is unclear how he had utilised the victims' money, said the prosecutors.\n\nScreenings by the Registry of Moneylenders showed STC had not concluded any moneylending transactions between 2011 and 2013.\n\nThe DPPs told the court: \"Despite the absence of any business activities undertaken by STC, the accused continued to pay the requisite fees to renew STC's moneylending licence with the Registry of Moneylenders.\n\n\"This fortified the accused's representations that STC was a legitimate and live moneylending business.\"\n\nIt is not stated in court documents what happened to STC after 2013.\n\nCourt documents also did not disclose how the offences came to light, but Murali was charged in court in 2019.\n\nThe DPPs had urged the court to sentence him to at least seven years and 10 months' jail.\n\n\"While the accused has claimed to have made some payments of 'investment returns' to the victims, the existence of such payments should be accorded minimal mitigatory weight,\" they said.\n\n\"The returns were paid so as to lend a veneer of legitimacy to the scheme, and to encourage investors to continue pooling money in the scheme.\"\n\nThey also said his offences had involved a high degree of premeditation and planning.\n\nFor each count of cheating, an offender can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/462d81bcde646d0ec2a381022caa64be30f221e2be796561bf48be3754ecaf87/KELL403420copy.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Murali Krishnan Naidu had duped them into thinking that their money would be invested in a moneylending business set up by his wife.", "caption": "Murali Krishnan Naidu had duped them into thinking that their money would be invested in a moneylending business set up by his wife.

This number went up to an average of 3,590 cases daily a week later.\n\nDr Sewa Duu Wen, who heads the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine at the Singapore General Hospital, said the year-end damp weather can create favourable conditions for virus survival.\n\n\"(The) moisture in the air may enhance virus viability and airborne transmission, potentially contributing to the persistence of respiratory infections during the rainy season. There is also some evidence suggesting that lower body temperature may reduce host immunity and predispose one to risk of respiratory tract infections,\" he said.\n\nDr Sewa added that it is possible to contract multiple respiratory viruses successively or even concurrently, as they share similar transmission routes.\n\n\"At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, we noticed a reduction in the rate of other common viral respiratory tract infections due to the highly transmissible Covid-19 strain 'outperforming' other virus infections. Now we are seeing the re-emergence of infections such as influenza. The overlapping symptoms and seasonal nature of these viruses contribute to the increased likelihood of back-to-back infections,\" he said.\n\nOne person who took months to shake off her cough is communications executive Leong Pei Yi, 36. Her cough started in August 2023 from a bout of flu and lingered despite other symptoms going away.\n\n\"It was a thick, phlegmy cough from deep within the lungs, and it lasted about three to four months. I had to use strength to cough and purge the phlegm from my chest every time. Yet the phlegm, which was dark yellow and sometimes green, persisted,\" Ms Leong said.\n\nShe was given flu medication and the decongestant Fluimucil to clear the viscous mucus, but she \"got sicker and the mucus got darker and thicker\".\n\n\"After two courses of antibiotics, the coughing and congestion in the chest did not subside,\" she added.\n\nHer sleep was disrupted as she would wake up a few times during the night. She was overwhelmed by the coughing, which often woke her parents, who are light sleepers, in the next room.\n\n\"I was extremely exhausted all the time and was convinced I was going to die. I found it difficult to function at work as I was constantly worried that the people around me were annoyed or concerned,\" she said.\n\nMs Leong believed her health had been weakened by Covid-19, which she caught in July 2022.\n\n\"The Covid-19 cough then was dry and itchy. It was a hacking sort of cough that would start out of the blue. It also lasted for about four months,\" Ms Leong said.\n\nLike Ms Leong, entrepreneur Vikram Mengi, 54, ended up with a long-drawn, dry and itchy cough that \"started about a week or so\" after he recovered from a Covid-19 infection in December.\n\nAbout the cough, when it was at its worst, he said: \"(It was because of) mucus that dripped and irritated the back of my throat. I could not say it affected my everyday life, except for when I coughed and was being an irritant. I was a bit socially awkward then because, as you know, people seemed concerned when someone coughed.\"\n\nMr Mengi was prescribed Fluimucil and nasal spray \"that should do the job\".\n\nBut he is still coughing, saying: \"It is a slow process.\"\n\nDr Sewa said most respiratory infections are self-limiting and do not lead to prolonged or permanent lung damage. However, a severe lung infection can lead to critically low oxygen level and become a disseminated infection affecting multiple organs, posing a threat to one's survival.\n\n\"The population at risk includes those of extreme ages (very young and very old), patients with multiple health diseases or those with weakened immune systems. Timely medical intervention and appropriate treatment are crucial to prevent lasting lung damage,\" he said.\n\nDr Sewa advised individuals above 65 to prioritise annual influenza vaccinations apart from just taking pneumococcal vaccinations, and to consider other relevant vaccines.\n\nJudith Tan\n\nCorrespondent\n\nSGH/SINGAPORE GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\nPOLYCLINICS\n\ncovid-19\n\nINFLUENZA\n\nGP/GP CLINIC\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nDance your WiFi troubles away with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e6cf1705fdf3df4007828741f1389a1b30cb331bb8cd90cce777c61b5800b887/dw-cough-240122.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "General ps said they saw upticks in the number of patients battling lingering coughs and returning to their clinics repeatedly at the end of 2023.", "caption": "General ps said they saw upticks in the number of patients battling lingering coughs and returning to their clinics repeatedly at the end of 2023.

The rental subsequently would be $50 a month.\n\nThe maid also had the option of getting her phone back by buying it for $1,000, which could be paid in instalments over four months.\n\nPolice investigations revealed that between June and October 2020, the 49-year-old man allegedly carried on a moneylending business without a licence by issuing illegal loans on the premises of his company.\n\nDuring the course of investigations, five bank accounts connected to his alleged criminal activities were frozen and more than $700,000 was seized.\n\nThe man, who was previously convicted of unlicensed moneylending offences, will be charged in court with one count of carrying on a moneylending business without licence.\n\nHe will also be liable for enhanced punishment under the same offence and three counts of acquiring property that represents the benefits from criminal conduct.\n\nThose found guilty of carrying on a moneylending business without licence will be jailed for up to four years, fined between $30,000 and $300,000, and receive up to six strokes of the cane on the first conviction.\n\nIn the case of a second conviction, they can be jailed for up to seven years, fined between $30,000 and $300,000, and receive up to 12 strokes of the cane.\n\nThose convicted of acquiring properties that represent their benefits from criminal conduct can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined up to $500,000.\n\nElaine Lee\n\nSingapore\n\nMONEYLENDING - ILLEGAL\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c756d11ac8614601b4a75330c2f2c424adaf716a5219572a2317ed668d6ad95b/cuffs_15.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3dffca45ca3e48aaf4294aa8e7321533eba807763558babf8bbf0e5a61cfea83/2021101813429777892e2423-c629-486b-a96b-22bba40bd71e.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/20a80f56aaa212cb613c5994295493e8e42f5a22f114bf3961c2d3d0b98ed1f7/egg.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "Passers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

The injuries are believed to be fake.\n\nUnknown to the two victims, the scammers had sent the purported scam education videos to threaten their parents and ask for ransom.\n\nPreliminary investigations by the police revealed that the two suspects had acted on the scammers' instructions to book and rent units for the victims.\n\nThey had also exchanged the victims' mobile phones with new mobile phones and SIM cards, so the victims could not be reached by anyone except the scammers.\n\nPolice investigations into the cases are ongoing. Case exhibits such as the kukri and ropes used in the videos were seized.\n\nThose convicted of cheating can be jailed up to 10 years and fined.\n\nThose convicted of possessing a scheduled weapon can be jailed up to five years and receive a minimum of six strokes of the cane.\n\nThe police said they would like to highlight that overseas law enforcement agencies have no jurisdiction to conduct operations here, arrest anyone or ask members of the public to help with any form of investigations without the approval of the Singapore Government.\n\nIn a separate statement on Jan 20, 397 people are assisting in investigations for their suspected involvement in scams as scammers or money mules.\n\nThe operation was conducted between Jan 1 and 18.\n\nA total of 276 men and 121 women, aged between 15 and 79, are believed to be involved in more than 1,300 cases of scams in which victims reportedly lost over $9.5 million.\n\nThey comprise mainly e-commerce scams, investment scams, job scams, phishing scams, Internet love scams and government officials impersonation scams.\n\nThe suspects are being investigated for alleged offences of cheating, money laundering or providing payment services without a licence.\n\nThose found guilty of cheating can be jailed up to 10 years and fined.\n\nThose found guilty of money laundering can be jailed up to 10 years, fined up to $500,000, or both.\n\nThose found guilty of carrying on a business to provide any type of payment service in Singapore without a licence can be jailed up to three years, fined up to $125,000, or both.\n\nThe police said to avoid being an accomplice to crimes, the public should always reject requests by others to use their bank account or mobile lines as they will be held accountable if those are linked to crimes.\n\nElaine Lee\n\nSingapore\n\nSCAMS\n\nINTERNET CRIMES AND SCAMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nDance your WiFi troubles away with StarHub Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dd4c30db60b35bb0e6518fa9ec9a8e43b2edda5f6183463f6c824f339b69f1c4/hzscam200124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The parents of the two victims received videos of the duo tied up, along with ransom demands.", "caption": "The parents of the two victims received videos of the duo tied up, along with ransom demands.

Some questioned: \"Where did our ministers go?\"\n\nSabah Works Minister Shahelmey Yahya said on Jan 20 that the 40km road leading to the school was actually under construction, reported local media.\n\nHe said the frequent rain has softened the soil structure and made it difficult for construction and maintenance works to be carried out.\n\n\"The contractor informed us that their machinery is at the construction site and will be dispatched to areas where damage always occurs for maintenance,\" he added.\n\nWeather\n\nEXTREME WEATHER\n\nfloods\n\nmalaysia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 17, 2025, 02:45am\n\nWarm, humid nights to continue till end-June; expect thundery showers in the day too\n\nJun 2, 2025, 11:39pm\n\nExpect warm and humid nights in first half of June\n\nMay 5, 2025, 06:20am\n\nFlash floods in Holland, Bukit Timah amid heavy downpour\n\nMay 1, 2025, 07:00am\n\nThundery showers expected on some afternoons in first half of May: Met Service\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 10Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c1e17314bdef1a9932496ff9ae38c7ab726bd2162e969cc51c4e50425fa5eea1/mud.PNG?w=965", "alt_text": "The pupils' faces, hair, clothes and shoes were all stained with mud.", "caption": "The pupils' faces, hair, clothes and shoes were all stained with mud.

Soon after, her parents forced her to marry her then boyfriend before the baby was born.\n\nThe pregnancy came as a shock because the couple used a condom, said Anna (not her real name).\n\nThey have since divorced. Her former husband, who was her first boyfriend, wanted her to get an abortion, but she would not hear of it.\n\n\"I wanted to keep the baby, as I was raised in a very religious household and I felt human life is very important,\" she said. \"To me, I was thinking, what are the chances of a condom failing? It (the pregnancy) felt like destiny.\"\n\nShe started having sex when she was 15, as she felt she could not refuse her then boyfriend's demands for sex.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 03:23am\n\nJail for man, 32, who tricked minor into sex for $700, never paid up\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"It just felt that I had to make him happy, or he would leave me,\" she said. \"Many of my friends say they don't know if they like having sex, but they feel it's more of an obligation and how a relationship should be.\"\n\nThat was how Anna became a mother and a wife at the age of 17, while studying for a diploma in marketing.\n\nAnna already had thoughts of breaking up with her then boyfriend, as she felt he was abusive. Then, she learnt she was pregnant.\n\nShe said that her parents pushed her to marry him so she would not have the child out of wedlock. He was three years older and also a polytechnic student then.\n\nAnna agreed, as she felt she had no other choice.\n\nDespite all her struggles, she pulled through those difficult years of juggling motherhood, studying and working.\n\nNow 22 years old, she is working as an analyst in a multinational firm, and her daughter turns five in 2024.\n\nThe number of babies born to teenagers has halved in the past decade, and counsellors say this is largely because today's teens are a lot more savvy about using contraception.\n\nIn 2022, 218 babies were born to teens aged 19 and younger.\n\nThis is fewer than half of the 487 babies born to teenagers in 2013, according to the Report of Registration of Births and Deaths 2022 published by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA). The 2022 figures are the latest available.\n\nAnna said she felt \"very alone\" throughout her pregnancy and in raising her daughter.\n\nShe has a strained relationship with her mother, who is often drunk and takes drugs. Her parents are divorced, although she has a good relationship with her stepfather.\n\nShe also found out her former husband cheated on her with her best friend after they tied the knot.\n\nHe hardly took care of their daughter, leaving Anna to be effectively a single mother. She had no financial support from him or her parents.\n\nShe had to work multiple jobs - on top of studying - to earn money to raise her daughter and put herself through school. She took on jobs such as telemarketing, conducting surveys and other work that could be performed remotely.\n\nIn the day, her daughter attended childcare when Anna was in school or working. At night, her neighbours, who are like family to her, helped to look after her daughter when Anna was too busy or tired.\n\n\"I was going through so much mentally and emotionally that I felt burnt out,\" she said. \"Being a mum, being a student, being a worker, and just showing up and giving my 100 per cent for everything.\"\n\nWhat got her through that period was support from Babes Pregnancy Crisis Support, a charity that provides support to pregnant teens.\n\nApart from counselling and emotional support, the group helped her practically by linking her up with other agencies that could provide aid and giving her baby items such as diapers and a pram.\n\nAnna also had financial aid from the Government, and free food and other supplies from various community groups. A lecturer from the school she used to attend and her close friends are also part of her support network.\n\nHer daughter gave her strength to keep going.\n\n\"I have found courage and resilience since I gave birth, and I was very determined to complete my diploma. I wanted her to be proud of her mum,\" she said. \"She has brought so many blessings to me.\"\n\nWhen she turned 21, she divorced her husband, as she did not want her daughter to grow up in a dysfunctional family like she did.\n\nAnna has since remarried, and has a six-month-old son with her current husband.\n\nShe wishes that there are more open conversations for young people about issues concerning sex.\n\nShe said: \"The sex education I had in school was very focused on abstinence, which I felt was not realistic, given that teens are very curious and they want to explore at that age. While sex education touches on contraception, I feel that they have to tell us more about reproductive health and how to handle difficult situations.\"\n\nShe wants teenagers facing a pregnancy crisis to know that they are not alone.\n\n\"Even if you feel that your own family have turned their backs on you, there are people out there who will support you if you reach out (for help),\" she said.\n\nTheresa Tan\n\nSenior Social Affairs Correspondent\n\npregnancy\n\nAbortion\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 09:43am\n\n'She had 3 abortions': S'pore social worker opens up about helping pregnant teens\n\nJun 19, 2025, 07:18am\n\nZika cases detected in Woodlands: What you need to know about the virus\n\nApr 9, 2025, 07:35am\n\nInfluencer Simonboy welcomes baby boy after wife's 45-hour labour\n\nMar 29, 2025, 11:08pm\n\nIVF gives hope to woman after miscarriages, ectopic pregnancy\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7cb8224a30c6d7641da2386c747c0f8fa62f06b280299b4b22fc9ca4bc20fe07/hands-68319441280.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Her boyfriend wanted her to get an abortion, but Anna felt human life is precious.

The 2022 figures are the latest available.\n\nMeanwhile, when The Straits Times asked the Health Ministry about teen abortions in the past decade, a spokesman said the incidence rate of abortions has remained largely unchanged at about two in 1,000 teens from 2018 to 2022.\n\nThe issue of teen pregnancy came up during a recent court case where a 15-year-old girl became pregnant after having sex with a 14-year-old boy. Concealing the pregnancy from their parents, they tried to abort the foetus on their own.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 14, 2024, 09:14am\n\nLocal influencer confuses family control pills, slammed for ignorance\n\nMore related stories\n\nTheir methods, which they found online, included the girl inserting a clothes hanger into her body in an attempt to pull the foetus out, taking abortion pills, and having her abdomen punched and kneed by the boy.\n\nThe girl gave birth to a stillborn son in 2021.\n\nShe kept the body of her stillborn child in her cabinet for two days before burying him in the garden of her house at her boyfriend's instigation.\n\nIn December 2023, the boy was found guilty of sexual penetration of a minor and abetting the girl in concealing the birth by burying the child. The boy, who is now 18, is awaiting sentencing.\n\nST understands that the girl has been given a conditional warning for her role in the case.\n\nCounsellors said a key reason behind the fall in the number of teen mums is that today's young people are more savvy about using contraception.\n\nMs Shazana Sharif, a social worker at AMP Singapore, a non-profit serving the Muslim community, said: \"Generally, there has been an improvement in teens' knowledge and the use of contraception compared to previous generations.\n\n\"Increased access to information through the Internet, comprehensive sex education programmes, and greater awareness of contraception methods have contributed to teenagers being more informed.\"iFrameResize();\n\nCounsellors said the falling numbers should not be interpreted as fewer teens having sex.\n\nIn fact, teens are starting to be sexually active at a younger age, and some counsellors even see pregnant teens as young as 13 asking for help, they said.\n\nMs Lena Teo, director of programmes and services at Care Singapore, which helps at-risk youth, said that with the proliferation of social media and online pornography, sexual behaviour has become normalised.\n\nShe added: \"To certain groups of youth - but not for all teens - they want to appear cool, to be in the know, and they are looking for acceptance (from their friends).\n\n\"It is seen as cool to have sexual experience, especially for the boys. For the girls, they feel they are loved and wanted if they have a boyfriend, and it's like their sense of self-worth goes up.\"\n\nBut in the event of a pregnancy, counsellors said, some teens try to terminate it without going to a doctor for various reasons.\n\nThey fear the repercussions if their parents, school or the authorities were to find out about the pregnancy.\n\nFor example, the male partner could be afraid of getting into trouble with the law if it is known that the girl is pregnant, said Mrs Jennifer Heng, director of Safe Place, which helps pregnant women in distress.\n\nIt is an offence to have sex with a person under the age of 16, even if the person consents to it. If the girl is under 14, the offence is called statutory rape.\n\nMs Shazana said that another fear some young couples have is that their parents would force them to marry, so they do not have the child out of wedlock.\n\nA spokeswoman for Babes Pregnancy Crisis Support, a charity which supports pregnant teens, said some young people resort to unsafe methods or substances in their bid to terminate the pregnancy as they cannot afford to pay for an abortion at a clinic or hospital, which can cost between $800 and $5,000.\n\nShe said: \"Some may be reluctant to disclose their situation to their parents due to various reasons, including fear of judgment, cultural stigmas, or strained relationships. This fear may lead to delays in seeking medical assistance and, in turn, increase the risks associated with unsafe practices.\"\n\nTo prevent teens from resorting to unsafe ways to abort the foetus, counsellors said that sex education is crucial.\n\nThe Babes spokeswoman said there is a need to strengthen reproductive and sexual health education in schools so that teens are well-informed about the consequences of getting pregnant, the legal framework surrounding sexual activity and safe methods for handling unplanned pregnancies.\n\nCounsellors added that parents also need to have more open conversations with their children regarding relationships and sex, even if it is hard to broach such topics.\n\nIf you are facing a pregnancy crisis and need help, you can contact:\n\n1.

After taking photographs of Ms Ponnalagu, she did an acrylic painting of her, which took over two months.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:12am\n\n'I lived on Pulau Samulun, now Jurong Shipyard': Musician remembers life before reclamation\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"I'm happy that she has done a good job,\" said Ms Ponnalagu, 43, looking at the 100cm by 70cm painting of herself. \"People always come and take my pictures or ask about my garlands. I'm like an Indian culture ambassador.\"\n\nShe takes 10 minutes to make a simple garland, a craft she learnt by observing others over a decade ago. The garlands are used for prayers and weddings, and as hair adornments.\n\n\"There are fewer people doing this now,\" said Ms Ponnalagu. \"My three children will come to help out, but won't take over this stall.\"\n\nMr Tan Ah Hock, owner of Sin Hoe Hin Joss Paper Dealer in Chin Swee Road, is another artisan Ms Miwa featured. The 70-year-old learnt to make paper replicas of items at the age of nine from his grandfather and father. He hopes to pass on his business to his engineer son Vincent, 35.\n\n\"I wanted to put on a shirt for the painting, but Ms Miwa said I should appear as my normal self,\" said Mr Tan, who toils topless over his papercrafts of items such as houses, cars and figurines.\n\nThese items are burnt during funerals and Chinese ancestral worship ceremonies.\n\n\"This is a dying art, with only about 20 artisans left,\" said Mr Tan. \"Some people import joss paper products from overseas now, but the workmanship may not be as good.\"\n\nMs Miwa, who speaks English and Mandarin, has also painted a traditional kopitiam owner, a Taoist deity statue maker, a cheongsam tailor and a Peranakan shoemaker.\n\nHer upcoming subjects include a Chinese cultural antique and vintage instrument seller, a string puppet performer and a maker of fire dragons, which are made of straw and burnt in temple rituals.\n\nShe hopes to uncover more unique skills and traditions that make up the rich tapestry of Singapore's cultural identity.\n\nMs Miwa, who declined to give her age, started painting at the age of three and enrolled in Tama Art University in Tokyo to study theatre and art. After working as a radio and television announcer in Tokyo, she came to Singapore in 2012 and rediscovered her love of painting.\n\nShe has done commissioned works, such as portraits of people, and paintings of animals and nature. She currently has an exhibition at the Singapore Polo Club featuring horses and nature.\n\nMs Miwa plans to have her Singapore Cultural Series culminate with an exhibition and a guided tour to watch her artisan subjects at work.\n\n\"People should be able to smell the flowers and coffee, and feel the energy and vibes, which cannot be done through paintings,\" she said. \"I want to inspire their five senses through the tours.\"\n\nShe gets help from friends such as heritage enthusiast Victor Yue to find her artisans.\n\n\"I help anyone who is interested in our heritage, and she has the skills to help these craftsmen leave a legacy behind through her paintings,\" said Mr Yue. \"We should be like Japan, where the heritage artisans are treated like national treasures.\"\n\nMs Miwa is grateful for the help she has received from Singaporeans, including the craftsmen. \"They are all so welcoming,\" she said. \"I am so privileged to see their work up close, and have them share their stories with me.\"\n\nThe artisans wondered why she was interested in them. \"They said they are very ordinary, but I told them they are extraordinary people who have been dedicated to their crafts for so long,\" she said.\n\nAs an artist, Ms Miwa shares a special connection with the artisans. \"Sometimes, people only notice the tradition when it's gone,\" she said. \"I love Singapore very much, and I hope to contribute by capturing Singaporean culture.\"\n\nMr Alvin Tan, deputy chief executive of policy and community at the National Heritage Board, told The Straits Times that in this digital age, Ms Miwa's efforts to get to know Singapore's intangible cultural heritage practitioners and document their crafts through the medium of art are commendable.\n\n\"With her paintings, Ms Tsuyumi Miwa joins the ranks of artists who have captured and celebrated different aspects of Singapore's heritage, and we hope that her efforts will inspire others to join us in safeguarding and promoting our heritage for present and future generations.\"\n\nChin Soo Fang\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nSINGAPORE HERITAGE\n\nNational Heritage Board\n\nARTISTS\n\nTraditional arts\n\nculture\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:34am\n\nPoster power: Singapore's vintage election memorabilia in the spotlight\n\nApr 22, 2025, 07:29am\n\nBrewing new love for bak kut teh at Singapore HeritageFest 2025\n\nFeb 2, 2025, 12:03am\n\nHeritageSG to make archaeology more accessible to the public\n\nJan 17, 2025, 03:21am\n\nNew community space at Rail Corridor might showcase heritage, history\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/db5815b5cfa90b0f96e3167a22afca9b3c644ff6eb6ce132424b45431aac1519/DSC1197.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Japanese artist Tsuyumi Miwa aims to showcase unique skills in Singapore that are at risk of disappearing.

Flood-affected farmers need to register with their respective district agriculture department so that data collected can be used to approve aid to those eligible.\n\n\"We will strive to deliver assistance as quickly as possible so that they can quickly return to operating their farms before the next flood season returns,\" he told reporters after participating in a walkabout programme in Sungai Atong on Jan 20.\n\nAt the event, 22 agri-food farmers cultivating crops such as sugar cane received agricultural input help, including fertiliser and pesticides, as well as agri-food kits, which are expected to lighten their burden to resume farming.\n\nDatuk Arthur said the Agriculture Department will also conduct a study to help farmers in flood-prone areas reduce losses during the monsoon season.\n\n\"Among things that can be done is to reintroduce corn cultivation as this area was cultivated with the crop before being managed with other crops more recently.\n\n\"Corn is a short-duration crop where farmers can start planting in February every year and harvest twice before September to reduce losses due to year-end floods,\" he said. - THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nAGRICULTURE/FARMING\n\nmalaysia\n\nWeather\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e39f06727b1f45897fbf71eb4afe6c9fe57438e1d102204b357c9fe5178fa746/2501807.png?w=965", "alt_text": "Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Food Security Arthur Joseph Kurup (centre) inspecting crops during a visit to a chilli and eggplant farming project in Felda Sungai Panching Selatan.", "caption": "Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Food Security Arthur Joseph Kurup (centre) inspecting crops during a visit to a chilli and eggplant farming project in Felda Sungai Panching Selatan.

In the same site, four 36-storey HDB blocks that were completed in 2018 sit next to the two blocks.\n\nThe two blocks - located behind the iconic dragon playground - are being demolished.\n\nRetired taxi driver Ang Tiau Hong, 84, opted to move into a two-room rental flat in Bidadari with his wife instead of remaining in Toa Payoh as they wanted a newer flat that would require less maintenance.\n\n\"I like living in Toa Payoh, but the flats are very old, everything is yellowing and needs to be repaired. In Bidadari, the toilet pipes and electrical wires are all new,\" said Mr Ang, who is now paying $50 a month in rent, up from $44 when he was living in Toa Payoh.\n\n\"The only thing is food at the nearby shopping mall is too expensive, so I prefer to take one of the three buses to Toa Payoh to have my meals,\" he added.\n\nHDB said tenants were given $2,500 in rehousing allowance to help defray the cost of moving. Tenants who relocated to towns farther away were given an additional $2,500 in rental credits.\n\nThose who were ready to buy their first flats received a $15,000 relocation grant on top of other housing grants they were eligible for, said HDB.\n\nTenants were first informed of the relocation exercise in July 2021 by HDB officers who went door to door to explain their rehousing options and benefits.\n\nMr Gary Woo, senior estate manager at HDB's rental housing department, said the large-scale relocation project required close coordination among several public and social service agencies.\n\n\"Many seniors lived in the two blocks, so naturally there were some concerns and anxieties,\" he said.\n\n\"Along with our partners on the ground, we all worked towards the same goal of ensuring as seamless a journey as possible for the tenants and no one is left behind.\"\n\nRetired regional director Ang Hock Pho was among 13 volunteers from the Singapore University of Social Sciences Gerontology Student and Alumni Community who helped 50 to 60 vulnerable seniors in their relocation process, including the collection of keys and inspection of their new place.\n\n\"For seniors, moving homes is already stressful.

man, 23, was a Woodlands Health nurse deployed to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital at the time of the offence, police said in a statement on Jan 21.\n\nHe was arrested after a former patient at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital discovered multiple unauthorised transactions made using his bank card details and lodged a police report.\n\nWhile hospitalised, the victim had woken up when he noticed an unknown man rifling through his belongings, but he could not check on his things as he was in a drowsy state then.\n\nOfficers from the Jurong Police Division investigated the matter after the police report was lodged, identified the nurse and arrested him.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 05:24am\n\nJail, caning for immigration offender who gave $36k in bribes\n\nMore related

said.\n\nThe man had misused the trust expected of a staff member of a health institution, accessed the banking details of his patients, even through their phones, and so \"committed a myriad of offences\", they added.\n\nHe faces amalgamated charges of cheating and unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate theft, on top of charges of unauthorithised modifications to a computer and unauthorised access to computer material.\n\nIf found guilty of cheating, he may be fined and imprisoned for up to 10 years.\n\nIf found guilty of theft, he may be fined, imprisoned for up to three years, or both.\n\nIf found guilty of unauthorised modification of computer material, he may be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to three years, or both.\n\nIf found guilty of unauthorised access to computer material, he may be fined up to $5,000, jailed for up to two years, or both.\n\nIf found guilty of access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of an offence, he may be fined up to $50,000, jailed for up to 10 years, or both.\n\nIn September 2023, a 38-year-old nurse from Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital was sentenced to six months' jail for stealing her colleagues' debit cards.\n\nShe had filched their cards in the staff changing room and used them to buy hotpot and bird's nest.\n\nCarmen Sin\n\npolice\n\ncrime\n\nnursing\n\nShare this

But beyond the scars that remain long after the races, Singapore kayaker Stephenie Chen also had to endure the anguish of missing out on an Olympic spot by less than a second - twice.\n\nIn a bid to banish those demons, the 32-year-old has been hard at work on the Gold Coast in Australia as she prepares for the April 18-21 Asian canoe sprint Olympic qualifiers in Tokyo.\n\nTwo quota places - up from just one at the last qualifiers - are up for grabs as kayakers seek qualification for the Paris Games.\n\nAt the Asian Olympic qualifiers in Pattaya in May 2021, Chen missed out on a quota spot in the women's singles K1 500m by just 0.938 of a second. She was second in 1min 54.649sec, with the winner, Kazakhstan's Natalya Sergeyeva, clinching the sole spot.\n\nIt went even more agonisingly close a day later in the K1 200m, with a mere 0.067sec standing between her and a ticket to the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nOct 23, 2024, 11:05pm\n\nMaeder to save, invest $250,000 earned for Paris 2024 bronze\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe was third in 40.325sec, behind Kazakhstan's Inna Klinova (40.123sec) and Japan's Yuka Ono (40.258sec). As Kazakhstan had already clinched an Olympic spot, Ono claimed the K1 200m quota spot.\n\nOn the double whammy of 2021, Chen said: \"It just made me a bit angrier. It made me really want to do better the next time. I missed out on both events by one place, so that was not fun.\n\n\"But I know that you can have losses, and that makes the wins a lot better. It did hurt, but I took learning lessons from all of my races and tried to improve.\"\n\nThe improvement brought about a historic achievement in Hangzhou last October, when Chen won a maiden Asian Games silver.\n\n\"The performance at the Asian Games just shows me that I'm on the right track. But you don't want to count your chickens before they hatch and Asia always has surprises. It is not a shoo-in for me to qualify, but the chances are good,\" said Chen, who is looking to qualify in the K1 500m.\n\nAnother Singapore canoeist Lucas Teo is in the same boat, not literally, but the 33-year-old is just as determined to book his first Olympic spot.\n\nAs part of his preparation for April's qualifiers, he took part in the Singapore Canoe Marathon at the Sports Hub's Water Sports Centre, where close to 800 participants competed in the two-day event.\n\nWhile he is looking to secure an Olympic spot in the men's K1 1,000m, competing in the marathon allowed him to have a winning experience as he clinched the K1 28km event in 2hr 18min 9sec on Jan 20, ahead of 22 competitors.\n\nLike Chen, Teo's confidence was boosted at the Asiad, where he finished fifth out of nine in 3min 56.235sec, less than 5sec behind the bronze medallist.\n\nA year earlier, Teo had won his second individual SEA Games canoeing gold - seven years after his first - in the men's K1 1,000m in Hanoi.\n\nTeo, who has been part of the national team since he was 16, said the difference between him and his Asiad rivals was power and strength. To close the gap, he has religiously hit the gym to beef up, while balancing his day job as a canoe coach.\n\nAsked about his qualification chances, he said: \"I will truly know only when I'm at the start line.

The key is to continue to do what works and build on the success.\n\n\"For our men, Lucas' timing in Hangzhou was positive and very close to the top three.

This will slow down the pace of price growth in 2024, which will benefit home buyers,\" he said.\n\nMichelle Ng\n\nHousing Correspondent\n\nSINGAPORE PROPERTY\n\nPROPERTY PRICES\n\nPRIVATE PROPERTY\n\nPROPERTY MARKET/SECTOR\n\nCONDOMINIUMS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:31am\n\nDislodged tiles, sharp edges in Sengkang exec condo pools\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:03am\n\n1 in 4 rental listings on PropertyGuru welcome to all regardless of race and gender\n\nMay 9, 2025, 12:04am\n\nProperty buyer loses $590k suit against real estate agent, ERA in rare case of size disparity\n\nMay 2, 2025, 05:12am\n\nThey tried to disrupt property agents - and built a top blog instead\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f2172ffae055940e1accc5c357efe166fba684d267cdefd217362f3622044dad/HP02-North-Facing-Resized.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Hillhaven in Hillview Rise sold 59 units of the 179 units launched at prices starting from $1,903 psf.", "caption": "Hillhaven in Hillview Rise sold 59 units of the 179 units launched at prices starting from $1,903 psf.

It earned him a spot in the semi-finals, where he clocked 2:38.401 for third place and a berth in the B final.\n\nThe top two from the three semi-finals make the A final, while the next two finishers qualify for the B final. Ryo eventually finished 13th overall (2:46.823) in the event won by South Korea's Joo Jae-hee.\n\nHe said: \"I did not think I would make it to the finals - even making it to the semi-finals was quite an achievement...\n\n\"I was quite shocked and I was quite unprepared because I didn't expect it. I thought the standard would be too different but I realised they are around my level, so I had to focus and fight with them.\n\n\"Most of the international competitions I've taken part in are World Cups and world championships, where it's mainly senior skaters skating so their level is much higher than mine.\n\n\"But in this competition, the skaters are much closer to my level so I have to strategise and fight, so it's really intense.\"\n\nStrategising for his races required him to observe his rivals and what they did in their races.\n\nFor example, Ryo noted how the South Koreans would usually sit back before sprinting in the final few laps, while some European skaters would push themselves throughout the race.\n\nThat influenced how he approached his races - whether to take it slow at first or starting strong.\n\nOn Jan 21, he finished 26th in the 1,000m and is hoping to wrap up his campaign by beating his personal best of 43.161sec in the 500m the following day.\n\nCompatriot and fellow short track speed skater Amelia Chua, who was 28th and 31st in the women's 1,000m and 1,500m respectively, will also race in the 500m event.\n\nFor now, Ryo wants to make the most of his time in South Korea.\n\nOutside the rink, he has been enjoying the wide variety at the village's food hall and taking part in game sessions for the athletes.\n\nHe even had a snowball fight with some of his fellow athletes.\n\nRyo said: \"I won't get this experience again, so this is something that I will treasure while I'm here.\"\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nWINTER SPORTS\n\nSINGAPORE ATHLETES\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nOLYMPIC WINTER GAMES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 25, 2024, 01:47pm\n\nTwice's Jihyo and Physical: 100 star Yun Sung-bin said to be dating\n\nJan 18, 2024, 09:37am\n\nSkater Amelia Chua gets her dream debut at Winter YOG\n\nDec 14, 2023, 09:25am\n\nAmelia Chua secures second spot for Singapore at 2024 Winter Youth Olympic Games\n\nNov 15, 2023, 09:00am\n\nMan arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after UK ice hockey player's death\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nNew diverse jeans everyone’s wearing, from slim to wide fits\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7ae5300e343684eff725d5c2a2a07d52e2bf858a5fa835b637a1111d9aec3c1b/CSJ2880xcBH0gh320240120012138.JPG.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Ryo Ong is the first Singaporean to make the finals of a short track speed skating event at the Winter Youth Olympic Games.", "caption": "Ryo Ong is the first Singaporean to make the finals of a short track speed skating event at the Winter Youth Olympic Games.

Per capita income is derived from the total monthly nett household income divided by the number of household members.\n\nWith the increase of the criterion from $1,000 to $1,600 from January 2024, 11,000 - or 12 per cent - more Indian families in Singapore are expected to benefit.\n\nSinda supports about 25,000 beneficiaries across its range of programmes and support initiatives, of which about 60 per cent use the per capita income criterion.\n\nThe programmes using the per capita income criterion include the Sinda Tutorials for Enhanced Performance, a subsidised tuition programme, and bursaries for pre-school to tertiary students.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nSep 29, 2022, 02:43pm\n\nFairPrice donates $40,000 to Sinda to help needy students ahead of Deepavali\n\nSinda said $5 million more is projected to be spent in 2024 to support households because of the larger pool of people qualifying for its financial assistance schemes and programmes. It has set aside additional funds to ensure it can meet the needs of a larger number of beneficiaries.\n\nSpeaking to the media at Sinda's appreciation tea on Jan 21 at Gardens by the Bay, Ms Indranee Rajah, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, noted that Sinda is bringing its programmes, subsidies and bursaries to a much larger group of people.\n\nShe added: \"We are also very mindful of the fact that the cost of living has increased over the years. So we want to make sure that no one's left behind. So we've essentially widened the net, and we hope that more people will receive assistance this way.\"\n\nIn her speech at the event, Ms Indranee said Sinda arrived at the new $1,600 ceiling by looking at Singaporeans' income distribution.\n\nShe noted that the 20th percentile of monthly household income from work per household member was $1,623, as at 2022.\n\n\"So, Sinda's revised the (per capita income criterion) to include a broader income band, and this aligns with Sinda's intention and goal to serve the lower-earning bands of our community,\" she said.\n\nShe added that middle-income groups will also have access to essential support and be able to enjoy full fee waivers when they enrol in Sinda programmes.\n\nOffice administrator Pavitra Rajendran, 31, and her husband, Mr Vinotha Karunakaran, 35, who works as a planner in an oil and gas company, are among those who will benefit.\n\nThey have three children, aged five and three, and eight months. One of them has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, and attends both a mainstream school and a special needs school.\n\nMs Pavitra said the family is unsure what other costs it may need to incur with regard to this child in future. With the change to Sinda's criterion, the couple now qualify for bursaries that will ease some of the family's burden.\n\nSaid Ms Pavitra: \"It will help reduce our financial burden. We are in the centre (in terms of our income level), not in the low, nor the high.

{"article_url": "https://www.tnp.sg/sports/tennis/players-produce-works-art-rainy-sunday", "site_title": "Players produce works of art on a rainy Sunday", "publish_date": "2024-01-21T23:34:00", "content": "Aryna Sabalenka produces some powerful ballet in the fourth round of the Australian Open.\n\nPHOTO: EPA-EFE\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 21, 2024, 11:34pm\n\nPlayers produce works of art on a rainy Sunday\n\nShare this article\n\nA lonesome racket lies on the surface of Margaret Court arena. Gently thrown. Forgotten by the defeated Amanda Anisimova who has left the court and soon the Open. The racket lies there like a stringed symbol of despair and frustration. This game hurts all the time.\n\nA day at these courts is never about justice. Nothing feels fair. Adrian Mannarino played so bravely across three five-set matches and his reward is Novak Djokovic who starts their match 6-0, 6-0. The only way the tequila-slugging Frenchman gets to overthrow the Serb is if there's a drinking contest at changeovers. Ah but Djokovic, tennis' austere conqueror, doesn't consume alcohol. Just sips at immortality.\n\nThe second week at a Slam is precious as talent starts to thin out slowly. \"Nothing is easy,\" said the Serb who makes it look precisely like that. Rain falls on a greying Sunday like a sullen drip. The defeated take their pay cheques and leave the premises, suddenly irrelevant to proceedings and yet sometimes forever altered. Maria Timofeeva lost to Marta Kostyuk, but the world No. 170 takes home applause and 8,000 more Instagram followers after an earlier win. \"That's crazy,\" she had said.\n\nGrand Slams events in the fourth round remind me of vast, great libraries. There's still something to suit everyone's taste. Stefanos Tsitsipas' one-handed backhand can be erratic but it has such flourish. Mannarino's racket resembles a set square while Aryna Sabalenka's racket should be registered at an armoury. The game's variety has somewhat deteriorated but it hasn't lost it entirely.\n\nThe drama isn't just in the shots but the anticipation. Organisers want to protect players' privacy but cameras are aimed everywhere. Anisimova ties her shoelaces, Sabalenka jogs in the corridor. Abba plays, though really these big-hitting women deserve rock. At one point, as Anisimova walks past Sabalenka downstairs, the latter wears a half-smile but the former walks past her without looking. Hardly rudeness, merely a competitor taking refuge in a zone of concentration.\n\nOn the next court, Rod Laver creeps quietly into the arena named after him. The cameras catch him and a roar of respect echoes. He's wondering what the fuss is about, then sights himself on the screen and can barely get himself to wave. He's all 1.73m of modesty, Sabalenka (1.82m) and Anisimova (1.80m) are towers of talent.\n\nThe average height of Singapore men - according to worlddata.info - is 1.73m. The average height of Sunday's eight fourth-round women is almost 1.75m. Power is a switch only some can produce on easy command. After winning the first set 6-3, Sabalenka was 0-30 while serving at 3-2. Her response was serves at 170kmh (wide), 185, 195 and 185. Match over.\n\nSo much we can see - the shots, the faces - and so much we might never know. Kostyuk, the Ukrainian, said she hadn't been sleeping well for days and who would know this. Everyone is playing for something and struggling with something.  \"COME ON\" - Tsitsipas' desperate roar seemed to rise from his gut, but his first Grand Slam still eludes him.\n\nThe rain tipped down and players waited. Rhythm comes and then flutters away like the bird trapped in the stadium. Fans tittered but players find interruptions foul. Djokovic spoke of the wrestle with greatness and said: \"Especially the guys at the top, they want to move the bar at least for 1 or 2 per cent, or try different things, maybe,  disguise their flaws in the game and improve them so they're not as exposed in certain shots.\"\n\nRust, doubt, insecurity, form are usual adversaries in sport but Kostyuk's fight is unique. In another time, Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson and Arthur Ashe took an inspiring stance against bigotry even as they competed. Sport is not always as simple as serving stats and counting winners. Kostyuk thinks people's attention has slipped away from her nation and she, full of long, thoughtful, answers, is a sneakered ambassador.\n\n\"I have to go through all the information (on the war) myself,\" explained Kostyuk, \"and see what's the best way to present it to people so they understand it in the easiest way. It's an extra duty that I have that I don't think other players have. I mean from other countries.\"\n\nNo scrap in sport, of course, is equally provocative. Animisova's great struggle has been to find happiness. Gifted and celebrated, she found fame suffocating and has been out of the game for eight months, for mental health reasons, and at 22 is making a return. The young in sport learn fast. The American quit tennis, went to college, painted to soothe herself and a fourth-round Australian Open place is remarkable.\n\nThe thrown racket was not insulting. It was defiance, desperation and perhaps in a way a tennis painter's respectful surrender to Sabalenka. Who is, of course, a work of art.\n\nRohit Brijnath\n\nAssistant Sports Editor\n\nAUSTRALIAN OPEN (TENNIS)\n\nWOMEN'S TENNIS\n\nnovak djokovic\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nUNIQLO\n\nNew diverse jeans everyone’s wearing, from slim to wide fits\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c4d6aa32f8957c97797df286372ad4c992195037f903c96c3f8e65dab1484721/11093174.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Aryna Sabalenka produces some powerful ballet in the fourth round of the Australian Open.", "caption": "Aryna Sabalenka produces some powerful ballet in the fourth round of the Australian Open.

The Vic Open is also a mixed-field event.\n\nTan had enjoyed some outstanding outings as an amateur.\n\nThey included becoming just the second Singaporean to win on the China Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour when she lifted the Singapore Ladies Masters title at Laguna National Golf Resort Club in July 2023.\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nWomen's golf\n\nGolf tournaments\n\nGolf players\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nExperience ultra smooth 10Gbps Broadband + WiFi 7 connectivity\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/2db00de374ca4900a4191c7ed5f16adf6ebb311a65065c0d2f25354c6bdf665d/hztan210124.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Shannon Tan finished second at the Jan 18-21 Webex Players Series Murray River, her first tournament as a professional.", "caption": "Shannon Tan finished second at the Jan 18-21 Webex Players Series Murray River, her first tournament as a professional.

A cluster of people lighting up at a makeshift smoking corner, mere steps from where people dine.\n\nThe National Environment Agency (NEA) told The Straits Times that smoking is currently not permitted at more than 49,000 places, both indoors and outdoors.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 4, 2025, 11:41pm\n\nDiner telling off man smoking at food centre gets finger burnt while arguing\n\nMore related stories\n\nTo limit the impact of second-hand tobacco smoke on non-smokers, smoking corners are typically placed at peripheral sections of outdoor refreshment areas and are limited to 20 per cent of these spaces, the agency added.\n\nNEA has stopped accepting applications for new smoking corners at retail food establishments since June 2017, and such smoking corners will be phased out when licences of the establishments are terminated or cancelled, it said.\n\nSmoking is also prohibited at \"any area within 5m of ventilation intakes, external windows, openings, entrances and exits to buildings of commercial, industrial or recreational purposes or publicly accessible\", according to NEA's website.\n\nNEA told ST that its officers actively check and take enforcement action against errant smokers, including for littering, with more than 14,600 tickets issued in 2023 for smoking in prohibited places.\n\nBut smoking is allowed in certain areas, such as open areas in residential estates and town centres.\n\nIn response to queries, the agency said: \"There is no prohibition for makeshift smoking points, as long as the smoking points are not smoking-prohibited places under the Smoking Regulations.\"\n\nFollowing a complaint about a makeshift smoking corner near an Upper Serangoon Crescent coffee shop on the Complaint Singapore Facebook group, ST visited 12 coffee shops in areas including Bendemeer, Bedok, Chinatown and Bukit Panjang, as well as the one at Upper Serangoon Crescent.\n\nMakeshift smoking corners were found near almost all the coffee shops, some close to sheltered walkways. These corners were marked with plastic chairs, benches and the occasional foldable table. Even during off-peak hours, smokers were occasionally seen sitting in the area puffing away at several of these corners. During peak hours, large groups of people can be observed smoking at some of these corners.\n\nWhile checking out coffee shops in various areas, ST also observed that makeshift smoking zones are frequently strewn with cigarette butts, empty cigarette packets and foil papers typically found inside cigarette boxes.\n\nMeanwhile, it was claimed in the Complaint Singapore post that the makeshift smoking corner near the Upper Serangoon Crescent coffee shop had blocked a fire engine access route.\n\nWhen ST visited the coffee shop on Jan 3, a notice from the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, dated Dec 28, 2023, was placed at the smoking corner. It warned against blocking the access route with chairs and other items.\n\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), responding to queries, stated that as at Jan 9, no fire safety violations were found at the location.\n\nNEA told ST that it \"encourages smokers to be socially responsible when smoking at public places, and to not light up at smoking-prohibited places\".\n\n\"Owners of premises should also be considerate when allowing makeshift smoking corners to be set up,\" it added.\n\nVihanya Rakshika\n\nand\n\nElaine Lee\n\nSmoking\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nSINGAPORE SOCIETY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 8, 2025, 09:07am\n\nSE Asia's youth choose vapes over cigarettes\n\nJan 15, 2025, 02:44am\n\nKopitime: Smoking corners at coffee shops will decrease over time\n\nJan 7, 2025, 12:20am\n\nKopitime: There needs to be a blanket ban on smoking at coffee shops\n\nDec 18, 2024, 06:10am\n\nM'sia Foreign Minister Tok Mat fined for smoking in prohibited area\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e2dc8331b3e2dbc548c5d32d173dfe1e17b331a3142505c88c9f38a27bad7f61/vrelsmoke20bp20smoke.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A makeshift smoking corner spotted a few metres outside a coffeeshop in Bukit Panjang.", "caption": "A makeshift smoking corner spotted a few metres outside a coffeeshop in Bukit Panjang.

It was the Frenchman's first day back at Kranji after a six-year absence.\n\nPHOTO: STC\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 21, 2024, 01:59pm\n\nWinning return for Curatolo\n\nFrench jockey is a man in a hurry, just like his last two Kranji stints in 2017 and 2018\n\nShare this article\n\nBack for another Singapore stint after six years, Ryan Curatolo showed that he was not about to buck the trend of scoring on his first day at the office.\n\nOn the scoresheet right off the bat at his two previous Kranji sojourns, the 31-year-old French jockey was lucky for the third time on Jan 20.\n\nJust like at his very first Singapore ride on Golden Spark (later renamed Magic Seven) at his maiden one-day visit in September 2017, the US-trained rider was off to a flyer at his 2024 baptism of fire on the Tan Kah Soon-trained Commander Jones in the $30,000 Class 5 Division 1 race (1,400m).\n\nAt his second stay in 2018 (when he did one full season), he did not strike at his first booking, but the fourth, on Yaya Papaya.\n\nCuratolo, who cut short his Dubai tenure by two months to honour his one-year 2024 Singapore Turf Club licence, said there was no secret recipe to his Kranji flying starts - just handy horses to steer.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"Of course, I know I've always begun with a winner in Singapore, and I'm glad I've kept it up again,\" said Curatolo, whose wife Dayle is Singaporean.\n\n\"To be honest, it's probably just a coincidence. But, at the same time, good horses make good jockeys.\n\n\"I still remember my first visit in 2017. I came for only one day and won at my first ride and won one more for the same trainer (Kuah Cheng Tee, Eden Garden) later.\"\n\nCuratolo has visited the Kranji winner's enclosure 35 times before, but the latest reception he received was a little more special.\n\n\"It was great to have my wife Dayle at the races today,\" he said.\n\n\"It's also my first time riding for Kah Soon, and we got a winner right away. It's fantastic.\"\n\nThe Godolphin-trained handler said that the Charm Spirit three-year-old grey was his own worst enemy, with his inclination to overdo things. But he has since learned to settle better.\n\n\"He never used to settle before. It's only when Ronnie Stewart rode him two times that he settled so much better,\" said the Malaysian conditioner.\n\n\"When Vitor Espindola rode him two starts back, they got into traffic, and the last time with Matthew Kellady, he had nowhere to go.\n\n\"Today, he dropped his head and settled nicely all the way. I was only worried he hit the front too soon as he stopped, but that's down to immaturity.\n\n\"Ryan only cantered him in the morning. All the work was already done.\"\n\nThose last finishing touches were not without informative value to the comeback hoop, though.\n\n\"I rode him twice in trackwork, and I did like his chances before the race,\" said Curatolo.\n\n\"I just followed the instructions which were to keep him relaxed, a little off the rails as he likes to hang in.\n\n\"I was able to track Marc Lerner who was on the horse (Simon) to beat.\n\n\"When Marc's horse accelerated, he also quickened nicely. Everything went right.\"\n\nSmothered in midfield for most of the race, Commander Jones ($41) exploded away once the field fanned out into the home straight.\n\nSimon weakened to fourth while $15 favourite Smoke And Mirrors (Bruno Queiroz) flew home late to take second, a ½-length away.\n\nLast-start winner China Pearl (Jamil Sarwi) was too far back, but powered home late to grab third, another 2½ lengths away. The winning time was 1min 22.99sec for the 1,400m on the long course.\n\nTan said that Commander Jones, who is raced by popular Samy's Curry restaurant owner Maheyndran Veerasamy can go over more ground in time to come.\n\n\"He's still work in progress but, with time, he can stay a mile. Not a problem,\" he said.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nHeal your WiFi woes with StarHub all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/bae84282abad1aa5a9041b30cded39c9df2c7fd43ed423319608a4755a8f9a2b/mlryan.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jockey Ryan Curatolo giving the Tan Kah Soon-trained Commander Jones a peach of a ride in the $30,000 Class 5 Division 1 race (1,400m) at Kranji on Jan 20.

He put in a fantastic run in the International Mile (Group 1 Longines Hong Kong Mile over 1,600m when second to Golden Sixty) and backed it up today.\n\n\"There's no heir apparent to Golden Sixty, but we're happy to be the next man jogging on the spot, so to speak, and we're probably lucky the champ wasn't there.\"\n\nAddressing Voyage Bubble's future, McDonald said the 2023 BMW Hong Kong Derby (2,000m) and Hong Kong Classic Mile (1,600m) winner had a host of options.\n\n\"He's lightly raced, he's five, he's at the peak of his powers. The world's his oyster, really,\" said the Australia-based Kiwi, reconfirming he would partner Romantic Warrior in the Group 1 Citi Hong Kong Gold Cup (2,000m) on Feb 25.\n\n\"They can go wherever they want to go - Australia, Dubai or Japan - I don't know. I'll leave that to the connections to see where he fits in against really good international competitors,\" said McDonald.\n\nYiu is weighing up tilts at either the Group 1 Dubai Turf (1,800m) at Meydan on March 30 or the Group 1 Doncaster Mile Handicap (1,600m) at Randwick in Sydney on April 6, but McDonald said there are plenty of opportunities in Hong Kong for Voyage Bubble.

Scientists in China on Tuesday announced that they have cloned the first healthy rhesus monkey, a two-year-old named Retro, by tweaking the process that created Dolly the sheep.\n\nPrimates have proved particularly difficult to clone, and the scientists overcame years of failure by replacing the cloned cells that would become the placenta with those from a normal embryo.\n\nThey hope their new technique will lead to the creation of identical rhesus monkeys that can be experimented on for medical research.\n\nHowever, outside researchers warned that the success rate for the new method was still very low, as well as raising the usual ethical questions around cloning.\n\nSince the historic cloning of Dolly the sheep using a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) in 1996, more than 20 different animals have been created using the process, including dogs, cats, pigs and cattle.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nAug 11, 2023, 06:52am\n\n'I just wanted to see him again': Vet Jean-Paul Ly on why he cloned his beloved dog\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever it was not until two decades later that scientists managed to clone the first primates using SCNT.\n\nA pair of identical crab-eating macaques named Hua Hua and Zhong Zhong were created using SCNT in 2018 by researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai.\n\nBut that breakthrough, led by the institute's Qiang Sun, only resulted in live births in fewer than two per cent of attempts.\n\nQiang was also a senior author of the new research published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nHe told AFP that the team had extensively researched why previous efforts to clone the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) had failed.\n\nIn an earlier attempt, one monkey - out of 35 implanted foetuses - was born alive, but it died in less than a day.\n\nQiang said that one of the \"major problems\" was that the placentas of cloned embryos were showing abnormalities compared to those from in vitro fertilisation.\n\nSo the researchers replaced the cells that later become the placenta, which are called the trophoblast, with those from a healthy, non-cloned embryo.\n\nThe trophoblast cells provide nutrients to a growing embryo, and turn into the placenta that supplies oxygen and other life-supporting assistance to the foetus.\n\nThe technique \"greatly improved the success rate of cloning by SCNT\" and led to the birth of Retro, Qiang said.\n\nHuman cloning 'unacceptable'\n\nHowever Lluis Montoliu, a scientist at the Spanish National Centre for Biotechnology who was not involved in the research, pointed out that just one out of 113 initial embryos survived, meaning a success rate of less than one percent.\n\nIf human beings were to ever be cloned - the great ethical fear of this field of research - then other primate species would have to be cloned first, he said.\n\nBut so far, the poor efficiency of these efforts has \"confirmed the obvious: not only was human cloning unnecessary and debatable, but if attempted, it would be extraordinarily difficult - and ethically unjustifiable,\" Montoliu said.\n\nQiang emphasised that cloning a human being was \"unacceptable\" in any circumstance.\n\nFor the SCNT procedure, scientists remove the nucleus from a healthy egg, then replace it with another nucleus from another type of body cell.\n\nThe embryo therefore grows into the same creature that donated the replacement nucleus.\n\nA rhesus monkey named Tetra was cloned in 1999 using a different technique called embryo splitting.\n\nBut this simpler technique can only produce four clones at once.\n\nScientists have focused on SCNT in part because it can create far more clones, with the goal of creating identical monkeys to study a range of diseases as well as test drugs. -

But when my horse started to stop, I changed the whip to the left hand and he responded,\" said the Marine Parade resident.\n\n\"It's Saimee who told me about this trick. It came in handy at the right time.\"\n\nPost-race, Saimee proudly beamed with a sense of satisfaction as he waited for Silent Is Gold ($28) at the sheltered area used for lead-ins during rainy weather.\n\n\"Most jockeys use only the right hand. I was able to use both in my time, but I saw no reason why someone like Jamil cannot pick it up,\" said the winner of more than 1,300 races as a jockey and 71 winners in four seasons as a trainer between 2017 and 2020.\n\n\"Before the race, I told Jamil that this horse has never been hit with the whip in the left hand before. I told him he should try something different.\n\n\"Luckily, he listened to me at a crucial stage of the race, and the horse went again. That made all the difference between winning and losing.\n\n\"Silent Is Gold's win was a nice birthday present. But to have Jamil listen to me and win also made me very happy.\"\n\nJamil, who finished runner-up to 2023 champion apprentice Jerlyn Seow, currently tops the 2024 leaderboard on three wins, one more than Seow.\n\nOne race before Silent Is Gold's win, Jamil produced another heady ride by coming from last aboard Axel ($65) for his master Donna Logan in the $50,000 Class 4 race (1,400m).\n\nAs much as learning little tricks of the trade was useful for the 26-year-old three-kilo claimer, his perfect handling of Silent Is Gold showed he was mastering the basics down pat.\n\n\"I was told to let Sky Eye go forward and sit close,\" he said.\n\n\"My horse jumped pretty well and I was able to sit one length off Sky Eye.\n\n\"Turning for home, I still had a lapful. When I asked him to go, he shot to the front, and held on well.\"\n\nGray, who does book Jamil a fair bit, put Silent Is Gold's seventh win down to both his horse's and young rider's abilities.\n\nBut the New Zealander also conceded that the result could have been reversed if not for Jamil's 3kg claim.\n\n\"Silent Is Gold's a quick little horse. He's running well and the boy rides him well,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a good horse for apprentices, he's won twice with Fahmi (Rosman). He also won with (senior local rider) Shafrizal (Saleh).\n\n\"I told Jamil to go forward as that's the best way to ride him and he never panicked.\n\n\"You can't beat weights. Golden Monkey had 59kg and we had only 50.5kg - that is a pull of 8.5kg.\"\n\nGray, who finished eighth on 32 winners in 2023, was incidentally opening his account for the new season. To be fair, he did not saddle many runners - only seven - at the first two meetings.\n\nThat was, however, the same number of runners he fielded on Jan 20, with Silent Is Gold clearly the best chance while two others, Hugo and Our Pinnacle, finished in the money.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\njan20results.pdf\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ce0c008056fb2ae7cc0f22e452033e8102ed0b8c63b50af9ba299269323523ba/dsc_1366.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Stephen Gray's assistant trainer Saimee Jumaat is all smiles as he leads in Silent Is Gold and Jamil Sarwi at the winner's circle after the running of the Class 1 1,200m race on Jan 20.", "caption": "Stephen Gray's assistant trainer Saimee Jumaat is all smiles as he leads in Silent Is Gold and Jamil Sarwi at the winner's circle after the running of the Class 1 1,200m race on Jan 20.

These two look set to fight out the finish once again.\n\n3 Kyeema\n\nwas interfered with on debut. He is clearly better than this and may represent some serious value on the weekend.\n\n1 Ima Single Man\n\nhas not raced in this grade for quite some time. He has the class edge.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\n3 Fun Elite\n\nwon with plenty in hand on debut and is suited over this course and distance from the draw. One to beat.\n\n6 Rise Companions\n\ncaught the eye in a recent trial behind Lucky Sweynesse. He clearly has ability.\n\n12 Speedy Fortune\n\ncan roll forward under Purton. He will be competitive close to the speed.\n\n5 Super Axiom\n\ncan lead and at any minute could easily reverse his form. Do not discount.\n\nRace 5 (1,240m)\n\n3 Superb Kid\n\nis lightly raced but can make a serious impact down to Class 4, especially with Bowman engaged. One to beat.\n\n6 Golden Bull\n\nhas been consistent without winning. Expecting the same again from him.\n\n2 Compassion Spirit\n\ncan take the right step forward, after stepping down from Class 3. Strong booking of Purton is worth consideration.\n\n14 Lucky Planet\n\nslots in light and gets his opportunity. He can save ground from the draw.\n\nRace 6 (1,200m)\n\n4 Handsome Bomb\n\nhad more to offer on debut. Expecting he can show that, even from an awkward gate. Shapes as the one they all have to catch.\n\n7 Pingwu Sparkle\n\ndraws poorly but expecting him to cross from the widest draw to lead. He has some ability and it is just a case of extracting that on race day.\n\n1 Super Goldi\n\nwas super impressive last start. He can take another step forward, especially in the same grade.\n\n3 Geneva\n\nlooks forward enough to contend strongly on debut.\n\nRace 7 (1,600m) THE STEWARDS' CUP\n\n3 Straight Arron\n\nis value. If they run this along at a decent tempo then he could easily be the beneficiary. He gets better and better and even still, his best is yet to come. Golden Sixty's absence opens this up.\n\n2 Voyage Bubble\n\nhas the right form after finishing second to Golden Sixty last month. He will be a deserved favourite.\n\n5 Beauty Eternal\n\ncan mix his form but is nothing short of brilliant on his day.\n\n1 California Spangle\n\nis next in line. He needs to bounce back.\n\nRace 8 (2,000m)\n\n7 Elliptical\n\nwill relish the added distance. He has done well and his best is clearly still ahead of him. He can easily announce himself this weekend with a first win in Hong Kong. Vincent Ho's booking is worth respecting.\n\n5 Ensued i\n\ns a three-time winner from four starts. He has a stack of class and continues to improve.\n\n2 The Best Peach\n\ngets out over further, which he looks well placed to enjoy.\n\n4 C P Brave\n\nis in the form of his life with two wins from his last two starts. Next in line.\n\nRace 9 (1,400m)\n\n12 Mugen\n\ncan bounce back following defeat. He won back-to-back races before that and the light weight affords him another excellent winning opportunity.\n\n2 Howdeepisyourlove\n\nlooks ready for the rise in distance now. He does not know how to run a bad race. James McDonald's booking is worth keeping an eye on.\n\n10 Global Harmony\n\nscored an almighty win last start. He will settle back in the field before unleashing his powerful turn of foot.\n\n6 Atullibigeal\n\nis regularly underestimated. Next in line.\n\nRace 10 (1,400m)\n\n1 Armour War Eagle\n\nwas superb on debut when finishing second. He only needs to reproduce that effort to go close again. He is favoured from gate 3 and could even be decent odds.\n\n2 The Heir\n\nhas a stack of class but no early speed. He will once again give them a head start before winding up late.\n\n13 Storm Rider\n\nis after back-to-back wins. He was super impressive last time. Major player.\n\n10 Lost Child\n\nis in good form and does boast a win already this season. Next in line.\n\nComments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 3Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e664975debeb007f341a63b95bd8a7db469069bf173084c5bccd9b09a99166a/hkprev20.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Jockey Vincent Ho bringing the Caspar Fownes-trained Straight Arron back to scales after a come-from-behind win in the Group 3 BOCHK Jockey Club Cup (2,000m) at Sha Tin on Nov 11.

Droughts, as the second leading cause of climate-related mortality, are forecast to claim 3.2 million lives.\n\nHeat waves, on the other hand, are expected to cause the highest economic losses, an estimated US$7.1 trillion, by 2050.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 15, 2025, 03:56am\n\nEligible households can claim additional $100 Climate Vouchers starting April 15\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe report warned that climate crisis will further exacerbate global health inequality and the most vulnerable populations will suffer the most. Regions such as Africa and southern Asia will remain particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, due to their limited resources such as infrastructure and essential medical equipment.\n\nThe WEF, in the report, called on global stakeholders to take decisive and strategic action to reduce emissions and mitigate the negative health impacts of climate change.\n\n\"Recent progress will be lost unless critical emission reduction and mitigation measures are improved, and decisive global action is taken to build climate resilient and adaptable health systems,\" said Dr Shyam Bishen, head of the Centre for Health and Healthcare and member of the Executive Committee at the WEF. - XINHUA\n\nCLIMATE CHANGE\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC FORUM 2024\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 29, 2025, 12:28am\n\nPresident Tharman: Stability, expertise key to Singapore's future\n\nMar 19, 2025, 08:29am\n\nPUB issues Flash flood warning as heavy rain hits Singapore\n\nJan 22, 2025, 02:42am\n\nPAP's new climate action group to help SMEs go green\n\nJan 10, 2025, 04:56am\n\nSaudi Arabia prepares for another extremely hot haj season\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/5139e7809200ec11ebf964fd618beb5b57ad4be6ccc2d6b4c11dd37b08c7e781/11079687.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Flooding alone is estimated to cause 8.5 million deaths by mid-century.", "caption": "Flooding alone is estimated to cause 8.5 million deaths by mid-century.

Local governments have also announced various measures to encourage new families, including tax deductions and housing subsidies, as well as cash \"rewards\" for marriages if the bride is aged 25 or younger.\n\nMs Julia Meng, whose company Julia's Events organised the Shanghai singles event, said an increasing number of people aged 35 and older had effectively \"given up\" on marriage.\n\nYounger Chinese, like event attendee Jack Jiang, say they want to get married, but high housing prices, uncertain job prospects and the general economic situation is not helping.\n\n\"It's not that we want to be single, it's the urban structure, economic situation that have led to this result,\" the 32-year-old entrepreneur said. - REUTERS\n\nmarriage\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nChina\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:02am\n\nActress Tay Ying and celebrity chef Wu Sihan hold guo da li ceremony\n\n1\n\nApr 14, 2025, 04:15am\n\nROM, ROMM to begin Saturday solemnisations at Esplanade Mall interim site\n\nMar 28, 2025, 05:11am\n\nHow to survive renovation: Top tips from SGAG's Xiao Ming and his wife\n\nMar 23, 2025, 12:00am\n\n'I needed to protect her against dark thoughts': Father of 5, whose wife had postnatal depression\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/6a1c3a7114a0790ef2af0e6ad9e7f9f3e6b9a674c5e8afb4bcb714a2a4f7150e/2024-01-16T083958Z1176249242RC28H5AAV8OQRTRMADP3ASIA-POPULATION-CHINA.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "People attending a masquerade singles mixer in Shanghai, China, on Jan 13.", "caption": "People attending a masquerade singles mixer in Shanghai, China, on Jan 13.

Lloyd.\n\nRecords will show that Jeff Lloyd was the winner of 15 races at various short stints at Bukit Timah and Kranji from 1993 to 2017, including the 2006 Singapore Gold Cup on Mr Line for trainer Patrick Shaw.\n\nExcept that it is not the 62-year-old British-born South African champion jockey who is coming out of retirement to pad up that score.\n\nJ stands for Jaden, 21, one of two jockey sons Lloyd Sr manages these days. Younger son Zac, 20, is a Sydney champion apprentice jockey riding for Godolphin.\n\nBrisbane-based Lloyd has not claimed any premiership yet, but came close twice.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe was runner-up in the Queensland metropolitan apprentice jockeys' premiership in the 2021/2022 and 2022/2023 season before graduating to the senior riding ranks in the current season.\n\nThe Australian will be at his first overseas stint when he starts a five-month Singapore licence between Jan 22 and June 22.\n\nBorn in South Africa, Lloyd's first dream was actually to become a trainer.\n\nBut, inspired by his father's 17 premiership titles around the world, including three in Brisbane after famously bouncing back from a stroke, he decided to follow in his footsteps at 16.\n\nAfter six months at the South African Jockey Academy, he emigrated with his family to Australia where he continued his apprenticeship at Racing Victoria.\n\nLloyd started his riding career in Wangaratta in August 2019, but eventually established himself in the warmer Queensland.\n\nIn four years of riding, he has tallied in excess of 200 wins.\n\nThough he has yet to win a Group 1 race - which his father has won a whopping 94 times - he does boast a Listed win aboard Honorable Spirit in the 2021 Queensland Cup and a Group 3 win in the 2023 Winx Guineas on Knight's Choice.\n\nLloyd sits in 14th place on eight wins on the Queensland metropolitan jockeys' premiership, and goes to scale at 53.5kg.\n\nHe will not be the only new face to commence riding duties at Kranji soon.\n\nFrom Feb 1, Brazilian jockey Carlos Henrique will also be introduced to the Kranji faithful in Singapore's final racing season.\n\nUnlike Lloyd, Henrique will stay until the last day, Oct 5, as his licence runs until Oct 31.\n\nThe 31-year-old from Rio de Janeiro is, however, a lot more well-travelled than Lloyd.\n\nBesides Brazil, Henrique - who also has a brother-jockey, Fausto, who rides in the US - has plied his trade in the US, India, Germany, Bahrain and Qatar.\n\nThe son of a veterinarian, Henrique was hooked on horse racing after he accompanied his father to his stable rounds at Gavea in Brazil.\n\nIt was not long before he joined the Rio de Janeiro apprentice school in 2008.\n\nShortly after he came out of his stint in 2010, he was bitten by the wanderlust.\n\nHe first took his saddle to India, where he ended up riding for four winter seasons.\n\nHenrique was an instant hit in the subcontinent where he bagged two Group 1 wins, namely the 2011 Deccan Juvenile Million atop Ashok Chakra and the 2012 Kunigal Stud Million aboard Jersey Girl.\n\nHis other career highlights feature two Group 1 wins at his current Qatar base, with Sealine in the 2021 Qatar Silver Trophy and Abida in the HH Sheikh Abdullah Bin Khalifa Al Thani Trophy.\n\nAll up, he has ridden 320 winners, and now sits in 18th place on seven wins on the Qatar jockey's log. The lightweight jockey goes to scale at 50kg.\n\nKranji was faced with a serious dearth of jockeys towards the end of 2024.\n\nThe likes of Louis-Philippe Beuzelin, Shafrizal Saleh, Bernardo Pinheiro and Ronnie Stewart left because of the impending closure.\n\nThe suspended Wong Chin Chuen thought it was the right time to move to South Korea.\n\nWith French jockey Ryan Curatolo making his debut on Jan 20, and the two newcomers starting soon, the Kranji jockeys' room will get busier with 27 of the 34 licensed riders active.\n\nHowever, that figure may change with the return of inactive licensees, new applicants and more leavers.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0a684682c5c5b440fd1d600ff96e4e0e0c6ba6bca74192eee9ef9b8113fa6205/mlnewjockey.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Carlos Henrique (left) and Jaden Lloyd are the two new jockeys to boost the Singapore riding ranks.

Although it is filled with restaurants and bars attracting the hip and trendy, there are eateries that appeal to families with children.\n\nAt Umami 10, East meets West in the Japanese dishes that have been given a contemporary European twist.\n\nWith its open kitchen, young diners can get a glimpse of the meal preparation without getting in anyone's way. The restaurant decor, with gold accents and dark set against a dark interior, earned the shophouse unit a Muse Design Award in 2022.\n\nAnd Umami 10 serves equally beautiful food.\n\nThe standout dish for me was the Asari Clams ($23). The broth, creamy with a delightful blend of tang and saltiness mingling with the natural sweetness of the clams, was elevated by San Marzano tomatoes. Slivers of chili padi injected a layer of heat to balance the dish.\n\nAnother highlight was the Iberico Pork Jowl with pickled apple ($30). The fatty pork cheek, tender from the 12-hour sous vide process, was plated prettily with with colourful blooms and pickled apple that gave the dish a zing.\n\nAsari Clams ($23) and Pork Jowl with pickled apple ($30).\n\nThe Truffle Pitan Tofu ($20) turned out to be a nice surprise, the century egg served as foam instead of in solid pieces. Its topping of ikura and snow crab leg meat lent a perfect balance of brinines and sweetness to the rich base.\n\nGracing the menu was a seasonal special - Cod Fish Shirako ($28). Shirako, or milt, is the male equivalent of caviar and is considered a delicacy. The creaminess and mild sweetness of the milt was in perfect harmony with the in-house yuzu wasabi sauce.\n\nTruffle Pitan Tofu ($20) and Cod Fish Shirako ($28).\n\nMeanwhile, my daughter Sarah savoured her Inaniwa Udon ($14), the noodles served in a light and creamy pork ribs broth, and the Daily Sashimi Platter ($40).\n\nWhen it was time for dessert, we shared the Yuzu Sorbet with Crispy Iberico ($18), the tart confection sprinkled with bacon jamon goodness.\n\nThe Tiramisu ($18), concocted with an in-house three-liquor recipe, had a robust alcohol kick that complemented the distinct flavours of cocoa and coffee.\n\nYuzu Sorbet with Crispy Iberico ($18) and Before Summer ($18).\n\nSarah ended her meal with a refreshing Grapefruit Lemonade ($8) while I had Before Summer ($18), a grapefruit-infused, gin-and-tonic cocktail.\n\nBeautiful setting, delicious food, great customer service.

Support will also be provided to help people take things forward. The new office will also help catalyse partnerships by connecting like-minded people and organisations and directing them to resources.\n\nIn addition, it will advocate deeper citizen-government collaboration, working closely with agencies to identify more areas where citizens can play a meaningful role, and publicising these opportunities.\n\nMs Dawn Yip, coordinating director of SGPO, who has been involved in various public engagement efforts over the years, including the Singapore 21 exercise in 1999, said Singaporeans \"always show up no matter what the issue is\", with many willing to give their time and resources to achieve something bigger than themselves.\n\nShe added that she hoped the office will provide more opportunities and means for people to show up and take action.\n\nSuch partnerships are one of the key ingredients behind Singapore's success, said DPM Wong.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Government has been deliberate about bringing diverse stakeholders together to work towards a common purpose, he added.\n\nFor instance, tripartism was promoted as a way for unions, businesses, workers and the Government to work together to spur economic growth. The grassroots movement, through the People's Association, was also set in motion to galvanise the community to build the nation together.\n\nSince then, the Government has set up more consultation mechanisms such as the Reach feedback unit, supported more ground-up initiatives, and opened up space for Singaporeans to contribute, said DPM Wong.\n\nMany government ministries now have public, private and people, or 3P, divisions, to help drive their engagement efforts, he cited.\n\nNoting how far Singapore has come in this journey, he said it is this spirit of collaboration that has seen the nation through many challenges, such as the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the 9/11-fuelled terror threats in 2001, the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s, and most recently, the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nDPM Wong, who co-chaired the multi-ministry task force set up to fight Covid-19, said the Government, unions, businesses, people and groups coming together was what helped Singapore mount an effective response during the pandemic.\n\n\"Because of our combined efforts, we have today in Singapore a stronger sense of cohesion and solidarity, a higher level of trust, where everyone actively supports one another so that we can progress together as one united people,\" he added.\n\nBut he said Singapore cannot afford to be complacent, especially as the world shifts away from the peace and globalisation of the past 30 years.\n\nWith traditional methods of cooperation breaking down, wars have erupted in Europe and the Middle East, with violence and conflict threatening to spread in other parts of the world, he added.\n\nSuch external stress, together with economic and social strain, has already taxed countries around the world, eroding trust and entrenching differences, he noted.\n\n\"We are not immune to the same powerful forces that can potentially divide us. There's no reason why Singapore is immune to this. It's not as though we've got a special vaccine,\" he said.\n\n\"In fact, as a diverse multiracial, multi-religious society, we are all the more susceptible to such divisive forces in the world.\"\n\nEncouraging Singaporeans to come forward, DPM Wong said the Government will continue to study more ways to facilitate such partnerships.\n\n\"We want to create more opportunities big and small for everyone, every citizen to contribute meaningfully to our shared future,\" he said, singling out the young for their enthusiasm to participate.\n\n\"I am confident that if we can encourage more people to join us in this partnership journey, we can foster a stronger sense of kinship and trust, and we can build a better and more united Singapore.\"\n\nHe added that there were many more things the Government hoped to achieve under Forward Singapore and that the first tranche of major updates would be unveiled during his Budget speech, slated for Feb 16.\n\n\"Please stay tuned for the Budget.

mainly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - to comply with the disclosure rules their multinational partners need to make regarding the carbon emissions of their supply chains.\n\nThe Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) unveiled the programme - known as the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) as a Service - on Jan 19 in a bid to boost the competitiveness and credibility of Singapore's export-driven manufacturing sector, which contributes about 22 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product.\n\n\"Companies need to start reporting emission numbers or risk losing out to competitors, as many of them are suppliers for international partners who will soon need to submit reports about the carbon footprint of their supply chain,\" said SMF president Lennon Tan.\n\nHe added that the federation understands that many SMEs cannot afford dedicated staff to plan and oversee sustainability initiatives due to limited resources, and so are unsure about where to begin.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 3, 2025, 12:30am\n\nSingapore manufacturing falls in April, ending 19-month growth streak\n\nMore related stories\n\nA firm can ask for an SMF in-house expert to work with their own CSO and help plan a decarbonisination pathway, and to gather data on environmental, social, and corporate governance issues and report it in accordance with local and international standards.\n\nThe SMF expert will not be full time at the SME but will spend enough time to show the staff what to do, and return to help when the firm has reached the next stage of its plan.\n\nAs the largest national organisation representing the interests of manufacturers, SMF is working closely with members to address challenges they face on their sustainability journey,\" said Mr Tan, who was speaking at the SMF Manufacturing Day Summit 2024 held at the Sands Expo & Convention Centre in Singapore.\n\nThe SMF also unveiled a playbook to help manufacturers, especially SMEs, upskill their employees, particularly in the precision engineering sector, which employs over 90,000 people.\n\nIt noted that the playbook is the first such guide for a manufacturing sub-sector and will be one of many to cover other sub-sectors, with at least two being produced every year.\n\nThe playbook - compiled by the Advanced Manufacturing Training Academy (AMTA) and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) - aims to help firms cope with a tide of transformative challenges, including disruptive technologies, rising costs, intense competition, a shortage of skilled operators and the looming threat of supply chain disruptions amid geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nMr Alvin Tan, Minister of State of Trade and Industry and Culture, Community and Youth, told the summit that Singapore, as the world's eighth largest exporter of high-tech goods, is a regional powerhouse for manufacturing.\n\nBut global shifts like the pace of technological advancements, reconfigurations in global supply chains and consumers' scrutiny of sustainable practices amid growing environmental concerns point to a more uncertain future for manufacturing.\n\n\"In today's age of intense competition, Singapore must continue to invest significantly in research, innovation and enterprise efforts,\" Mr Tan added.\n\n\"There are new opportunities amidst these global shifts too, that will allow Singapore to maintain and even enhance our attractiveness as a manufacturing hub.\"\n\nHowever, to capture these opportunities, Singapore must double down on its key and core value propositions that include connectivity, stability and a well-developed innovation ecosystem.\n\n\"As the world grapples with the environmental and social consequences of traditional manufacturing, compounded by shifts in consumer preferences towards more sustainable products and offerings, the need for sustainable manufacturing practices has become increasingly urgent,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nHe also stressed the importance of investing in the local workforce and urged companies to upskill and reskill their workers by tapping various schemes, such as the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit.\n\nAMTA director Zeng Xianting said the new playbook encompasses six key roles, ranging from operators to specialists and engineers, providing a detailed breakdown of essential role changes and the new skill proficiencies necessitated by disruptive technologies.\n\n\"It (the playbook) aims to empower the industry to maintain its competitive edge by providing a clear strategy for engineers, specialists, and operators to adopt new competencies,\" Dr Zeng added.\n\nOvais Subhani\n\nSenior Business Correspondent\n\nMANUFACTURING\n\nSkillsFuture Singapore\n\nSKILLS TRAINING\n\nALVIN TAN\n\nSUSTAINABILITY\n\nESG\n\nSINGAPORE ECONOMY\n\nSingapore exports\n\nENGINEERS/ENGINEERING\n\nSME/SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 19, 2024, 03:19am\n\n59 workers to be laid off due to Oatly S'pore plant closure\n\nDec 22, 2022, 08:24am\n\nSome bottles of Prego pasta sauce recalled due to manufacturing error\n\nAug 4, 2022, 09:07am\n\nSFA suspension a surprise to some kueh manufacturers\n\nJan 29, 2022, 09:03am\n\nUS bans imports from Malaysian glove maker YTY over forced labour allegations\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/247f1ab345e8c343d2a125d802f7f47096972377633a254ba23dab01517b7cc0/yaohui-pixgeneric-4181.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The federation understands that many SMEs cannot afford dedicated staff to plan and oversee sustainability initiatives due to limited resources.", "caption": "The federation understands that many SMEs cannot afford dedicated staff to plan and oversee sustainability initiatives due to limited resources.

Online sleuths discovered a photo showing their signatures posted on the Instagram page of Seumikatsu on Nov 9, with the owner thanking the two idols for visiting the restaurant in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nHyuna, whose full name is Kim Hyun-ah, debuted as a member of girl group Wonder Girls in 2007 before she left in the same year. She was later part of the girl group 4Minute, which debuted in 2009 and dissolved in 2016.\n\nIn 2010, Hyuna launched her debut solo single Change, which featured Junhyung. She gained further fame when she appeared in the music video of Gangnam Style with South Korean rapper Psy in 2012.\n\nIn 2018, she acknowledged that she had been dating K-pop boy band Pentagon's Dawn for two years, resulting in their contracts being terminated by their then agency Cube Entertainment.\n\nHyuna and Dawn announced their engagement in February 2022 before parting ways in November that same year. Dawn, 29, announced in October 2023 that he was beginning his military service as a social service worker.\n\nJunhyung, whose full name is Yong Jun-hyung, rose to fame after debuting in 2009 as a member of K-pop boy band Beast, who changed their name to Highlight in 2017 after leaving their original agency Cube Entertainment.\n\nJunhyung left the group in March 2019 after he was implicated in an illegal sex video scandal involving entertainers such as former BigBang member Seungri and singer Jung Joon-young.\n\nJung was accused of sharing the sex videos in a chatroom with several artistes.

He was taken unconscious to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital but did not survive. A 29-year-old male car driver was arrested for careless driving causing death.\n\nMr Syahied's sister, Ms Syakienah Ahmad, 27, told The Straits Times that he had recorded the song, titled Lady In Red, the night before the accident. The song, a symbol of his enduring love and affection, remains unreleased.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 07:51am\n\n$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17\n\nMore related stories\n\nHis family plans to have the song put up on music streaming platform Spotify, but Ms Syakienah said they have left it to Mr Syahied's friend, Kenny Kamil, 21, who was with him while he was recording the song, to decide when to do so.\n\nMr Syahied, the eldest of three children, was remembered by his sister Ms Syakienah as a pillar of emotional support for their mother.\n\n\"He was always a safe space for my mum to confide in. That's why he composed this song, to express his love and gratitude,\" she said.\n\nHis interest in music was sparked at a young age by his father Mr Ahmad Samsudin, 58, who taught him basic guitar chords. Mr Syahied's curiosity and passion for music led him to teach himself to play several various musical instruments, including the keyboard, which he played by ear. His musical journey included performances with his father and cousins.\n\nOn his TikTok account, Mr Syahied often posted snippets of him singing, or playing portions of pop songs on various instruments.\n\nHis best friend Akmal Aziz, 29, a call operator for an airline, reminisced about Mr Syahied's carefree nature and zest for life.\n\n\"He loved life and lived it fully. We had plans for a road trip to Malacca, to visit my grandparents' kampung after Hari Raya. Syahied would have loved the relaxing environment there,\" Mr Akmal said.\n\nThe two had been friends since 2001.\n\nMr Akmal said that upon learning that Mr Syahied had been in an accident, he left for the hospital in Jurong immediately from his workplace in Paya Lebar.\n\n\"By the time I reached, he was already gone,\" Mr Akmal said, adding that he had broken into tears at that point. \"His distraught father kept asking me to take a look at Syahied. When I finally felt his body, it was already cold. It was too late and I did not get to say goodbye.\"\n\nHe added that Mr Syahied \"taught me to relax when things got tough, and to have integrity\" and that he felt he had not thanked his friend enough when he was alive.\n\nMs Syakienah said she felt the same way.\n\n\"In our family, we practised tough love. But that is something I regret. Amongst the many things I wish I told my brother, I wish I told him that I loved him,\" she said.\n\n\"We never said, 'I love you' enough. It's the simple things you take for granted, thinking there will always be another chance. But sometimes, there isn't.\"\n\nVihanya Rakshika\n\nCorrespondent\n\nSingapore\n\nACCIDENTS - TRAFFIC\n\nROAD SAFETY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1c27cddaea0af00afe38743987572517c11777accab758b30937dd7595669aa8/syahied204.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Syahied Ahmad was killed in a traffic accident four days after he completed writing the song for his mother.", "caption": "Mr Syahied Ahmad was killed in a traffic accident four days after he completed writing the song for his mother.

Six weeks ago, there were just 143 cases.\n\nWhile this is a far cry from the 1,552 cases a week at the peak of the infection in 2022, the steady increase in cases has the National Environment Ministry urging people \"living in dengue cluster areas to take immediate action to suppress the Aedes mosquito population and help break disease transmission\".\n\nIt also asked them to cooperate with National Environment Agency (NEA) officers inspecting their property for mosquito larvae.\n\nThere were almost 10,000 dengue cases reported last year, down from the 32,000-plus cases in 2022. The largest number of this Aedes mosquito-borne viral infection seen here was in 2020, when there were 35,315 cases, and 32 deaths.\n\nDengue caused three deaths here in the first nine months of 2023. The previous year, 19 people died.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 26, 2025, 12:19am\n\nAlmost 2,000 dengue cases in Singapore so far in 2025, 74% drop from 2024\n\nMore related stories\n\nHowever, experts say the recent heavy rains could lead to a drop in dengue cases.\n\n\"The general trend is for dengue cases to dip after heavy rainfall and this dip can go on for as much as six weeks,\" said Professor Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases expert and vice-dean for global health at the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n\nWhile wet weather resulting in standing water increases mosquito breeding, heavy rains causes a \"flushing effect\" where the larvae is washed away, killing most of them.\n\nThe experts are also not overly worried about the two changes in the dominant dengue serotype last year, although they warn that a second infection could prove more serious.\n\nThere are four dengue serotypes. DEN-3, the dominant strain behind the bulk of infections in 2021 and 2022, was overtaken by DEN-1 in June 2023, and later DEN-2 in September.\n\nPeople do not get reinfected by the virus from the same serotype, but can be infected by the other three strains.\n\nSymptoms of dengue include a sudden onset of fever, headache, muscular and joint aches, nausea and vomiting. Anyone with such symptoms should see a doctor to prevent the infection from taking on a more severe form, such as dengue haemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome.\n\nThere are currently 80 active dengue clusters of which 17 have 10 or more cases. The biggest cluster in the Boon Lay-Corporation Road-Jurong West area has recorded 200 cases, of which 48 were within the past fortnight.\n\nThe NEA said it had observed a \"fast rate of dengue transmission\" in this cluster, as well as two at Pair Ris and one at Jalan Chegar at Upper Thomson.\n\nIt urged people to use insect repellent to protect themselves from being bitten by the Aedes mosquito.\n\nAnyone diagnosed with or suspected to have dengue are also advised to avoid further mosquito bites, to prevent passing on the dengue virus to mosquitoes and other people in their neighbourhood, NEA added.\n\nSalma Khalik\n\nSenior Health Correspondent\n\nDengue fever\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nmosquito\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 8, 2025, 06:02am\n\nDengue cases in Singapore up 36% from 2023\n\nOct 30, 2024, 11:12pm\n\n15 dengue deaths so far in 2024\n\nOct 15, 2024, 01:09am\n\nJohor dengue cases jump nearly 40%\n\nJul 23, 2024, 10:39am\n\nOver 10,000 dengue cases so far, exceeds total number in 2023\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f0b1991f7e5d09b129a32def3c44f56f8d031fa875d9b45160ee5b9a7cc953bf/airain190124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: ST FILE"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8fb5bef23dde3c3551dd8a29dacd96647844900994201590ce174413ba4887ab/2025052516615986pyl8148.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Almost 2,000 dengue cases in Singapore so far in 2025, 74% drop from 2024", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/1f906c83b281a6965aa89c2883a3285028966acdb3980a2c7a41c63695061097/IMG6160.JPG?w=318", "alt_text": "Dengue cases in Singapore up 36% from 2023", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Court documents did not disclose where the men were at the time.\n\nWu came to Singapore alone on Nov 9, 2023, with Chen footing his travel expenses. He was instructed to go to Tiffany & Co to look for the biggest diamond ring and snap a picture of its price tag.\n\nWu went to to the Tiffany & Co outlet at The Shoppes at MBS and claimed to be \"Mr Liew\" from Taiwan, saying he was looking for a gift for his wife.\n\nA client adviser showed Wu several diamond rings and with her permission, he snapped a picture of one worth $318,000 with its accompanying price tag.\n\nWu sent the picture to Chen and told the adviser he would return within the next few days to buy the ring.\n\nWu returned to China the next day and met Chen who said that Wu would receive, via post, a replica ring which would look similar to the genuine piece.\n\nAfter receiving the replica on Nov 18, 2023, Wu returned to Singapore alone two days later and Chen, again, footed his travel expenses.\n\nHe went back to the Tiffany & Co store and was served by a team manager, who showed him several rings on a black tray. Wu was also told that the client adviser, who had earlier served him, was not in the store at the time.\n\nBy using sleight of hand, Wu swopped the 3.18 carat ring with the replica after distracting the team manager by claiming that he wanted to have a look at another piece of jewellery.\n\nDPP Ng said: \"After stealing the genuine ring, the accused lied to the victim that he wanted to purchase (a) 2.15-carat ring so that he could find an opportunity to leave the store.\n\n\"While the victim was facilitating this purchase, the accused told the victim that he had changed his mind.\"\n\nThe team manager then realised that the texture of the price tag on the replica ring felt different from the one on the genuine piece. She told Wu that the replica did not belong to Tiffany & Co, and the Chinese national did not respond.\n\nHer male colleague, who was alerted, told Wu that he wanted to conduct a physical check on him.\n\nThe two men entered a room and Wu took out the genuine ring from his pocket. He asked for forgiveness and was arrested soon after.\n\nFor theft, an offender can be jailed for up to seven years and fined.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nTHEFT/BURGLARY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/98c5f52f784e63be5edd0ad57e53bdc31a9f16f6746e00369701142105ea0c6f/airingcol211123_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The replica ring (left) which Wu Youquan used to swop with a diamond ring worth $318,000 (right).", "caption": "The replica ring (left) which Wu Youquan used to swop with a diamond ring worth $318,000 (right).

It began with a limited edition Royal Oak Offshore (Reference 25770SN) which he wore in the 1999 action horror film End Of Days.\n\nIn an interview with several publications including The Straits Times in Dubai in 2023, former chief executive Francois-Henry Bennahmias - who left the brand after 30 years in December 2023 - told the story of how the End Of Days collaboration came to be.\n\n\"We were having lunch at Arnold's office in Malibu; he was supposed to buy watches. There were watches on the table and he was supposed to choose. There were security guards around us and he said, 'What are we doing here? This is bulls**t. I don't care about this'.\n\n\"And I said, 'Are you shooting a movie?'. He said, 'Yes. End Of Days.' And I said, 'Could we do something where you put the watch in the movie? We will create a special edition and we will raise money for a foundation.' And he said, 'I love this, okay.' That was how the whole thing started,\" said Mr Bennahmias.\n\nThe collaboration fuelled a craze for the Royal Oak Offshore which has not abated. Since then, there have been more than 10 collaborations between the watchmaker and the action star, including the T3 (2003), All Stars (2007) and The Legacy (2011).\n\nLast year, Audemars Piguet released the Royal Oak Offshore Chronograph End Of Days, which pays tribute to the original released in 1999.\n\nWong Kim Hoh\n\nDeputy Life Editor\n\nWATCHES\n\nactors\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 10, 2025, 04:53am\n\nWoman buys $399 watch but does not receive it despite tracker showing item delivered and signed for\n\nDec 22, 2024, 11:30pm\n\nMan claiming to be from Taiwan tries to sell 'Omega' watch at mall\n\nMar 26, 2024, 02:00pm\n\nSnaking queue outside Ion Orchard on launch of Snoopy-themed MoonSwatch\n\nOct 20, 2023, 12:56pm\n\nM'sia police officer investigated after false rumours circulate about her 'pricey watch'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

08:38am\n\n8 new charges for money laundering accused who allegedly funded Scotts Rd properties\n\nShare this article\n\nSu Baolin, one of the 10 accused in the $2.8 billion money laundering case, was handed eight more charges on Jan 19.\n\nSu, 42, who was originally from China, holds a Cambodian passport and now faces 10 charges in total.\n\nOne of his latest charges alleges he had on or around Dec 24, 2020, used $657,980 - his alleged benefits of criminal conduct  to fund the purchase of three properties at Scotts Square, in Scotts Road, in the name of his wife, Ma Ning.\n\nThree cheques were issued, each worth over $1.8 million.\n\nThe money he provided was allegedly derived from a conspiracy he engaged in with a Wang Qiming, a former Citibank employee, to forge a document with the intent to cheat Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:44am\n\n$3b money laundering case: MinLaw probes 4 law firms, 1 lawyer over seized properties\n\nMore related stories\n\nThree of his new charges are for making false representations and involve Wang Junjie - a man who held multiple directorships, secretarial and shareholder positions in 185 firms.\n\nThe Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority said on Jan 19 that Wang Junjie had his registration as a qualified individual (RQI) cancelled on Jan 18, as part of its investigations into the ongoing money laundering probe.\n\nAcra said Wang Junjie is the RQI and director of filing agent (RFA) LW Business Consultancy (LWBC).\n\nAcra said RQIs and RFAs provide corporate secretarial services for business entities, like helping customers to incorporate companies, file annual returns and other filing requirements under the Companies Act 1967 or other Acts under Acra's purview.\n\nRQIs and RFAs must perform customer due diligence measures and guard against breaches in anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls.\n\nAcra said the registrations of Wang Junjie and LWBC were cancelled in view of breaches of AML/CFT controls under the Acra (Filing Agents and Qualified Individuals) Regulations 2015.\n\nAccording to court documents on Jan 19, Su had allegedly abetted Wang Junjie to fraudulently make false representations to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore regarding the true and accurate values of Xinbao Investment Holdings' revenue, gross profits, and trade receivables for the company's financial years in 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nSu and Wang Junjie were both directors at Xinbao Investment Holdings, where Wang Junjie was also secretary.\n\nThree of Su's latest charges were for refusing to sign statements.\n\nHe allegedly did not sign various statements he made when required to do so by a Commercial Affairs Department officer on Dec 14 and 21, 2023, and on Jan 4, 2024, in an interview room at the Changi Prison Complex Medical Centre.\n\nDuring Su's bail review hearing in November 2023, the court heard he suffers from a serious congenital heart condition, and is at a high risk of gastric cancer.\n\nSu's other fresh charge is for using as true a false declaration in the purchase of a unit at the Gramercy Park condominium, in Grange Road, off Orchard Boulevard.\n\nOn or around Nov 30, 2017, he allegedly made statements in a statutory declaration affirmed before a Commissioner of Oaths which he did not believe to be true.\n\nThese allegedly include that he was a director of a company known as Great Trillion Technology in Hong Kong and that he received dividends, and director's salary and fees from them totalling about $5.1 million since 2016.\n\nHe allegedly falsely declared he was a director and one of the shareholders of a company known as China Run Feng (Holdings) Investment in China, and that he received dividends, director's fees and salary from it.\n\nHe purportedly stated the company had invested in a firm in Indonesia, where his share of the returns was about $840,000.\n\nSu had allegedly declared he borrowed from the other shareholders of China Run Feng (Holdings) Investment totalling $1.16 million and provided it to his conveyancing solicitor as declaration of his source of funds for the purchase of a unit at Gramercy Park.\n\nSu, who remains in remand, is scheduled to have a pre-trial conference on Jan 24.\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nmoney laundering\n\nCOURT &

Since then, several businesses in Little India have switched to cloth bags and paper straws.\n\nSome customers who visited Jothi Store and Flower Shop at Campbell Lane to buy items for Pongal saw minimal use of plastic items.\n\nMrs Senthamarai Ganeshan was impressed by the move. \"Cloth bags are good for emphasising the importance of environmental protection,\" she told English-language Indian weekly Tabla.\n\nMrs Revathi Kamaraj, a 54-year-old clinical researcher, said she was happy to see such commitment to the cause. \"A week ago, I was shopping in Chennai and saw many shops have done away with plastic bags.

Mahenthiran pointed out that his own establishment, Gayatri Restaurant, is encouraging customers to bring their own containers for takeaway food. \"This will promote food packaging sustainability,\" he said.\n\nTekka stall owners like Vignesh Pathma, who is in the meat business, welcomed the alternatives to plastic. \"But they should be practical and affordable,\" he said.\n\nK.

She felt tipsy, but was still able to walk unassisted and was aware of her surroundings.\n\nShe sat on a chair in the eatery after throwing up and sent to text message to a male friend who was supposed to be there. She also shared with him her live location at the time.\n\nErugula then approached the woman and she felt uncomfortable when he started talking to her. The victim told him that she was fine and did not need any help.\n\nAt 1.40am, she sent a text a message to her friend about her encounter with Erugula.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor John Lu told the court: \"The accused then lifted the victim off her chair, held her face-to-face and carried her out of Festivo. The victim could not see where the accused was taking her as her back was facing the direction in which they were moving.\n\n\"During this time, the victim asked the accused not to take her and to let her go but the accused persisted with his actions. The accused also took the victim's handphone from her.\"\n\nErugula took the woman to a nearby field, placed her on the ground and hovered over her. She told him to stop and stay away but her cries fell on deaf ears.\n\nDespite these, she managed to convince him to return her mobile phone. At around 1.50am, she used the device to send a few messages to her friend, asking for help.\n\nErugula took away the mobile phone and molested the woman before undressing himself.\n\nHer concerned friend, who had arrived at Festivo, received the messages and left the restaurant with a party of searchers to look for the woman.\n\nHe heard a faraway scream scream as he was walking near some tennis courts and saw the silhouettes of two people, who turned out to be Erugula and the victim, at the open field in the distance.\n\nThe friend and his group then made their way there. As they came forward, Erugula, who was in the nude, moved away from the crying victim.\n\nThe friend called for the police at around 2am and Erugula was arrested soon after.\n\nOn Jan 19, DPP Lu urged the court to sentence him to four years' jail and six strokes of the cane, adding: \"During his interaction with the victim, the accused must have noticed that the victim was drunk, alone and vulnerable, which is why the accused chose to take advantage of her.\"\n\nFor committing the offence, Erugula could have been jailed for between two and 10 years, and caned.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nOUTRAGE OF MODESTY/INSULTING MODESTY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/28cbf7fa4951a03b45e03f333c92a56873ea24568f8c4df735ac89811eedf8fa/jail.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Carey's song appeared on her 1994 album Merry Christmas and has since become a popular standard, topping the billboard Hot 100 chart every holiday season since 2019.\n\nCarey said on Wednesday that Stone's song was \"obscure and obviously different\" from her own. Her court filing said that Stone's case \"absurdly\" relies on \"both songs' references - like untold Christmas songs before them - to snow, mistletoe, presents under Christmas trees, and wanting a loved one for Christmas\" as well as other \"generalised and unprotectable themes.\"\n\nStone filed and later withdrew a similar lawsuit against Carey in Louisiana in 2022. - REUTERS\n\nlawsuit\n\nCOPYRIGHT/INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 21, 2023, 08:07am\n\nMcDonald's to pay $1 million to girl, 7, burned by McNugget\n\nJan 12, 2023, 02:10pm\n\nParents seeking $3.3m from psychiatrist, IMH in medical negligence suit over son's suicide\n\nNov 29, 2022, 10:30am\n\nJapanese death row inmates sue over 'cruel' hanging\n\nApr 18, 2022, 02:28pm\n\nUS man awarded $612,000 by jury over unwanted office birthday party\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ac2844b75d9d46d7b46c2ca60db3ed100b50fc1c5ede2b2aa31fdc42336813cd/2023-12-21t011412z_1793537567_rc2c15avpw21_rtrmadp_3_christmas-season-music.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO: REUTERS"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/35f4c361308a00c05fb9470a8e7a08200a3b6ec9bddb5d62d7f5623af6e46421/ianfang_0.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Father of Ian Fang's victim speaks out, affirms decision to sue the ex-actor", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/8373bf1d06c8ef43698f00cbcbf11b2a4f8723561bd52048bc76dee20087d3af/nugget.jpg?w=318", "alt_text": "McDonald's to pay $1 million to girl, 7, burned by McNugget", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Ramanathan has been carrying the kavadi during Thaipusam since he was a teenager.\n\nPHOTO: ST VIDEO\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 19, 2024, 01:13am\n\nPain is bliss for Thaipusam devotees\n\nShare this article\n\nMr Shanmugam Govindarasu still recalls how he felt 26 years ago when he was just 16 and carrying a kavadi (a semi-circular steel and wooden canopy carried by Hindu devotees) for the first time during Thaipusam.\n\n\"I had no idea what to expect. During the process, my whole body was numb, the weight on my shoulders was so strenuous. Somehow, my prayers gave me the strength to complete the ritual,\" the 42-year-old says in a video by The Straits Times.\n\nCelebrated on the full moon day in the Tamil month of Thai on the confluence of star Pusam, Thaipusam is known as one of the most physically demanding religious festivals in the world. It will be held in Singapore on Jan 25, reported English-language Indian weekly Tabla.\n\nIn 2022, Singapore shortlisted this Hindu festival for nomination to the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage list. Some 30,000 people, including tourists, attend the festivities every year, including about 250 kavadi bearers and 10,000 devotees carrying milk pots.\n\nEvery year, devotees pierce their bodies and carry kavadis - which can be up to 3m high and weigh between 20kg and 30kg - to fulfil their vows and seek the blessings of Lord Murugan, who represents virtue and power and is regarded as the destroyer of evil.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 13, 2025, 01:03am\n\nHe's not heavy, he's my brother\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe ritual also requires devotees to pierce their tongues, torsos and lips with hooks and pointed steel rods, and cheeks with vel skewers - a divine spear associated with Lord Murugan.\n\nKavadi-bearers will then embark on a gruelling barefoot 4km walk from the Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple in Serangoon Road to the Sri Thendayuthapani Temple in Tank Road, where they will give their offerings to Lord Murugan. Thaipusam commemorates the deity's birthday.\n\nThe pain borne by the kavadi-bearers can be difficult to witness. But, beneath the exterior, Thaipusam has a quiet and tender meaning of love and loyalty.\n\nMr S. Ramanathan, in his mid-40s, has also been carrying the kavadi since he was a teenager.\n\n\"It's to follow a spiritual path that was paved by past generations,\" he says in the video.\n\n\"I start preparing (by fasting and praying) 41 days before the event. That's the time of change; your mind has to change, all the negative thoughts have to be discarded. The way you eat, the way you think - everything has to be progressively correct before Thaipusam.\n\n\"About two weeks before the day, if you're still not in that state of mind, you're not going to be ready. And that has happened to me before; the state of my mind was wrong.\n\n\"So I made an extra conscious effort the following year to follow the procedure to a tee. Through meditation, I set my mind to focus. That year was fantastic for me. I followed all the guidelines and what was expected of me.\"\n\nAt least a week before the festival, devotees go on a vegetarian diet to purify themselves. They believe that as long as they adhere to strict fasting and abstinence, they will not feel any pain.\n\nMr Shanmugam says he refrains from even cutting his nails.\n\n\"I normally fast one week before Thaipusam. I'll go on a vegetarian diet, refrain from shaving, cutting my hair and nails, and I sleep on the floor on a piece of yellow cloth,\" he adds. \"I'll go to the temple every day, to meditate and attain peace of mind.\"\n\nRegarded as Singapore's best piercer, Tamilchelvan Suppiah has been piercing the bodies of the devotees for more than 30 years. Now in his 50s, he began performing the sacred and delicate ritual when he was just 15.\n\n\"Different devotees have different types of skin. It's usually more challenging to pierce a devotee who has more hair on his body,\" he explains. \"It's easier to pierce someone who sweats more. Oily skin can be difficult, and dry skin too, because it can split when pierced.\n\n\"There won't be any blood when piercing, but some devotees bleed when the piercings are removed, or if they knock into someone or if there is too much movement. But, at most, it's minor bleeding.\"\n\nIn the video, amid a small gathering of friends and family members and loud procession music, Mr Ramanathan, with grey ash smeared across his forehead and chest, stands still in the centre of the Perumal temple as the spikes are pierced through his body without a hitch. He is unfazed by the pain, his mind solely focused on Lord Murugan.\n\n\"Getting pierced is a transcending experience,\" he says. \"You are in a full state of meditation, and you have gone to a further level of surrender. I can't elaborate further, but you do become a little bit different.\"\n\nThe kavadi bearers' 4km walk takes around four hours to complete, and by the time they reach the end, the pain and exhaustion can be overwhelming.\n\nFor Mr Shanmugam, it is his favourite part of the whole ritual.\n\n\"I won't really dance too much during the procession; I want to reach the Tank Road temple in the fastest time, so that I can see Lord Murugan.,\" he says. \"My favourite part is when I enter the temple. At the highest point of my prayers, I'm always so energised to see him with my kavadi.\"\n\nALI KASIM\n\nThaipusam\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 26, 2024, 01:15am\n\nThaipusam 2024 drums up cheer and hope for 18,000 devotees\n\nFeb 7, 2023, 11:28am\n\nPost-Thaipusam cleaning crew in KL stumped by sheer number of misplaced shoes\n\nJan 6, 2023, 01:46pm\n\nFoot procession, kavadis returning to Thaipusam after two years\n\nJan 20, 2022, 04:55am\n\nBaby born outside Batu Caves at Thaipusam\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nKovan Tuition Centre: Ein Blick Hinter Die Kulissen\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a915d112d599f95ae069a71ceb57905b415bab5c9bb4d62196ed4a77fce6b1e7/tahipusam2_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr S.

He is survived by his 92-year-old wife Surjit Kaur, five children, 10 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.\n\nHis eldest son Mel Gill, a psychologist, said his father fractured his hip last February after a fall, but \"healed sufficiently in three months\". However, his health deteriorated later on owing to renal failure.\n\n\"Up until he fractured his hip, he was playing golf three times a week,\" he told Engish-language Indian weekly Tabla. \"He couldn't have surgery because he had several allergies, but he was a trooper; he ploughed on, and even from his bed at home he was always more concerned about everyone else. That was just how he was.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 11:34pm\n\n'The game has lost a legend': Liverpool fans in Singapore mourn Diogo Jota\n\nMore related stories\n\nSingapore Hockey Federation president Mathavan Devadas, who knew Ajit for more than 50 years, said he was an iconic figure. \"He was someone who, even in his 90s, was very active, still playing golf. He would always be available to come for events, to talk to players and share his experiences - he was an inspiration,\" said Mathavan.\n\nBorn in Kuala Lumpur in 1928, Ajit was the oldest of 10 siblings and lived through the Japanese occupation in Malaya during World War II.\n\nAs a young athlete, he excelled in hockey and represented Selangor at 17.\n\nHe moved to Singapore in 1951 to enrol in the Teacher's Training College. Within five years, he donned Singapore's colours at the Melbourne Olympics, where he and his teammates finished eighth in Singapore hockey's first and only appearance at the Games.\n\nIn the 1960s, he showed his all-round sporting ability when he swapped his hockey stick for a cricket bat, once again representing Singapore in various international matches.\n\nHis friend, former national hockey player Harbhajan Singh Loomba, 85, who played both hockey and cricket alongside Ajit for the Indian Association, said that, as a teammate, there was no one better than him.\n\n\"He was a humble, very friendly person, and I'm happy to have known him for so many years - since 1956 when we were both part of the teachers' union,\" Loomba said.\n\n\"He was outstanding in both sports. You couldn't have asked for a better teammate. He spoke to everyone and always advised the younger players.\"\n\nLocal sports enthusiast A. Thiyaga Raju remembers Ajit fondly, as he was a student at Queenstown Secondary School in 1974 when Ajit taught there. The two also kept in touch over the following decades.\n\nMr Raju wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday: \"In 2016, when I hosted a surprise birthday party for Mr Ajit at his Teachers' Housing Estate residence, he excitedly showed me old newspaper cuttings and scrapbooks containing articles on him, and reminisced about his glory days as an Olympian.\n\n\"He proudly shared with me that it was in Melbourne during the Games that he bought a proposal ring for his future wife.\"\n\nIn his later years, Ajit kept active through golf and race walking. His penchant for winning carried on as he topped the Asean Senior Amateur Golf Championship in 1990. In 2016, he claimed gold in the 5,000m race walk at the Asia Masters Athletics Championships.\n\nAnd in 2010, he was one of the 2,400 torch-bearers - and the oldest - at the Singapore leg of the Youth Olympic Games torch relay.\n\n\"He may have been physically old, but mentally, he was sharp,\" explained his son Mel when asked how Ajit kept himself active even in his advanced years.\n\n\"He had an awesome mindset. He always felt that you could only improve by doing something over and over again. He was a competitor all the way.\"\n\nAjit's other son Phupinder Gill said that of all his father's accomplishments, making the Olympic grade meant the most to the old man.\n\n\"Growing up during that time, when the ruling class was very different from how it is today, making it to the Olympic team was something special to him,\" said Phupinder, who is the CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n\n\"He did it not because he knew someone or anything like that, but because he worked hard. That made him have this philosophy in life to persevere and not to fear anybody.\n\n\"Aside from marrying the woman he wanted to, that was his greatest accomplishment.\"\n\nALI KASIM\n\nobituary\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 12, 2025, 12:38am\n\nFormer Singapore cricketer and coach Arjun Menon killed in Malawi\n\nMay 1, 2025, 01:29am\n\nWorld's oldest person, a Brazilian nun, dies at age 116\n\nApr 22, 2025, 07:50am\n\nPuan Noor Aishah, S'pore's first first lady, remembered for grace and service\n\nApr 17, 2025, 02:49am\n\nPM Wong pays tribute to Cultural Medallion recipient Yusnor Ef\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Fish could also be seen swimming in the water at the time.\n\nIn another case, water in a canal in Jurong West turned crimson in 2015, alarming some residents. This was attributed by PUB to an organic solvent and dye in a perimeter drain.\n\nThe public can contact PUB on 1800-2255-782 to report any suspected pollution in Singapore's waterways.\n\nWallace Woon\n\nand\n\nFatimah Mujibah\n\npub\n\nWater pollution\n\nBukit Timah\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 21, 2025, 11:25pm\n\nTemporary closures of Bukit Timah, Dunearn roads on April 25-26\n\nApr 21, 2025, 08:16am\n\nFlash flood in Yishun Ave 7 is estate's third in 9 days\n\nApr 13, 2025, 06:15am\n\nFlash flood at Yishun Ave 7 amid heavy downpour, public should avoid the area\n\nMar 25, 2025, 01:25am\n\nLack of proper drainage causes floods during monsoon surge\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

His record reads: 1-2-4-3-2.\n\nHe signalled his chances for Jan 20 with a top trial on Jan 11 and a fluent 600m hit-out (41.1sec) on Jan 16.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nAlthough he finished second in the trial - by half a length - behind Pacific Gold, it was evident he could have won it easily.\n\nHis race jockey, five-time Singapore champion Manoel Nunes, kept him wide under a stranglehold.\n\nHad he released the brakes, Black Storm would have unleashed a powerful gust to land the trial in a faster time than Pacific Gold's 1min 02.38sec.\n\nHe now looks fit and ready to collect another win cheque on Jan 20.\n\nBlack Storm landed his first success as Roman Chief on July 30, 2023.\n\nThat was in a Restricted Maiden event over 1,400m in 1:22.41, beating Creative Dreams, who is also a top chance in Race 9.\n\nHe was then under trainer Michael Clements, who did not want to stay on until Singapore racing's closure on Oct 5. He quit in late September.\n\nBlack Storm had another start, finishing second Novice company over 1,400m, under Clements before being transferred to Tim Fitzsimmons.\n\nUnder the 2022 Singapore champion, Black Storm is getting closer with each start.\n\nIf number sequence is to be followed, it will be a \"1\" after his \"4-3-2\" finishing order.

But, as it turned out, there was Red Dot - with a rating of 72 - who stepped up to the plate and delivered.\n\nIt was a one-horse affair with only one question being asked. Just how wide a margin would Red Dot put between himself and the chasing pack?\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThat was after he opened a six-length lead at the first turn - a lead which increased to 10 lengths at the 600m mark.\n\nIn the saddle, apprentice Clyde Leck was getting a sedan chair ride, as Red Dot did all the work.\n\nDream Alliance, with a rating of 89 and making his first appearance after that brilliant effort when second to Lim's Kosciuszko in the 2023 Singapore Gold Cup on Nov 11, tried to lift the excitement level. But he could never eat into the lead.\n\nSo it was, the David Kok-trained Red Dot was allowed to have it his way. Although he did come back to them over the final furlong, he still managed to get home by a healthy six lengths.\n\nHe won in a respectable 1min 00.57sec for the Polytrack 1,000m.\n\nThe hard-ridden 66-point rater Lim's Craft - the mount of Sazali Ramli - held on to that second spot, which consigned Dream Alliance to third.\n\nA last-start winner on Dec 30, Red Dot has won two races from just four starts.\n\nWith natural progression, he could have a terrific 2024 season.\n\nAs for Dream Alliance, he also will be a force to be reckoned with in the big races coming up in this final year for Singapore racing.\n\nA couple of others looking to leave their mark in the new season and having their trials on Jan 18 were Silo and Tiger Roar.\n\nUnfortunately for Kranji, Silo will be continuing his racing in Hong Kong. It will be our loss and the former British colony's gain.\n\nA youngster - he is just three years old - Silo took out the fifth trial of the morning. And he did it with plenty of authority.\n\nRidden by Vlad Duric, who won on him on Dec 30, Silo made his rivals eat his dust when leading all the way over the 1,000m.\n\nThe very talented Last Supper made some inroads at the 600m mark.\n\nBut he was never asked to extend by jockey Manoel Nunes and eventually finished at the rear.\n\nIt was left to King Gee (Chong Shin Wah) and Colonel Son (trainer Richard Lim) to push and prod Silo. That they did, but they were never going to put a dent into Silo's lead.\n\nHe eventually took the trial by 2 3/4 lengths in 1:01.12.\n\nOwned by the Toasts Trust & Silo Stable and trained by Stephen Crutchley, Silo has had a terrific 2023.\n\nIndeed, he has never been further than third in all his seven start, which produced three victories, three seconds and a third.\n\nHopefully, his owners will give him a few more runs at Kranji before uprooting.\n\nIt will be good to see him in action - especially now that he is in that rich vein of form.\n\nAs for Tiger Roar, he took out the first trial of the morning, beating Smart Era (Amirul Ismadi) by half a length in 1:01.34.\n\nBut it was easier than the margin suggested.\n\nAlways well up with the pace - he was third at the 600m mark - Marc Lerner prodded him into action at the top of the straight and Tiger Roar was more than game.\n\nHe opened up in style. With a furlong to travel, he was going better than the rest and it was on a tight hold that he cruised to the line.\n\nPrepared by Daniel Meagher, Tiger Roar has been a good one to have in the yard.\n\nHe has won seven races for the Falcon Racing No. 7 Stable and the general feeling is one of optimism. Yes, we have not yet seen Tiger Roar bare his fangs.\n\nA six-year-old formerly trained by Michael Clements, Tiger Roar has not raced since that last win on Aug 28, 2022.\n\nThat was against a competitive field of Class 2 talents. Under a strong ride by Simon Kok, he easily beat Prosperous Return over the 1,400m.\n\nSince then, Meagher has put his charge through four trials and that last one on Jan 18 was an eye-opener. Tiger Roar is in red-hot form and must be one to note when he next goes to the races.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a252504a566608f0c621a5c5e8705bb2b4e29addbe4735eee37513d1aa3a2b61/bmtrials19.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Last-start winner Red Dot (Clyde Leck) making it an one-act affair in the second of six trials on Jan 18. \n", "caption": "Last-start winner Red Dot (Clyde Leck) making it an one-act affair in the second of six trials on Jan 18.

Fans also performed some of Lee's songs and dances at the event.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"2023 was a difficult year for my family and all the fans who love Coco,\" Nancy said in a speech on behalf of the family. \"Jan 17, 2024 is Coco's first birthday since she left us, and my family would like to thank fans who came here from around the world to send their blessings.\"\n\nNancy, 51, said she hoped fans would remember what Lee left behind, and that they would work hard to live with her love and positive energy.\n\n\"My mum said after Coco left us that she is getting old, and my elder sister and I are no longer young,\" Nancy said. \"We hope that Coco's story can still be passed down by the fans and their children so that the world will not forget about her.\"\n\nAt the event, Lee's mother announced that a platform has been established for her global fan club to disseminate information on commemorative events.\n\nLim Ruey Yan\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nhong kong\n\nChina\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 7, 2025, 01:33am\n\nStar Awards 2025: The 11 red carpet looks that caught the eye\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:25am\n\nActor-singer Glenn Yong's pomeranian Rio brings family closer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nJul 3, 2025, 07:31am\n\nNo foundation on screen in 22 years: Jeanette Aw talks beauty in her 40s\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The South Korean had progressed with a 21-19, 14-21, 21-14 win over American Zhang Beiwen.\n\nYeo's quarter-final with An will be a rematch of their last-eight showdown at last week's Malaysia Open, when An prevailed in three games to extend her head-to-head superiority to 7-1. Yeo had beaten China's world No. 8 Han Yue earlier in the Super 1000 tournament.\n\nThe US$850,000 (S$1.14m) India Open is a Super 750 competition on the third level of the Badminton World Federation World Tour, behind the World Tour Finals and Super 1000 events.\n\nYeo's fine start to 2024 is in stark contrast to her five straight defeats to open 2023, in which she did not make it past the second round of a Super 1000 or Super 750 event, and could not beat any top-10 player in 14 attempts.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMar 2, 2025, 11:33pm\n\nYeo Jia Min savours German Open win as she ends badminton title drought\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe 24-year-old told The Straits Times: \"I focused on the details of improving my game and saw results in training. That gave me confidence to challenge any top player now. However, I don't like to compare myself to others or look back on the past too much. I will focus only on what is next for me.\n\n\"I became friends with An Se-young when I trained with her and her teammates in South Korea for two weeks in November, and I will try to be mentally sharper for our next match.\"\n\nYeo had gone into her match against Tunjung trailing 2-6 in their past encounters, with the Indonesian enjoying a breakthrough in which she rose from world No. 31 to a career-high seventh in 18 months. She also beat the Singaporean thrice in 2023.\n\nUnder slow conditions that were conducive for long rallies, the first game was a roller-coaster, with both players taking turns to build four-point advantages early on before trading leads nearer to the end.\n\nYeo was fortunate to win a couple of points while being out of position, but showed tenacity to save two game points while requiring three of her own to clinch the opener. While she won only four out of 13 games that went to deuce in 2023, she has managed a perfect two-for-two in 2024.\n\nIn the second game, Yeo beat Tunjung at her own game with good court coverage and aggression to record another encouraging win.\n\nNational singles head coach Kelvin Ho said: \"Jia Min is more mature now in handling different shots and is more accepting of changes in the game.\n\n\"She has grown through the wins and losses in 2023, and developed well working with the coaching team and sparring partners. She understands better her strengths and how to bring them into her playing style, so she can be more positive when creating her game plans.\"\n\nDavid Lee\n\nSports Correspondent\n\nYeo Jia Min\n\nbadminton\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 21, 2024, 10:28pm\n\nYeo Jia Min beats former world champ to reach China Masters q-finals\n\nOct 18, 2024, 06:55am\n\nLoh Kean Yew's coach Kelvin Ho to take over national training squad\n\nMay 29, 2024, 12:51am\n\nLoh Kean Yew remains sole local player in KFF Singapore Badminton Open\n\nJan 12, 2024, 01:36am\n\nSingapore shuttlers advance to Malaysia Open quarter-finals\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But she chose to stay in England to train for the Winter Youth Olympic Games (YOG).\n\nJust a month before that, the teenager had earned a quota spot at the Jan 19-Feb 1 Gangwon Games, after the withdrawal of one of the countries from the quadrennial event.\n\nShe said: \"It was tough at first because this was my first time spending Christmas away from home and my family and I had already missed out celebrating my birthday (in October) with them.\n\n\"But I'm grateful to be able to train with the UK team here and for the support from the coaches and also the families of my teammates here, so I was not completely alone during the holiday season.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 31, 2025, 11:58pm\n\nFormer Pandan Gardens pool possible spot for new ice rink\n\nMore related stories\n\nStaying put in England, where she is training and studying at the University of Nottingham International College, was key for her to prepare for the biggest competition of her career.\n\nBack home, she is only able to train on ice for two days a week - Singapore's only Olympic-sized ice skating rink at JCube closed last August - while gets six days in the United Kingdom.\n\nAll this extra work was worth it for Amelia, who has dreamt of competing in the Winter YOG since she was a young girl.\n\nShe started recreational figure skating with her family in 2012 but switched to short track speed skating two years later after watching the Sochi Winter Olympics on television.\n\nAmelia said: \"I liked how the races were, they were really exciting. All the overtaking, even the crashes and how fast-paced the races would be... I was very intrigued, impressed and in awe of how the skaters were skating so I really wanted to give it a shot.\n\n\"It was hard initially because it's two different disciplines but I was more into doing the fast-paced action, it felt more comfortable to me than doing the graceful figure skating things.\"\n\nShe has been hooked on the sport since. Even a crash and an injured knee a week before her first regional competition in 2016 could not stop her from skating.\n\nIn Gangwon, Amelia is aiming to progress as far as she can and she is also looking forward to meeting her fellow athletes, some of whom she met at a camp in Korea in 2023.\n\nShe said: \"I'm really excited to be representing Singapore at the YOG, it's a huge honour and I'm very proud that I've come this far in my sport... It's always been my dream to represent Singapore on such a huge stage since I picked up skating in 2014.\n\n\"I've always dreamt of going to the Olympics and this is just a major personal milestone, it's a step in the right direction for where I want to be in my career.\"\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nWINTER SPORTS\n\nSINGAPORE ATHLETES\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMar 25, 2024, 01:47pm\n\nTwice's Jihyo and Physical: 100 star Yun Sung-bin said to be dating\n\nJan 21, 2024, 11:38pm\n\nShort track speed skater Ryo Ong finds self-belief in unfamiliar environment at Winter Youth Olympics\n\nDec 14, 2023, 09:25am\n\nAmelia Chua secures second spot for Singapore at 2024 Winter Youth Olympic Games\n\nNov 15, 2023, 09:00am\n\nMan arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after UK ice hockey player's death\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The parents were then informed that their newborn has a congenital heart defect.\n\nLeon was born with pulmonary atresia - a condition in which the valve of the pulmonary artery, the main blood vessel to the lungs, is not developed and blocks essential blood flow.\n\nBarely three weeks and two surgeries later, he suffered two strokes. One affected his peripheral vision while the other affected the right side of his body.\n\nHe is still in the neonatal intensive care unit, needing to be tube-fed, and is receiving injections of blood-thinning medication twice a day.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2025, 05:38am\n\nKKH opens Singapore's first centre for flat-head syndrome as cases rise 36%\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe routine is expected to continue for the next three months, but all his parents want is to be able to cradle him in their arms at home. He is slated to be discharged on Jan 21.\n\n\"When the doctors first told us about his condition, we just had so many questions racing through our heads,\" said Mr Koit, 41, in a phone call from KKH.\n\n\"Why wasn't this detected earlier? What's going to happen now? What does this mean for Leon in the future?\"\n\nAccording to the Cleveland Clinic in the United States, pulmonary atresia occurs in about one in 10,000 live births.\n\nThe survival rate without surgery is about 50 per cent at the age of one.\n\nIn Leon's case, he went through a surgical procedure on Dec 14 to create an opening in his pulmonary artery. But the six-hour procedure was unsuccessful, and he underwent another one five days later.\n\nThis time, a small tube, or shunt, was inserted near his heart to allow blood to flow.\n\nBecause Leon is still growing, it is only a temporary measure. When he turns 18 months old, he will need to undergo cardiac surgery.\n\n\"We were told that there's a 5 per cent to 15 per cent chance of dying if he undergoes the surgery now; 18 months is when the risk gets lower.\n\n\"After all this, he'll have to go for rehabilitation and physiotherapy as well because of the strokes, although it's still too early to tell if there'll be any effects on his development,\" said Mr Koit, who works in the finance industry.\n\nEvery day is a heart-wrenching ordeal, he added.\n\n\"Having to watch your child suffer and not being able to do anything about it. It hurts as a parent.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the family has set up a fund-raising campaign on Give.asia with the aim of raising $70,000 to pay for Leon's medical procedures.\n\nGovernment subsidies and MediSave have helped to offset the bulk of the bills, and the donations will be paid directly to KKH.\n\nThe campaign has already amassed more than $41,000 since it began on Jan 12.

There can be no compromise, relaxation, or fudging the issue; no matter the political price, said Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\n\n\"The PAP government will continue to do everything we can to uphold the highest standards of integrity, incorruptibility and propriety. That's how we maintain the trust that Singaporeans have placed in us,\" he told journalists on Jan 18.\n\nHis remarks came hours after former transport minister S. Iswaran was handed 27 charges in court - two counts of corruption, 24 counts of obtaining items from someone he had business dealings with as a public servant, and one of obstructing the course of justice.\n\nDPM Wong said that the investigations into Iswaran were initiated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) and since then, the government pursued the matter \"decisively and proactively\".\n\nOnce CPIB completed its investigations and the public prosecutor assessed the findings independently, they decided to proceed with charges against Iswaran, said DPM Wong.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 07:51am\n\n$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn court, Iswaran pleaded not guilty, and is now out on $800,000 bail.\n\nWhen asked, DPM Wong said that the case would have \"no impact\" on succession and the leadership transition.\n\nDPM Wong said it was announced that the PAP's leadership transition will take place before the next general election, and before the party conference in November 2024.\n\n\"This plan remains on track,\" he said.\n\n\"We are saddened and disappointed that Iswaran has to leave politics under these circumstances\" and while he has no doubt that it would affect party morale, DPM Wong said: \"But we cannot allow this political hit to compromise our zero tolerance stance against corruption.\"\n\nHe added: \"And that's why the party, the government will continue to do the right thing and do everything we can to keep our system corruption free. I believe Singaporeans expect no less from us.\"\n\nOn how the case would affect the PAP's plans on when to call the general election, DPM Wong said the government's focus is to continue and press on with its work, and redouble its efforts to improve the lives of Singaporeans.\n\nHe said: \"When the general election comes, the PAP will present our report card to Singaporeans, and we'll do our best to earn the confidence and trust of Singaporeans.\"\n\nOn the Code of Conduct for Ministers, DPM Wong said that the code, which has been in place since 1954, is \"not static\" and continues to be updated.\n\n\"We will continue to review and update the Code, taking into account the experiences and learnings from this incident,\" he said.\n\nDPM Wong noted that there will be many civil servants who are disappointed, shocked and saddened by what has happened, including those who have worked closely with Iswaran all these years.\n\nHe stressed that there was no whistleblower or tip off, and that CPIB pursued this matter on its own accord.\n\nThe bureau, he said, did a thorough investigation and left no stone unturned, before presenting their investigation to the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC).\n\nDPM Wong highlighted that the AGC has explained that it will look at the investigations against Iswaran first, before deciding whether decisions should be taken against others who are involved in this matter.\n\nHe hoped that civil servants will see that \"what has transpired is the determination of the PAP government to keep our system free from corruption\".\n\n\"That determination is clear, and we will not compromise on our zero tolerance stance against corruption,\" he said.\n\n\"That will ensure that Singapore remains special, that will ensure that Singapore can continue to move forward with confidence in the future.\"\n\nNatasha Ann Zachariah\n\nand\n\nJean Iau\n\nSingapore\n\nCPIB\n\nS ISWARAN\n\nLawrence Wong\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nSmart Investors Are Backing Small Businesses\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d0e4c0306cbefb51124cc0119f0d7adaf4788f5f8a9a99ed62ccd63b758df3c8/2024011826395475img4263.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong speaks to the press at the National Press Centre on Jan 18, 2024.", "caption": "Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong speaks to the press at the National Press Centre on Jan 18, 2024.

There will also be two 22kW alternating current (AC) chargers there.\n\nAt Oasis Terraces in Punggol, SP Mobility will run two fast charging points, powered by a single 100kW DC dual-gun charger. In addition, there will be four 22kW AC chargers.\n\nUnlike AC chargers, a DC charger has a converter inside the charger. That means it can feed power directly to the car's battery and does not need the vehicle's on-board converter.\n\nEach dual-gun charger can juice up two EVs at the same time.\n\nWith these fast chargers, EV drivers will be able to get a quick boost that will give them an extra 100km to 200km in mileage with a 30-minute to one-hour charge, Dr Khor said.\n\nIn contrast, charging a vehicle such as the MG5, which cab operator Strides Premier uses as a taxi, takes about 8½ hours using a slow charger.\n\nEVe said the decision to deploy fast chargers at HDB carparks came in response to industry feedback.\n\nRight now, most fast chargers are at commercial places such as malls and offices. The company said heavy EV users such as cabbies and fleet drivers had asked for more fast chargers at public carparks, where parking rates are more affordable, and where there are amenities such as coffee shops and hawker centres.\n\nDr Khor said overnight slow charging, however, remains the predominant charging strategy for private electric cars, adding that most drivers will need to charge their EVs only once every five or six days if they clock an average daily mileage of 50km.\n\nShe said: \"While slow chargers will meet the needs of most EV drivers, we also recognise that fast chargers are needed as a supplement.\"\n\nDr Khor noted that new electric car registrations formed 18.2 per cent of all new car registrations in 2023 - 50 per cent more than in 2022, and almost five times compared with 2021.\n\nIn November 2023, registrations for \"cleaner energy\" cars, which include fully electric and hybrid cars, crossed 75 per cent of all car registrations for the first time, she added.\n\nThere are now almost 11,000 fully electric cars on the roads here, and more than 15,200 EVs, after including other vehicle classes such as taxis and motorcycles.\n\nAs part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the Government's aim is for all vehicles here to run on cleaner energy by 2040, with the registration of new diesel cars and taxis to stop from 2025 and the registration of new pure combustion engine cars to end from 2030.\n\nWhile EV adoption has climbed, the shortage of EV chargers has been a sticking point for drivers yet to make the switch.\n\nIn November 2022, five companies were picked to roll out EV chargers at 2,000 public carparks under a large-scale tender.\n\nThis was part of the Government's move to encourage greater adoption of EVs by expanding the charging network to tackle \"range anxiety\", a common concern among drivers that their cars will run out of power before reaching a charging station.\n\nThe bulk of the chargers installed as part of the large-scale tender are 7.4kW slow chargers that are mostly located on the third deck of HDB multi-storey carparks.\n\nThe large-scale tender followed an earlier one awarded in September 2021 to install more than 600 charging points in public carparks.\n\nSingapore aims to have 60,000 EV charging points by 2030, of which 40,000 will be in public carparks and 20,000 on private premises such as malls and condominiums.\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nTransport Correspondent\n\nELECTRIC AND HYBRID VEHICLES\n\nLTA\n\nhdb\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 21, 2025, 10:28pm\n\n19 public carparks in Singapore now equipped with fast EV chargers\n\nMay 14, 2025, 07:29am\n\nBYD is top-selling car in Singapore in first four months of 2025 with 20% of total sales\n\nApr 23, 2025, 09:34am\n\nCOE prices for Cat A and Cat E inch up in latest bidding\n\nMar 19, 2025, 09:01pm\n\nCOE prices rise across the board; Cat B and E cross $116,000\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nHow to Invest Your First $100K Wisely in Singapore\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/3d191f3af6251d6c64047affa537dbf70885b93d5ee591488b2848b6b4dcdf11/20240118591484425b77daa6-a12b-409e-b38f-7e494240277a.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A new electric vehicle charging station at the carpark of HDB Hub on Jan 18, 2024.", "caption": "A new electric vehicle charging station at the carpark of HDB Hub on Jan 18, 2024.

He was also ordered a pay a penalty of $70.\n\nThe cases against Thiru, who is no longer with Certis Cisco, and Chen are pending.\n\nDPP Yu said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) had formed Foreign Workers Management (FWM) teams to patrol places where such workers congregate.\n\nEach FWM team typically consists of auxiliary police officers, who are in uniform and armed, and security officers, who are in polo shirts and unarmed.\n\nThe SPF also had a contract with Certis Cisco to supply auxiliary police officers and security officers for deployment in the FWM teams.\n\nAmong other things, the officers were tasked to take action against offences such as littering and the sale of illegal SEDs.\n\nHafizudin and Thiru were deployed to the same team, known as \"Golf 3\", and attached to Geylang Neighbourhood Police Centre. The team was tasked to patrol the areas around Geylang.\n\nTo commit their offences, Hafizudin and Thiru would first seize the SEDs from a peddler, according to protocol, said DPP Yu.\n\nHowever, the pair would not hand over all of the seized drugs to the SPF and would retain a portion instead.\n\nHafizudin would then snap an image of the retained drugs and send the picture to Thiru.\n\nThe prosecutor added: \"After the rest of the team leaves, Thiru would then secretly approach the peddler in person to offer to return a certain amount of the seized SEDs to him if the peddler agreed to pay a specific sum of money to Thiru.\n\n\"Thiru would show the photo of the seized SEDs to the peddler. This sum of money would be a few times higher than the cost price of the SEDs.\"\n\nIf the peddler agrees, he would slip some cash in a cigarette box that he would place at a certain location.\n\nThe court heard that either Hafizudin or Thiru would then collect the money at a later time.\n\nDPP Yu said: \"Thiru or Hafizudin would place the agreed amount of SEDS to be returned to the peddler at a location, such as under a traffic cone in an alleyway, and inform the peddler for him to pick it up.\n\n\"On some occasions, Thiru or Hafizudin would tip off the peddler in advance of incoming raids... so that the peddler could prepare to escape and avoid detection from the FWM team.\"\n\nDPP Yu added that the two men had seen Chen during their patrols in the Geylang area and approached him in May 2022 to obtain the bribes. He agreed to hand over the money.\n\nIn August 2022, the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau received information about the graft-related offences and Hafizudin was arrested in September 2022.\n\nTwo other men, former Certis Cisco officer Mohd Aris Jalil, 66, and Chinese national Chen Dongliang, 33, are also accused of committing similar offences.

Unfortunately for him, he didn't have the courage to come down.\n\n\"That's what I was asking him. If you have courage, if you're such a tough man, tough guy, come down and tell it to my face, and let's have a discussion about it.\"\n\nHeckling aside, Djokovic also had trouble with his game. His forehand was unusually fragile and at times he seemed bothered by the wrist problem that flared up prior to the tournament.\n\nHe also looked flat at times as he dealt with a cold but still managed to get the job done against the 24-year-old Popyrin who will rue not taking the third set.\n\nNext up for Djokovic is Argentine Tomas Etcheverry who has already accounted for Andy Murray and Gael Monfils.\n\nAfter a tumultuous night on Rod Laver Arena, Djokovic said he may prepare for that by visiting Melbourne's Botanical Gardens -- and spend some time with his favourite tree.\n\n\"There's one particular tree that I've been having special relationship with, so to say, in the last 15 years,\" he said. \"I love every corner of botanical gardens. I think it's (an) incredible treasure for Melbourne.\n\n\"That particular tree, I cannot reveal which one, I'll try to keep it discreet for myself when I'm there to have my own time.

So, she looked at other addresses to try and locate Bronson, and when she failed to do that, she spoke to her manager and she contacted police,\" said Ms Sandy.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 4, 2025, 12:31am\n\nMan arrested for supplying drugs to Liam Payne\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe social worker went back on Jan 4, but again did not get a response.\n\nShe returned on Jan 9. When no one answered the door, she alerted the landlady and gained entry to the property.\n\nBronson's mother, Ms Sarah Piesse, 43, told The Guardian she last saw her son before Christmas. She had been living apart from Mr Battersby and had got in a fight with him when she last saw him.\n\nMr Battersby was believed to have died of a heart attack no earlier than Dec 29. He was unemployed and had a pre-existing heart condition that caused him to become severely jaundiced in the months leading up to his death.\n\nMs Piesse told The Guardian that the post-mortem examination found that her son had died of dehydration and starvation.\n\n\"Bronson starved to death because his dad died,\" she said.\n\n\"I couldn't pick him up because his body was too fragile,\" she said. \"I could only touch him. He had been left there too long.\"\n\nA neighbour, who claimed she knew the family, described Bronson as a \"gorgeous, happy little boy\".\n\nThe boy loved watching cartoons on the YouTube channel Cocomelon, nursery rhymes, and playing with his drum kit, she said.\n\nMs Maria Clifton-Plaice, Mr Battersby's landlady, told the BBC that finding the two bodies was one of the \"worst (days) of my life\".\n\nShe said she did not know Bronson well, but remarked: \"I know he'd come and started staying with Kenny recently, and he was just probably the light of his dad's eye. He was, I think, Kenny's chance to be a good dad.\"\n\nBoston and Skegness MP Matt Warman described what happened as a tragedy.\n\n\"It does appear that social services made repeated contact. They tried to get hold (of), and the system did not seem to understand, the potential gravity of the situation. That's what we've got to try and understand,\" he said.\n\nRaul Dancel\n\nCorrespondent\n\nBritain\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nACCIDENTS\n\nCHILD CUSTODY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nNov 15, 2024, 10:49pm\n\nS'pore govt officer in London warned for leaving kids home alone\n\nAug 31, 2024, 04:39am\n\nOasis concert tickets relisted for more than $10k minutes after pre-sale\n\nAug 28, 2024, 12:16am\n\nAdele invites Singapore fan onstage at her concert in Germany\n\nAug 14, 2024, 03:33pm\n\nTaylor Swift set for emotional London return after terror threat\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f8d863f8c93ad63ac39c11191839a6a77f4394645b7d081567bfce06c802ddba/rdtoddler17.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "A neighbour described two-year-old Bronson Battersby as a  “gorgeous, happy little boy” who loved watching cartoons on YouTube.", "caption": "A neighbour described two-year-old Bronson Battersby as a  “gorgeous, happy little boy” who loved watching cartoons on YouTube.

Other times, he loathed it. He just needed a job to get by.\n\nBut See did not miss his previous life as a jockey either.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nBesides the cheers, he also copped jeers - three times for three separate lengthy disqualifications - Look At Me (2011), Perfect Challenger (2015) and Smoke And Mirrors (2022).\n\nThe latest ban was the longest, 18 months, and costliest with a $50,000 fine. Three strikes, and he was out.\n\nNot many jockeys get a second chance, let alone a third, but he spurned them all.\n\nThe Perth-trained jockey did not even bother reapplying for a licence in 2023 when his ban ended in February. The chances that the committee's leniency had not been worn thin were next to nothing.\n\nDisillusioned with the way his career had gone south, See secured a liquor's licence at Newton Circus instead, and put a line through his 15 years as a jockey.\n\nOr so he thought.\n\nSome 30 months - 909 days to be exact - after he rode his last winner All We Know at Kranji on July 18, 2021, See popped up a winner at Geraldton, Western Australia, on Jan 13.\n\nThe 40-year-old's pledge to not jump in a saddle again did not last very long.\n\n\"Back in August, I decided to hand my stall to my staff and return to Australia, in Geraldton, mainly to get back with my family,\" said See, who has two children, Jacob, 14, and Chayla, 11, with Australian wife Cassey.\n\n\"They were with me in Singapore at first but it was hard as Cassey didn't have a job there, and then I was out.\n\n\"She also went back to Perth for the kids' schools. It was hard as I missed them, luckily, we can video call.\n\n\"So, racing was the last thing on my mind when I went back to Australia. I just wanted to find another job here, I kept my options open.\n\n\"But Cassey works as stable foreman for trainer Bob Martin and, with the stables only a 15-minute drive from our Greenough home, I soon went back to the stables.\n\n\"Next thing I know, I was bitten by the bug again. I started riding trackwork first and, as my weight dropped to 54kg, I started thinking about a riding comeback.\"\n\nTo See's delight, his application with the licensing committee from the Racing and Wagering Western Australia (RWWA) was successful.\n\n\"I'd like to thank RWWA for giving me the opportunity to ride in Western Australia, especially Mr John Zucal from the licensing office,\" he said.\n\nSee took his first ride back at Geraldton on Nov 29, finishing a close fourth aboard a 40-1 shot, Where's My Lunch, for Martin.\n\n\"I worked hard with Bob and Cassey on this horse. It was a very encouraging first ride,\" he said.\n\nSimilar bookings on mostly roughies followed but he did ride a handful of minor placings, including one that would lead to the breakthrough.\n\n\"After I finished third on Navy Sun in a 1,400m race (Dec 9), I told Ron Cowl the trainer that he can go up to 1,600m,\" said See.\n\n\"But I missed his next start on 1,600m because I was committed to another horse. I got on last Saturday, and the horse (25-1) got up to beat the leader (Butterflyrock).\"\n\nAfter a short stint with hops in a bottle, See has hopped back onto his first love - and a winner to boot.\n\nSee would rather stay in his comfort zone of the countryside, though.\n\n\"I was offered to ride in the city at Ascot and Belmont, but I prefer the quieter life in Geraldton,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm enjoying life in Australia with my wife and my two kids. I can get to see them grow up.\n\n\"I do miss home and I still keep in touch with my jockey friends in Singapore.\n\n\"I feel sorry for them with racing closing (in October). It's sad to see 182 years of history come to an end.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

So he sat there, snug as a bug in a rug, and timed his run to perfection.\n\nHe said \"go\" at the 250m mark and October took off.\n\nThey had the lead at the furlong mark and coasted in to beat Con Speranza by half-a-length.\n\nRattling home to claim third spot was Navy Seals, the mount of Benny Woodworth.\n\nA three-year-old chestnut, October covered the trip in 1min 01.36sec, which was a more than decent time considering the sloshy and sloppy conditions of the Polytrack.\n\nSo it must have been, when returning to the stable, Kellady would have had only good things to report to Gray. And he would not have been exaggerating.\n\nOn the day, October had run a good trial.\n\nSeemingly, he had finished with plenty more in the tank and, if he unloads it on his rivals at his next start, it could be a photo-taking occasion for his connections.\n\nThey missed out on a photo opportunity by a whisker on Dec 30, when October was beaten by Seamlessly. The margin was a nose.\n\nIt came on the back of another second placing on Dec 9.\n\nThat day, when October was backed down to $19 at the betting windows, he could not cope with Gun's finishing burst and went down by slightly over two lengths.\n\nA New Zealand-bred by Ocean Park, October has raced four times at Kranji for two seconds and a third.\n\nHe deserves his day in the sun and it could come sooner rather than later.\n\nWhile two-time winner Con Speranza did well to hold down second spot, mention must go to Navy Seals, who finished in third place.\n\nHe was hesitant out of the chute and was near last when the runners made that sweeping left-handed turn on the far side.\n\nBut up in the saddle, Woodworth seemed hardly perturbed.\n\nHolding his mount together, he pushed Navy Seals forward at the 700m and, by the time they straightened for the run home, he had slotted Navy Seals into third spot - and widest of the lot.\n\nAlthough not able to catch the leading pair of October and Con Speranza, he was doing his best work over the final 100m.\n\nA three-year-old, Navy Seals has fired blanks in seven previous Kranji efforts.\n\nBut he is better than that. Indeed, trainer Tan Kah Soon has put him through the wringer hoping to extract something extra from the youngster.\n\nSo far, no good. But things could change. Navy Seals won a trial on Dec 26. Coupled with the effort on Jan 16, we should see improvement at his next race start.\n\nSo, keep him on your shortlist. He is the first reserve in Race 8 on Jan 20 and, should he get a chance to race, you may want to include him in the novelty bets. He could make it all worthwhile.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

While there is no official announcement when the new campaign kicks off, The Straits Times understands it is likely to start in March.\n\nKitahara scored 17 goals in 13 matches for Albirex as they finished second in the 10-team competition, nine points behind champions Lion City Sailors.\n\nThis might be her debut on the WPL touchline but she is aiming high. Speaking through a translator, Kitahara, 35, said: \"I have never heard of the best player winner also being named best head coach. That is unprecedented. But to be honest, this will require the effort of everyone.\n\n\"A lot of the work will be done on the training pitch but during matches, I have good and reliable coaches with me and we will all do our best to achieve our goal of winning the title.\"\n\nKitahara, who holds a Japan Football Association B Licence, will be assisted by former Singapore women's team head coach Melisa Ye and former Singapore men's Under-17 assistant coach Toni Teo.\n\nHer on-field experience is unquestioned. Kitahara has played in midfield and attack for Albirex and was deployed as a defender for the Japan national team that finished runners-up at the 2015 World Cup.\n\nAlbirex chairman Daisuke Korenaga said his main goal is to elevate women's football here and that amongst several Japanese players with World Cup experience, Kitahara was his first choice when he convinced her to relocate in 2022.\n\nShe was also hired on a coaching contract which saw serve as the assistant of the U-17 Albirex men's team that competed in the Football Association of Singapore's Centre of Excellence U-17 league and as a coach in the Albirex Singapore Football Academy where she coached girls and boys from the age of six to 17.\n\nThe Sailors themselves will have a new face in the dugout after promoting their goalkeeper coach Daniel Ong, 34. He takes over from Yeong Sheau Shyan, who led the side to back-to-back undefeated title-winning campaigns and was WPL Coach of the Year in 2022 and 2023.\n\nYeong is now head of the Sailors women's programme, tasked with ensuring the development of players from the club's girls academy through to the WPL team.\n\nOng, who is also the women's national team goalkeeper coach, oversaw his first game in charge on Jan 12 in the Sailors' 4-2 win over second-tier Women's National League champions Royal Arion in the Cafe Football Charity Cup 2024 at Our Tampines Hub.\n\nThe job comes with \"big pressure\", he admitted, but said he is looking forward to the challenge.\n\n\"I feel blessed. Not everyone can take up this role but coach Sheau Shyan has trusted me and I want to do well,\" he added: \"Of course it is a big pressure given the team has been undefeated but I see this job as being one where I will be focused on making players better. As a team, they are good but individually, there is a lot to improve.\"\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nWomen's Premier League\n\nFootball\n\nSingapore Football\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

You have to confront what you did, and you have to find the answer to that, but it's not in trying to suggest the court has to be lenient to you.\"\n\nThe Chief Justice added that the court has to be faithful to precedents and stick to sentencing principles.\n\nThe man was one of seven hauled to court in an unprecedented case where husbands conspired with other men to have their own partners drugged and raped.\n\nThe crimes came to light after the man's wife discovered explicit images of herself on his mobile phone on Jan 1, 2020, and found out that her husband and another man had been \"exchanging wives\".\n\nMost of the men got to know one another on the SammyBoy online forum and other platforms where people talked about exchanging sexual partners.\n\nThey discussed wife-sharing fantasies in private and group chats, and also exchanged details of their sex lives and shared explicit images or videos of their wives or partners with one another.\n\nFour of these five men pleaded guilty to their respective charges and have been sentenced to between 13½ and 22 years in prison. Three of them were also each sentenced to 20 strokes of the cane.\n\nThe fifth man was found guilty in November 2023 following a trial, and is awaiting sentence.\n\nOne of these five men invited a seventh man to rape his wife, but the attempt was unsuccessful. This seventh man was jailed three years.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

We will challenge the charges vigorously in court,\" said their lawyer N. Surendran, adding that the case could stifle the growing local film industry.\n\nDeputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division Phil Robertson called the charges \"ludicrous\" and urged the authorities to drop the case.\n\n\"Prosecution of Khairi and Meng Kheng under a vague and arbitrary statute for so-called 'hurting religious feelings' shows very clearly how Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his government are fundamentally failing to protect freedom of expression,\" Mr Robertson said in a statement.\n\nThe duo are among a growing pool of up-and-coming young moviemakers.\n\nThe film Mentega Terbang (a Malay wordplay meaning \"Butterfly\") is about a 15-year-old girl who discusses the afterlife from the perspectives of different religions with her parents as she struggles to come to terms with her dying mother.\n\nThe film has been vehemently criticised by the religious authorities for going against the Islamic creed in Malaysia, where race and religion are highly sensitive matters.\n\nThe movie was released in 2021, but never screened in Malaysian theatres.\n\nIt was taken down from Hong Kong streaming platform Viu in February 2023. However, it remained available on Jan 17 for viewing on YouTube.\n\nThe movie was banned by Malaysia's Ministry of Home Affairs in September in 2023.\n\nIt is common for censors in the Muslim-majority country to ban films entirely or cut scenes related to subjects they deem sensitive. - AFP\n\nMovies\n\nreligion\n\nmalaysia\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/7bc06aca4d1088c8d70c8026932a930202bdbef1711eb8c9bf8c1865fd1c38a9/aifilm170124.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Director Khairi Anwar Jailani (second from left) and producer Tan Meng Kheng (third from left) could face a one-year jail term if found guilty.", "caption": "Director Khairi Anwar Jailani (second from left) and producer Tan Meng Kheng (third from left) could face a one-year jail term if found guilty.

He made an estimated profit of about $35,000.\n\nHis acts came to light when the commission received nearly 1,400 complaints from the public between February 2020 and September 2021. They had received marketing messages, despite registering on the Do Not Call Register to block such messages, according to the commission's findings released on Jan 17.\n\nThe authority then traced these messages to 95 prepaid SIM cards bought from Koh, who ran Mobile Chat, a shop in Geylang that sold mobile phones and prepaid SIM cards.\n\nIt found that Koh had exploited the SIM card registration process to register additional prepaid SIM cards through two ways.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 6, 2025, 12:46am\n\nIT vendor fined over data stolen from 190,000, sold on Dark Web\n\nMore related stories\n\nFirstly, he would scan identity documents, like identity cards and passports, twice to register two SIM cards without the customer's knowledge.\n\nKoh would then hand over only one card to the customer and keep the other to sell to unauthorised buyers.\n\nSecondly, for customers who had completed the registration process but decided not to buy a SIM card, Koh would keep the card instead of cancelling or reversing the registration.\n\nHe would then activate it without the customer's knowledge and sell the card to other buyers.\n\nThe 95 SIM cards sold by Koh had been registered with the details of 73 people, who had their names, addresses as well as their NRIC, FIN and passport numbers used without their consent.\n\nHowever, the commission found that it is likely that the personal data of more people were affected, as Koh admitted that he sold an average of 250 prepaid SIM cards annually over four years.\n\nIn deciding the fine for Koh, the commission noted Koh's breaches of the Personal Data Protection Act were difficult to detect, as these went unnoticed until the customers' information had been misused to send marketing messages.\n\nAs prepaid SIM cards are frequently used to further criminal activities, a supplier of prepaid SIM cards who breaches the act must be dealt with severely to deter others, said the commission.\n\nIt also considered the fact that his actions were intentional and took place over a long period of time, had caused inconvenience to innocent parties, and he had made a profit of about $35,000 .\n\nThe commission said Koh had asked for no financial penalty to be imposed due to personal and financial hardship. According to Koh, he was the sole breadwinner of his family and had been seeking treatment at the Institute of Mental Health.\n\nThese reasons were not accepted as he did not substantiate his claims.\n\nIn September 2023, Koh was also sentenced to 16 months of jail for illegally modifying the contents of M1's computer system to register pre-paid SIM cards.\n\nKoh had registered SIM cards with a terminal device provided by M1, which was used for registration of such cards before December 2021.\n\nThe commission said Koh's case is the second case involving egregious misuse of individuals' personal data for illicit activities.\n\nIn 2022, Yoshi Mobile was fined $21,000 for selling illicit SIM cards that were also used to send unsolicited messages.\n\nAng Qing\n\nPERSONAL DATA PROTECTION ACT\n\nData protection\n\ncrime\n\nSINGAPORE CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 14, 2024, 09:31am\n\nUse of NRIC numbers - Acra jumped the gun\n\nDec 13, 2024, 06:59am\n\nIC numbers linked to S'pore businesses easily obtained on Acra portal\n\nFeb 23, 2024, 09:45am\n\nCarousell fined $58k for data breaches\n\nAug 17, 2023, 01:29pm\n\nShopBack fined $74,400 over data leak that affected more than 1.4 million users\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

I treat her like my own child, my own sister,\" said Ms Sanjani, who told Ms Jomhao's father that she would raise money for his daughter's treatment.\n\nMs Sanjani has set up a fundraising campaign at\n\nGoGetFunding\n\n. The money raised will go towards Ms Jomhao's treatment here and in India when her conditions stabilise enough for her to be flown home.\n\nOn Jan 16, Ms Sanjani shared that Ms Jomhao had started responding and could follow basic commands.

Training is a two-way process and your participation will help you bond with your pet, and equip you with the right skill sets and mindset to guide your pet,\" she said.\n\nMs Sankar's comments were in response to a video posted on Instagram on Jan 15 showing two employees at dog training firm\n\nXavian and Pack pushing and hitting dogs.\n\nIn the video, one of the men pushes down on a dog's back to get it to sit. When the dog stands back up, the man uses both his arms to shove the dog down again and it eventually sits.\n\nThe other man drags another dog, before appearing to hit its body and head to get it to stay in place.\n\nThe firm's owner has said that the pair have since been suspended and the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS) said it is investigating the matter.\n\nMs Sankar said that businesses that conduct dog training should have stringent recruitment processes and regular training for employees.\n\nBusinesses should also develop a code of conduct that their employees can adhere to and go through assessment and obtain the relevant certification from government bodies before being allowed to handle animals without supervision, she added.\n\nThe AVS launched its Accredited Certified Dog Trainer Scheme on Dec 10, 2022, for dog trainers to improve their capabilities in managing dog behaviours.\n\nUnder the scheme, which is voluntary, dog trainers will get certification from any of the four following international animal behaviour and training organisations: the International Association of Animal Behaviour Consultants, the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers, the Animal Behaviour Society, and the American College of Veterinary Behaviourists.\n\nDog trainers who wish to apply for the scheme may visit\n\nAVS' website\n\nfor more information.\n\nDog owners who wish to engage an accredited trainer may also refer to a list on the same page.\n\nWallace Woon\n\nanimal abuse\n\nnational parks board\n\nANIMAL WELFARE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 27, 2025, 07:49am\n\nKitten allegedly rolled in container at Tuas adopted, NParks investigating\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:52am\n\nNParks probing case of kitten allegedly stuffed in container, rolled around\n\nJun 3, 2025, 11:20pm\n\nCommunity cats found dead in Yishun and Tampines linked to road accidents, not abuse\n\nMay 27, 2025, 06:09am\n\nCommunity cat found dead in Tampines West, residents appeal for witnesses\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nwealthwreath\n\nUSDT 是诈骗吗还是可以信赖\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e6121d5aeefc8c84861ec3c55ba401a4f6bf24533a820a9d564d2d3b890385f0/2019101815713769275175723820417215102a2obmczuann.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "There were 48 cases reported to the SPCA in 2019, 20 cases in 2020, 30 cases in 2021 and 35 cases in 2022.

Twice before - in his last two starts - Filial Dragon had to settle for second best.\n\nBoth times, he carried stable confidence and was not beaten by much.\n\nRichard Lim, his trainer, and the Hor Siew Stable, his owner, would have felt gutted.\n\nWell, as they say, \"that's racing\". You win some, you lose some.\n\nHowever, you live to fight another day and, in the case of Filial Dragon, that \"other day\" could come rushing at him.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe is down to contest the Class 4 Division 1 race over 1,200m on Jan 20 and, in his final preparation for that seventh start, Lim put Filial Dragon through his paces on the training track on Jan 16.\n\nRidden by Koh Teck Huat, Filial Dragon was in full flow, running the 600m in a swift 35.7sec.\n\nLim, who would surely have been watching at trackside, would have said \"now, that's more like it\".\n\nHe would have been spot-on. After all, the workout on Jan 16 was full of merit.\n\nHe did the job fluently and, if he brings that form to the racetrack on Jan 20, he could hand his rivals a beating and bring his winning tally to two.\n\nActually, it was not too long ago that Filial Dragon opened his Kranji account.\n\nThat was in a 1,200m sprint on Oct 28. That day, when handled confidently by Koh, Filial Dragon came off a midfield spot to beat Song Of Nature by 1½ lengths in 1min 09.51sec on the grass.\n\nIf it worries you that he must handle the Polytrack in the upcoming assignment, well, have no fear.\n\nFilial Dragon will make light of the underfoot conditions.\n\nIt was only on Dec 17 that he almost romped home a winner - only to be beaten by a short head by Last Samurai on the Poly.\n\nNext up on Jan 6, he again found one to beat, going down to Golden Brown, also on the synthetic surface over the 1,200m.\n\nYes, Filial Dragon is the real deal. He certainly looks to be one of the better gallopers in Lim's power-packed team of 20 entered for the Jan 20 meeting.\n\nThe other runner who could raise Lim's stock is Mr Black Back.\n\nHe, too, showed good action in his training gallop, when running the 600m in 38.7sec. Manoel Nunes was the man in the saddle.\n\nSlotted to run in the $85,000 Class 2 race over the mile, Mr Black Back comes into the race on the back of a more than decent last-start show on Dec 2.\n\nThat day, in the Group 3 Colonial Chief Stakes (1,700m), he finished fourth in the race won by Bestseller.\n\nThe race conditions did not favour Mr Black Back, as it was run over the Poly as opposed to the grass.\n\nIt was not that Mr Black Back could not handle the Poly. But it certainly was not his preferred surface, as all his three wins have been on the turf.\n\nHe will get that in the event that is coming up.\n\nThe gallop on Jan 16, which followed a runaway trial win on Jan 11, would have topped him up sufficiently for what lies ahead.\n\nBut it is not going to be a romp in the park and two runners who could make Mr Black Back sweat are Relentless and In All His Glory.\n\nBoth talents are from trainer Tim Fitzsimmons' yard and both were among the stars who showed up for work on a drizzly morning at Kranji.\n\nRelentless, partnered by Vlad Duric, ran the 600m in 41.3, while In All His Glory went a tad faster, stopping the clock at 40.2.\n\nA five-time winner, Relentless has been a good horse for the Arexevan-Relentless Stable - even though he has not won a race since June 26, 2022.\n\nBut Fitzsimmons has worked on him \"relentlessly\" and his trial on Jan 11, when second to Mr Black Back, would have given his connections plenty of hope.\n\nAs for In All His Glory, Fitzsimmons pulled him out from a 1,000m trial on Jan 16 and instead sent him for a 600m gallop.\n\nHe did a decent job but he must be at the top of his game on Jan 20.\n\nAfter all, it will be the second time in a long career that he faces Class 2 opposition.\n\nThe first time was way back on Nov 5, 2022, and that day he was fifth in a race won by Minister.\n\nSince then, he has been plying his trade in Class 3 and 4 and the step-up to Class 2 will surely be a test.\n\nBut the seven-year-old will get into the race with a light weight of just 50kg on his back and, if the rest are not wary, he could puncture some big egos.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\njan16trackwork.pdf\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Chance.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nRace 2 (1,800m)\n\n1 Precise Express\n\nhas a significant class edge over his rivals. He draws ideally and is suited with the 5lb (2.27kg) taken off with Angus Chung's apprentice claim. The one to beat.\n\n12 Palace Pal\n\nslots in light and should be finishing fast. He has found a winning mark. It is just a matter of needing luck from well back in the field.\n\n2 Concerto\n\ncan roll forward and give his all from there. He has proven tough to get past at times.\n\n9 Strongest Boy\n\nhas been knocking on the door all season. Do not discount.\n\nRace 3 (1,200m)\n\nExpect\n\n3 Tattenham\n\nto fly forward and lead. He is capable in this grade. He comes from the right stable and has the right jockey (Luke Ferraris) engaged. The one to catch.\n\n1 Nordic Combined\n\n, who secured a run after Top Top Tea was withdrawn, is worth each-way. He scored first-up this term and was runner-up at his penultimate start.\n\n2 Youth Power\n\nfound his feet last start and can improve following that effort. He just needs to offset the wide gate.\n\n6 Cheong Fat\n\ncontinues to race well and make improvement. He will go close.\n\nRace 4 (1,000m)\n\n6 Nicconi County\n\nhas been ready to score for some time. He ran a seriously strong fifth last start, which should prove to be a pretty smart tune-up for this assignment. The one to beat, especially from gate 1 under Vincent Ho.\n\n9 Happy United\n\nis in superb form and appears to still have a few rating points in hand. The booking of Purton sees him carry 2lb overweight but he could still be a force to be reckoned with.\n\n10 Fortune Warrior\n\nslots in light. He has an awkward draw, so finding the front could prove tough.\n\n2 Heroic Master\n\nhas claims.\n\nRace 5 (1,650m)\n\n12 Superb Move\n\nhas a bit of ability and can make good use of the featherweight impost. The wide gate is not ideal, but a midfield spot in the run should allow him to showcase his best under no weight. Worth taking a chance on.\n\n2 Dragon Star\n\nhas remained in solid form all season with two wins to his name. He is racing well and deserves his shot.\n\n4 Satirical Glory\n\nis next in line. He has been close to a first win for quite a while.\n\n7 Win Win Fighter\n\nis consistent. He has a suitable draw.\n\nRace 6 (1,200m)\n\n9 Melbourne Hall\n\nraced wide in his latest effort and deserves forgiveness. He can atone for that run with no weight from a good gate.\n\n2 Beauty Infinity\n\nwas a strong winner last time. He did well that day and should be able to continue improving.\n\n7 Lucky Quality\n\ncan mix his form but does get a super chance to record another victory. He has been close to doing exactly that all season.\n\n1 Scotch Tycoon\n\nshould lead from gate 1. He will take a bit of running down.\n\nRace 7 (1,650m)\n\n10 Tradition\n\ncan improve from his first-up run. He is well bred and the inside gate should see him receive the gun run throughout. Take a chance on him for value.\n\n3 California Voce\n\nhas a bit of quality. It would not surprise to see him get on the board.\n\n2 Tourbillon Prince\n\ncan lead and give this group something to run down, just as he did successfully two starts ago.\n\n4 Quantum Patch\n\nhas an awkward draw but should be able to make his presence felt. He has been well supported of late.\n\nRace 8 (1,200m)\n\n5 Raging Blizzard\n\nis a two-time winner from four starts at Sha Tin and continues to improve. He can take another step forward, especially from a good gate for his Happy Valley debut.\n\n1 Bon's A Pearla\n\nscored her first win last start. She has found her feet and gets another shot under Purton, albeit from gate 10.\n\n8 Watch Buddy\n\ncontinues to advance and is a winner already this season.\n\n9 Golden Samurai\n\nhas mixed his form but is worth keeping safe, as he does have ability.\n\nComments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Two other charges were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nAt the time of the offences in 2021 and 2023, Nur was a Singapore University of Social Sciences student and was working as a part-time tutor, earning about $2,000 to $3,000 a month.\n\nIn early 2021, he was hired to tutor a 13-year-old boy in science every Saturday evening. The lessons took place in the teenager's bedroom with the door closed.\n\nIn June that year, Nur groped him during a lesson. The teenager did not know how to react and remained silent, and lessons with the offender continued until December 2022.\n\nThe second victim was an eight-year-old boy, whom Nur started tutoring in mathematics in October 2022.\n\nThe sessions were held in the child's bedroom with the door left slightly ajar.\n\nThe boy's mother would sit in the living room and look into the bedroom occasionally.\n\nIn earlier proceedings, Deputy Public Prosecutor Claire Poh said the boy addressed the offender as \"Abang Ikhlas\", or \" Brother Ikhlas\" in Malay, and they were on good terms.\n\nAfter a month, the boy's mother noticed that Nur would rub her son's back and poke him in the body, but she did not think much of the behaviour.\n\nBetween January and February 2023, Nur began placing the victim on his lap.\n\nDPP Poh had said that Nur was trying to get the victim to become accustomed to physical contact so that the boy would let his guard down when Nur molested him.\n\nOn Feb 26, 2023, Nur touched the boy inappropriately while the latter was doing his homework.\n\nStunned, the boy did not know what to do and continued with his work. Nur then molested him again that day.\n\nWhen the lesson ended, the boy told his mother about what had happened. She fired Nur that day, but did not lodge a police report.\n\nThe third victim was a 13-year-old boy, and Nur taught him mathematics and science from March 2022.\n\nThe lessons, which took place every Sunday afternoon, were conducted in the boy's bedroom with the door closed.\n\nThe Secondary 2 student, who was shy and introverted, noticed that Nur liked to caress his thigh.\n\nWhen Nur molested him on March 26, 2023, the shocked boy moved away from him.\n\nDPP Poh had earlier said: \"(The victim) was initially reluctant to report the accused's actions to his family. On April 1 that year, he plucked up the courage and told his mother.\"\n\nThe victim's sister lodged a police report two days later. The other offences came to light during police investigations.\n\nFor molesting a person below 14 years of age, an offender can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or receive any combination of such punishments.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Corresponden\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

She is expected to be sentenced on Feb 22.\n\nThe woman and other parties linked to this case cannot be named due to a gag order to protect the daughter's identity.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Niranjan Ranjakunalan said the woman, her son - who was referred to as B2 in court documents - and her daughter, were living together in a two-room flat. The woman and her husband are divorced.\n\nIn 2010, the mother walked into the kitchen in their flat and saw her son, who was then 13, and her daughter, then 5 years old, naked. She asked her son what he was doing, but he did not respond. She later told him that the girl is his younger sister and that he \"should not do such a thing to her\".\n\nSometime that same year, the victim was taking an afternoon nap in the flat while B2 was watching pornographic videos on the computer. Feeling aroused, he approached his sister and sexually abused her.\n\nLater that day, the mother saw stains on her daughter's panties while she was showering her and asked her son if he had sexually abused his sister. When he denied this, the mother again reminded him that the girl is his younger sister and that he \"cannot do such a thing to her\".\n\nThe prosecution said that despite knowing as early as 2010 that B2 was sexually abusing his sister, and that she was at risk of further sexual abuse by her brother, the mother failed to take steps to protect her daughter from that risk.\n\nShe also did not regularly check with B2 and her daughter on whether her son had stopped the sexual abuse, and did not ensure that the siblings do not share a bed, added the DPP.\n\nIn fact, in 2017, the mother told her son, who was 20 years old then, to sleep on the same bed as her daughter, who was 12.\n\nThat same year, B2 committed statutory rape against his sister in the flat. While he was sexually assaulting her, the mother woke up from her sleep, lifted the blanket and saw her son on top of her daughter.\n\nThe mother asked her son what he was doing, but he did not answer. She then reminded B2 that the girl was his younger sister.\n\nLater that year, B2 committed statutory rape against the victim while their mother was sleeping in the same room.\n\nShortly after, the siblings got into an argument, which woke their mother up. When she saw them together, she reminded B2 again that the girl was his younger sister and asked if he was not afraid of the consequences.\n\nThe offences came to light when the girl missed her period in October and November 2017.\n\nThe mother got her daughter to take a DIY pregnancy test and realised she was pregnant.\n\nShe asked B2 if he had done anything to the victim, adding that she hoped he was not the father of the baby. B2 did not reply to this.\n\nThe mother subsequently took the victim to a clinic to confirm that she was pregnant. She was advised to lodge a police report and send her daughter to the hospital for a full examination, but she did not do so as she was afraid her son would get arrested.\n\nInstead, the mother took the girl to a clinic in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, for an abortion. When the doctor declined to perform the abortion as the foetus was over eight weeks old, the mother decided that the daughter would keep the baby.\n\nIn January 2018, when the girl did not turn up for school multiple times, the school contacted the mother, who claimed her daughter was unwell and requested that she be withdrawn from school.\n\nWhen the school said they needed a doctor's letter confirming that the victim was not well enough to attend school, the mother admitted that the girl was pregnant and that her brother was the baby's father.\n\nThe school informed the Ministry of Social and Family Development's Child Protection Service and a police report was lodged.\n\nThe DPP said the girl's pregnancy was terminated in February 2018, and that further investigations, including a paternity test, revealed that the biological father of the foetus was not B2 but someone else referred to as B3.\n\nB3's age was not revealed in court, but the prosecution said the victim met him online in 2017 and her sexualisation as a result of her repeated sexual activity with B2 contributed to her engaging in sexual acts with B3.\n\nB3 was sentenced to eight years' jail and six strokes of the cane for his offences, including having sex with the girl when she was below 14 years old.\n\nFor his offences such as statutory rape, B2, a diagnosed paedophile, was sentenced to 11½ years' jail and seven strokes of the cane.\n\nNadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

In a few days, the teenager will be travelling over 9,400km to the Serbian city of Valjevo, where he will be based on his own for two years with Valjevo Valis' youth water polo squad as he chases his sporting dreams.\n\nThe longest he has been away from home was just over two weeks in 2022 for a training camp in Serbia with his local club Pacer.\n\nIt was during that trip that Yong Jun caught the eye of Valis, who compete in the Serbian Water Polo League A, the country's top league.\n\nA powerhouse in the sport, the Serbia national men's team are two-time Olympic winners and three-time world champions.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 10, 2025, 12:52am\n\nSingapore water polo teams relishing opportunity to play world's best at home world c'ships\n\nMore related stories\n\nYong Jun said: \"The environment there and in Singapore is quite different. In Singapore they prioritise studies, but over there they play sports, they're very passionate and they have a lot of drive.\n\n\"By going over there, I can improve much faster. The training there is much more tedious and they have a different kind of experience - they're all bigger, stronger, more aggressive.\"\n\nWhile the club had expressed interest in recruiting Yong Jun as a professional player, his parents were apprehensive as they were worried that the two-year stint would affect his studies.\n\nBut when they found out that the Singapore Sports School (SSP) allowed for remote learning, Yong Jun transferred from the School of Science and Technology to SSP in 2024.\n\nThe Singapore Olympic Foundation-Tan Family Water Polo Fund, Sport Singapore and Singapore Aquatics also came on board to sponsor him financially.\n\nHis mother Krystal Koh said: \"We're very worried about him being alone there at this age, but he loves the sport so much and he proved to us that he wants to go there.\n\n\"He assured us that he can do it and this is a rare opportunity so we eventually agreed to let him try it out.\"\n\nThe housewife, 48, noted her son's dedication to the sport - there were times when he got home after 11pm owing to his training.\n\nYong Jun's love affair with water polo began in Primary 3, when his father, a former player, introduced him to it. He then made the switch from table tennis.\n\nThe right driver and wing impressed in the National League, winning many Most Valuable Player awards in his various Under-14, U-15 and U-16 matches, before earning the call-up to the national youth development squad about six months ago.\n\nTravelling to Serbia in winter to join the team mid-season will be tough, with Yong Jun noting that it was challenging to play against players in his age group during the 2022 trip.\n\nHe can also expect an increased training load - in the mornings he will work with the senior squad, with gym sessions scheduled on some days, followed by an evening session in the pool with the younger players.\n\nYong Jun is determined to do all it takes to get himself ready. When his team here were on a holiday break, he worked out at the gym to maintain his fitness and he has been learning Serbian on his own in the past month.\n\nNational men's coach Kan Aoyagi, who is also Singapore Aquatics' water polo technical director, noted that it is unusual for a Serbian club to take in players of Yong Jun's age as \"they must be really, really good\".\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nwater polo\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nSINGAPORE ATHLETES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nS'pore Sports School clinch back-to-back titles in B Div water polo\n\nJan 3, 2025, 03:01am\n\nHeather Lee quits job for World Aquatics scholarship with Greek club\n\nNov 29, 2024, 09:25pm\n\nS'pore swimmer eyes 2025 world c'ships and 2028 Olympics\n\nApr 18, 2024, 04:12am\n\nReturning player leads S'pore Sports School to win\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Responding to queries, the pre-school said on Jan 10 that CCTV footage was shown to the parents on Jan 9 and no cause for the bruise was seen.\n\nECDA said the pre-school reported the incident to the agency on Jan 8, leading to investigations that included unannounced visits to the pre-school, reviewing CCTV footage when the child was present in the school, as well as interviews.\n\nBased on the agency's preliminary findings, the bruise on the boy's right ear could have occurred on Jan 4 when the child was seated on a low chair, lost his balance and fell backwards onto the floor, ECDA said. This was caught on CCTV.\n\nWhile the boy's injuries have faded, he has stopped attending school since Jan 8 as he was \"badly traumatised\", his father told ST on Jan 16. The boy's parents have yet to decide on withdrawing their son from the pre-school.\n\nEven now, the child's father remains doubtful that the bruise on the boy's ear had been caused by the child falling on his own.\n\nHe questioned why the pre-school had not flagged the incident involving a teacher, adding that he had learnt about that incident only on Jan 15 when ECDA informed him.\n\nThe agency said: \"While incidents involving children may sometimes occur despite the pre-school's best efforts, ECDA takes a serious view towards all cases of child mismanagement.\n\n\"Actions will be taken against the pre-school operator and staff if our findings support the allegation.\"\n\nAng Qing\n\nPRE-SCHOOLS\n\nEDUCATION AND SCHOOLS\n\nCHILDREN AND YOUTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 1, 2025, 08:49am\n\nCentralised relief teacher pool aims to solve preschool staffing woes\n\nMar 10, 2025, 06:10am\n\nLower pre-school fees among key takeaways from MSF budget\n\nMar 5, 2025, 11:35pm\n\nFormer Kinderland teacher admits to ill-treating kids\n\nFeb 13, 2025, 12:46am\n\nPrivate-hire driver who drove into Sin Ming pre-school fined, disqualified\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

But hours later, he arrived in Japan with only HK$1,500 of the money left.\n\nA Hong Kong man identified by only his surname Chow told Sing Tao Daily that he was travelling with his girlfriend and a family member on a red-eye flight from the Chinese city to Osaka when someone stealthily replaced his money with Indonesian rupiah on the plane.\n\nIt was not clear when the trip took place.\n\nMr Chow said he was carrying 100 HK$500 bills bundled with a rubber band in his backpack and had intended to exchange the money for yen after he arrived in Japan, Sing Tao Daily reported on Jan 14.\n\nAt first he stowed his backpack under his seat on the plane, but a flight attendant asked him to place it in the overhead compartment instead.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 28, 2025, 01:02am\n\nHong Kong TVB opens auditions in Singapore for 'midlife' singing competition\n\n3\n\nMore related stories\n\nMr Chow said he was sitting in the last row, and the overhead compartment above him had no room for his backpack as it was packed with life vests. Therefore, he placed the bag in an overhead compartment a few seats away from his.\n\nDuring the flight, he fell asleep.\n\nWhen he arrived at the destination, he retrieved his backpack, and his stack of cash fell out.\n\nHe believed his money had been stolen by then, but he had not noticed the loss because the thief had sandwiched a thick wad of 2,000 rupiah notes - 153 pieces in all and worth HK$1 each - between three HK$500 bills.\n\nIt was onboard a train in Japan later when the holidaymaker realised his money was gone.\n\nMr Chow said his credit card was also missing, and he quickly cancelled the card.\n\n\"The most cunning thing about the thief was that he covered the Indonesian money with Hong Kong money to create the illusion that my money was not gone,\" said Mr Chow. \"This made me miss the opportunity to expose the theft on the plane.\"\n\nMr Chow also blamed the flight attendant for insisting that he put his bag in the overhead compartment, even though he had flown several times without a hitch with the same backpack kept under his seat.\n\n\"If I had kept it under my seat, I would be stirred from my sleep if someone moved my bag, but I was made to leave it three or four seats away. On top of that, it was a red-eye flight and the lights were out. Even if I was not asleep, I wouldn't have noticed something's amiss,\" he added.\n\nMr Chow filed a police report after he returned from Japan, a claim that was confirmed by Hong Kong police.\n\nIn response to media queries, HKA said passengers will be asked to put their bags in the overhead compartment if the bags are of a bigger size to prevent obstruction at certain points, like the exits, on the plane.\n\nPassengers should also inform the cabin crew immediately if their things are stolen, and police officers can be arranged to board the plane for investigation.\n\nIn 2023, a Chinese national on a Scoot flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore took another passenger's bag from an overhead compartment back to his seat and stole money from the bag. He was sentenced to eight months in jail in January 2024.\n\nMichelle Chin\n\nhong kong\n\nJapan\n\nTHEFT/BURGLARY\n\nTRAVEL AND LEISURE\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 19, 2025, 03:00am\n\nWoman, 72, scammed into thinking she's helping Andy Lau and his daughter\n\n7\n\nJun 1, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n'I have another 8 or 9 years to live': HK star Law Kar Ying battles cancer for 4th time\n\n1\n\nMay 31, 2025, 01:40am\n\nMay babies: Actress Grace Wong's daughter born in same month as her and husband\n\n2\n\nMay 14, 2025, 11:50pm\n\nActor Wong He says he was drugged and sexually assaulted twice in 2024 at his friends' homes\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Her life is plunged into chaos when these killers descend upon her.\n\nWhile the series begins with Jin-man's death, it jumps back and forth between the past and the present, still allowing for plenty of scenes between Lee and Kim as loving uncle and sassy niece.\n\nKim (Kingdom, 2019 to 2020) admits she found Lee, who is known for fantasy dramas such as Tale Of The Nine Tailed (2020) and Goblin (2016), distant when she first met him.\n\n\"He's such a huge star and a senior of mine, so I did feel like it was a bit difficult to get close to him at first. But then, he approached me with so much ease. He would reach out and ask to get meals together. He was friendly on set,\" she recalls.\n\nThe actress adds: \"Every time he has a photo or commercial shoot for a product he endorses, he returns to the set with a lot of gifts of whatever product he was advertising for all of us. It felt like meeting an uncle right after his payday.\"\n\nA Shop For Killers also stars actors Seo Hyun-woo, Jo Han-sun and Geum Hae-na as shady killers and villains, while actor Park Ji-bin plays Ji-an's former classmate, who is a skilled hacker.\n\nThe story's premise of assassins and mercenaries who co-exist in an underground world with its own rules and taboos, as well as its stylish action sequences, are reminiscent of the John Wick cinematic universe.\n\nAsked about the famed action movie franchise, of which he is a huge fan, Lee says: \"It would be a stretch to say what we did was equivalent to what was done in the John Wick series, but everyone on the team poured their heart and soul into this series.\"\n\nJan Lee\n\nCorrespondent\n\nk-drama\n\nSTREAMING - MUSIC/VIDEO/CONTENT\n\nactors\n\ntelevision\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 1, 2025, 11:47pm\n\nPark Bo-gum to meet fans in Singapore on Aug 14\n\nFeb 27, 2025, 06:37am\n\nK-drama star Song Joong-ki spotted playing golf in Singapore\n\nDec 12, 2024, 11:51pm\n\nMixed reactions to Park Sung-hoon's transgender role in Squid Game 2\n\nSep 24, 2024, 07:50am\n\nClaudia Kim announces divorce after five years of marriage\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

OSS' relocation to Sengkang will cater to the higher demand for secondary school places in the North-East area.\n\nOSS, which was formerly an all-boys primary school known as Outram Road School, was founded in 1906 and is one of the oldest schools in Singapore. In Jan 1954, it ceased being a primary school and was converted to a secondary school. In 1958, OSS admitted girls into the school for the first time.\n\nThe school moved from its original premises in Outram Road to York Hill in 1968. In 1994, the school moved again to a site at Windstedt Road while awaiting the redevelopment of its new premises at York Hill, before moving back in June 1998.\n\nOSS will not be admitting new Secondary 1 students in 2025. From 2026, it will begin accepting new Secondary 1 students at its Sengkang campus. OSS will operate two campuses until 2027, when the last batch of Secondary 4 students at the York Hill campus graduates.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 7, 2025, 12:23am\n\n'I am able to grieve now': Woman lost father one month into polytechnic studies\n\nMore related stories\n\nOSS' relocation is part of MOE's plans to meet changing demands for school and MOE Kindergarten (MK) places across Singapore.\n\nMOE also announced the relocation and closures of schools in other areas. Kranji Primary School (KPS) and MK@Kranji will shift from Choa Chu Kang to a new Tengah campus in 2028. As such, KPS and MK@Kranji will stop accepting P1 and K1 students from 2025.\n\nMOE said this will minimise disruption to students and their families at Choa Chu Kang.\n\nMK@Bukit View will open in 2028. The centre will be housed within Bukit View Primary School's new campus in Bukit Batok West.\n\nMK@Blangah Rise has stopped accepting K1 applications due to falling demand for preschool places in the area. It will not have a K1 cohort from 2024.\n\nIn Tampines North, a new primary school with an MK will begin operations in 2029. This is to accommodate the increasing number of families who are moving there as more HDB Build-to-Order projects have been completed. MOE said that details of these schools will be announced at a later date.\n\nElisha Tushara\n\nCorrespondent\n\nEDUCATION AND SCHOOLS\n\nEducation\n\nKINDERGARTENS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 14, 2025, 02:49am\n\nFalse address cases rise over past five years as P1 registration exercise fuels housing demand\n\nJun 9, 2025, 10:23pm\n\nNew NIE study to examine well-being and behaviour of girls in top secondary schools\n\nJun 8, 2025, 11:01pm\n\nTeens are creating their own study culture - one Telegram channel at a time\n\nMay 27, 2025, 02:26am\n\nUniversity fees: A parental obligation or a student's burden?\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/4840a089821307f31e076343230d1d463bf12254f0cdbf04d9c6bfad9911a8b8/rroutram1601.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Outram Secondary School’s relocation to Sengkang will cater to the higher demand for secondary school places in the North-East area.", "caption": "Outram Secondary School’s relocation to Sengkang will cater to the higher demand for secondary school places in the North-East area.

Another 30 charges were considered during sentencing.\n\nMs Asya, 36, was earlier handed 46 charges, mainly for cheating. On Jan 16, all of her charges were withdrawn, and she was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal. This means, she cannot be charged again with the same offences.\n\nThe reasons for this move were not disclosed in court, and The Straits Times has reached out to the Attorney-General's Chambers to find out what they were.\n\nSpeaking on her behalf, the couple's lawyer, Mr Satwant Singh, told ST: \"She is relieved that the matter is over for her and her family, and they can now move on with their lives.\"\n\nIn November 2022, Shankar Suppiah, then 45, who was linked to the case, was sentenced to four months' jail after he pleaded guilty to his role in cheating FAS.\n\nHe was then the sole proprietor of All Resource Network (ARN), which specialised in event management and the sale of sporting and recreational goods. ARN was a supplier of FAS at the time of the offences.\n\nThe case involving another man, Pallaniappan Ravindran, 50, is still pending.\n\nRikram had met Ms Asya while she was working in the communications department at FAS in 2013.\n\nShe then set up ARN after leaving FAS in December that year.\n\nRikram and Ms Asya spoke frequently as ARN regularly organised or supported FAS events. They soon became romantically involved, and later got married.\n\nIn February 2016, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) and the National Council of Problem Gambling (NCPG) agreed for FAS to produce and disseminate clappers, stress balls, scroll banners and football scarves.\n\nThese would carry NCPG imagery and be distributed at S-League's matches and youth outreach programmes.\n\nRikram managed to convince Pallaniappan, a former colleague, not to wind down an unprofitable company called Myriad Sports & Events, so that it could be used as a front to quote for supply jobs that he would then pass to ARN.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran had earlier said that Pallaniappan agreed to the scheme because of his friendship with Rikram.\n\nIn one instance, Pallaniappan submitted a quotation for 130,000 clappers valued at $28,600.\n\nFAS requires procurements valued between $3,000 and $50,000 to have at least three quotations.\n\nTo fulfil the requirement, Rikram instructed his subordinate to find two other quotations, even though he had already decided to buy the items from Myriad.\n\nDPP Thiagesh had earlier told the court: \"(The subordinate) understood this to mean that she was to create fictitious quotations which were higher than Myriad's quotations to justify the approval of supply jobs to Myriad.\"\n\nOn Rikram's recommendation, the FAS management approved Myriad's quotations, disbursing $116,335 to it for clappers, stress balls, scroll banners and football scarves between July 2016 and February 2017.\n\nARN then supplied the items to FAS.\n\nIn June 2017, MSF once again engaged FAS to produce clappers, stress balls, banners and scarves with NCPG imagery to be distributed at S-League matches.\n\nIn October that year, Ms Asya transferred ownership of ARN to Shanker, who was Rikram's friend.

After giving birth to a baby girl, Shai, in July, she decided to return for the 2024 season.\n\n\"I felt like I did the best that I could possibly do. It was just really nice to be on Rod Laver again, hear the audience, how much they interacted with the match. That was fun,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course I have to tell myself, 'Hey, like six months ago you were pregnant', stuff like that.\n\n\"Of course, there's a voice in my head that is, 'Who are you to think you can come back and immediately start winning matches?'\n\n\"I don't know. I kind of always expect myself to stand a chance anyways. So I guess just being nicer to myself is like a key thing that I learnt in my time away.\"\n\nGarcia paid respect to her under the lights on Rod Laver Arena, saying: \"I have a lot of respect for Naomi as a person and as a player.\n\n\"She's been through a lot, but I'm just very glad to see her back and I hope she can enjoy the tennis now and have fun out there. She's a great girl.\n\n\"I mean, six months after giving birth she is playing quite amazing already, so we have to watch out.\"\n\nWith the match finishing at around 11.30pm, tournament director Craig Tiley said late finishes are inevitable, despite the introduction of an extra day in 2024 to help with fixture congestion.\n\nThe final match of the first day of the 15-day Australian Open on Jan 14 started at 11.41pm, after Novak Djokovic had taken four hours to win his first-round match against qualifier Dino Prizmic.\n\n\"We finished at 12.35am and we have taken the edge off having the possibility of late finishes,\" Tiley told Australia's Channel Nine.\n\n\"It's going to happen and it will happen again, it could happen tonight or tomorrow night.\"\n\nPlayers, including Djokovic, backed the extension of the tournament if it resulted in fewer late finishes. But he is not an admirer of a new rule which allows fans to move in and out of the stadium during games rather than until the change of ends previously.\n\nHe told some fans who were being noisy as they moved around to \"shut up\" during his first-round match. He later admitted he did not know about the rule change.\n\nSaid Djokovic: \"We lost quite a bit of time when they were letting people in to come to their seats, even though it was not a changeover. My opponent would wait for them to sit down...

These are the three local banks - OCBC Bank, DBS Bank and UOB - and, since last April, Maybank.\n\nAccording to the CPF Board, a foreign bank can provide fixed deposit services under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS) only if it has been accorded qualifying full bank (QFB) privileges. Maybank began operations in Singapore in 1960, and received QFB status in December 2001.\n\nCPF members must set aside $20,000 in their OAs and $40,000 in their CPF Special Accounts before they can place any excess CPF savings into a fixed deposit.\n\nAmong the local banks, OCBC is currently the only one offering fixed deposits under the CPFIS. The bank started doing so in November 2022.\n\nSince October 2023, OCBC customers have also been given the option to digitally transfer their OA funds to their fixed deposit accounts via the OCBC app.\n\nPlacements of OA funds made digitally earn 3.1 per cent a year, compared with 2.7 per cent if customers do so at an OCBC branch.\n\nThe placement is for a duration of six months and CPF members have to put in a minimum of $30,000.\n\nIn comparison, OA savings earn an interest rate of 2.5 per cent, which is the legislated minimum interest rate payable on those funds.\n\nCPF members under 55 years old get 1 percentage point more, or 3.5 per cent, on the first $20,000 of OA balances.\n\nThose who are 55 and above can get 2 percentage points more, or 4.5 per cent, on the first $20,000 in their OA.\n\nTo invest their OA savings, CPF members will need a CPF Investment Account (CPFIA) with one of the three local banks.\n\nUpon maturity of their T-bills or fixed deposits, the funds will go back to their CPFIA, where they accrue interest daily at a base rate of 0.05 per cent per annum.\n\nAny uninvested cash balance will remain in the CPFIA until members instruct their bank to transfer the amount back into their OA.

Trainer Daniel Meagher watched the race from Australia.\n\nST PHOTO: SYAMIL SAPARI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 15, 2024, 02:06pm\n\nMeagher goes full steam ahead\n\nIn-form yard adds third 2024 win while proactive trainer goes shopping in Australia\n\nShare this article\n\nThe Daniel Meagher yard are keeping up the strong start they have made to the new and final 2024 season - and may even be looking beyond.\n\nFavourite Lim's Saramati's narrow win, in the $20,000 Maiden race (1,200m) on Polytrack on Jan 14, added a third strike to the stable's double from September and Lim's Bighorn at the opening day on Jan 6.\n\nThe Australian was, however, not on hand to head down for the traditional photo this time. He was at the Gold Coast, both for business and personal reasons.\n\nBut he did turn on the livestream on his smartphone to watch Lim's Saramati fight his way to the line.\n\n\"We've had a great start. The horses are running well,\" he said.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"This horse has been so frustrating as he's a real slow learner, and we knew that all along.\n\n\"He was a late three-year-old when he came to our yard. But we've been very patient with him.\n\n\"Well done to Marc (Lerner). It was a great ride from him, it was all about his strength.\n\n\"To be honest, I thought the horse was gone, but he fought his way back.\"\n\nThe Sooboog four-year-old never travelled like a $15 favourite for the best part of the 1,200m journey.\n\nStoked up early by Lerner in a bid to beat his barrier No. 10, Lim's Saramati found himself flushed out deeper and deeper the more the horses on his inside kicked up.\n\nFirst it was second favourite Sage Ruler (A'Isisuhairi Kasim), who would not yield his spot on the fence no matter how hard Lerner tried to come across.\n\nRoughie Sacred Stellar (Rozlan Nazam) joined the fray mid-race, pushing Lim's Saramati further out. When Behind Player (Bruno Queiroz) came in between Sacred Stellar and Lim's Saramati, the swing for the judge became four wide.\n\nAll the while, Lerner never slackened off, even reaching for the whip from the 600m - not the sight favourite backers like to see.\n\nThe French jockey's hard graft was not in vain, though.\n\nBehind Player was the fresh legs on the scene at the 400m, but, stunningly, Lim's Saramati was not done for the day.\n\nAfter such a torrid run, he was entitled to peter out but he regained a second wind and finally struck the front.\n\nHe and Behind Player then turned into pinballs for around 100m before a neck eventually split the duo.\n\n\"He's still very immature. He probably needs more ground,\" said Lerner. \"The field was within his reach. The wide barrier did not bother me as he does not have enough speed and it helped him avoid the kickback.\n\n\"It was the residual fitness of his last race that helped him today.\"\n\nThat day in an Open Maiden race (1,200m) on Dec 9, he had every chance in a perfect trailing position in third, working home nicely, but Gun proved too good.\n\nWith Lim's Saramati knocking on the door, Meagher would have preferred to press on towards a turf race, but thought a maiden race regardless of surface would be the softer option.\n\n\"He's better on turf. He actually never trialled well on Poly, but we saw that maiden on Poly, and we ran him,\" he said.\n\n\"He probably needs further as he was strong through the line.\"\n\nMeagher flew back to Singapore on Jan 15, but not without opening his wallet at the Magic Millions Gold Coast Yearling Sale.\n\n\"I came to see my mum and dad, but also to go to the sales with (brother) Chris,\" he said.\n\n\"We bought a Capitalist colt (Lot 865) for A$280,000 (S$249,000) and a Brazen Beau filly (Lot 58) for A$70,000. They will stay with Chris at his Eagle Farm stables and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nWith Singapore racing closing its doors on Oct 5, Meagher and the other 17 Kranji-based trainers are mulling over their future.\n\nTwo trainers - first Michael Clements in September and Shane Baertschiger in December - left in 2023, while Hideyuki Takaoka had already planned to retire that year.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/cefaa88517ffc484f2977e2a729c035e3950b42cf4e3b716e8ff9c55da72e551/mlmragher16.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Marc Lerner steering Lim's Saramati to the line while staving off Behind Player (Bruno Queiroz, obscured) on their inside in the Maiden race (1,200m) on Jan 14.

He still ran a creditable sixth to Greatham Boy.\n\nHe then mixed his form, mostly in Novice company, even proving a handful when he was caught wide on more than one occasion.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe was particularly extravagant at his third outing in September when he struggled to take the turns in a 1,200m speed dash, hanging out badly before beating one home.\n\nEarmuffs came on, but the results were far from conclusive.\n\nLe Grange did not despair, though. The South African handler was convinced that an engine was still hidden under that bonnet, but just needed a bit more time to tune up - and a safe pair of hands.\n\nHe again went for another $75,000 Novice event on Jan 14, this time on the Polytrack 1,200m.\n\nThat seventh attempt to reproduce Strike Gold's first-up winning turn hit paydirt, aided in no small way by the booking of Brazilian jockey Bruno Queiroz.\n\n\"It was a good ride by Bruno. He won the race from the first 100m when he settled behind the early speed,\" said Le Grange.\n\n\"When you put on good jockeys, it makes a whole lot of difference. Bruno also rode him in trackwork, he's a very talented rider.\"\n\nLe Grange was one of the first trainers to give Queiroz a leg-up when he arrived at Kranji last July.\n\nIn a dozen combinations, they had to wait until their 10th pairing to win a race - Taling Pling on Nov 18, with Strike Gold their second win together.\n\n\"Big thank you to Ricardo for giving me such a good horse to ride,\" said Queiroz.\n\n\"He's a very good horse. I think he can win a Group race one day.\n\n\"He pulls hard in trackwork but it was all perfect today. He's a horse who needs luck in his races.\n\n\"He can go over longer later.\"\n\nLe Grange still stayed conservative with the trips for now.\n\nMore so when the first three-year-old feature race is staged over the winning distance, albeit on a different course - the Group 3 Singapore Three-Year-Old Sprint (1,200m) on April 6.\n\n\"I can't thank the Gold Stable and Eugene Yong enough for supporting (Le Grange's former master) Patrick Shaw and myself for 20-odd years,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm very glad they now have a horse who could go on to the 3YO races, but we'll take it one step at a time.\n\n\"I've always had a high regard for this horse. He will just get better and better with more racing, he's better than two starts ago.\n\n\"His parading manners were better today. He was in the air-conditioned stall to calm him down.\n\n\"He's still very immature, though. Anything, the slightest noise, would set him off, so he wears earmuffs, which I don't usually put on my horses.\n\n\"The older he gets, the more confident he will get. He's definitely got ability.\n\n\"I've trained him mentally to get the job done. It's the proverbial saying that once the penny will drop, he'll become a very nice horse.\"\n\nFrom the way Queiroz rejoiced after the line, there is no doubt the second-year rider seconded Le Grange on that assessment.\n\nBut the clenched fist was also raised to celebrate another fruitful day in the saddle - a second Kranji four-timer that also featured wins on Silver Dragon, Nineoneone and Benbo, after a first on Oct 21.\n\n\"I'm very happy. I'm riding for more trainers, things are going well,\" said the 22-year-old, who returned empty-handed at his first 2024 meeting on Jan 6.\n\nTipped as five-time Singapore champion jockey and fellow Brazilian Manoel Nunes' main challenger in 2024, Queiroz already sits in third place on four wins - one off Nunes and Marc Lerner.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Court documents did not state what role she previously held at the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant ceased operations on Nov 15, 2019, and Chen become unemployed on that date.\n\nThe DPP said Chen was aware that because her unemployment was before Jan 23, 2020, and not due to the economic impact of Covid-19, she was not eligible for both the CSG and CRG.\n\nIn May 2020, Chen made an online application for the CSG and stated that she had lost her job due to Covid-19 on Feb 1, 2020.\n\nThis application was rejected that month as Chen had not submitted any supporting documents from her former employer.\n\nWhen Chen saw this, she contacted the former owner of J Koion, Ms Wang Yan, to ask for a letter in support of her CSG application.\n\nMs Wang said she could not provide Chen with such a letter but suggested that she create one herself.\n\nDPP Koh said that in May 2020, Chen faked a retrenchment letter from J Koion that stated her employment was terminated from Feb 1, 2020, and a signed \"payment voucher\" that stated she had received $1,000 as her salary for January.\n\nIn May and October 2020, Chen made two CSG applications which MSF approved, leading to the ministry disbursing $4,800 to her.\n\nIn January 2021, Chen made a CRG application, which was also approved by MSF, and received $1,800.\n\nHer offences came to light when an MSF officer noticed that Chen's retrenchment letter had various fonts and suspected it had been forged. The ministry subsequently reported the matter to the police.\n\nChen has since made full restitution, said the DPP.\n\nNadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nMINISTRY OF SOCIAL AND FAMILY DEVELOPMENT\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The moist condition of his bedroom also caused his wooden doorframe to show signs of rot and the joint of his ceiling lamp to appear loose.\n\nHe has slipped and fallen after the droplets wet his floor and made it slippery.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:06am\n\nResident complains as neighbour turns shoe rack into Shopee collection point\n\nMore related stories\n\nMr Wang told Shin Min Daily News that the problem started last February and he claimed it was caused by the temperature of the air-conditioning in the unit above his being set too low.\n\nHe approached the relevant authorities and an officer was sent to conduct a check, but the problem could not be resolved.\n\nMr Wang applied a coat of paint on his ceiling but the problem resurfaced within a month and mould began to form on the ceiling.\n\n\"We had to change our sleeping arrangements. I sleep in the living room with my son, and my wife sleeps another room,\" he said.\n\nMr Wang added that he had approached the neighbour upstairs but was told to approach HDB instead as the neighbour insisted that the problem was in Mr Wang's ceiling.\n\nIn the unit two floors above Mr Wang's, 45-year-old Lee said she had been experiencing condensation on her master bedroom floor.\n\nNot only would she wipe her floor after coming home from work, but she would also crank up her air-conditioning to match the temperature in the bedroom beneath hers in order to prevent the condensation.\n\nMs Lee said she approached the neighbour in the fourth-floor unit but was told that the problem was in her flooring.\n\nThe fourth-floor residents told Shin Min Daily News they had not been approached by their neighbours about any ceiling or flooring problems.\n\nThey claimed their bedroom temperature was always set to be above 20 deg C.\n\nhdb flat\n\nneighbourly disputes\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:58am\n\n'Is it a mistake?': Mysterious Sengkang door sparks debate\n\nJun 10, 2025, 07:36am\n\nWoman snubs neighbour's romantic advances, so he splashes urine on her door\n\nMay 30, 2025, 03:57am\n\nFire breaks out in Whampoa flat, man arrested for arson\n\nMay 20, 2025, 01:33am\n\n'You betrayed me!': Woman throws man out with bolster, pillow\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/e8a9fc4a1ac78028f44a01d09a43fcadf15445b71e4df46397d04fed02b468f0/hdbaircon_0.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "The dripping condensation from the ceiling made the floor slippery, causing Mr Wang to fall and suffer a cut.", "caption": "The dripping condensation from the ceiling made the floor slippery, causing Mr Wang to fall and suffer a cut.

The fire originated among the contents of a bedroom in a fifth-floor unit.\n\nSCDF told The Straits Times that its personnel had to forcibly enter the unit to tackle the fire, which they extinguished using a water jet.\n\nAbout 100 residents self-evacuated from the block before the SCDF arrived. In addition to the individual taken to hospital, SCDF paramedics assessed four others for minor injuries. They declined further medical attention and chose not to be taken to hospital.\n\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation by the authorities.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:25am\n\nMedics treat 7 after Chai Chee block lift lobby blaze\n\nMore related stories\n\nA 75-year-old retiree who lives below the affected unit told Shin Min Daily News he was awakened by noises.\n\nHe was initially confused but realised the situation was serious when he heard children crying and SCDF personnel communicating with some residents in Malay.\n\nDescribing the scene as chaotic, another resident, 36, recounted how SCDF personnel knocked on doors to urge people to evacuate quickly. She said they helped young children and a visually impaired elderly person make their way out of the building.\n\nThe evacuated residents gathered downstairs, where they remained for some time before being allowed to return to their homes.\n\nVihanya Rakshika\n\nCorrespondent\n\nFIRES\n\nFIRE SAFETY RULES\n\nSCDF\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:06am\n\n'I didn't know it was so bad': Neighbours rally to help after fire broke out in Holland Close\n\nJun 22, 2025, 02:01am\n\nFire breaks out in empty bunk at Pulau Tekong's Basic Military Training Centre, no injuries\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:22am\n\n4 people, including 2 firefighters, taken to hospital after fire in Holland Close flat\n\nJun 7, 2025, 03:35am\n\n20 people evacuated after fire at Home Team Career Centre\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Gucci, Chloe and Alexander McQueen got new creative directors in 2023.\n\nThere are few major changes in this week's line-up, though French fashion house Balmain is returning to menswear shows for the first time in several years.\n\nSome labels have chosen to stay out of the official calendar, notably Saint Laurent, Jacquemus and Celine. Jacquemus is holding its show in Provence on Jan 29.\n\nBut 42 brands will be holding runway shows during the menswear week, and another 32 organising presentations of their new collections.\n\nThe pace is relentless. After menswear comes haute couture week for the most luxurious and bespoke outfits.\n\nHaving already been through Milan, the fashion caravan then decamps for Miami, Copenhagen, New York and London, and then back to Milan and Paris for womenswear shows in February.\n\nThe French capital \"remains the stronghold of fashion\", said Vanity Fair fashion expert Pierre Groppo, with big names such as Chanel, Dior and Hermes still dominating global trends, as well as the presence of (slightly) more affordable but high-quality labels like AMI and Officine Generale.\n\nThe big brands have managed to go beyond just makers of clothing, he added. Their shows are \"transmitters of cultural messages... they are entertainment broadcasters\" at the crossroads of fashion, music and celebrity. - AFP\n\nFrance\n\nFASHION SHOWS\n\nFASHION DESIGNERS\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 21, 2024, 08:23am\n\nTeam Singapore's monumental effort for Olympic glory\n\nJul 15, 2024, 01:47pm\n\nBTS singer Jin takes part in Paris Olympics torch relay\n\nJun 19, 2024, 04:13pm\n\nTeammates hopeful Mbappe can make Friday's match against Dutch\n\nJun 17, 2024, 01:37pm\n\nMichelle Yeoh and Jean Todt celebrate 20 years as a couple\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9cf52b704e4049ed296b1209dd02bf1be2c3f27ea06f6215228043d375fe9557/2023-11-30T150536Z941500055RC2ON4AC2C68RTRMADP3FASHION-LOUISVUITTON-HONGKONG.JPG?w=965", "alt_text": "Musician Pharrell Williams appearing at the end of Louis Vuitton's first Men's Pre-Fall 2024 Show in Hong Kong on Nov 30.

The pair later boarded the same taxi, and they sat in the rear.\n\nThe vehicle was travelling towards the man's home when he pulled her towards him so that she could rest her head on his shoulder. He then molested the victim by performing acts such as groping her body.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutors Muhamad Imaduddien and Emily Koh stated in court documents that the victim was drifting in and out of consciousness at the time.\n\nUpon arrival at their destination, the man helped the woman out of the taxi and took her to his apartment. He then helped her lie down on a bed and rested beside her after she fell asleep.\n\nThe DPPs said he molested her again between 3am and 5am that day, adding: \"The victim felt weak when she woke up and tried to turn away from the accused, but the accused managed to pull down (her top).\"\n\nThe man undressed the victim and tried but failed to rape her as she managed to keep her legs crossed.\n\nHer boyfriend turned up at the unit soon after and took the woman back to her own home.\n\nThe woman confided in her close friends after the incident.\n\nShe also sought help from advocacy organisation Association of Women for Action and Research as she was having nightmares and panic attacks following her ordeal.\n\nThe victim attended a counselling session on May 14, 2019, and lodged a police report 13 days later. She continued attending counselling sessions till July 2019, but stopped due to her work schedule.\n\nOn Jan 15, the prosecution asked the court to sentence the offender to five years' jail and six strokes of the cane.\n\nThey said: \"The victim was forced to suffer both the trauma of discovering that someone, whom she trusted and regarded as a friend, had attempted to violate her while she was intoxicated and vulnerable.\n\n\"He flagrantly abused the victim's friendship trust by sexually violating her at every step of the way. The emotional pain and trauma suffered by the victim as a consequence of the accused's betrayal of her trust cannot be understated.\"\n\nThe offender's lawyer Raphael Louis of Ray Louis Corporation pleaded for his client to be given three years and six months' jail with no caning.\n\nMr Louis told the court that his client had shown genuine remorse and had not exploited the friendship.\n\nThe offender is expected to be sentenced on Jan 18.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

These pop-ups are in addition to the current network of more than 1,200 DBS and POSB ATMs available for withdrawing cash.\n\nFrom now till Jan 25, customers can also place orders for DBS QR Ang Bao - or its e-hongbao - via a chatbot on the DBS website and have the cards delivered to them before Chinese New Year.\n\nSherlyn Sim\n\nchinese new year\n\nMAS/MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE\n\nFESTIVALS/CELEBRATIONS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nFeb 20, 2025, 02:52am\n\nStranger allegedly assaults couple near Esplanade after accusing them of filming her\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 03:45am\n\nTemple plans to hire 'burly' security guards following attack on volunteer\n\nFeb 19, 2025, 12:59am\n\nDevotee allegedly starts fight with temple volunteer after misunderstanding\n\nFeb 12, 2025, 09:40am\n\nFive vehicles destroyed after fireworks stall in Selangor catches fire\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It was not stated in court why this was so.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Ng Jun Chong said that on Feb 3, 2021, Jethro and his schoolmates were at the Safra Adventure Sports Centre in Yishun to take part in outdoor activities organised by the school to promote team building.\n\nHakim, who was an unpaid volunteer for outdoor adventure training company Camelot, conducted a safety briefing for Jethro and his schoolmates. The briefing included instructions on how to wear the helmet and harness, and how the participants should react if they fall off the high-element course.\n\nHakim also held the role of dispatcher that day, for the first time. As the dispatcher, he was required to conduct final checks on the students to ensure their helmets and harnesses were properly buckled and adjusted before they take part in the high-element course.\n\nEven though he was supposed to check the harness physically to ensure the loops were securely threaded through and the buckles were tightened, he did not do so for Jethro and three other students that went before Jethro.\n\nInstead, he only visually observed the harness, thinking that it appeared secure.\n\nThe prosecutor said that before Jethro went onto the obstacle course, he looked nervous and told Hakim that he was afraid of heights.\n\nHakim then encouraged him and told him that if his classmates could do it, he could too.\n\nJethro went on the obstacle course and finished the first one without issue.\n\nAt 1.30pm, he slipped from the second obstacle course, which required participants to hold onto a rope while walking sideways on a metal cable.\n\nJethro was suspended by his harness and he struggled.\n\nAn instructor told him to hold onto his safety line and the rope of the obstacle, put one foot onto the foot cable and pull himself up. The boy tried that but could not pull himself up.\n\nAnother instructor at the scene saw that the leg loops on Jethro's harness were loose and had gone up from his thighs to his waist.\n\nThe two instructors then got to him and tried to hoist him up but failed.\n\nBoth of Jethro's leg loops then became unbuckled, and he hung from the shoulder straps of his harness by his armpits.\n\nWhen a teacher at the ground level told him to stop struggling, he replied that he was suffocating, said the DPP.\n\nHakim, who went through the obstacle course to get to Jethro, told the boy to hold onto his forearm. At this point, Hakim saw that the boy's face was pale and that his fingers had turned blue.\n\nHe could see that the boy was panicking and heard him gasping for air.\n\nEight minutes after falling, Jethro lost consciousness.\n\nA rescue bag was deployed to belay him to the ground and he was lowered down more than half an hour after his fall.\n\nAt that point, he had stopped breathing and had no pulse.\n\nHe was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and died the next day from multi-organ failure following compression of the neck and traumatic asphyxia.\n\nSeeking six to eight months' jail, DPP Ng said that as the dispatcher, Hakim was the last person to check that the deceased's harness - \"the only thing that stands between a participant and grievous injury or even death\" - was properly attached before sending him onto the obstacle course.\n\n\"It was his solemn responsibility to ensure that the deceased's leg loops were properly buckled... but he failed to do so.\"\n\nIn mitigation, defence lawyer Azri Imran Tan of I.R.B. Law said his client had exercised a poor split-second judgment call in the midst of a dynamic exercise, as opposed to an offender who took a deliberate and cavalier approach to risk.\n\nMr Tan sought not more than four to six months' jail for Hakim, adding: \"While Hakim was aware that not doing a physical check would possibly entail risk of endangering the deceased's life, he was not alive to the exact or obvious danger.\"\n\nThe defence lawyer added: \"It was something he never imagined could have happened, and certainly something he never wished for or wanted. He is deeply remorseful knowing that his actions have led to the loss of a young life.\n\n\"Not a day goes by without him thinking about the incident, what he or his other instructors could have done differently, and whether the life of the deceased could have been spared.\"\n\nNadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Another 28,000 are due this year, and 24,000 next year for a total of nearly 100,000 private and public homes between 2023 and 2025.\n\nMr Lee urged buyers to be prudent in their purchases and avoid over-extending themselves as \"housing prices are unlikely to sustain the momentum they have seen in the past three years.\"\n\nIn providing the property market outlook for 2024, Mr Lee noted that HDB resale and private housing prices had risen, while application rates for Build-To-Order (BTO) flats was high.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic had disrupted housing supply over the last four years. At the same time, demand for housing remained strong.\n\nSome people were worried about the delayed completion of Build-To-Order (BTO) flats and decided to turn to the resale market. Demographic changes in society and smaller household sizes also contributed to the demand, he said.\n\nThe government introduced a range of measures, including increasing the additional buyer's stamp duty in 2023, and ramped up new supply of BTO and private housing, which helped to address the supply-demand imbalance, said Mr Lee.\n\nThe 43,000 homes completed in 2023, which included 21,400 HDB flats, is the largest number of homes completed across the HDB and private market in a year since 2018, he added.\n\nHe noted that demand has began to stablise across both the HDB and private sectors.\n\nFor instance, in 2023, private housing transactions and HDB resale transactions fell by about 13 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, compared with the previous year.\n\nThe BTO application rate among first timer families for all flat types has stabilised, with 1.9 first-time applicants for each flat in 2023, down from 3.7 in 2019, Mr Lee said.\n\nJoyce Lim\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nSINGAPORE PROPERTY\n\nPROPERTY PRICES\n\nBCA/BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION AUTHORITY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 11, 2025, 05:31am\n\nDislodged tiles, sharp edges in Sengkang exec condo pools\n\nMay 23, 2025, 08:03am\n\n1 in 4 rental listings on PropertyGuru welcome to all regardless of race and gender\n\nMay 9, 2025, 12:04am\n\nProperty buyer loses $590k suit against real estate agent, ERA in rare case of size disparity\n\nMay 2, 2025, 05:12am\n\nThey tried to disrupt property agents - and built a top blog instead\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The crate also comes with a removable plywood board at each end to facilitate mealtimes and checks when needed.\n\nTo ensure that he moves into the crate voluntarily and gets used to it, panda keepers from Mandai Wildlife Group have been conditioning Le Le to enter the metal container with food rewards\n\nAt the airport, his crate will be loaded and strapped onto a pallet, which will then be loaded onto the main deck of the plane through the nose door. Talk about priority boarding.\n\nThe pallet will then be secured to the floor of the main deck to minimise movement during the flight.\n\nWhile Le Le may not have an SIA cabin crew attending to him, he will be attended to by Mandai Wildlife Group's assistant curator Trisha Tay and a veterinarian, as well as a keeper from China.\n\nThey will be seated in the upper deck and can easily check on Le Le to ensure that he is comfortable and calm during the flight.\n\nThe ambient cabin temperature will be maintained between 12 deg C and 16 deg C, similar to the temperature of Le Le's habitat at River Wonders.\n\nThe panda cub will have a selection of up to 50kg of his favourites, such as bamboo, bamboo shoots, apples, carrots and pellets.\n\nMr Gajandran Sokayan, assistant manager for dangerous goods and special cargo at SIA, said the team spent the last five months \"poring through every little detail to prepare for this special flight\".\n\n\"This includes little touches such as pre-cooling the aircraft prior to Le Le's arrival, as well as the careful loading and strapping of his crate to the pallet and onto the main deck,\" said Mr Gajandran, who has been with SIA Cargo for 51 years and facilitated the transportation of Jia Jia and Kai Kai from China in 2012.\n\nCaptain Nithaar Zain, the chief pilot, said the flight crew will take a gentler angle when taking off and landing to ensure maximum comfort of Le Le - his first giant panda passenger. He has flown the freighter for 16 years and transported live animals like horses, cows and sheep.\n\nBefore the flight, the pilots will meet with the keepers and veterinarian to review all procedures to ensure a comfortable flight experience, said SIA.\n\nThe red-carpet treatment does not end there, though.\n\nTwo SIA loadmasters will also travel to Chengdu ahead of Le Le's arrival to welcome him and support his on-ground handling. One of them facilitated the operations when Kai Kai and Jia Jia arrived in Singapore in 2012.\n\nThey will work with the ground handlers in Chengdu to ensure that Le Le's pallet is safely unloaded from the freighter, and his crate is transferred to his next mode of transport.\n\nUpon his arrival in Chengdu at about 11.30pm, Le Le will be transported to a quarantine facility in Huaying, Guang'an City, in Sichuan province.\n\nMandai Wildlife Group\n\nWILDLIFE\n\nChina\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 30, 2025, 05:23am\n\nBird Paradise celebrates historic first hatching of endangered kagu chick\n\nApr 20, 2025, 11:56pm\n\nMandai Wildlife Reserve's Giant Panda Forest to close for breeding season\n\nApr 3, 2025, 04:11am\n\nSingapore tiger heads to Taipei for love\n\nMar 17, 2025, 11:45pm\n\nMandai Wildlife Group warns visitors after woman feeds soft drink to Piddy the lemur\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The interviewee looked momentarily puzzled, perhaps weighing the possible follow-up questions, and simply replied: \"We speak English.\"\n\nPerhaps feeling\n\npaiseh\n\nfor his lack of knowledge, Khan said: \"I'm so sorry.\"\n\nKhan, if you are reading this, Singapore has four official languages: English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil.

The agency is also stepping up inspection of all pollution sources within the city.\n\nPM2.5 pollutants are fine, inhalable particles that generally have a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less. They are dominant during haze episodes and have been linked to lung cancer and heart disease.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 10, 2025, 12:30am\n\nSingaporean fugitive arrested in Thailand for alleged drug trafficking\n\n1\n\nMore related stories\n\nPCD director-general Preeyaporn Suwanakate said the concentration of these pollutants is increasing due to poor air circulation in many areas of Bangkok.\n\nIt is largely due to a combination of low atmospheric pressure and fluctuating wind patterns in the region, she said.\n\nBangkok is currently experiencing winds from the south, which are expected to be replaced by winds from the east and north-east, Ms Preeyaporn said, adding that they would transport pollutants from other regions into the city.\n\nThailand experiences the effects of forest fires within the country and those neighbouring it, The Nation Thailand reported. They usually peak in the latter months of the year and the beginning of a new year.\n\nSatellite imagery from Thailand's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency recorded at least 1,000 hot spots between Jan 9 and 11, Thai news website Thaiger reported.\n\nIn the northern Thai province of Chiang Mai, farmers have been advised to only plough their rice fields ahead of the planting season, instead of burning rice straw, which worsens haze pollution.\n\nThai Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin also plans to discuss the issue with his Cambodian counterpart Hun Manet during the latter's visit to Thailand on Feb 7.\n\nAccording to the Bangkok Post, Mr Srettha had previously said that the two countries are to establish a joint task force to combat transboundary haze.\n\nKeval Singh\n\nCorrespondent\n\nthailand\n\nAIR POLLUTION\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:20am\n\n2 Singaporeans among 3 arrested in Thailand in joint anti-vice sweep\n\n2\n\nJun 4, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nS'pore businessman nabbed before flight at Bangkok airport over suspected tax evasion\n\n2\n\nMay 21, 2025, 12:24am\n\nActor Mark Lee urges hairstylist Addy Lee not to be too harsh on host Quan Yifeng\n\nMay 6, 2025, 02:06am\n\nSingaporean man in Thailand nabbed for being part of illegal vape network\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

These included a drum set played by Search's late drummer Yazit.\n\n\"At that time, in Kuala Lumpur, music fans were more into blues and reggae music. So, it took some time for us to penetrate the KL market with rock songs,\" says Amy.\n\nSearch were formed in the late 1970s and Ang is the only member left from the founding line-up, which included former singer-guitarist Zainal Rampa and Yazit.\n\nAng came up with the band's name, which was inspired by the title of a television documentary that he liked to watch.\n\nThe early days were not easy, the Johor-born musician recalls. \"When we moved from Johor to KL, we had to sleep in the same club that we performed at because we didn't have a place to stay.\"\n\nSoon after the release of their debut album Cinta Buatan Malaysia (Love Made In Malaysia) in 1985, the group found themselves at the forefront of the burgeoning 1980s Malay rock scene.\n\nTheir first three albums, including 1987's Mentari Merah Di Ufuk Timur (Red Sun On The Eastern Horizon), were recorded in Lion Studios.\n\nIn 1989, they scored a massive hit, Isabella, from fourth album Fenomena, which led to sold-out stadium shows in Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, as well as the larger Indonesian music market.\n\nSearch consistently released albums and new songs throughout the 1990s and 2000s, even as rock music's prominence waned as other genres such as pop, hip-hop and R&B started to dominate the mainstream.\n\nTheir most recent and 12th studio album, Katharsis, was released in 2017.\n\nSearch's line-up has been fluid over the years.

Ms Ardern, one of just two women to have a baby as national leaders, took her daughter to a United Nations meeting.\n\nThe wedding took place in Hawke's Bay at Craggy Range Winery on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island, about 310km north of capital Wellington, Ms Ardern's spokesperson said by e-mail.\n\nOfficial photos showed a smiling Ms Ardern wearing a white halter-neck dress, while Mr Gayford wore a black suit.

It was set up after a massacre in New Zealand targeting Muslims, for which Ms Ardern's sympathetic response won applause.\n\nIn her final speech in Parliament, Ms Ardern told Mr Gayford, a New Zealand television presenter: \"Let's finally get married.\"\n\nThe couple's daughter Neve is five years old. - REUTERS\n\nNew Zealand\n\nJACINDA ARDERN\n\nWEDDINGS AND ENGAGEMENTS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 22, 2024, 07:58am\n\nNew Zealand man fined for 'stupid' attempt to 'body slam' orca\n\nJan 16, 2024, 08:39am\n\nNZ MP Golriz Ghahraman resigns over shoplifting allegations\n\nJan 5, 2024, 02:50am\n\nNew Zealand fisherman rescued after treading water for 23 hours\n\nJan 2, 2024, 02:58am\n\n'Thank you for everything': NZ couple pay last respects to former amah in S'pore after 40-year search\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

In the past, customers could not enter her stall as seawater would be knee-deep during high tide.\n\nBut her stall has been spared the damaging effects of rising tides since 2018. That was when a group of architecture undergraduates from the National University of Singapore reconstructed it and elevated the timber floors as part of a community-led restoration initiative. Known as Revitalising Ubin As Living Kampung, the project was funded by the National Parks Board (NParks).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 5, 2025, 06:20am\n\nFlash floods in Holland, Bukit Timah amid heavy downpour\n\nMore related stories\n\nMany others, however, did not benefit from the scheme.\n\nAmong them are Madam Ng Ngak Heng, 73, and her 77-year-old husband. They run provision store Yak Hong, which is near the jetty.\n\n\"When it floods, it takes me at least an hour to clear the water that enters my store. Flooding is even worse when it rains,\" said Madam Ng, who has been living in Pulau Ubin for 48 years with her husband.\n\nShe said that while other stalls in the area were able to cement and raise their floors to avoid overflow, the same could not be done for her stall due to its existing doors and pillars, which would have to be removed in order to raise the flooring.\n\nAccording to Madam Ng, NParks had over the past two years improved the drainage system on the island to reduce the severity of flooding. But even though the damaging effects have lessened, flooding still cannot be avoided.\n\nTypically, flooding happens in Singapore in January and February due to seasonal spring tides. When combined with heavy rainfall, seawater can rush inland and submerge low-lying areas.\n\nThe highest tide recorded in the Republic was 3.9m on Feb 9, 1974. Seawater 1m high covered large areas of the island. Nicoll Drive, which runs along the Changi Beach coastline, was reportedly under 1.5m of water.\n\nSeasonal high tides have also flooded several low-lying coastal areas along East Coast Park.\n\nChecks by The Straits Times found that a high tide of 3.2m flooded the canals along East Coast Park in the late morning of Jan 12. Some water overflowed to the nearby grass patches.\n\nSimilarly, flooding took place at Singapore's southern coast in January and February in 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019 and 2023, when the tide recorded was 3.4m, according to the National Environment Agency (NEA).\n\nElisha Tushara\n\nCorrespondent\n\nfloods\n\nWeather\n\nNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 21, 2025, 08:16am\n\nFlash flood in Yishun Ave 7 is estate's third in 9 days\n\nApr 13, 2025, 06:15am\n\nFlash flood at Yishun Ave 7 amid heavy downpour, public should avoid the area\n\nMar 25, 2025, 01:25am\n\nLack of proper drainage causes floods during monsoon surge\n\nMar 20, 2025, 03:25am\n\nSevere floods hit three districts in Johor, 753 people evacuated\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He later coached the National University of Singapore and Raffles Institution, and started the Aegir Water Polo Club in 2016.\n\nOn his coaching philosophy, he said: \"I believe there are three levels of relationships between a coach and his players. During training and competition, we are teacher and disciple; during our in-depth conversation, we are friends; and in our daily lives, we are elder and the next generation.\n\n\"As a teacher, I need to lead by example and be committed.

Of these, around 40 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, will be exempted.\n\nThis works out to be about 17 PBDs. PBDs are dormitories that can accommodate 1,000 or more workers, with the average being 5,000 workers. FCDs are factories that have been partially converted into dormitories.\n\nThe ministry did not elaborate on what it meant by short remaining leases, though it had previously said that dorms with leases expiring in 2033 or earlier would be exempted from the transition.\n\nMOM said in October 2023 that about 1,000 existing PBDs and FCDs must meet the interim standards by 2030. The vast majority would progressively meet these standards between 2027 and 2030, with a \"small handful\" of large dorms to do so earlier as they were assessed to have a higher public health risk.\n\nReplying to a separate question by Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC), MOM said on Jan 10 that it has completed its inspection of all construction temporary quarters (CTQs) here that are regulated under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (Feda).\n\nNo major lapses were uncovered, although common minor issues found included poor housekeeping such as faulty lights, water leakage in toilets, and untidy rooms.\n\n\"CTQ operators have promptly rectified these minor issues and no penalties have been imposed,\" it said.\n\nCTQs house foreign workers within construction sites. Those with seven or more beds came under Feda regulation from April 2023, after the law was expanded to bring migrant worker dorms under a single regulatory and enforcement framework.\n\nChristine Tan\n\nFOREIGN WORKERS\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nWORKER WELFARE\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:21am\n\nAttempted misuse of work pass for foreign students or trainees ongoing for years: Industry insiders\n\nJun 7, 2025, 03:34am\n\nMOM investigating alleged misuse of work passes meant for foreign students and trainees\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:09am\n\n2 charged over getting foreign workers to hold placards in protest at worksite\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:19am\n\n2 to be charged over organising, abetting illegal public assemblies involving foreign workers\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nTransform your home affordably with IKEA Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f6cc654712721a11b43275f8a64c6d74d1b0382e1667f809297321496f9af51/2023101149877540img4183.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "MOM said in October 2023 that about 1,000 dorms must meet improved interim housing standards by 2030.", "caption": "MOM said in October 2023 that about 1,000 dorms must meet improved interim housing standards by 2030.

Let's support our hawkers.\"\n\nMr Ong had dinner at the centre with Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth Eric Chua, who is a Tanjong Pagar GRC MP, and said he had claypot rice, oyster omelette and chendol.\n\nOn Jan 12, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu also dined at the food centre, with fellow ministry office holders Amy Khor and Baey Yam Keng, after reading news of the slow business there.\n\nShe said in a Facebook post: \"If you are in the Bukit Merah area and looking for affordable good eats, why not drop by ABC Brickworks Food Centre to show support to our hawkers?\"\n\nTo date, more than 1,500 people, representing about 93 per cent of eligible residents, have signed up for the mandatory screening.\n\nAll of the active TB disease cases have been treated and rendered not infectious.\n\nAng Qing\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES\n\nONG YE KUNG\n\ngrace fu\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 21, 2025, 12:21am\n\n151 new HIV cases diagnosed in 2024 - first time number falls below 200 since 1998\n\nFeb 14, 2025, 01:01am\n\nCommunicable Diseases Agency to be set up to enhance agility in responding to outbreaks\n\nFeb 8, 2025, 01:12am\n\nMOH confirms Indonesian baby an imported case of vaccine-associated polio\n\nDec 8, 2024, 11:10pm\n\nNo subsidy for shingles vaccine which can cost $720-$950\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

As it was their matrimonial home, he ruled that the entire value of the flat would be counted in the pool of marital assets to be split between them.\n\nJustice Ang said that the couple's agreement is but one factor in the overall assessment, adding that \"it remains critical for the court to consider all the circumstances of the case when determining the proper weight to be given to such an agreement\".\n\nThe judge also rejected the man's argument that the 50 per cent share of the flat he inherited after his mum's death should be excluded from the marital pool, as it was an inheritance.\n\nWhile a section of the Women's Charter that defines matrimonial assets provides an exception for assets that are inherited, this exception does not apply if the inherited asset is considered a matrimonial home, Justice Ang said.\n\nThe couple's flat is considered their matrimonial home, and hence, their matrimonial asset, the judge said.\n\nThe couple lived in the flat through their union, which lasted about 30 years even though they led separate lives for the bulk of that time, and raised their daughter there.\n\nThe property at the heart of the case is a three-room flat in Chai Chee that the man and his mother bought in 1982 for $40,500.\n\nThe flat was bought under joint tenancy, which means all the co-owners have an equal share in the property, regardless of the individual's contribution to the purchase.\n\nIn 1989, the man tied the knot and the newly-weds, together with the man's mother, moved to live in the flat. The couple's names, ages and occupations were not stated in the judgment.\n\nA year after their daughter was born in 1993, the marriage fell apart.\n\nJustice Ang wrote: \"Parties (referring to the couple) took to sleeping in different rooms owing to constant arguments and ceased all physical and emotional intimacy and development.\"\n\nHe added that the pair kept communication to a minimum, such as when it was necessary and regarding matters pertaining to their daughter's care, education and health.\n\nIn 2019, they filed for divorce.\n\nThe couple had agreed that the husband and his mother each owned 50 per cent of the flat, which was fully paid up and worth $305,000 at that time.\n\nAnd they agreed that only the husband's share of the flat, or 50 per cent, would be counted in the matrimonial pool of assets to be divided.\n\nJustice Ang said the man's argument that the flat was bought before the marriage is \"irrelevant\" once the flat became the matrimonial home.\n\n\"Indeed, matrimonial homes are subject to the court's power of division upon dissolution of the marriage, even if they were acquired before the marriage,\" he added.\n\nThe judge said the couple had not thought about what would happen should the man inherit his mother's share of the flat if she died after they had reached an agreement.\n\nThe couple had decided to split only the man's share of the flat, as they arrived at an agreement before his mother died.\n\nJustice Ang said: \"To therefore visit upon the wife the consequence that she is entitled to share in only 50 per cent of the matrimonial flat notwithstanding the fact that the husband has since become entitled to 100 per cent of the property by way of survivorship would, in my view, not be just and equitable.\"\n\nMr Lim Chong Boon, head of family law and litigation at PKWA Law Practice, explained that matrimonial assets encompass all the properties acquired during the course of a marriage.\n\nTypically, properties that are obtained before the marriage are not considered a marital asset, unless they are regularly used by the family, among other criteria.\n\nLikewise, assets that are inherited are not automatically classified as matrimonial assets, but there is an exception to this inheritance rule if an asset is used as a matrimonial home.\n\nThe law makes it very clear that any property that is inherited will be considered a matrimonial asset if it was used as a matrimonial home, Mr Lim said.\n\nMs June Lim, a director at Focus Law Asia, said that the type of ownership of a property does not impact the court's power to divide the property in a divorce.\n\nA person may have bought a flat before marriage in his or her sole name, or with another person like his or her parents, but the status of the flat as a matrimonial home makes 100 per cent of its value subject to division under the Women's Charter.\n\nPKWA's Mr Lim noted that a private agreement, as in this case, on the division of marital assets is highly persuasive, but it is not binding and the courts have the final say.\n\nHe said that to ensure that an agreement, whether it is a pre-nuptial or post-nuptial agreement, made by the couple becomes ironclad and binding, it has to be turned into a consent court order.\n\nLawyers typically submit draft consent orders for the court to approve and issue.\n\nHe said: \"The consent court order becomes binding on both parties, and it becomes extremely difficult to change it.\"\n\nTheresa Tan\n\nSenior Social Affairs Correspondent\n\nDIVORCES, SEPARATIONS, ANNULMENTS\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nhdb\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

At 3-1 it was even. At 4-1 they dropped their arms a bit. We are happy.\"\n\nAncelotti was being kind to Barca who could have suffered an even bigger defeat after a dismal second half in which they did not record a single shot on target.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 17, 2024, 01:39pm\n\nMbappe rules out playing at Paris Games after Real Madrid move\n\nMore related stories\n\nReal's masterclass, however, had started much earlier, with Jude Bellingham, Rodrygo and Vinicius creating all kinds of trouble for a Barcelona defence that was playing with an extremely high line.\n\nIt took Real seven minutes to open the scoring thanks to a magnificent assist by Bellingham.\n\nThe England midfielder was surrounded by three players on the halfway line but somehow managed to produce a stunning pass to find Vinicius who took the ball in his stride and effortlessly raced past the goalkeeper to finish into an empty net.\n\nReal wasted a great opportunity to extend their lead when Federico Valverde recovered the ball quickly and delivered a great pass through to Rodrygo, whose point-blank strike was brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Inaki Pena.\n\nReal's second came from another long pass, this time with Dani Carvajal finding Rodrygo in the right channel. He broke into the box before squaring the ball across the penalty area for a Vinicius tap-in in the 10th minute.\n\nBarcelona almost hit back quickly as Ferran Torres fired a half-volley against the crossbar and goalkeeper Andriy Lunin made a reflex save to deny a bullet strike from Robert Lewandowski on the rebound.\n\nYet Barca were resilient and managed to reduce the deficit with a fine Lewandowski strike from another rebound in the 33rd minute.\n\nThe momentum was seemingly in Barca's favour when Aurelien Tchouameni lifted a cross to Vinicius Jr who was held by defender Araujo as he tried to pounce on the ball. Vinicius took the penalty and netted with a tidy finish to the goalkeeper's right in the 39th minute.\n\nThe goal was a hammer blow for Barcelona and Real dominated the second-half with Rodrygo hitting their fourth from a rebound in the 64th minute.\n\nThe loss will increase the pressure on Barca manager Xavi, who has faced criticism from fans and media who are unhappy with the team's form.\n\nThey sit fourth in the LaLiga standings on 41 points, eight behind leaders Girona and seven adrift of second-placed Real Madrid.\n\n\"We have not shown the level required for a match like this,\" Xavi told a press conference.\n\n\"We played our worst game.

A record of only one win in five previous starts for Burridge told the story.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nEven that day (Nov 25), he was reefing and tearing when boxed in on the fence in a muddling-run Class 3 race (1,400m), but somehow scrambled home from stablemate Lim's Craft on raw ability.\n\nHence, Burridge always approached Ghalib's races with plenty of guesswork in the equation.\n\nBut when the $13 favourite jumped on terms from his handy barrier No. 2 on Jan 14, half the battle was won. Getting a cart off grey flash Illustrious (Vlad Duric) throughout, he was off and gone once he gobbled him up.\n\nThe battle for the minors was won by former Group winner Countofmontecristo (Ibrahim Mamat) for his best run to-date since his surprise return from Australia.\n\nDancing Light (Zyrul Nor Azman) flashed home late, just missing the runner-up spot by a nose. The winning time was 1min 11.17sec for the Polytrack 1,200m.\n\nEven if Ghalib was unproven on the all-weather, Burridge could ill-afford to wait for ideal conditions to get him out of his box.\n\n\"He's such a gross horse. We would have had to wait six to seven weeks for a 1,400m race,\" he said.\n\n\"He doesn't normally trial that well on Poly, but he trialled well the other day (won on Jan 4).\n\n\"I was actually more worried about his barrier manners. He's well-behaved at home, but he's a funny horse at the barriers.\"\n\nManoel Nunes has now held the reins at all of Ghalib's four wins, but the Brazilian ace maintained he was still a work in progress.\n\n\"Ghalib doesn't stay long inside. Stenmark's another problem horse and had to go in first, so we went in second-last,\" said the five-time Singapore champion jockey.\n\n\"Credit to the starter for waiting for the moment the blindfold came off to push the button.\"\n\nBurridge, who had one of the early four-year-old favourites in Street Of Dreams in 2023 before he went amiss, clearly holds Ghalib in high regard despite his flaws.\n\nThe veteran trainer still exercised caution, but was not averse to exploring those heights for Ghalib.\n\n\"He won by 4¼ lengths. He'll get around seven points,\" he said.\n\n\"There aren't many Class 2 races around, so I'll probably run him in Class 1 next time.\n\n\"He could also be my four-year-old horse. I personally don't think he can stay, but we'll see.\"\n\nThe Group 3 Silver Bowl (1,400m) on June 9 would be the more suitable option at this stage should Ghalib head that way.\n\n\"He needs to settle better before we look at stepping him up to 1,400m,\" said Nunes.\n\n\"I know he won the last time he raced over 1,400m, but he nearly clipped heels with Jerlyn's (Seow) horse (I Am Sacred) down the back. He was too keen when they slowed down the tempo.\"\n\nUnlike the first meeting of 2024 when he rode a four-timer, Nunes had a quieter day second-up, with Ghalib his only winner.\n\n\"It's been a long day. The rides were no standouts today,\" he said.\n\n\"Ghalib was with Starboy my two best chances for the day. I'm glad Ghalib won and gave me another winner for Mansoor Gandhi and the Al-Arabiya Stable.\n\n\"Starboy just got beaten (by stablemate Silver Dragon). But he was on a quick back-up from last week (second), and he weakened late.\"\n\nSilver Dragon ($57) was one of trainer Jason Ong's quartet of winners, but his longest-priced winner was Wait U Know at $200.\n\nThe reigning Singapore champion trainer, who was waking up after a blank day on Jan 6, also bookended the meeting with the better fancied Wins One ($16) and Surrey Hills ($20) to claim the trainer's honours hands down.\n\nIn one fell swoop, he has vaulted straight back to the place where he finished in 2023 - the top.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\njan14results.pdf\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He has only to keep his new charge \"ticking over\".\n\nSince under his care, Italian Revolution has impressed in his work and lone trial, so much so that the four-year-old Australian-bred can return to the scoresheet at his first start for Fitzsimmons on Jan 14.\n\nThat will be in the last race, the $50,000 Class 4 Division 1 event over the Polytrack 1,000m.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"He came to me in great condition from Shane, so I just have to keep him ticking over,\" said Fitzsimmons. \"He trialled well and I expect him to run a good race.\"\n\nIn that trial on Jan 4, Italian Revolution jumped from a wide barrier and was caught four-deep without cover in a line of four.\n\nHe straightened up widest and went untaxed to the post. In the end, he was just beaten narrowly by the Steven Burridge-trained Ghalib, who is the likely favourite in Race 10.\n\nOn top of Italian Revolution was Vlad Duric, the jockey who rode the gelding by Caravaggio to the first of his three victories.\n\nThat was on Jan 28, 2023, in a Restricted Maiden event over the 1,200m on turf. The pair will be reunited on Jan 14.\n\nItalian Revolution's two other successes, including one over the Poly 1,000m at his penultimate start on Nov 25, was with Ronnie Stewart aboard.

He loves the racing game,\" said Koh.\n\n\"He always works very well and it shows in his will to win, even when he ran second at his last start.\n\n\"We knew he had ability from Day 1. We just didn't expect him to win first-up.\n\n\"He has such an explosive quality. It's too bad he does not know that the turf club is closing (on Oct 5).\n\n\"We will enjoy the moment for now. Hopefully, we can still have fun with him in the next nine months.\"\n\nWith the Novice field Sacred Buddy is pitted against not looking overly strong, the Blazing Expectations Stable might well raise another toast.\n\nBut two new variables have been thrown into the equation - a first test on Polytrack in the $75,000 race over 1,200m and a new rider doing the steering duties on his back, A'Isisuhairi Kasim.\n\n\"I just want to try him on Polytrack. It's better to know now than later,\" said Koh.\n\n\"I think he should be able to handle the two different surfaces equally well.\n\n\"Iskandar is used to him and would have been the normal booking. But he currently has some permit issues, and is not riding this week.\n\n\"I then booked Harry. He rode him at his last gallop on Wednesday, and they went okay.\n\n\"Harry was happy enough with the workout.\"\n\nKoh mustered 16 winners for a 16th-placed finish in 2023. It is a below-average score for the Singapore Derby-winning trainer (Chase Me in 2012), but, considering his downsized string of only 18 horses, he has done well.\n\nThe fact that Flying Nemo on 68 points is his highest-rated horse also tells the story.\n\nThe Vespa four-year-old, who claimed the last race of the opening meeting to Singapore's last season on Jan 6, is, with Sacred Buddy, about Koh's only two horses who can still set his pulses racing.\n\n\"Flying Nemo has a good engine and is very game. He needs more TLC as he is more delicate,\" said Koh.\n\n\"He was a little closer than usual in the early stages last Saturday, but he's the sort who takes up a spot depending on the pace of the race.\"\n\nThe rest of Koh's squad are either too old or struggling to make their presence felt.\n\nBut their US-educated trainer is, however, still counting on the odd surprise.\n\nOn Jan 14, Koh also races Atlante Legend in the $50,000 Class 4 Division 2 (1,000m), Nineoneone in the $30,000 Class 5 (1,700m) and standby starter Coming Fast in the $30,000 Class 5 Division 2 (1,200m) - all roughies.\n\n\"Sacred Buddy is my best chance. I can only hope for a good run from the others,\" he said.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/919629e7c500a8b15ccab8d71715f5d6570fc62cb62432fcb60cc22e95fd5bf9/mlbuddy13.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "The Desmond Koh-trained Sacred Buddy (Iskandar Rosman) landing a shock $158 win at his debut in an Open Maiden race (1,200m) at Kranji on Nov 4.\n", "caption": "The Desmond Koh-trained Sacred Buddy (Iskandar Rosman) landing a shock $158 win at his debut in an Open Maiden race (1,200m) at Kranji on Nov 4.

He does look well placed to make his presence felt in a big way.\n\n1 Top Scorer\n\nwas sound first-up when finishing second. He can improve from that effort.\n\n2 Joy Of Spring\n\nsoared to an improbable runner-up finish on debut two runs back. He can strike with the prospect of a dry track.\n\n10 Mr Maestro\n\nhas been solid across two runs and he can only get better.\n\nRace 3 (1,200M)\n\n1 Must Go\n\nmakes a favourable step down to Class 4. He found form last start and shapes as the one to beat.\n\n3 Run Run Timing\n\nhas finished third twice in both runs in Hong Kong. His day will come soon enough.\n\n8 Ruby Sailing\n\nhas finished second four times across his short career. He just needs a bit of luck.\n\n2 Sight Hero\n\nis next in line.\n\nRace 4 (1,000M)\n\n6 Deep Pursuit\n\nlooks ready to strike first-up after his eye-catching trial at Conghua. He draws well for this race down the straight 1,000m.\n\n1 James Tak\n\nis chasing back-to-back victories and he gets a handy 10lb taken off his back from Ellis Wong's claim.\n\n9 Lifeline Express\n\ncan improve after finishing third on debut.\n\n2 Metro Warrior\n\nsteps down to Class 4, where he can compete strongly.\n\nRace 5 (1,400M)\n\n2 Fighting Machine\n\nis after consecutive wins and he can easily get that despite the wide draw. His latest score was superb and remains in Class 4.\n\n13 Kasi Farasi\n\nwas blocked for a run at the crucial stages last time. Expect him to bounce back, especially as he is clearly in the right vein of form.\n\n8 Volcanic Spark\n\nis lightly raced but does have plenty of upside, especially with Bowman taking the reins.\n\n7 Master Tornado\n\nis next in line.\n\nRace 6 (1,600M)\n\n7 Lucky Eternity\n\ndeserves a first win. He has finished second twice over the course and trip this term, both times missing by under a length. He looks ready to win with Bowman back on board.\n\n12 Northern Beast\n\nclosed off nicely to finish fifth last time. Expect a similar effort again.\n\n1 Holy Lake\n\nis a two-time winner from his last three starts. He can figure.\n\n3 Beato\n\nis racing well and closing in on a first win. With Zac Purton up, he has claims.\n\nRace 7 (1,200M)\n\n6 Galaxy Patch\n\nreturns in a bid for a hat-trick of victories. He has been touted as one of the next big things in Hong Kong. He can win easily.\n\n7 Lucky Encounter\n\nwill prove a formidable opponent. Lightly raced, he is open to improvement as a smart four-time winner from seven starts.\n\n1 Ping Hai Galaxy\n\ncan fire forward with the top weight. He has the class edge.\n\n5 Bundle Of Charm\n\nhas been solid this term.\n\nRace 8 (1,200M)\n\n9 Denfield\n\nhas shown that he is best suited from a forward position and he did also have excuses last start. He can give this race a shake.\n\n2 Cotton Fingers\n\nshould get the run of the race from gate 1. He is closing in on a first win.\n\n4 I Give\n\nis another who should roll forward. He is a prolific winner who can make his presence felt.\n\n10 Magnificent Nine\n\nwas without luck last start. Next best.\n\nRace 9 (1,600M)\n\n7 Hakka Radiance\n\nwas impeded in the straight last start. He clearly has much more to offer and a clean run can allow him to show that.\n\n13 Star Mac\n\ncaught the eye with a fast-finishing third last time. He can do the same again under no weight.\n\n2 Chancheng Glory\n\nis after a fifth straight win. In the form of his life, he should be able to cross the field for a forward position early on and hold on to the line.\n\n3 Speed Dragon\n\nwas impressive last start. Do not discount.\n\nRace 10 (1,400M)\n\n3 Joyful Hunter\n\nwas incredible last start. A repeat of anything close to that effort should see him win again. A serious talent, he has yet to reach anywhere close to his ceiling in Hong Kong. Hard to beat.\n\n4 Leslie\n\nsurprised last start. He is holding his condition and poses a threat.\n\n6 Beauty Fit\n\ncontinues to race well without winning. He was placed in each of his last five starts.\n\n1 Beauty Crescent\n\nis still relatively lightly raced. He is drawn to get the right run for Purton.\n\nComments courtesy of The Hong Kong Jockey Club\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nMake home your happy place with our new Home design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/455b768609c78ca6f49fe53b63c94bf961225a0a02106e4749aec510417742d9/hkprev13.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Joyful Hunter, a winner of three of his six starts, has yet to reach anywhere close to his ceiling in Hong Kong.

A pole dance performance marked the book's launch on Jan 12.\n\nPHOTOS: FELIX CHEONG / YUNG S G\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 12, 2024, 11:29am\n\nS'porean author launches graphic novel - with a pole dance\n\nShare this article\n\nIn June 1966, Singapore's former Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock went missing for 10 days when he was serving as Malaysia's High Commissioner to Australia.\n\nWhen he eventually turned up, he was incoherent about his whereabouts.\n\nMuch has been speculated about Lim's disappearance in Canberra, including his suspected involvement with a 19-year-old stripper and his alleged debts.\n\nWhile the case continues to be shrouded in mystery, Singaporean author Felix Cheong, 58, and Kuala Lumpur-based freelance artist Arif Rafhan, 46, have come up with a fictionalised account of what might have gone down during that mind-boggling period of time.\n\nTheir latest graphic novel, The Showgirl And The Minister, brings to life the enigmatic tale of Lim, who finds himself in \"a tangled knot of sex and politics\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 10, 2025, 04:13am\n\nDiary of a CEO's Steven Bartlett is coming to Singapore\n\nMore related stories\n\nIts launch was held at Milan Pole Dance Studio on Jan 12, complete with a captivating pole dance performance.\n\nAuthor Felix Cheong at the launch of The Showgirl And The Minister on Jan 12.PHOTO: YUNG S G\n\nTold in poetic form, the book weaves an engaging and imaginative narrative brimming with action, suspense and secrets and schemes. The rich manga-style illustrations further enhance the gripping and tantalising nature of the story.\n\nSpeaking about his inspiration for the book, Cheong told TNP: \"This mysterious vanishing of a man who could have been Singapore's first prime minister - if he hadn't lost the 1959 General Elections to Lee Kuan Yew - was intriguing.\n\n\"Writers, like nature, abhor a vacuum and we fill it up with stories.\n\n\"Other than the fact that Lim had disappeared for 10 days, the whole story is really fiction inspired by fact. For legal reasons, we changed the names of the characters.\"\n\nThe creative process was not without its challenges, said Cheong, who highlighted the difficulty of merging historical events with the personal narrative of a high-profile figure and his connection to a much younger woman in the flesh trade.\n\nHe exclaimed: \"Plus, the story is told in poetic form! I had surely given myself the biggest challenge of my writing career!\"\n\nWhile Cheong chose to craft the book \"more like a movie\", Rafhan was equally integral in painting an authentic picture of its setting.\n\n\"I wanted to combine noir and manga styles,\" said Rafhan, who drew inspiration from Japanese mangaka and Slam Dunk creator Takehiko Inoue.\n\n\"I did some research on the real case and Australia's nightlife back in the 60s to set the tone, look, and feel of the world they live in.\"\n\nThis marks the fourth collaboration between the dynamic duo, who expressed mutual admiration of their \"pretty chill\" working relationship.\n\nCheong praised Rafhan's ability to \"draw so well and so fast,\" adding: \"He gets where I'm coming from and renders my story so fittingly, so telepathically, that I sometimes wonder, 'How did he get inside my head?'\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rafhan said of his co-creator: \"I admire Felix's unlimited creative juice flow. He's like a river of ideas! And he always respects my freedom to create my visuals. I really appreciate that.\n\n\"Both of us inspire and push each other for us to achieve our super Saiyan mode.\"\n\nAs for what they hope readers will take away from their latest work, Cheong expressed a desire for readers to be entertained and to realise that poetry need not be intimidating.\n\nHe shared: \"People who have read the book told me the story had hooked them so much they didn't even notice that it was written in poetic form.\"\n\nRafhan added: \"I hope people will understand the magnitude of willpower and affection, as well as how they can impact your life and the people around you.\"\n\nAsked about their future projects, Cheong revealed that the two are working on a zombie graphic novel.\n\nHe told TNP: \"With each book, I always try to push myself out of my comfort zone and see if I shrivel or thrive. So any genre or topic is fair game, as long as I find something of myself in it.\"\n\nBy\n\nCherlynn Ng\n\nAssistant Digital Editor\n\nRead articles by Cherlynn Ng\n\nbooks\n\nSINGAPORE BOOKS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:11am\n\nNUS book-dumping incident: Students also told to destroy DVDs of classic films\n\nMay 21, 2025, 06:58am\n\nYale-NUS library books disposal sparks outrage among students, alumni\n\nMay 21, 2025, 12:44am\n\nEpigram Books becomes non-profit Epigram Literary Foundation\n\nMay 5, 2025, 12:27am\n\nMemorialising Little India's 200 years of rich history in a book\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

He cannot be named due to a gag order.\n\nHe met the first victim through mutual friends and the pair started a romantic relationship in July 2020.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutors Melissa Heng and Adelle Tai stated in court documents that the offender was 17 at the time while the girl was 12.\n\nHe was then undergoing probation for unrelated offences, but details were not disclosed in the court documents.\n\nTwo months later, he became more controlling towards the girl and asked her to cut off contact with her friends.\n\nThe offender was the one who initiated physical contact with the victim in the first few months of their relationship, performing acts such as kissing and holding hands.\n\nSoon after, the couple had sexual intercourse.\n\n\"The first victim felt pressured to do so as his girlfriend,\" the DPPs told the court. \"While the first victim was afraid of getting pregnant, she continued engaging in penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with the accused as she was in love with him.\"\n\nThe couple had engaged in sexual intercourse on at least 20 occasions. These sexual encounters mostly took place at a staircase landing of a Housing Board block of flats, the DPPs said.\n\nOne such incident took place between Dec 2 and 31, 2020, when the girl was 13 years old.\n\nA few months later, she realised that she could be pregnant when she missed her menstrual period.\n\nShe confided in the offender, but he dismissed her concerns and continued engaging in sexual activities with her.\n\nThe couple broke up in March 2021 and in the following month, the girl told her mother that she could be pregnant.\n\nHer mother took her to KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and medical staff confirmed the girl's pregnancy.\n\nKKH alerted the police and the girl had an abortion on April 27, 2021.\n\nDNA analysis later confirmed that the offender was the biological father of the aborted foetus.\n\nFollowing the break-up, the youth started a romantic relationship with the second victim on May 15, 2022 - when he was 19 years old and the girl was 14.\n\nHe had sexual intercourse with the girl, and she also became pregnant with his child.\n\nThe DPPs said: \"She informed the accused about her pregnancy, but the accused continued engaging in sexual intercourse with her.\"\n\nThe second victim terminated her pregnancy on Nov 14, 2022.\n\nIn an unrelated incident, the offender also committed rioting in July 2022.\n\nHe had met up with a group of youngsters in Punggol, and they rained blows on a 16-year-old boy who later went to KKH.\n\nThe teenager was found with injuries including a laceration on his right eyebrow and a swelling on his lower lip.\n\nThe offender's mitigation and sentencing will take place on Feb 23.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Its chief has denied violating security rules while expressing regret over his death.\n\nLee's death rekindled criticism from the entertainment industry and the public over the often harsh and public nature of any criminal investigations involving celebrities which fuelled media coverage and pressure on them.\n\nYoon singled out a report by public broadcaster KBS using a recording of Lee's phone call with a bar hostess, questioning if it was meant to serve people's right to know and demanding it be deleted.\n\nKBS said in a statement it stood by its reporting that was aired more than a month before Lee's death and the content was used with \"maximum restraint\" to uncover the facts of the case.\n\n\"The recording was used in a very limited way because it was not irrelevant to the allegations (against Lee) but was in fact supporting the credibility of the claim,\" it said.\n\nLee made three highly public appearances before police between October and December, the last time for 19 hours overnight.\n\nHe had denied knowingly taking illegal drugs and said he was tricked by the bar hostess who later blackmailed him, local news media reported before his death. - REUTERS\n\nSouth Korea\n\nARTISTS\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 28, 2025, 01:14am\n\nWoman left in vegetative state by botched procedure returns to S'pore\n\nJan 13, 2025, 09:32am\n\nFans wait 7 hours in the rain for (G)I-dle's Minnie at Chagee opening\n\nDec 31, 2024, 02:48am\n\nWhy is there a concrete wall near the end of Muan Airport runway?\n\nDec 29, 2024, 11:41pm\n\nGrief fills Muan Airport as families wait for victims to be identified\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/b3e322d1b9e13a66c42e44588f5780d69f1e71c9b9bc226aaa20e3d2fe6f22ae/LYNXMPEK0B072-2.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "South Korean director Bong Joon-ho attends a press conference to call for the protection of artists and an investigation into the death of actor Lee Sun-kyun who was found dead in apparent suicide amid a drug probe, in Seoul, South Korea, January 12, 2024.

Shortly after, he met his friends and they confronted Tan Jek He at Kitchener Complex.\n\nWhen the police arrived, Tan Qiu Yan claimed that the victim had touched her buttock and that her boyfriend had retaliated by punching him.\n\nTan Jek He gave a similar story to the police regarding the incident.\n\nDPP Ong said that the couple had conspired to cover up for Tan Jek He, as he had recently been released from prison for a previous offence, and they were worried that he would get into trouble for punching the victim. It was not stated in court documents what his previous offence was.\n\nTan Qiu Yan had come up with the idea that she had been molested by the victim.

The label also said it contained a \"botanical extract\".\n\nBut after reading previous advisories by the HSA, the woman suspected her symptoms could be caused by sibutramine, so she reported it to the authorities.\n\nAnother consumer experienced dry mouth, extreme thirst and insomnia after taking Slimming Seven Days by Figure Up for a few days, HSA said. It was marketed as a natural and traditional weight loss product to help suppress appetite.\n\nHSA said it found \"very high\" levels of sibutramine in Slimming Seven Days by Figure Up and Energy Booster Figure-Up New Look Strong Version.\n\nSibutramine is a prescription-only weight loss medicine banned in Singapore since 2010 due to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.\n\nHeart problems and central nervous system disorders such as psychosis and hallucinations were some other serious health issues that had been reported after consuming the substance.\n\nIn a previous case reported to the HSA, a woman experienced extremely fast heart rate and fell unconscious after taking a product tainted with sibutramine. She was resuscitated, but a defibrillator had to be implanted to regulate her heart rhythm.\n\nHSA said the three weight loss products were falsely labelled with Good Manufacturing Practice logos, which may mislead consumers into believing the products are safe.\n\nThe authority said that consumers should be wary of products that promise to deliver quick weight loss or carry exaggerated claims such as \"100 per cent herbal\".\n\nIt added that adulterated products are often manufactured under poor conditions with no quality control, so different batches of the same product may have different amounts of ingredients and different types of adulterants.\n\n\"These products may appear well-packaged or (are) labelled as certified to meet quality standards, but these are tactics used by unscrupulous manufacturers to falsely portray that the products are safe and of good quality, when in fact they can contain potent ingredients which can seriously harm your health,\" the authority said.\n\n\"If buying online, buy only from reputable pharmacies or retailers' websites or those with an established retail presence in Singapore,\" it added.\n\nHSA said it would take stern enforcement action against anyone who sells and supplies products found to be adulterated with banned substances or potent ingredients.\n\nSellers and suppliers are liable to prosecution and, if convicted, may be fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to two years, or both.\n\nThose who have information on the sale and supply of these illegal products may contact HSA's enforcement branch at 6866-3485 during office hours or email\n\nhsa_is@hsa.gov.sg\n\nYong Li Xuan\n\nHEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY\n\ne-commerce\n\nHealth and well-being\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 13, 2025, 06:09am\n\nHSA raids nightclub in Coleman Street as agency turns up heat in anti-vaping drive\n\nJun 11, 2025, 10:33pm\n\n1 arrested, 8 bicycles and PMDs seized in enforcement operation against errant riders in CBD\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:00pm\n\nNearly 200 travellers fined for not declaring large cash amounts, evading GST and taxes on tobacco\n\nMay 16, 2025, 11:53pm\n\nNearly 18,000 people caught for possession and use of vapes over 15 months: HSA, MOH\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/f3415150c974882f22048720a9e10cb1d25d3e213247c9d74253e2e8ac8ae557/hzslim120124.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "The products sold on Shopee were found to contain high amounts of sibutramine, a banned toxic substance.", "caption": "The products sold on Shopee were found to contain high amounts of sibutramine, a banned toxic substance.

Coincidentally, there was a surge in visitors to car showrooms in Leng Kee Road and Alexandra Road after COE premiums fell by more than 20 per cent.\n\nAs such, the word in the exhibition hall was that some brands may not have many units of cars left in stock to sell at the show. This may mean that some buyers will have to wait longer to collect their new cars, rather than a few days after the next COE tender exercise closes on Jan 17.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 08:49am\n\nCOE prices rise across the board\n\nMore related stories\n\nComing on the back of a tough year of high COE premiums and low private car sales, some companies that were at the 2023 event are absent this time around.

The Musical! audience with a cameo appearance on Jan 9.\n\nIn a video shared on social media, the crowd at the James Earl Jones Theatre in New York City could be heard going wild when the unlikely duo showed up at the end of the performance.\n\nGutenberg! stars actors Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells as aspiring Broadway writers Bud and Doug. The musical follows their attempt to pitch a musical about Johannes Gutenberg, who invented the printing press.\n\nEach show ends with a celebrity who cameos as a Broadway producer and presents Bud and Doug their dream contract.\n\nHathaway, 41, and Wintour, 74 - sporting yellow \"producer\" trucker hats - sent the audiences into a tizzy when they appeared onstage.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:04am\n\nNational Day: Kit Chan, Taufik Batisah to perform at free Gardens by the Bay concert\n\nMore related stories\n\nWintour announced that she was \"a very famous Broadway producer\".\n\n\"And this is my assistant,\" she added, gesturing at Hathaway, referencing the actress' character in The Devil Wears Prada.\n\nIn the hit 2006 film, Hathaway played Andy Sachs, an assistant of Miranda Priestly, a powerful fashion magazine editor, memorably played by Meryl Streep. Priestly was said to be modelled after Wintour.\n\n\"I hold in my hands a Broadway contract,\" Wintour continued, followed by celebratory hugs between Hathaway, Rannells and Gad.\n\nBut when Gad attempted to hug Wintour, she recoiled and said, \"That's all\", channelling a perfect The Devil Wears Prada moment, much to the audience's delight.\n\nAccording to American celebrity news platform Page Six, it was Wintour's idea to have Hathaway up onstage with her. Wintour's daughter, Bee Carrozzini, is a producer of the musical.\n\nMany other American celebrities, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Idina Menzel, Will Ferrell, J.J.

Two similar charges were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor R. Arvindren said Zhang committed the offence on a Scoot flight from Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore on Dec 16, 2023.\n\nThe court heard how during the flight, a fellow passenger, Ms Graham Valmai Hope, sat in seat 11B, next to Zhang's in 11C.\n\nWhile en route to Singapore, Ms Hope saw Zhang walk down the aisle and take a haversack from the overhead compartment above seat 7E.\n\nShe then saw him returning to his seat with the bag, rummage through it, take something out and place it inside his jacket. He then put the bag back into the overhead compartment where he found it.\n\nDPP Arvindren said that when the plane landed in Singapore, Ms Hope noticed it was someone else who retrieved the bag that Zhang had rummaged through earlier.\n\nWhen Ms Hope told the man to check the contents of his bag, he realised he was missing an envelope containing cash of US$1,000 (S$1,330) and $930.\n\nMs Hope informed the victim that it was Zhang who had stolen the envelope, but Zhang was no longer at his seat.\n\nAt this point, another passenger, Mr Richard Khoo, who overheard the conversation between Ms Hope and the victim, saw Zhang trying to rush to exit from the aircraft.\n\nHe then saw Zhang throw an envelope onto one of the seats and tried to stop him from leaving the plane.\n\nThe victim took the envelope and counted the cash inside it, which tallied with the amount of cash that was missing from his bag.\n\nHearing this commotion, two other passengers checked their own bags and realised their cash too, were missing.\n\nAnother passenger then noticed Zhang throwing more cash onto the floor of the plane. The prosecutor said Zhang did this to get rid of the evidence that he had stolen money.\n\nAfter the police was called and Zhang was arrested, he denied committing the offences despite the eyewitnesses' accounts.\n\nThe money belonging to all three victims were recovered.\n\nNadine Chua\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nTHEFT/BURGLARY\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting\n\nRECOMMENDATION", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/acd7051f2b2276194ffaf6e100b7867fcf4d3b3ce6025b354599497b11052965/aiscoot120124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": "PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: BT FILE"}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

Her husband is a Chinese businessman living in Singapore.\n\nMs Deng had seen the black Hermes crocodile leather bag put up for sale via the seller's Instagram account prior to October 2023.\n\nShe then contacted the seller directly, and arranged to buy the bag at a second-hand store in a well-known shopping mall in Ratchaprasong for 1.4 million baht ($53,140) on Oct 1, 2023.\n\nLuxury bag reseller Madison Avenue Couture has the same bag for sale at US$67,500 ($89,800).\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 10, 2025, 12:30am\n\nSingaporean fugitive arrested in Thailand for alleged drug trafficking\n\nMore related stories\n\nA day after her purchase, Ms Deng sent the bag to The Catch Fake Brandname, a Thai luxury goods authentication institute, to ascertain if the bag was genuine. It was found to be a counterfeit.\n\nMs Deng tried to contact the seller to return the bag. The seller refused, claiming that the bag had since lost its value after the purchase.\n\nShe then engaged a representative via a law firm to lodge multiple complaints with Thai police, reported The Thaiger.\n\nHer representative subsequently visited the second-hand store with the police to discuss the matter, with the store offering to buy back the bag at 980,000 baht. In other words, Ms Deng would have to suffer a 30 per cent loss.\n\nBoth parties could not agree on a suitable offer, so Ms Deng approached Thai media on Jan 10 with her account of the incident.\n\nShe also lamented that despite having lived in Thailand for some time, she still found it difficult to locate a government agency that could assist tourists and protect their rights, especially in situations involving counterfeit goods.\n\n\"I would like to ask the country's leaders to help in this matter,\" Ms Deng said via an interpreter.\n\n\"I am worried that tourists who have experienced the same thing as me might be afraid to come to Thailand to travel and shop.\"\n\nIan Cheng\n\nCorrespondent\n\nthailand\n\nLUXURY BRANDS\n\nCOUNTERFEITS/FORGERY\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 20, 2025, 02:20am\n\n2 Singaporeans among 3 arrested in Thailand in joint anti-vice sweep\n\nJun 4, 2025, 11:28pm\n\nS'pore businessman nabbed before flight at Bangkok airport over suspected tax evasion\n\nMay 21, 2025, 12:24am\n\nActor Mark Lee urges hairstylist Addy Lee not to be too harsh on host Quan Yifeng\n\nMay 6, 2025, 02:06am\n\nSingaporean man in Thailand nabbed for being part of illegal vape network\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0e8bff407eac174a250f9672305db04c295bf6247bfe5ae7d56c2be74ea82818/Handbag1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Luxury auction site Sotheby’s closed a lot for the Hermes Kelly Pochette bag in November 2023 for 44,450 Swiss francs (S$69,400).", "caption": "Luxury auction site Sotheby’s closed a lot for the Hermes Kelly Pochette bag in November 2023 for 44,450 Swiss francs (S$69,400).

It was sending the wrong vibes, he was told.\n\nThe Singaporean actor, 42, plays Liu's brother-in-law in the upcoming drama Once Upon A New Year's Eve. It premieres on mewatch on Jan 15 and Channel 8 on Jan 18 at 9pm.\n\n\"It was weird and awkward calling her da sao (Chinese for elder sister-in-law),\" Chan told The Straits Times on Jan 11.\n\n\"I was trying to be serious and yet the crew would be sniggering, joking that they could sense something was going on between us whenever I looked at my 'sister-in-law'.\"\n\nHe had to consciously remind himself \"to be detached\" from Liu, 44, in the few scenes they had together.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 3, 2025, 08:43am\n\nAndrew Seow of Growing Up is now an auxiliary police officer\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn the 20-episode drama, Liu is married to Chan's elder brother, played by Qi Yuwu.\n\nThe story revolves around the wealthy yet miserly Qi, who is estranged from his family.\n\nDuring one Chinese New Year's Eve, he helps a stranger, who turns out to be a time traveller. The chance encounter offers Qi a chance to go back in time to salvage the broken relationship between him, Liu and their two children.\n\nOnce Upon A Time On New Year's Eve also stars Zhang Zetong, He Yingying and Brian Ng.\n\nChan and Liu, who tied the knot in 2017, have worked together in other shows, such as Who Killed The Lead (2014), Crouching Tiger Hidden Ghost (2021) and Soul Detective (2022).\n\nAnd now, working on the same drama has been a plus for the couple. For instance, they get to commute to and from work and have their meals together.\n\nChan said: \"It is good that we are working on the same drama. Otherwise, we do not get to see each other often, perhaps only before we go to bed. I do not like those schedules.\"\n\nThey are also each other's acting coaches, said Chan, who has been in the entertainment industry since joining singing competition Project Superstar in 2006.\n\nLiu recalled how she needed her husband's help when they were starring in the supernatural dramedy Crouching Tiger Hidden Ghost. \"We would rehearse my lines at home and Jeremy gave suggestions on how I could approach certain scenes to make them funnier.\"\n\n\"Comedy is his forte, while I am more of a dramatic performer,\" said the Langkawi-born actress, who started acting in 2005. She has received the Top 10 Most Popular Female Artistes award at the Star Awards 10 times.\n\nChan won the Best Comedy Performance at 2018's Asian Academy Creative Awards for My Agent Is A Hero.\n\nThe actor-host said when he had dramatic roles, he would consult Liu on how to portray the character and channel the emotions convincingly.\n\nChan, who was named one of the Top 10 Most Popular Male Artistes at the 2023 Star Awards, hopes to star with Liu in a light-hearted drama where they get to play a married couple.\n\n\"I'm confident of our on-screen chemistry,\" he said.\n\nJoanne Soh\n\nTV series\n\nactors\n\nCelebrities\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 3, 2025, 08:15am\n\nSuper Rich In Korea's David Yong given additional charge linked to over 1,000 promissory notes\n\nMay 16, 2025, 01:14am\n\nSingapore actress Eleanor Lee accused online of insulting China, allegedly dropped from Chinese show\n\nMay 11, 2025, 05:04am\n\nActress Eleanor Lee denies making derogatory comments about Chinese people\n\nMar 23, 2025, 09:46am\n\nNetizen calls Chinese actress Zhao Lusi 'trash', says her make-up 'ugly like a dog'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of connectivity with 5Gbps Broadband\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/d4adbee1666756642465705fc507db0df2860b87cd03f485f58ba4c8bb7a780c/2024011158247860bum9134-01.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Celebrity couple Jeremy Chan and Jesseca Liu star in the drama Once Upon A New Year's Eve.", "caption": "Celebrity couple Jeremy Chan and Jesseca Liu star in the drama Once Upon A New Year's Eve.

He was released from prison in May 2021.\n\nThe Yellow Ribbon Project, which promotes the acceptance of ex-offenders, referred Chia to work for another interior design company.\n\nBut between November 2021 and March 2022, he made off with cash totalling $77,200 from two customers.\n\nOn Jan 12, Chia, 43, pleaded guilty to one count of criminal breach of trust and was sentenced to 15 months' jail. He has since made full restitution.\n\nChia's job was to discuss interior design projects with customers and collect payments from them.\n\nBut he felt he was not earning enough to cover his expenses, as he and his wife were expecting a child. Details about his salary were not disclosed in court documents.\n\nBetween Nov 9, 2021, and March 10, 2022, he dishonestly misappropriated cash totalling $77,200 from two customers and spent it on personal expenses.\n\nChia's offences came to light when a project team linked to one of the affected customers told the company's director no payment had been received for the works.\n\nThe customer said he had transferred money to Chia's personal bank account.\n\nThe director confronted Chia, who admitted what he had done, and the police were alerted in April 2022.\n\nOn Jan 12, Deputy Public Prosecutor Ethan Lee urged the court to sentence him to between 16 and 18 months' jail.\n\nHe added: \"It should be noted that the accused reoffended for the same offence barely half a year after being released from his prison sentence for his previous offence.\n\n\"A sufficient uplift must be ordered given that the accused failed to learn from a 10-month term that was previously imposed for identical offences.\"\n\nChia's bail was set at $20,000, and he is expected to surrender himself at the State Courts on April 8 to begin serving his sentence.\n\nShaffiq Alkhatib\n\nCourt Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nCRIMINAL BREACH OF TRUST\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSearch Ads\n\nWork From Home Jobs in Singapore May Pay More Than You Think\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9f025cf859d58947a6c69a3fea86402b17fccf90fcd31021e7400df23a3872ae/gavelscales.png?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

They are set to release their new song, Stuck In The Middle, on Feb 1.\n\nMEC is a global leader in the energy drinks industry and owns at least 33 registered trademarks in Singapore, with many of them including the word \"monster\".

He cannot be named owing to a gag order to protect the victim's identity. Another 15 charges, including 10 for aggravated statutory rape or sexual assault by penetration, were taken into consideration during sentencing.\n\nJustice S. Mohan said: \"Instead of caring for, looking after, and protecting his niece and keeping her safe, the accused turned her into his sex toy to satisfy his disgusting and depraved lustful tendencies.\"\n\nThe judge added: \"The horrendous actions of the accused have destroyed the victim's innocence and childhood.\"\n\nThe girl is currently in a welfare home and undergoes counselling to help her deal with the psychological trauma from the crimes.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Etsuko Lim had told the court that the girl and her older brother were left in the care of their paternal grandparents on weekdays after their parents divorced, as their mother was busy with work. This arrangement went on from 2014 until late 2018, when the victim's mother remarried.\n\nDuring this period, the victim became close to the accused and his wife, who often had dinner at her grandparents' home. They were also the girl's godparents.\n\nThe accused first sexually abused the girl in 2016, when she was five or six years old, by kissing her in private at her grandparents' home.\n\nFrom 2017, the girl regularly stayed overnight at her uncle's home. She would beg her mother and stepfather for permission to spend the weekends overnight at the accused's home.\n\nThe girl's mother and stepfather felt uncomfortable on learning that the girl shared a bedroom with her uncle, but they continued to allow the overnight stays.\n\nIn June 2017, the man began having unprotected sex with the girl almost every time she stayed overnight, and often took photos of the various acts.\n\nThe first time he raped her, the man showed the victim a pornographic video and told her that she would enjoy such acts. He told her not to tell anyone about what had happened, as it was their secret.\n\nOnce, when she told him to stop the acts, he bought lollipops for his children and her brother, but not for her. On another occasion, he promised to give her $10 to $20 to perform oral sex on him.\n\nThe victim did not tell anyone about the abuse for several reasons, DPP Lim said. The girl feared that her uncle would be jailed, that she would be removed from her family and placed in a home, that her relationship with the man's wife would suffer, and that nobody would believe her.\n\nIn 2021, the girl became worried about getting pregnant as she had started having her periods. She confided in two friends in October 2021, and at her friends' urging, she told the school counsellor about the sexual abuse. The counsellor informed the school management, who alerted the authorities.\n\nThe man was arrested on Oct 26, 2021, and has been in remand since.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nCRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN/MINORS\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - How SMEs Can Optimize Cash Flow & Financial Stability\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/52202035aa88ef458cc48fbf9913634938fcaf3e13176a0bce0d413ea6d4fd79/gavelscales.png?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

When I went back to Rio for work, I was thinking wow, Rio is beautiful. I should have been in the moment more.\n\n\"Maybe it was one of the reasons that made me feel like I had some things that I need to settle, some unfinished business.\"\n\nAt the 2013 SEA Games, Aisyah became the face of Singapore rowing when she won the women's 2,000m lightweight single sculls - it was the Republic's first Games gold since 1997.\n\nHer road to Rio also inspired many Singaporeans, as she used up most of her savings and had to crowdfund to raise money for her training and living expenses in Sydney for her Olympic dream.\n\nNow, almost eight years after her Rio debut, Aisyah finds herself back at the start.\n\nIt was in early 2023 that she first thought about a comeback. She had competed in several marathons and felt \"really fit\" after going back to the gym.\n\nBut it was not until a meeting in October 2023 in Paris with fellow Olympians that she gained confidence to take the plunge.\n\nShe met Polish 400m hurdler Marek Plawgo, an Olympic kayaker from South Africa, a Serbian basketball player and a winter Olympian from Australia.\n\nShe said: \"I was telling them that I was in my mid-30s and that maybe it's time for me to move on...\n\n\"But they're all in their 40s and 50s and they told me: 'No, you're still young and you should try it at least one more time. If you don't, you will regret it forever'. That was when I started to feel like if I don't give this a try, I will regret it.

Han had won all four of their encounters in 2023, two of which had also gone to three games.\n\nYeo, 24, said she felt relieved to have finally beaten Han, who is of the same age, saying: \"I just held on to every point even when I was losing so I kept trying and I'm happy to finally get the win.\"\n\nShe raced to a 4-0 lead in the first game, but Han clawed her way back to claim it 21-16.

The South Korean, 21, has won their last six encounters.\n\nIn the mixed doubles, world No. 22 Tan and Hee achieved another milestone as they reached their first Super 1000 quarter-finals with a 21-14, 23-21 win over Thailand's 20th-ranked Supak Jomkoh and Supissara Paewsampran.\n\nIt was neck and neck at the start of the first game, but the Singaporean pair won seven consecutive points to go 20-13 up. Their Thai counterparts saved four game points, but married couple Tan and Hee still claimed the first game 21-14.\n\nIt was much closer in the second game and the Singaporeans found themselves down 16-13, but they rallied to win 23-21 and book their quarter-final berth against 2021 world champions Dechapol Puavaranukroh and Sapsiree Taerattanachai.\n\nTan, 30, said: \"(This win) is huge and means a lot to us.

Owner Song Ming Shi said the labrador could have suffered worse if she had not thrown herself to shield it.\n\nMs Song, 44, told The Straits Times she heard a commotion outside her house at around 9.20pm. Her maid Sri, who had taken the dog on its usual night walk, screamed when she saw the first rottweiler charge at them.\n\n\"There were cars screeching, dogs barking and humans screaming. My heart sank when I heard Hobbit's cries and quickly realised she was being attacked,\" said Ms Song.\n\nShe ran towards the rottweilers in a panic to fend them off Hobbit.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:24am\n\n'We cannot halt time': Vet advice on caring for a senior pet\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"They did not have collars, so I couldn't grip them. Instead, I took the dustbin from the side of the road to ward the rottweilers off, but they would not let go of Hobbit. They were pulling her in all directions, and she was yelping in pain,\" Ms Song said.\n\nMs Song said she then threw her body over the labrador to protect it.\n\n\"I was in total panic mode. It was chaotic and felt like an eternity. I knew I was at the eye level of the rottweilers. I learnt what I did only when my neighbours told me later,\" she said, her voice breaking.\n\nAs soon as she managed to pull Hobbit away from the attackers, a quick-thinking neighbour opened his gate slightly for Ms Song and her pet to seek safety.\n\nHobbit was taken to Gaia Veterinary Centre, where it was stabilised and had a draining tube inserted.\n\n\"I was told by the vet that it will take about seven days to fully assess the damage as some injuries would only surface after a few days,\" said Ms Song, adding that the vet bill was more than $3,000.\n\nMs Song, who suffered cuts on her heel and ankle, sought treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital the next day. She was given a tetanus shot, antibiotics and painkillers.\n\nMs Song has since made reports to the police and the Animal and Veterinary Service (AVS), a cluster of the National Parks Board (NParks). Both authorities confirmed the reports.\n\nUnder the Animals and Birds Act, an errant dog owner can receive a maximum composition fine of $1,000.\n\nThe owner of the rottweilers, Ms Marissa Leow, told ST that the incident was \"an unfortunate accident\".\n\n\"The magnetic lock (at the front gate) was corroded by the rain and was not working. We had not realised this. On the fateful night, I had just returned from the supermarket and was unloading the groceries at the back of the house,\" she said, her eyes brimming with tears.\n\n\"The dogs are usually in the front yard. We did not realise the gate was faulty and the dogs managed to burst through the gate. It was not something we had wanted to happen.\n\n\"We wanted to speak to the owner of the labrador but she was too upset to speak to us. The police advised us to perhaps wait for a while before we broach the subject with her.\"\n\nMs Song said: \"Dogs do not have any moral compass. It is not their fault but that of their owners. I hope the dogs will be taken away and rehabilitated and not put down.\"\n\nJudith Tan\n\nCorrespondent\n\nANIMAL WELFARE\n\nnational parks board\n\npolice\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 6, 2025, 03:52am\n\nWill you give Frodo the Singapore Special a fur-ever home?\n\nJun 30, 2025, 09:34am\n\n'It was never smooth sailing': Dog welfare group ex-president reflects on 13 years at the helm\n\nJun 27, 2025, 07:49am\n\nKitten allegedly rolled in container at Tuas adopted, NParks investigating\n\nJun 26, 2025, 06:52am\n\nNParks probing case of kitten allegedly stuffed in container, rolled around\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nNo worries with this all-inclusive 3Gbps Broadband plan\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/ec2e8fe4eb287b1e8e334839d69145587dac73304e1136e266e86c4b5e247d6e/hzhobbit110124.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Hobbit, the labrador, suffered several bites, the more serious ones on her neck, shoulder and rear end, and one of her ears was torn.", "caption": "Hobbit, the labrador, suffered several bites, the more serious ones on her neck, shoulder and rear end, and one of her ears was torn.

His mount was found to be lame off-fore and had respiratory disease.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nGiven plenty of time and tender loving care by Burridge and his team, the strong bay gelding has been well reconditioned to resume racing on Jan 20.\n\nAfter such a long layoff, he has had three trials as his final preparation. He improved each time to be fit as a fiddle again, as evidenced by his third trial on Jan 11. He won it with aplomb.\n\nBurridge had said, after that first trial on Dec 21, that Street Of Dreams \"just went around for a practice\".\n\nHe ran last of eight, finishing nearly 14 lengths from the winner, Illustrious.\n\nBut Street Of Dreams thrived to finish fifth a week later on Dec 28 at his second trial - which was a test to qualify for his comeback.\n\nHe finished closer this time, only about 6½ lengths behind the winner, Major King.\n\n\"It was an easy trial but I liked the way he travelled this morning,\" said Burridge then.\n\n\"They didn't clock sensational times, he himself did 62½. Given the time they ran, he ran good. But he had to pass the test.\"\n\nThen on Jan 11, Street Of Dreams blossomed further.\n\nThis time, he raced on the pace. He dictated the early speed with the Stephen Crutchley-trained Fame Star, who had newly crowned first woman apprentice jockey Jerlyn Seow astride.\n\nFame Star kicked to a half-length advantage at the bend and opened up a big lead on straightening.\n\nJockey Manoel Nunes just sat pretty, but Street Of Dreams wanted to do more.\n\nHe closed the gap slowly but surely, eventually winning the trial by half a length.\n\nDespite being kept well in hand, he ran the 1,000m on the Polytrack in 1min 00.99sec.\n\nIt was the second fastest of the five trials. The quickest was the Richard Lim-trained Mr Black Back, who also had Nunes on board, in Trial 3.\n\nNunes was pleased with Street Of Dream's constant progress, particularly his trial on Jan 11.\n\n\"He looks really well.

He's got a great turn of foot, he's got ability.\n\n\"I had a great barrier (three), I just tried to put him asleep on the rail. The pace was even and comfortable for everyone, I thought.\n\n\"I just had a look at the last corner to find a way out. I managed to get my way around them and he won brilliantly.\"\n\nReflecting on the bitter-sweet recollections of Simply Brilliant's triumph in 2019, which delivered the Frenchman's first Hong Kong Group score, Badel said: \"A lot of memories, I remember it just like it was yesterday.\n\n\"I broke my wrist after the line, I fell off, so there were a lot of ups and downs. But Hong Kong is always full of surprises and I'm glad that I won this race again for him (Lor).\"\n\nLor said: \"I like this race - I've won it three times. He's (Happy Together) been great and I think he can still improve.\n\n\"Alexis knows this horse and what it takes for him to perform.\"\n\nApprentice jockey Ellis Wong made an auspicious start to his Happy Valley career by slotting a win at the city circuit with only his second ride.\n\nHe triumphed aboard Lyrical Motion for Caspar Fownes in the first section of the Class 4 Great George Handicap (1,200m).\n\n\"It feels very special to have my first winner in Happy Valley,\" said Wong, 23.\n\n\"The horse drew a good barrier (five) and we just kept the position behind the leaders and he came away strong to win very easily.\n\n\"This is very meaningful for me to get this win in Happy Valley (for Caspar Fownes) because he is the 'King of Happy Valley'.\"\n\nAble to claim 10lb (4.54kg), Wong had ridden eight winners from 87 mounts at Sha Tin before being permitted to compete at Happy Valley and his display for Fownes delighted the four-time champion trainer.\n\n\"He (Wong) gave him a beautiful ride. He didn't feel any pressure. It's good and it's a sign that he's got a cool head,\" Fownes said.\n\n\"He's got a few things we can work on but he's getting there, so he'll gain a lot of confidence from this.\"\n\nRicky Yiu notched a treble to boost his tally for the season to 20 with the victories of Prime Minister, Mega Bonus and Simply Maverick.

She was informed by her maid that the medical staff had trouble drawing blood from the elderly man.\n\nMs Tan's sister raised the issue with a nurse but was told that the blood-taking procedure would have been carried out by a doctor.\n\nLater on Dec 2, it was the elderly patient's right hand that was bruised and swollen.\n\nWhen she requested to speak to the doctor who attended to her father, Ms Tan was told to wait for the doctor to complete his rounds.

Ridership in the first year is expected to be about 40,000 passengers daily.\n\nThe ride will take five minutes each way.\n\nMr Loke said the RTS Link will reduce congestion on the Causeway by 35 per cent. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than 350,000 people used the land link daily.\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nMalaysia's former transport minister Wee Ka Siong said in 2020 that fares for the RTS Link would be affordable and set with lower-income persons in mind. He also said ticket prices will be the same on both sides of the Causeway, factoring in currency conversion rates.\n\nCurrently, there are a variety of transport options for those travelling between Singapore and Johor Bahru, in addition to driving or walking across the border.\n\nCross-border public bus routes such as 170 and 950 charge regular public transport distance fares. A ride from Queen Street Terminal in Singapore to Larkin Terminal in Johor Bahru costs $2.30.\n\nThere are also private bus services that ply a range of cross-border routes, with fares starting from $1.80 in Singapore and RM2.60 in Johor.\n\nThe Shuttle Tebrau train service by Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad between Johor Bahru and Woodlands costs $5 for a one-way trip from Singapore. A ticket from Johor Bahru costs RM5.\n\nThis service will stop once the RTS Link starts operating.\n\nMeanwhile, a legal cross-border taxi ride costs between $60 and $120.\n\nOn water, there are ferry services operating between Tanah Merah and Desaru Coast in Johor (costing $108 for a round trip), and between Tanah Merah and Tanjung Pengelih in Johor ($73 for a round trip).\n\nIn 2023, Johor chief minister Onn Hafiz Ghazi proposed an\n\nadditional ferry service between Puteri Harbour in Johor and Tuas in Singapore\n\nto ease congestion on the Second Link. Puteri Harbour is a 30-minute drive to Johor Bahru.\n\nThe rail service will be able to carry up to 10,000 people per hour in each direction between Woodlands North in Singapore and Bukit Chagar in Johor. ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIM\n\nAsked on Jan 11 whether there are plans for more ferry services linking Johor and Singapore, Mr Loke said Malaysia will consider any proposals from the private sector to improve connectivity between Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nHowever, more discussion is needed as any new cross-border links will need approval from the authorities on both sides. This is because a lot of infrastructure and facilities will be needed, he added.\n\nMr Loke said the RTS Link is poised to be a major driver of socio-economic development.\n\nMr Chee noted that the project is \"much more than building bridges\".\n\n\"It is about building stronger ties between the people of Singapore and the people of Malaysia,\" he said.\n\n\"It is also about building a better future for both countries, strengthening our longstanding friendship and creating more win-win opportunities for our businesses and citizens.\"\n\nKok Yufeng\n\nTransport Correspondent\n\nRTS/RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM LINK\n\nRTS LINK\n\nChee Hong Tat\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nAmerican Express Singapore\n\nMy Travel Insurance – Up to S$150 eCapitaVouchers\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/430687f7178e0a13645a5d3e51a3795e031a90532967f120513c608c41f676c4/rrchtloke1101.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "Singapore’s Acting Minister for Transport Chee Hong Tat (right) and Malaysia Transport Minister Loke Siew Fook at a ceremony to mark the completion of a connecting span for the JB-Singapore RTS Link on Jan 11.

He has since recovered fully.\n\nA report by the Institute of Mental Health said Nabil was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence, but that he had suffered psychotic symptoms from his cannabis use.\n\nBefore the incident, he had reported auditory hallucinations and paranoia after taking drugs.\n\nLess than a year before the slashing, on Sept 13, 2021, Nabil had attacked a security guard at Rivervale Mall.\n\nThe security guard had spotted Nabil parking his vehicle at the loading bay that evening, and told him to not park there.\n\nNabil had gestured aggressively, then smacked the guard's hand twice and kicked him.\n\nNabil only left the scene after a passerby intervened and calmed him down.\n\nDuring sentencing on Jan 11, District Judge Wong Peck said it was entirely fortuitous the victim in the slashing incident recovered with no permanent damage.\n\nShe said while Nabil suffered from cannabis use disorder at the time of the offence, his intoxication was self-induced, and was an aggravating factor.\n\nFor voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapon, Nabil could have been jailed for life, or for up to 15 years and fined.\n\nDavid Sun\n\nCrime Correspondent\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nCAUSING HURT/GRIEVOUS HURT\n\nSLASHING\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSyfe Business Treasury - How SMEs Can Optimize Cash Flow & Financial Stability\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/21690c9b729b70da1d8c0625a00e52aeaf2ebfda3ab0feb28be49eaafe6cbcb6/jail_0.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": null, "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/800b12cc24429e90d01777c6264d841d1522571c6e9a2443b6e48e967192852e/vouchers.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Retiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/9e6de3cf11f0f14b5cb1c3b08d973f0f1c8a1b766f456ff8475b36916809c0e3/macsjpg.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Man clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/18c4f3c81d3f2f1f7ba57a5fd547bf9da3a70edb086ee8edac81d00cddf8407c/TNPKV48.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Customer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/c122f2452c69930add8b48a898609403c2fcdafbb007b5bda9fd41b44fc9f597/cyclist.png?w=150", "alt_text": "Cyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire", "caption": null}, {"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/567103c1f28851005d6219b2d89eb7f37ae3ba7e4b0079f9cf3fd2d0b96b722f/starawards.jpg?w=150", "alt_text": "Netizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "caption": null}]}

They are also our companion animals.\n\n\"On top of making them work, and if they stop being useful to us in those ways, we should treat them as dog meat? That sounds immoral.\"\n\nNetizens urged Beijing to do more to protect dogs in the country, given the growing number of pets but detractors wondered whether it was fair to legislate the right to choose to eat dog meat, and pointed out that it seemed inconsistent to protect dogs, but not other kinds of animals.\n\n\"I don't eat dog meat, but I certainly would not prevent others from eating if they so wish,\" said Weibo user Tontrando from north-eastern Heilongjiang province.\n\n\"Why should dogs be treated differently from chickens, ducks, geese, pigs, cows and lambs?

The messages included vulgarities.\n\nTay's lawyer said in court on Jan 10 that his client has been harassed and heckled by the public, causing grief to his family, and that he will be making police reports.\n\nTay, who auditioned for Singapore Idol in 2006, is known for his antics including carrying a World Wrestling Entertainment belt and getting breast implants.\n\nFor each charge of distributing intimate material without a woman's consent, he can be jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.\n\nHe could be fined up to $5,000 if he is found guilty of making threatening, abusive or insulting communication.\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nDance your WiFi troubles away with all-inclusive broadband plans\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/67ef7389b4725a3ebe69a949fdb20a17dbee068fc398dbb72863f2ad6c14e439/aikurt100124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Online personality Kurt Tay, whose real name is Tay Foo Wei, faces 11 charges in total.

This consistent showing does indicate that we are at a new level among rifle shooters in Asia.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 14, 2024, 09:52am\n\nNear misses help shooter Teh Xiu Hong qualify for Olympics\n\nMore related stories\n\nNoting that it was a \"nice boost\" for them, Fernel, 21, said that \"it makes us want to work harder to ensure we are able to achieve more in 2024\".\n\nWhile she was happy with a team silver, Natanya was disappointed to miss out on an Olympic spot. A total of 385 athletes from 26 nations are competing in the Jan 5-18 championship, with 16 quota places on offer for the 2024 Paris Games.\n\nAfter hitting 628.7 in the qualifying round, Natanya finished 10th out of 62 shooters. With five shooters ineligible for the final - owing to International Shooting Sport Federation rules on the number of athletes each nation can field for individual events - she was able to advance to the next stage.\n\nBut the teenager finished last out of eight shooters and did not earn a quota spot.\n\nThe Singaporean trio will have another opportunity to secure qualification at the Rifle and Pistol ISSF Olympic Qualification Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from April 11 to 19.\n\nThe qualifying battle for Singapore continues on Jan 11, when Teh Xiu Hong, Teh Xiu Yi and Teo Shun Xie will compete in the 25m pistol women's event.\n\nVeloso will return to action on Jan 13 in the 50m rifle 3 positions alongside Olympians Jasmine Ser and Adele Tan.\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nshooting - sport\n\nSINGAPORE SPORTS\n\nSPORTS AND RECREATION\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 27, 2023, 02:58pm\n\nShooters turn Asiad disappointment into silver medal at Asian Championships\n\nSep 28, 2023, 02:20pm\n\n'I was having panic attacks, blackouts': Singapore shooter Adele Tan's story of struggle and bravery\n\nDec 10, 2022, 06:02am\n\nShooting: Singapore win 3 golds, 6 silvers and 1 bronze at South-east Asian championships\n\nJul 17, 2022, 11:16am\n\nShooting: Teh Xiu Hong and teammates win Singapore's first World Cup gold medals in pistol events\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nFind the Best Fixed Deposit Rates\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/be67d973cc5916c3c7a1ed7c96ec29f128d5ae8b0f96782073d989fb3f83e9b2/aishoot100124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The trio of (from left) Fernel Tan, Natanya Tan and Martina Veloso clinched a silver at the Asian Rifle/Pistol Championship at the Senayan Shooting Range on Jan 10.", "caption": "The trio of (from left) Fernel Tan, Natanya Tan and Martina Veloso clinched a silver at the Asian Rifle/Pistol Championship at the Senayan Shooting Range on Jan 10.

The pre-school has an enrolment of 16 infants and six staff members.\n\nResponding to queries, the centre's principal, Ms Angelyn Leong, said stomach flu symptoms were first detected on Jan 3. Two children had developed diarrhoea then, and both did not attend school the next day.\n\nOne of the two children returned to the centre two days later, despite still showing symptoms, and their parents said the doctor had given the green light to do so, as the diarrhoea was caused by eating too much, said Ms Leong.\n\nBut more children started falling ill, including four who vomited on Jan 10.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJan 8, 2025, 12:09am\n\nRise in HMPV cases in S'pore typical during year-end period\n\nMore related stories\n\nAll the staff are well, said Ms Leong, adding that none of the affected children were hospitalised and two have since made a full recovery.\n\nThe centre at Tanjong Pagar Community Club looks after children aged two months to 30 months. It is run by the Singapore Amalgamated Services Co-operative Organisation.\n\nSaid Ms Leong: \"The preliminary findings from our investigations suggest that the stomach flu outbreak may have been caused by a viral infection.\n\n\"However, we are continuing our investigations to determine the exact cause and prevent any further cases.\"\n\nShe said the centre has hired a professional cleaning firm to carry out thorough cleaning and disinfection to contain the outbreak.

Colombia and Brazil expressed their support of South Africa late Wednesday.\n\nIsrael launched its offensive after Hamas fighters carried out an Oct 7 cross-border rampage in which Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 abducted.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 11, 2025, 12:03am\n\nPM Wong: Ex-NMP Calvin Cheng's comments on activists 'completely insensitive and unacceptable'\n\nMore related stories\n\nSince then, Israeli forces have laid much of Gaza to waste, and nearly all its 2.3 million people have been driven from their homes at least once, causing a humanitarian catastrophe. More than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nOn the eve of the hearings, Mr Netanyahu for the first time publicly stated opposition to calls from right-wing members of his government, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, for Palestinians to leave Gaza voluntarily, making way for Israelis to settle there.\n\nWhile the stance has been Israel's official policy, Mr Netanyahu's prior comments on permanent occupation of Gaza have been inconsistent and at times opaque.\n\n\"I want to make a few points absolutely clear: Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population,\" he wrote on X.\n\nPotentially timing his comments ahead of the ICJ hearings, he added: \"Israel is fighting Hamas terrorists, not the Palestinian population, and we are doing so in full compliance with international law.\"\n\nJordan and Egypt warned on Wednesday against any Israeli reoccupation of the Gaza Strip and appealed for uprooted residents to be allowed to return to their homes as Jordan's King Abdullah and Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi met.\n\nIsrael had said this week it was planning to begin drawing down troops, at least from the northern part of Gaza, after weeks of US pressure to scale down its operations and shift to what Washington says should be a more targeted campaign. - REUTERS\n\nGaza\n\nISRAEL\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu\n\nWARS AND CONFLICTS\n\nICJ/INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE\n\nSouth Africa\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 10, 2025, 07:37am\n\nEx-NMP Calvin Cheng 'deeply remorseful' for remarks on activists\n\nApr 10, 2025, 06:33am\n\nKorban registration opens in S'pore, portion of meat to be distributed in Gaza\n\nApr 9, 2025, 11:40pm\n\nMasagos says remarks by former NMP Calvin Cheng hurtful to Malay/Muslims\n\nApr 7, 2025, 08:52am\n\nPergas calls former NMP Calvin Cheng's remarks on activist group 'deeply troubling'\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nSalary Insights in Singapore - Where Do You Stand?\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/64778152990f24dadcbc0864128b14f09bcbb2d30640c52d30a942939ec1e0c4/LYNXMPEK0A013-1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mourners react next to the bodies of Palestinians killed in an Israeli strike, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, January 10, 2024.

The now three-year-old will lap up the 1,200m on the Polytrack - which he has to cover on Jan 14.\n\nDuric has been Greatham Boy's regular partner since Fitzsimmons took over his training duties from Michael Clements in September.\n\nThey have developed a good understanding and, together, they have been to the trials four times, winning twice and placing second on the other two occasions.\n\nFitzsimmons has picked a nice race for the son of Stratosphere who, to date, has won two races from four starts.\n\nBoth those wins were recorded while he was in Clements' yard but Fitzsimmons has him in a good place and he looks ripe for another victory.\n\nDuric also worked on Italian Revolution and the four-year-old will see action in Race 11 - a Class 4 flyer over the 1,000m.\n\nAlready a three-time winner from just 11 starts, Italian Revolution will be having his first start for Fitzsimmons, having previously been under the care of Shane Baertschiger.\n\nA noted speedster, he pulled off his third career win on Nov 25.\n\nThat day, under Ronnie Stewart, he charged home from third at the turn to win rather easily.\n\nAn Australian-bred by Caravaggio, he was sent to the trials on Jan 4 and he performed admirably, finishing second to Ghalib.\n\nThat trial, coupled with that most recent gallop, would have smoothened out any rough edges.\n\nFitzsimmons will be optimistic and happy with his three-year-old.\n\nHe has every right to be so.\n\nWatch for that spring in their steps when Lucky Hero and Eruption step out for Race 9, a Novice event over 1,200m.\n\nBoth have been finely tuned for that upcoming assignment and it would not come as a huge surprise to see them turn in big runs.\n\nEruption, who races in the silks of the Buffalo Stable, knows what it feels like to win a race.\n\nHe has one under his belt - putting it together with an all-the-way win over the tricky trip of 1,400m.\n\nLast time, on Dec 30, Eruption had to settle for third spot in that race won by Aniki.\n\nThat day, he carried stable confidence and Fitzsimmons would have been disappointed.\n\nEruption gets his chance at atonement and he just might do it.\n\nIn the same race, Fitzsimmons could be looking at the quinella with Lucky Hero.\n\nA four-year-old by Shooting To Win, Lucky Hero has yet to break through at Kranji.\n\nHe came close on two occasions which, right now, seemed a long time ago.\n\nIndeed it was on May 20 that he took second in a race won by Knippenberg.\n\nThen, on July 23, he again had to settle for the spoils when beaten by Fight On in a Novice event over 1,200m.\n\nFitzsimmons sent him to the trials on Jan 5 and he equipped himself really well, winning that hit-out in a smart time of 1min 00.39sec.\n\nBefore arriving at Kranji on Nov 21, 2022, Lucky Hero had one start for one win in Australia.\n\nThat was in a 1,000m sprint at the Sunshine Coast.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before he opens his Singapore account and live up to his name.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nstarhub.com\n\nCelebrate 25 years of StarHub with 10Gbps Broadband deal\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/dff7c11e83cd9da7ad430335c13711d2af2ce91822a7b6a77eee00ef3f083b1f/bmtrack11.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Greatham Boy (Ibrahim Mamat) making a winning debut in a Restricted Maiden race (1,100m) on June 17, 2023.\n", "caption": "Greatham Boy (Ibrahim Mamat) making a winning debut in a Restricted Maiden race (1,100m) on June 17, 2023.

He would have been a happy man. After all, his horses at the trials seemed to lap up the adverse conditions and they ended the morning taking both hit-outs.\n\nIndeed, Gray pulled off the trifecta in the first trial when Kharisma beat Silent Is Gold, which left Hard Too Think to take the \"bronze\".\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nThen, in the second trial, Gray's runner, Our Pinnacle, beat the Mahadi Taib-trained Bureaucrat to complete a good day for the affable conditioner.\n\nJust so it is not all about Gray, jockey Matthew Kellady would have been pleased with both the mounts he was entrusted with.\n\nYes, he was astride Kharisma in the first and later legged up on Our Pinnacle.\n\nKellady used to do most of his riding for former Kranji trainer Shane Baertschiger.\n\nBut since \"Stretch\" stopped training at Kranji, he has been offering his services elsewhere.\n\nIndeed, at the just-concluded meeting on Jan 6, Kellady helped juice up two trifectas when he parked two big-priced rides into third spot.\n\nVolcanic was a $272 hope when third to Pacific Sonic in Race 9 while Webster, a $107 chance, filled third spot in the last race which was won by Flying Nemo.\n\nBack to the trials and Kharisma had to fight for honours.\n\nThen again, it could be said that for all of the 1,000m, the trial was between Kellady's mount and Silent Is Gold, who was partnered by apprentice Jamil Sarwi.\n\nThey dictated things from the get-go and, as they raced down the home stretch, they looked to be locked as one.\n\nHowever, under the gentle hands of Kellady, who nursed his mount along, Kharisma prevailed by half a length, with Silent Is Gold hardly disgraced.\n\nKharisma clocked 1min 00.99sec, which was highly commendable given the wet conditions.\n\nAlthough getting on in years, Kharisma can still land some knockout blows.\n\nTake that last win on Aug 6. It was the Rocket Man Sprint, a Singapore Group 3 race run over 1,200m on grass.\n\nKharisma was parked in midfield and it was doubtful if his rider, Shafrizal Saleh, could extricate him from that position.\n\nBut he did and, when Kharisma saw daylight close home, he went for broke and, in the process, beat Pacific Emperor by three parts of a length. He then took fourth behind Lim's Kosciuszko in the Lion City Cup on Aug 27.\n\nGray entered him for five more races before closing the book on his 2023 campaign.\n\nKharisma is hardly a spent force and he deserves a second look the next time he goes to the races.\n\nAs for Silent Is Gold, we know that he has a ton of racing left in him.\n\nIt was two starts back on Nov 11 that he notched up his sixth career win.\n\nThat was in classy company and he beat Gold Star by three parts of a length.\n\nThen, at his last start, on Dec 17, he garnered a busload of new fans when he finished second - beaten by under a length by that brilliant galloper, Super Salute.\n\nYes, at just five years old, Silent Is Gold is the real deal and we should see more big runs from him in the high-class races coming up.\n\nAs for that other Gray-Kellady winner on Jan 9, Our Pinnacle has been off the boil for the better part of a year.\n\nHopefully, that win at the trials will rekindle some spark in the nine-year-old. Gray, who owns and trains the galloper, will be keeping his fingers crossed.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/97d8ec694b55b080d8faff35cd29deafb302e68e651d26cd1bc6d6ffa2933b87/bmtrials11.jpeg?w=965", "alt_text": "Kharisma (Matthew Kellady) finishing ahead of stablemate Silent Is Gold (Jamil Sarwi) in a barrier trial on Jan 9.\n\n\n", "caption": "Kharisma (Matthew Kellady) finishing ahead of stablemate Silent Is Gold (Jamil Sarwi) in a barrier trial on Jan 9.

I'm pretty strict. Aside from the websites and apps she needs to download for school, I don't let her use the Internet much.\"\n\nHe adds: \"The Internet is something so out of my control. If she really wants to surf the Web, I can do it with her.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe veteran actor's wariness of the online world is one of the reasons Lau made I Did It My Way. He is both leading man and executive producer.\n\nMovies should have a sense of purpose, he says.\n\n\"Things progress so rapidly online, like artificial intelligence - it's almost unfathomable to me.\n\n\"Technological advancements are perhaps good, but there are cons too, misinformation and so on that can be hard to balance with the good. That's what I'm hoping to tell the audiences through this film.\"\n\nWatch on YouTube\n\nLau flaunts his villainous chops as a crime boss who can torture and kill without batting an eyelid, though he still has a soft spot for his family.\n\nHe says: \"I wanted to be someone who comes across as very cold. Aside from his family, he doesn't show too much emotion.\n\n\"There are a lot of movie villains who are showier and more expressive. Tony Leung Chiu-wai recently played one in The Goldfinger, so I thought it would be good to showcase a different type of antagonist.\"\n\nThe Goldfinger, which opened in Singapore cinemas on Dec 30, reunites Lau and Hong Kong actor Leung in their first collaboration since the Infernal Affairs trilogy (2002 to 2003), with Lau playing a cop trying to hunt down Leung's corrupt businessman.\n\nI Did It My Way is a star-studded flick too, with Lau roping in fellow Infernal Affairs alum Gordon Lam, veteran Hong Kong star Simon Yam and Taiwanese actor Eddie Peng.\n\nPeng, 41, is a well-known \"fanboy\" of Lau who has publicly professed his admiration for the veteran actor.\n\nDespite having previously co-starred in movies such as Cold War (2012), this is their most extensive collaboration yet.\n\nTaiwanese actor Eddie Peng (left) faces off Andy Lau’s (right) crime lord character in I Did It My Way. PHOTO: SHAW ORGANISATION\n\nWhen asked if he could feel Peng's nerves filming opposite him, Lau says: \"That's really normal. I was also very nervous when I first met (Hong Kong movie star) Chow Yun Fat on set.\n\n\"Everyone is this way when they work with actors they admire because you know your performance will determine their impression of you. It's the sort of nerves that can be helpful for your work.\"\n\nWith more than 40 years of experience and some 200 movies and series under his belt, Lau is booked and busy.\n\nHis year-end holiday season in 2023 was packed with schedules promoting The Goldfinger and I Did It My Way, which opened within days of each other in China.\n\nBut the Heavenly King is keen to finally cut back on his workload.\n\nHe explains: \"With the pandemic in the past three years, a lot of films that were backlogged then are now starting to screen, so a lot of things are coming out at about the same time.\n\n\"But I'm definitely thinking of slowing down and I will gradually start to do so.\n\n\"Ultimately, I'm someone who likes to spend time with friends and family.\"\n\nI Did It My Way opens in cinemas on Jan 11.\n\nJan Lee\n\nCorrespondent\n\nMovies\n\nactors\n\nhong kong\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 28, 2025, 01:10am\n\nSingapore content creator Annette Lee to write and direct first feature film\n\nMay 24, 2025, 03:12am\n\nDirector Anthony Chen wrapping up the final film in his Singaporean trilogy\n\nMay 10, 2025, 10:53pm\n\nGodzilla emerges from Marina Bay to mark franchise's 70th anniversary\n\nApr 25, 2025, 12:35am\n\nMade-with-Singapore films earn prestigious Cannes Festival spots\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nSyfe\n\nRiding the Market Waves - Why REITs Still Deliver\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/27469773c6c989e735a726e363d55af46f35bdfe929d4796786e1a81a638526d/aiandylau100124.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Hong Kong movie star Andy Lau plays a ruthless drug kingpin in the new crime movie I Did It My Way.", "caption": "Hong Kong movie star Andy Lau plays a ruthless drug kingpin in the new crime movie I Did It My Way.

And to her surprise, she received several messages from interested parties asking whether the business and recipes were for sale a day after her announcement.\n\n\"To be honest I've not considered what price I'd be willing to sell them for,\" she told the Chinese evening daily, adding that she will \"wait and see\" before making a decision.\n\nIn her post, she thanked her customers for their support and did not rule out going back to the food industry.\n\n\"Who knows, I might be back again on a smaller and [more] manageable scale on my own,\" she wrote.\n\nbuns\n\nRESTAURANTS/EATERIES\n\nBUSINESS CLOSURES\n\nCHEFS\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nYour dream home, now more affordable with IKEA home design ​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/0f59008803029f032f0ff1ba757eafcf94eb66c77c3c8131573da52f79c99043/imgonline-com-ua-twotoone-xubobxtx3s.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Madam Sandra Chan, the wife of the late chef Tan Yong Hua (right), announced on Restaurant Home’s social media pages that it would be closing on March 31.", "caption": "Madam Sandra Chan, the wife of the late chef Tan Yong Hua (right), announced on Restaurant Home’s social media pages that it would be closing on March 31.

The messages claimed Ms Maemanah had other outstanding loans.\n\nMadam Ika found it hard to believe as she herself had seen the loan amounts in Ms Maemanah's conversations with the loan sharks.\n\nA friend working at a licensed moneylending company advised Madam Ika to ignore the messages and he said it was a scare tactic loan sharks use to try to get more money from their victims.\n\nShe tried to reach Ms Maemanah but her calls went unanswered. Her son also told her that the maid was not at home.\n\nMadam Ika filed a police report for a missing person and the harassment by loan sharks. The police advised her to keep her door closed and not make any more payments.\n\nMs Maemanah was caught on the closed-circuit television footage to be leaving the flat with two tote bags.

There is a gag order on the victim and the specific location of the incident.\n\nAccording to court documents, he accessed the dormitory rooms of two women, aged 18 and 21, on Nov 13.\n\nA second criminal trespass charge will be taken into consideration during Neo's sentencing, which is scheduled for Feb 21.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 29, 2025, 01:41am\n\nExperts sound warning despite few cases of AI cheating reported in S'pore universities\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn a statement after he was charged in November 2023, the Ministry of Defence said Neo has been suspended from all duties.\n\nThe ministry also said that it would carefully assess the eventual findings before deciding on further appropriate actions.\n\nThe accused's lawyers Mr Sunil Sudheesan and Ms Joyce Khoo, from Quahe Woo & Palmer, said Neo decided to go to NTU, his alma mater, to seek emotional comfort as the institution represented \"a place of fond memories and familiarity\".\n\nThey said Neo had been in a low mood since his godfather, whom he was very close to, died on June 30, 2022.\n\nThe lawyers said that before committing the offences, Neo drank beer and planned to visit his godfather's home to seek solace, but ended up at NTU instead.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Wong Shiau Yin said Neo's victim was in lying on her bed, eating some snacks and using her phone, at about 2am on Nov 13, 2022, when she heard a knock on her door.\n\nBefore she could react, Neo opened the door. He spoke to her briefly, before entering the room without her permission.\n\nNeo then closed the door behind him, and locked it.\n\nHe sat on the student's bed and told her that he was tired as he had just climbed many flights of stairs.\n\nSaid DPP Wong: \"The victim felt puzzled by the accused's actions but did not react as he looked tired and was sweating profusely.\"\n\nNeo asked the student for some drinks, and she directed him to a water cooler on another level.\n\nInstead of leaving, Neo continued to sit on her bed and asked for directions to Hall 10 and Hall 14, saying that he was looking for a friend who was residing at one of the blocks.\n\nThe student provided directions, but Neo then asked for directions to other halls.\n\nHe also asked her some personal questions, like where she was from and what she was studying.\n\nAfter the victim replied that she was from Jiangsu province in China, Neo continued quizzing her about her course of study, her name, and other personal information.\n\nHe then asked the student her if she wanted to earn some extra income and \"accompany\" him for $1,000.\n\n\"At this point, the victim felt uncomfortable as the accused was making a sexual proposition,\" said DPP Wong.\n\nThe student rejected Neo by saying that she did not need the money and told him to leave her room. Instead, Neo touched her left thigh.\n\nAfter the student repeated her request for him to leave her room, Neo stood up from the bed, walked towards her and touched her left arm.\n\nHe placed his hands on her shoulders and said in Mandarin: \"Is $1,000 ok? Can you accompany me?\".\n\nScared, the victim pushed Neo away and shouted for him to leave the room.\n\nNeo eventually walked to the door and told the student the door was locked and that he could not open it.\n\nThe student then took out her phone intending to call her friend and when Neo saw this, he unlocked the door and left the room.\n\nThe student called campus security and made a police report.\n\nA report from the Institute of Mental Health stated that Neo was intoxicated at the time of the offences, adding that there may be a partial contributory link between his alcohol intoxication and loss of restraint.\n\nThe report added that he was not of unsound mind at the time of the offence.\n\nDPP Wong argued for Neo to be sentenced to at least 12 weeks' jail, saying the molestation offence was committed on private property in the wee hours of the morning.\n\nMs Khoo and Mr Sudheesan said he should be fined about $10,000, saying that it was a one-off incident and uncharacteristic of Neo.\n\nThey highlighted that the skin-to-skin contact between their client and the victim was very brief, and that there was no invasion of the victim's private part.\n\nThey also said Neo did not have any ulterior motive, and had entered the dormitory to find someone to talk to.\n\nFor using criminal force intending to outrage modesty, Neo can be jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or receive any combination of such punishments.\n\nHe can be jailed for up to three months, fined up to $1,500, or both, for criminal trespass.\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nntu\n\nRSAF\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 19, 2025, 12:46am\n\nNUS retains 8th spot, NTU climbs to 12th in latest global university rankings\n\nApr 20, 2025, 01:46am\n\nNTU receives $110m gift to help students in need and support the community\n\nMar 30, 2025, 11:56pm\n\nNUS medical school sees record 60% female intake in 2024\n\nMar 25, 2025, 11:42pm\n\nNTU student uses dorm for photo shoots of girls, including 13-year-old, in lingerie\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

If I didn't, they looked at me weirdly.\n\n\"It was just that they were unfamiliar with me and my race.

Shanmugam said: \"In Singapore, what we have seen is people who prey on young girls - may not necessarily be rape. They come out, and then they do it again.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 3, 2025, 10:38pm\n\nGE2025: WP to get two NCMP seats in the next Parliament, on top of 10 elected MPs\n\nMore related stories\n\nIn a joint statement, the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said with current sentencing options being inadequate to deal with such serious offences, the SEPP will ensure serious offenders are detained for as long as needed for public safety.\n\nThe SEPP is limited to those who committed serious violent offences such as culpable homicide and attempted murder, and serious sexual offences such as rape and sexual penetration of a minor.\n\nThe SEPP will apply to those 21 years old and above, and will not just be for recalcitrant offenders, but for first-time offenders as well.\n\nIf sentenced under the SEPP, an offender can be detained between five and 20 years. These offenders will not get remission, which is a discount on their sentence.\n\nAt the end of their term, if the offender is found suitable to leave prison, he will be released on licence.\n\nThis means he may be required to attend counselling, remain at home during certain hours, and be made to wear an electronic tag. He will be assessed every two years for his suitability to be discharged unconditionally.\n\nMeanwhile, if an offender is not suitable for release, he can continue to be detained indefinitely and even up to life. But his case will be reviewed annually.\n\nMr Shanmugam added: \"There will be a proper assessment. Is he mentally and psychologically fit to be released, or is he going to continue to be a menace to society? If he continues to be a menace to society, he can be kept in.\"\n\nThis is unlike an imprisonment sentence or preventive detention, where the offender must be released after serving the sentence imposed by the court.\n\nPreventive detention is a regime for recalcitrant offenders that does not automatically offer the usual one-third remission.\n\nMinLaw and MHA said the authorities want to ensure that dangerous and high-risk offenders are not released into the community until they no longer pose a threat to public safety.\n\nThey noted that for offences that do not call for life imprisonment, the available sentencing options all require an offender to be released automatically after a certain point, regardless of the threat they pose to others.\n\nIt will be up to the court to decide if SEPP is appropriate for the offender after considering risk assessment reports, including reports by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).\n\nSeparately, if the Bill is passed, the Corrective Training (CT) regime will be repealed and the Preventive Detention (PD) regime will be amended.\n\nTo replace the existing sentences of CT and PD, the Sentence for Public Protection (SPP), which is aimed at recalcitrant offenders, will be introduced.\n\nCurrently, the CT regime applies to offenders aged 18 years and above who require corrective training for a substantial period. This is followed by supervision if released before their sentence ends, to prevent them from reoffending.\n\nThe PD regime applies to offenders aged 30 years and above who need to be detained for a substantial period. It is reserved for more serious offenders, as compared to the CT regime.\n\nIf the Bill is passed, the SPP will be for those aged 21 years and above, and they can be jailed for between five and 20 years.\n\nThey may be released on licence by the Minister for Home Affairs after serving two-thirds of their sentence, and must be released after serving the full term.\n\nNadine Chua\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\ncrime\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:51pm\n\nGE2025: Is my vote really secret?\n\nApr 28, 2025, 10:46pm\n\n'Mission Possible': Voting for WP in Punggol GRC will benefit all S'poreans, says Pritam Singh\n\nApr 22, 2025, 03:31am\n\nTearful Louis Ng announces exit from politics, says he wants more time with family\n\nApr 14, 2025, 07:16am\n\nGE2025: Key days and announcements to look out for in the lead-up to the election\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Stills from this new movie were recently released, and show a very different Jia.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 19, 2024, 03:09pm\n\nS'porean singer Qiu Feng Ze teases fans on what's up and coming\n\nMore related stories\n\nShe sports toned arms and abs, reportedly thanks to having gone through a strict strength training programme.\n\nHer new look has shocked netizens, with some worried that she put her health at risk.

Taiwanese stars Bai Yun, Di Ying and Joseph Ma also made special guest appearances on separate nights.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 7, 2025, 08:12am\n\nMan looking to buy drone at discounted price ends up scammed\n\nMore related stories\n\nIt was awe-inspiring to see the amount of hard work that went on behind the scenes.\n\nBeyond the on-screen banter was meticulous research into the products to be sold, planning how to conduct each livestream, darting about to record orders on a laptop while the show was ongoing, and stealing bites of dinner in between.\n\n\"Jack is probably the funniest man in Singapore, so when you have him directing, it's not a problem,\" Cao said of his co-founder.\n\nThere's no question that the pair are prominent faces, even in Taipei. They were easily recognised by locals and Singaporean tourists alike, who often stopped them on the streets for photos.\n\nFans stopping Jack Neo and Terence Cao for photos in Ximending, Taipei.TNP PHOTOS: CHERLYNN NG\n\nThe rest of the team contribute just as much to Star Live's growth and success. Take super multi-taskers Lee and Ong, for example, who was seen taking care of administrative work with the utmost diligence every night, as the camera rolled.\n\nThe chemistry among the Star Live team was a sight to behold. Jokes and punchlines sparked rambunctious laughter, creating an atmosphere where it never felt like you were being sold a product but rather, listening to friends rave about trusty recommendations. The cold climate had nothing on the infectious energy that warmed and inspired in equal measure.\n\nWhy did Star Live choose Taiwan for its first overseas venture?\n\nCao explained that the country boasts rich agriculture, promising delicious eats. Star Live also collaborates with Taiwan's leading livestreaming platforms to sell quality and trusted local products such as tea, biscuits and skincare.\n\n\"It's an efficient process with our Taiwanese counterparts handling quality control and logistics, saving our artistes from the tedious task of packing and such,\" said Cao.\n\n\"There are both on- and off-screen partnerships, and opportunities for all.\"\n\nCao also revealed choosing the period for its Christmas backdrop, adding: \"It's a feast for the eyes.\"\n\nBut what differentiates Star Live from its rivals?\n\nStar Live is not only an alternate source of revenue for celebrities, but also a good way for them to \"maintain their craft\", said Cao, who welcomes artistes from all walks of life, regardless of their backgrounds.\n\nHe said: \"There are some platforms that are too focused on sales. It's all about sell, sell sell. But at Star Live, it's about the artiste's craft.\n\n\"Shopping is about creating an experience, not just selling products. We want to bring an element of entertainment, that's how we set ourselves apart from other livestreamers.\"\n\nThis is evident in Star Live's many broadcasts, with each team member playing their part.\n\nThere is plenty of teasing and playful taunting, with Oh often being the brunt of jokes. Cao, the sole full-timer, is a constant and reliable presence, staying onscreen throughout the platform's three-hour Taipei streams three evenings in a row.\n\nWatching Star Live behind the scenes was quite the experience.TNP PHOTOS: CHERLYNN NG\n\nEqually noteworthy is the personal touch that Star Live brings to viewers. For instance, Lee is lauded by both her colleagues and the audience for her in-depth knowledge of nutrition and skincare when the team peddles beauty products.\n\nBesides acknowledging fans and calling out their names on air, Star Live gave away tickets to Neo's upcoming film Money No Enough 3, during one livestream. Customers who placed their orders in December were also promised they will receive the goods before the Lunar New Year.\n\nCao said: \"That's the beauty of livestreaming. It's accessible, the prices are good and you can buy things that you can't purchase elsewhere.\n\n\"We serve the brands and role-play for content during livestreaming. It's like a performance. That's how we stay committed as a company.\"\n\nTaiwanese entertainer Bai, who does not host his own livestreams, said he enjoyed working with Star Live and found the experience refreshing. He praised the teamwork, noting how the members got to share their expertise on a wide range of goods.\n\nThe 53-year-old, whose real name is Li Kuo-hung, explained: \"It's tiring to livestream solo, so I don't host any on my own despite receiving offers. I think it hurts the throat too much, plus you have to introduce so many products. Livestreaming is really not easy and you have to do it three to four days a week, which is very tough.\n\n\"But here, there are a lot of people bantering back and forth. Among all the laughter and fun, we also recommend good and affordable products to viewers, which I think is a good thing.\"\n\nFellow veteran celebrity Ma, 52, said it was his first time participating in such an event and spoke just as highly of the collaboration.\n\nTaiwanese actor Joseph Ma told TNP that he enjoyed working with Star Live.TNP PHOTO: MAUREEN KOH\n\nThe former member of 1990s boy group Red Hot Boys told TNP: \"We might not know one another well but we are all actors in the same industry, so I think we worked pretty well together.\n\n\"I feel that livestreaming allows us to engage with the audience in a way that traditional media doesn't. When you are filming a drama series or a movie as an actor, you don't really get to interact with your viewers. Livestreaming not only bridges this distance, but it also lets me share my experiences regarding different products with everyone.\"\n\nAsked if he had any encouraging words for Star Live, Ma said: \"I hope they come to Taiwan more often.\"\n\nBy\n\nCherlynn Ng\n\nAssistant Digital Editor\n\nRead articles by Cherlynn Ng\n\ne-commerce\n\nlocal actor\n\nOnline Shopping\n\nlive streaming\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJan 25, 2025, 01:13am\n\nShopee customers lost $399,000 to scammers in 2024\n\nJan 22, 2025, 08:17am\n\nMan orders bi-fold doors on Lazada but receives plastic keychain instead\n\nNov 23, 2024, 08:23am\n\nExcessive levels of toxins found in kids' clothes sold on Temu\n\nNov 12, 2024, 11:16pm\n\nQoo10 owed online retailer $1.6m in sales payout as of July\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Especially in the form of a gracious matriarch who still lives in a family-owned hanok (traditional Korean house) and invites you to dinner for a taste of heritage that dates back more than 350 years.\n\nKi Soon-do, whose name graces the bottles of artisanal soya sauce that her ancestors made before her, lives in Yucheon-ri - a small rural village in Changpyeong-meong, a three-and-a-half-hour drive from Seoul.\n\nThe Kisoondo family home sits on a sprawling piece of land, with no neighbours except distant mountains, pine forests and some 1,000 clay jars known as onggi, standing in rows like stubby terracotta warriors silently guarding the precious brew within - an alchemy of soybeans, bamboo salt and water.\n\nKisoondo is not officially open to the public, but the matriarch regularly invites local and overseas chefs to visit.\n\nHere, they get to make their own customised soya sauce, albeit in smaller jars than the ones used for commercial sale. They learn how soybeans are boiled, mashed and pressed into blocks called meju, which are tied with straw and hung to dry to attract the good bacteria that kick-starts the fermentation.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:48am\n\nKia launches its first Singapore-assembled EV\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe blocks are placed in jars, along with water and house-made bamboo salt - sea salt which has been packed into bamboo harvested from the famed forests in Damyang county, and baked to infuse it with its trademark fragrance and mellow saltiness.\n\nThe chefs return after a year to see if their efforts have come to fruition. Success is not guaranteed because batches are known to spoil if mould seeps in. This is why a successful brew can also be interpreted as a sign of good luck for the year ahead.\n\nThe Business Times was there with Korean chef Ryu Tae-hwan of the Seoul restaurant Ryunique - a locavore-inspired modern eatery that sources its ingredients from artisanal producers around the country.\n\nOut on the field, where the jars of sauce lay in different stages of fermentation, Chef Ryu's grand \"opening\" of his personal soya sauce is overseen by the matriarch herself, as other family members help to peel off the backing that covers the jar.\n\nIt's a success. Glistening golden brown brew peeps from the opening, with blocks of well-aged soya beans that will be mashed and then repacked into the jar for further fermentation into soya bean paste. Meanwhile, the precious soy sauce will be bottled and served at Ryu's restaurant.\n\nThe whole process is an eye-opening look at the rich history and traditions of South Korea, where artisans such as Ki Soon-do still exist to create the backbones of the country's cuisine without succumbing to the pressures of commercialisation.\n\nEven then, the Kisoondo brand is not one that's closed off to the outside world. Its product line, which includes soya sauce aged from one to five years, gochujang and doenjang, is sold in high-end Seoul supermarkets and as far away as the US and even in Singapore.

Prior to this, these were registrable offences, and those convicted were given a criminal record.\n\nThe conviction would automatically be rendered spent after five years if the person remained crime-free during the period, unless the individual was disqualified under certain conditions, such as if the sentence exceeded three months' jail or a $2,000 fine. This means the person would no longer have a criminal record for the offence.\n\nBut past convictions under Section 377A for consensual, private, homosexual acts between adults may now be rendered spent by application as well.\n\nIn 2022, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said there were 17 living people convicted between 1988 and 2007 over consensual, private, homosexual acts between adults.

The man then swiped his hand over the boy's left cheek.\n\nThe bus attendant spoke to Poh, who then returned to the driver's seat and continued driving the bus.\n\nThe boy called his grandmother, who said she would meet him at the void deck of his home.\n\nUpon seeing his grandmother, the boy cried and told her what had happened.\n\nThe grandmother then confronted Poh about touching the boy. Poh brushed it off by laughing and denied that it had happened.\n\nOn Aug 2, 2023, the boy, who was feeling pain on his left shoulder, visited Changi General Hospital and was diagnosed with a dislocation of the acromioclavicular joint of the left shoulder, and tenderness over the area.\n\nHe was given hospitalisation leave from Aug 2 to 15 and had to wear a sling.\n\nWhen questioned by the police, Poh said he was angry with the boy, as he was not using the seat belt, had thrown items all over the bus and dirtied his bus.\n\nHe admitted that he grabbed the victim's left shoulder and wanted to pull him out of his seat.\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nBUSES\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 9, 2025, 12:42am\n\nMan arrested over bottle thrown at SMRT bus\n\nJul 7, 2025, 12:32am\n\nPassenger injured after bottle thrown at bus leaves hole in window\n\nMay 27, 2025, 12:18am\n\nSMRT to extend selected train, bus services on eve of Hari Raya Haji\n\nMay 19, 2025, 10:36pm\n\nNew bus service 230M linking Kim Keat and Toa Payoh Bus Interchange to start on June 8\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Shanmugam said: \"To combat this scam variant, the SPF has been working with Meta to stop further abuse of compromised WhatsApp accounts as soon as they are detected.\"\n\nHe said the police are also working with online platforms such as Google to introduce stronger safeguards, including pre-emptive detection and blocking of URLs linked to phishing sites.\n\nAdditionally, the Online Criminal Harms Act, which is set to be progressively rolled out from this quarter, will allow the Government to tell online messaging platforms to disable access to accounts suspected to be compromised or involved in scams.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nMr Shanmugam was responding to Dr Wan Rizal (Jalan Besar GRC) and Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), who had raised concerns after the SPF said at least 237 victims had lost $606,000 to phishing scams since November.\n\nThere was also a spike from the WhatsApp scam variant.\n\nMr Shanmugam said this happened as users clicked on a fake WhatsApp website as they tried to access their WhatsApp account on their computers.\n\nScammers then accessed the victims' WhatsApp accounts and impersonated the victims to ask their family and friends for money.\n\nMore recently,\n\nat least 83 victims have fallen prey to a DBS Bank phishing scam\n\nsince the start of January, losing at least $155,000, after scammers impersonated DBS officials through spoofed SMSes.\n\nFrom January 2018 to June 2023, scammers pocketed more than $2.2 billion from victims in Singapore.\n\nIn the first six months of 2023, the police\n\nrecorded 22,339 cases of scams,\n\nwith victims losing $7.4 million through 2,991 cases of phishing scams.\n\nThe police said phishing scams generally involve e-mails, text messages, calls or advertisements. Scammers impersonate official sources to trick victims into revealing details like bank account or credit card information.\n\nThe police advise the public to adopt the following precautionary measures:\n\nAdd - Install ScamShield app to protect yourself from scam calls and SMSes. Set up security features such as transaction limits for Internet banking transactions, and two-factor or multi-factor authentication for banks and e-wallets.\n\nCheck\n\n- Check for scam signs with official sources, such as ScamShield WhatsApp bot @\n\ngo.gov.sg/scamshield-bot\n\n, or call the Anti-Scam Helpline on 1800-722-6688, or visit\n\nscamalert.sg\n\n. Look for telltale signs of a phishing website and never disclose your personal or banking credentials, including one-time passwords, to anyone.\n\nTell - Tell the authorities, family and friends about scams.\n\nThose with information relating to such crimes can call the police hotline on 1800-255-0000, or submit it online at\n\npolice.gov.sg/iwitness\n\nAndrew Wong\n\nSCAMS\n\nSINGAPORE PARLIAMENT\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs\n\nINTERNET CRIMES AND SCAMS\n\nK Shanmugam\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/537c2d4cbd074dfb8cc005441bffe5f55253780ac9eb86cda825f8e15a06dec4/JSL7901.JPG.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "The Singapore Police Force has been working with Meta to stop further abuse of compromised WhatsApp accounts as soon as they are detected.", "caption": "The Singapore Police Force has been working with Meta to stop further abuse of compromised WhatsApp accounts as soon as they are detected.

Others went against the clock and more than a handful got racegoers at trackside talking.\n\nMonopolising the conversation were two runners entered for the Novice event over the 1,200m on the Polytrack.\n\nThey were Gun and Strike Gold.\n\nIn separate gallops, both youngsters went under the 40-second mark.\n\nGun clocked 39.1 for his effort over the 600m while Strike Gold went a tad faster, registering 38.9 for that same trip.\n\nBack to that Novice event, which carries a purse of $75,000, it is shaping up to be an exciting contest with some future talents coming under starter's orders.\n\nFor now and in the mix we have Gun and Strike Gold.\n\nPrepared by Donna Logan, Gun has been a revelation since Kranji's woman trainer sent him to the races on Oct 14, 2023.\n\nThat day, he finished second to Kungfu Hero - despite his rider being put at a distinct disadvantage when his saddle shifted back.\n\nNo point crying over spilt milk.\n\nSo the connections got back to the drawing board on him and, two starts later, they saw the fruits of their hard work.\n\nGun covered himself with glory, beating a talented Open Maiden field over the 1,200m sprint.\n\nAnd he did it in style, putting 2½ lengths between himself and second-placed October. That was on Dec 9.\n\nApprentice Jamil Sarwi, who did the work on him on Jan 9, was in the saddle that day.\n\nThe pair looked like they could make it a quickfire double when Logan entered Gun for a Novice event on Dec 30.\n\nAlas, it was not to be.\n\nThe three-year-old was - well - outgunned by Aniki, who took the chocolates by a length.\n\nWell, that is behind him right now and, with Jan 9 workout under his girth, Gun looks well-placed to shoot down his rivals in the Jan 14 showdown.\n\nThen again, maybe not.\n\nStrike Gold was equally impressive on the training track, and the colt from Ricardo Le Grange's yard will want a piece of the pie.\n\nA winner on debut, which was on July 15, Strike Gold has not been able to replicate that showing in all of his next six starts.\n\nBut he did put in an admirable effort two starts back on Dec 2.\n\nThat day, in a Class 4 event over the 1,200m on the Polytrack, Strike Gold was sent on his way as the $18 top pick.\n\nUnder a ride from Vitor Espindola, he had the early lead but surrendered it before the home turn.\n\nHe still looked in it at the furlong mark but could not cope with that brilliant finishing burst of speed from Groovy, who eventually took the honours with two lengths to spare.\n\nStaunch and loyal supporters of Singapore racing for decades, the Yongs of Gold Stable would have been disappointed.\n\nBut they can take heart in the fact that their youngster is in fine fettle and he should hold his own in the sprint that is coming up.\n\nOn the undercard, it could be worth your while to pay attention to Ksatria.\n\nTrained by Stephen Gray for the Dago Stable, Ksatria (Jamil) turned in a pleasing gallop, running the 600m in 39.6 in the wet.\n\nNow a seven-year-old, he has been a good horse to have in the yard.\n\nThrice already, he has served up wins for his connections.\n\nHowever, you have to go all the way back to July 30, 2023, to find the last time he saluted the judge.\n\nThat day, when obliged to race wide in a 1,200m event, he still had enough in the tank to charge home and then hold off a spirited challenge from eventual runner-up, War Warrior.\n\nKsatria fired blanks in his next five starts but he did turn in a nice gallop when running third in a recent trial.\n\nIt is always difficult to say with certainty what could happen in Class 5 races.\n\nBut one thing is certain.\n\nAfter racing and falling short in his recent races - all of which have been against Class 4 opposition - Ksatria will appreciate the drop in class.\n\nAnd, on the back of his nice hit-out, he could put that Class 5 race to bed long before the others come to realise what hit them.\n\nbrian@sph.com.sg\n\ntrackwork.pdf\n\nBy\n\nBrian Miller\n\nRead articles by Brian Miller\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Nets FlashPay cards can continue to be used for both motoring and retail payment after the deadline.\n\nAnnouncing the change on Jan 9, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said two in three adult fare transactions on public transport today are made on the SimplyGo system, which allows commuters to use contactless bank cards - MasterCard, Visa and Nets - or the SimplyGo EZ-Link card to pay for public transport.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 08:49am\n\nCOE prices rise across the board\n\nMore related stories\n\nFrom Jan 19 to July 18, commuters can exchange their Nets FlashPay cards for free Nets Prepaid Cards at SimplyGo Ticket Offices located at MRT stations and bus interchanges.\n\nNets said in a statement that refunds can also be made at local bank ATMs or at its customer service centre in Braddell within one year of the card's expiry.\n\nThe Nets Prepaid Card can be used for transit and retail payment.\n\nPassengers have until Aug 31 to exchange older EZ-Link cards without the SimplyGo logo at SimplyGo ticket offices, ticketing service centres and ticketing machines at rail stations and bus interchanges.\n\nFrom end-March, EZ-Link adult cardholders will be reminded to change to SimplyGo when topping up their cards at ticketing machines, the LTA said.\n\nService ambassadors will be deployed at MRT, LRT stations and bus interchanges with ticketing machines to help commuters change their old cards, as well as downloading and using the SimplyGo app.\n\nThe SimplyGo app will allow users to top up the cards, receive notifications on their fares and balances, as well as block further transactions if the cards are misplaced.\n\nRefunds of the remaining value from the two older card systems can be done at SimplyGo ticket offices and ticketing service centres.\n\nAfter July, those holding Nets FlashPay cards have to approach the Nets customer service centre for their refund.\n\nLike the contactless bank cards, the SimplyGo EZ-Link and Nets Prepaid cards cannot be used for motoring-related payments.\n\nEZ-Link is holding a lucky draw to encourage commuters to exchange their older EZ-Link cards for SimplyGo-compliant ones.

There is a gag order on the identity of the girl, who is now 17.\n\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Sunil Nair said the incident happened on Dec 6, 2021.\n\nThe victim, who was supposed to have an online meeting with her school counsellor, walked to a multi-storey carpark for some privacy as there were other people at home.\n\nAt the fourth floor of the carpark, the Secondary 3 student walked past Subramaniam, 50, who was waiting to leave for work on his motorcycle.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 9, 2025, 05:45am\n\nFemale primary school teacher charged over alleged sex acts with male student, 13\n\nMore related stories\n\nAbout an hour later, the girl walked down from the fifth floor of the carpark when she fell and hit a door. Subramaniam heard the noise and helped the girl to her feet.\n\nShe thanked him and went home, while he went back to his motorcycle. She returned with a can of drink for Subramaniam as a token of gratitude.\n\nThe two of them then sat at the fourth-floor staircase of the carpark and chatted. About an hour later, Subramaniam and the girl became intimate. The girl then performed a sex act on him.\n\nSubramaniam also tried to have sex with her but failed. They later dressed up and parted ways, but not before exchanging numbers.\n\nThe court heard that they remained in contact via WhatsApp, but the messages were not of a sexual nature.\n\nOn Dec 8, 2021, two days after the incident, the victim made a police report because she felt that Subramaniam had taken advantage of her.\n\nThe DPP noted that the accused was not at any time misled by the victim's age, and added that he did not force or coerce the victim to be intimate.\n\nIn response to queries from The Straits Times, a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said Subramaniam, a first warrant officer, was suspended from all duties following his arrest.\n\n\"The SAF will initiate further actions upon the conclusion of court hearings, which may include discharging him from service,\" she added.\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nSEX OFFENCES\n\ncrime\n\nministry of defence\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 9, 2025, 06:21am\n\nMy husband arranged for 5 men to rape me.

The root was an imbalance on the right hip which leads to an imbalance on her stride.\n\n\"What I can tell you is that she was in pain, and then the pain disappeared (after seeing Dr Apostolopoulos).\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nMay 31, 2025, 10:11pm\n\nShanti Pereira makes history with 'groundbreaking' feats at Asian meet\n\nMore related stories\n\nPereira went on to break her national 200m record with a 22.57sec effort as she became the first Singaporean to reach the semi-finals of the world athletics meet, earning a Paris Olympic spot in the process.\n\nThen came the October finale in Hangzhou, where she ended Singapore's 49-year wait for an Asian Games track and field gold by claiming the women's 200m crown.\n\nDr Apostolopoulos was in Singapore to work with local athletes and conducted workshops on Jan 5 and 6 to demonstrate his techniques to the local athletics community.\n\nPereira said: \"Recovery is a really important aspect of the training and competition process - more so when preparing for a major race, so I was really glad I got Nikos' support through recommendation by Loren Seagrave before my races in Budapest, and now during the loading phase of my training cycle.\"\n\nDr Apostolopoulos' work is based on a recovery-regeneration technique that is focused on calming down the nervous system to promote relaxation.\n\nIt has been used to treat many professional athletes in the National Football League, National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association (NBA), as well as in the English Premier League.\n\nDeepanraj Ganesan\n\nshanti pereira\n\nEXERCISE/FITNESS\n\nSPORTS AND RECREATION\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nMay 29, 2025, 01:51am\n\nSingapore's Shanti Pereira wins 100m silver at the Asian Athletics Championships\n\nJul 21, 2024, 03:38am\n\nShanti Pereira's booming slingshot for maximum impact\n\nJul 12, 2024, 04:38pm\n\nShanti Pereira adds 100m to her Paris 2024 programme\n\nJul 11, 2024, 06:18am\n\nSprinter Marc Louis set for Olympics on universality place\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Camelot can be fined up to $500,000, if found guilty.\n\nFor causing a person's death by performing a rash act, an offender can be jailed for up to five years and fined.\n\nLiew and Camelot are expected back in court on Feb 15.\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nWORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncrime\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nApr 5, 2025, 12:37am\n\nMOM strengthens worker protection against extreme weather events\n\nMar 26, 2025, 06:53am\n\nWorkplace deaths in Singapore climb to 43, vehicular incidents top cause\n\nMar 4, 2025, 08:29am\n\nTraffic controller dies at work in Joo Chiat; road-roller operator arrested\n\nFeb 28, 2025, 11:54pm\n\nBangladeshi worker struck by steel beam at Tuas shipyard warehouse, dies\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

They suggest to queer people that she is one of us.\"\n\nIn 2022, Marks published a guest essay speculating over the gender identity of Harry Styles, a pop star Swift has dated, examining accusations of queer baiting against him.\n\nMarks opened her Swift column by referencing the inner turmoil of Chely Wright, a queer country musician and activist who has described staying closeted for years for both career and personal reasons.\n\nFollowing the essay's publication, Wright lambasted it as \"triggering\".\n\n\"I was mentioned in the piece, so I'll weigh in,\" Wright, 53, wrote on X, the former Twitter, on Jan 8.\n\n\"I think it was awful of @nytimes to publish. Triggering for me to read - not because the writer mentioned my nearly ending my life - but seeing a public person's sexuality being discussed is upsetting.\"\n\nSwift posted a banner 2023 as she continues her blockbuster Eras tour and catapults to an otherworldly realm of stardom.\n\nFor months, the 34-year-old has openly dated NFL player Travis Kelce, bringing new legions of viewers to football games as the camera routinely pans to Swift.\n\nHer dating life has long been fodder for tabloids, fans, and her songwriting. Swift has been linked to high-profile men including the actors Tom Hiddleston, Jake Gyllenhaal and Joe Alwyn, as well as the singers Styles, 1975 frontman Matt Healy and John Mayer.\n\nSwift herself has never publicly indicated that she identifies as queer, although speculation has persisted for years.\n\nShe has championed LGBTQ+ rights, which she discussed in a 2019 interview with Vogue: \"I didn't realise until recently that I could advocate for a community that I'm not a part of.\"\n\nAnd in the prologue to her recent re-release of her album 1989 (Taylor's Version), Swift reflected that in her 20s she \"swore off hanging out with guys\" because of media assumptions that she was sleeping with every man she spent time with.\n\n\"I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships,\" she said. \"If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn't sensationalise or sexualise that - right?\n\n\"I would learn later on that people could and people would.\"\n\nKayla Gagnet - director of digital content at Equal Pride, an umbrella brand of queer-focused media outlets including The Advocate and Out - said when it comes to celebrity news coverage, \"pointing out obvious signals is not inherently problematic\".\n\nNoticing signs of queerness, she told AFP, \"should be no different\" than media noticing Swift was dating Kelce before the pair had confirmed it.\n\nTaylor Swift cheers during the first quarter between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Kansas City Chiefs at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Dec 31, 2023. PHOTO: AFP\n\nOn the other hand, Gagnet said, the backlash to the Times essay \"is really focused on not the reading of queerness into her work, which I think is totally valid, but more on ignoring or being dismissive of what she herself has said about it\".\n\nFollowers of pop culture will always be interested in who celebrities are dating, she continued. \"It's fair game to sort of be interested in what that might mean about their sexuality.\"\n\nBut at Equal Pride outlets, Gagnet said they \"believe people when they tell us who they are\".\n\nShe added: \"And that is true for queer people and straight people and everybody in between.\" - AFP\n\ntaylor swift\n\nCelebrities\n\nMusic\n\nLGBT+\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nAug 14, 2024, 03:33pm\n\nTaylor Swift set for emotional London return after terror threat\n\nAug 8, 2024, 12:37am\n\nTaylor Swift's Vienna concerts cancelled, 'tragedy averted'\n\nJul 24, 2024, 12:45pm\n\nWill Taylor Swift endorse US presidential candidate Kamala Harris?\n\nJun 24, 2024, 06:12am\n\nSwift puts Kelce on stage at Eras Tour London concert\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

It will be debated in Parliament on Jan 9.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nApr 13, 2025, 02:09am\n\nUp to 2,400 MacPherson households to get $45 worth of hawker centre meal vouchers\n\nMore related stories\n\n\"We may not be able to totally stamp out such risk or threats because they're like cockroaches; they somehow just keep evolving. But if we can do more, and everyone (is) willing to take on a larger share of the responsibility, we probably can protect more people, and reduce the harms or the damage to the ordinary citizen,\" said Ms Tin told ST on Jan 8.\n\nThe other MPs who filed the motion are Ms Jessica Tan (East Coast GRC), Mr Sharael Taha (Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC) and Mr Alex Yam and Ms Hany Soh (Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC). They are also part of the GPC.\n\nMs Tin noted that while Singapore continues its journey to digitalise, she and her fellow MPs have observed challenges, including scams, that undermine the public's confidence and trust towards digital transactions.\n\nAside from the resident who fell victim to the fake endorsement using Mr Tharman's name, Ms Tin recounted how she was notified about a man pretending to be her brother on Telegram to get people to invest in a fraudulent scheme. She filed a police report, and the account and group were shut down.\n\nMs Tin said the MPs have made 13 calls to action, which she will reveal during the debate.\n\nShedding some light on what this entails, she said: \"We are trying to push the Government to do more... to lead in some of the areas, in terms of getting corporations and private entities to share more information, for example, to be more transparent with their products and offerings, so that we can be more prepared for some of the risks of scams (or) malware.\"\n\nMs Tin added that these corporations should also pull their weight and take on a more equitable share of the responsibility in terms of detection, deterrence and protection.\n\nShe urged members of the public to work together to promote greater awareness, and educate and empower vulnerable segments of the population, so that they will not be disadvantaged as Singapore progresses digitally.\n\nZhaki Abdullah\n\nand\n\nJean Iau\n\ntin pei ling\n\nINTERNET CRIMES AND SCAMS\n\nSCAMS\n\nCOMMUNITY ISSUES\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nDec 15, 2024, 10:57pm\n\nKKH seeing more children with moderate and severe eczema\n\nJun 24, 2024, 05:57am\n\nTenants to pay landlord for damages in Paya Lebar fire\n\nAug 18, 2023, 02:34am\n\nMP Tin Pei Ling leaving Grab after 7 months for fintech firm\n\nFeb 10, 2023, 08:01am\n\nMP Tin Pei Ling moves to corporate development role at Grab Singapore following outcry\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/48faf00ed614c30a4ffde8de76be664485161ddb22ae1ecdf1815967152ece10/20240107104452174gin2569.jpg.JPEG?w=965", "alt_text": "A motion on building a safe digital society will be debated in Parliament on Jan 9.", "caption": "A motion on building a safe digital society will be debated in Parliament on Jan 9.

He doesn't have that privilege.\"\n\nThe lawyer was also asked about Mr Anwar's statements in the documentary, which Mr Muhammad Shafee described as \"unpleasant\".\n\n\"There were statements that were unpleasant because there is no proof and the case is still ongoing,\" he said.\n\nThe trial also saw a heated exchange of words between the prosecution and the defence over a statement by the 49th prosecution witness, Ms Nur Aida Arifin, who resumed her testimony by reading her 95-page witness statement.\n\nHer testimony, however, was halted when Mr Muhammad Shafee stood up to object several times.\n\nHe argued that the witness, a Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) senior officer, had \"drawn her own conclusions\" in the case.\n\nDeputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib responded that Ms Nur Aida's testimony was merely based on the findings of her investigation as she was the investigating officer in the 1MDB probe. Mr Muhammad Shafee, however, still got on his feet to object numerous times.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Collin Lawrence Sequerah interjected and said the proceedings could not continue in such a manner.\n\n\"Either we continue on this path, which will take forever, or I adjourn the trial, and both parties come up with a statement they can live with... we cannot go on like this,\" he said.\n\nThe proceedings were then adjourned for parties to meet the judge in chambers.\n\nNajib, 70, is on trial for 25 charges, four for abuse of power that allegedly brought him the financial benefit to the tune of RM2.28 billion ($650 million) and 21 for money laundering involving the same amount of money. - THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK\n\nmalaysia\n\nPOLITICIANS\n\ncorruption\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 26, 2025, 11:43pm\n\n3 S'poreans charged in Malaysia over cocaine-laced vape liquid, face possible death penalty\n\nJun 24, 2025, 01:02am\n\n1 Singaporean, 17 Malaysians among 24 people evacuated from Iran to Kuala Lumpur\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\n'Singapore has always been special': Malaysia's Siti Nurhaliza to debut new song at concert here\n\nJun 19, 2025, 05:48am\n\nJohor looking to raise levy on property purchases by foreigners\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

They first combined for a win with Lim's Knight on Jan 15, 2023.\n\nST PHOTO: SYAMIL SAPARI\n\nThis article is more than 12 months old\n\nJan 8, 2024, 02:15pm\n\nAnother Lim's find reaches the top\n\nLim's Bighorn is not as smart as stable star Lim's Kosciuszko, but neither is he 'dumb'\n\nShare this article\n\nLim's Bighorn's all-the-way win on Jan 6 gave trainer Daniel Meagher every reason to be happy with his first day at the office in 2024.\n\nNot only did the Australian lead in a second winner, after September scored earlier, but Lim's Bighorn was also among a batch of 14 horses his biggest supporter, Lim's Stable, bought at the end of 2022.\n\nMeagher's smile for the latter reason was a little bittersweet, though.\n\nThe Lim's Stable unleashed the purse strings at a time when the industry needed to bounce back from the shackles of Covid-19 between 2020 and 2022.\n\nOther owners also travelled to sales again, bolstered by the signs of a second lease of life.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nLim's even named their 14 new purchases after mountains around the world, inspired by the meteoric rise of their superstar, Lim's Kosciuszko.\n\nTo establish a link between a naming pattern and the next champion may sound a touch naive, but it was mostly in the name of fun.\n\nSadly, fun has given way to gloom. That light at the end of the tunnel is shortlived. It would burn out by Oct 5, the date of Singapore racing's impending demise.\n\nMeanwhile, it is still business as usual for the remaining 18 trainers, including Meagher.\n\nHaving seen all of the 14 Lim's newcomers race bar one, Lim's Diablo, it would be safe to assume the next Lim's Kosciuszko will not emerge in the next 10 months, even if Lim's Saltoro has already been anointed as a possible heir apparent by some.\n\nThe son of Shamexpress - hence the choice of Asian peak Saltoro to follow the same first alphabet of the sire as per the Lim's horses' naming convention - is undefeated in three starts, but still has all to prove at a higher level.\n\nAmong the others from that shopping spree to have shown ability, Lim's Puncak Jaya is honest and Lim's Fuji has won once in maiden company.\n\nLim's Bighorn has also opened the score in an Open Maiden race, but Meagher seems to have more time for the Better Than Ready three-year-old - even if his initial assessment was not too flattering.\n\n\"He was a dumb horse when he first came to us. He's such a slow learner,\" he said.\n\n\"He's learned a lot. He's picked up a lot in the last three months.\n\n\"We've been very patient with Mr Lim Siah Mong's young horses, and it's good to see they are starting to hit their straps.\"\n\nThough Lim did say he would continue to race horses in Australia and Hong Kong post-Oct 5, he is not jumping ship yet.\n\n\"Mr Lim and all my owners told me to continue training for them till the end,\" said Meagher. \"After that, nobody really knows what will happen.\"\n\nFor now, Meagher, a young father of three - whose well-known Victorian racing family trains from Brisbane these days - is keeping his eyes on the road.\n\n\"I really liked today's wins by Lim's Bighorn and September. It's a great start,\" said Meagher.\n\n\"I also liked how the moment TH (Teck Huat) Koh moved on Lim's Bighorn, he just took off. It was a peach of a ride.\"\n\nMeagher shared only one win with Koh before, Lim's Knight on Jan 15, 2023, but is keen to improve that score.\n\n\"I'd like to support TH more often. I did that late last year with four rides,\" said Meagher.\n\n\"I'll still use Marc Lerner, Benny Woodworth where I can, but it's good to have one more option.\"\n\nMeagher said he was impressed with the way the Singaporean lightweight jockey followed his instructions to a tee.\n\nHe let the gelding glide across the face of the field from his outermost alley (12) to find the rail.\n\nFrom that point, Koh just had to save enough petrol for the last 300m. Lim's Bighorn - named after mountains in Wyoming - did the same on debut, but was softened up by Stop The Water on his outside. He faded to third inside the last 200m.\n\nEnjoying a cosier lead this time, albeit he was used to come across, Lim's Bighorn ($12) not only put up a stiffer fight, but also pulled away to beat Starboy (Manoel Nunes) by just under four lengths.\n\n\"I didn't know the horse. I just followed the instructions,\" said Koh.\n\n\"Dan told me that if he can go forward, he should win.\n\n\"He's still learning. Today's run will teach him more about racing.\"\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

So, I gave him a spell to freshen him up,\" he said.\n\n\"He trialled good, he was okay, even if he's not as good as before. But he did win. That's what matters.\n\n\"There is not much racing for him, we'll see how he pulls up. The key to him is to space his runs.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:22pm\n\nGroup 1 box ticked for Ong, third title next\n\nMore related stories\n\nLord's Command certainly began his Singapore campaign on the right foot with a two-from-two, three weeks apart in the months of August and September, 2023.\n\nBut he tasted his first defeat when backed up within a fortnight of his second consecutive win.\n\nThe short-priced favourite looked home and hosed when he came off his box seat to sweep past the wilting Darc Bounty, but staggered late before getting rolled by the fast-finishing Renzo.\n\nIn hindsight, Lim and Manoel Nunes felt they may have erred in rushing him back to the races.\n\nA six-week layoff ensued, but the Class 3 race (1,200m) proved inconclusive as he copped a check to finish out of the placings for the first time.\n\nTo give himself no room for any doubt this time, Lim stretched the wait to two months before pushing the reset button.\n\nThe $70,000 Class 3 race (1,100m) on Jan 6 came up at the perfect interval.\n\nBut it was the physical space itself that was actually in short supply for the speedy gelding during the early sectionals of his first 2024 outing.\n\nFor a horse who usually races in the first few, he looked in a spot of bother when caught four wide without much room to tuck in for the first 300m.\n\nBut once the early speed sorted itself out, Nunes, who was aboard at Lord's Command's first two wins, was able to drop him in behind Win Win (Amirul Ismadi) and Bransom (Matthew Kellady).\n\nFinding that window to catch his breath proved to be the winning move.\n\nInto the straight, the $14 favourite easily levelled up with the two leaders before going full bore towards the winning post.\n\nHis nemesis from two runs back, Renzo (Vlad Duric), came with a wet sail on the outside at the 200m, but hit a brickwall late. The Argentinian-bred lunged but missed out by a neck from Lord's Command.\n\nReignite (Jamil Sarwi) finished third, another 3/4 lengths away.\n\nThe feedback of keeping plenty of gaps between runs actually came from the person in the irons.\n\n\"He's a late-maturing sort. He's not fully mature yet. I told Richard and (assistant trainer) Joe (D'Zulkifliy) not to run him too often,\" said Nunes.\n\n\"He was fitter today and I was happy where he was behind the speed. He was in a lovely spot and was relaxed throughout. He was still looking around in the straight, he's still green.\n\n\"But, as long as we keep him fresh, he should be able to win more races here.\"\n\nThe Brazilian ace, for one, knows how to do just that. He won the most races at Kranji for the fifth time in 2023, spacing his rivals from a long way out.\n\nA four-timer on the first day of the 2024 season could not have been a better way to kickstart his title defence.\n\nWith half of the haul coming for Lim, as well as providing the Penang-born Singaporean trainer with a first feature success, courtesy of Super Salute in the $110,000 Group 3 New Year Cup (1,200m), the Lim-Nunes duo may well be the team to watch in 2024.\n\nSuper Salute also capped Lim's red-letter day with a training treble. The first leg, The Shadow (Marc Lerner, $25) was the inaugural 2024 winner in the opener.\n\nmanyan@sph.com.sg\n\nMichael Lee\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01pm\n\nRace cards for July 15 & 16\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:53pm\n\nBig Union has first Malaysian win in sight\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:45pm\n\nJuly 16 Hong Kong (Happy Valley) form analysis\n\nJul 15, 2025, 02:42pm\n\nJuly 16 South Africa (Greyville) form analysis\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The acquaintance, who received multiple letters informing him that he had outstanding hospital bills, notified the police.\n\nLogeswaran had similarly impersonated his brother on nine occasions at the National University Hospital (NUH) between May 1, 2018, and Sept 16, 2019, and incurred bills totalling $945.35.\n\nThis included a $430 bill for an MRI scan on Sept 6, 2019.\n\nAfter receiving bills from NUH, Logeswaran's brother made a police report on Feb 10, 2020.\n\nLogeswaran's lawyer Danny Nah said in mitigation that his client suffered a slip disc following a holiday in India and required Tramadol to relieve his regular back pains.\n\nMr Nah said the primary motivation around Logeswaran's offences involving the hospitals was to seek relief for the pain and not capital gains. He added that his client had various other health problems including heart disease and diabetes.\n\nDistrict Judge Lim Tse Haw said while a fine may appear sufficient, given the amount in each charge involving cheating the hospitals was small, the totality of Logeswaran's conduct justified a jail term.\n\nThe judge also said the various hospitals and polyclinics that Logeswaran had targeted accepted him in good faith and noted that if they were to tighten their procedures following the offences, it would create a lot of inconvenience for genuine patients.\n\nFor each charge of cheating by personation, Logeswaran could have been jailed for up to five years and fined.\n\nSamuel Devaraj\n\nCOURT & CRIME\n\ncheating\n\nShare this article\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Mainly he must have a fondness for Sun Wukong, a certain level of acting talent, and a lively, cheerful and friendly disposition to interact with tourists,\" a manager at the site told Shangyou News.\n\nSun Wukong - the protagonist of Chinese classic novel Journey To The West - is said to have been trapped in the rocks of the Wuzhishan mountains by gods who scorned his childish bluster.

Because I'm black. I love my nose. What are you concerned about my nose for?\"\n\nDDG also denied they were expecting a child when a fan asked him on Snapchat on Dec 31 if he had a daughter. The rapper asked the person to \"mind his own business\".\n\nBailey covered up any signs of a baby bump with a voluminous full-length gown when she walked the red carpet at The Color Purple premiere on Dec 6.\n\nBailey and DDG have been dating for more than a year.

Muis did not send any pilgrims for the haj in 2020 and 2021 because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIn 2023, it introduced the MyHajSG portal, which did away with the need for prospective pilgrims to register in person.\n\nInstead, the online registration system uses Singpass, in a bid for greater convenience.\n\nWhile the process has been made easier, the cost of performing the haj - one of the five pillars of Islam - is expected to increase.\n\nIn 2023, Muslim pilgrims had to pay $1,500 more, on average, compared with the last five years.\n\nThe average package price per person was about $14,150, excluding emergency medical assistance and airfare. The cheapest package was about $8,490.\n\nAt the same time, the application fee for the haj increased from $240 pre-pandemic to $285 in 2024.\n\nThis will remain the case until the end of 2025, before the fee is further increased to $330 from 2026.

And workshops are regularly organised to help supervisors better identify and address mental health issues within their teams.\n\nMr Wong said: \"All these initiatives are founded on the recognition that secondary trauma and vicarious trauma affect the legal profession, and each organisation at various levels, in different ways.\"\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nFeb 17, 2025, 02:00pm\n\nAGC warns public against 'contempt of court' after WP chief Pritam Singh's conviction\n\nMore related stories\n\nHe noted that a number of the initiatives are targeted at the prosecutors in the AGC's crime division, because they are the legal service officers who are most exposed to the trauma of victims, and to the mental health and social issues faced by accused persons.\n\nHe said these officers may have to examine traumatic material for the purposes of the criminal process, or get a victim or an accused person to provide details of trauma.\n\nMr Wong recalled hearing a prosecutor say she would never forget the cries of children from the videos that she reviewed in a case of sexual abuse.\n\nHe added: \"It is therefore important that we support our prosecutors' mental well-being, by de-stigmatising mental health issues and encouraging the seeking of help for such issues.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, Ms Lisa Sam, the newly elected president of the Law Society of Singapore, said the society is committed to safeguarding its members' mental and social well-being, particularly that of its younger members.\n\nShe noted that lawyers and judges work long hours, often extending into weekends, public holidays, and overseas family holidays.\n\nMs Sam cited how applications filed by lawyers at 7.30pm are approved by judges at 9.30pm that night.\n\nShe said: \"These round-the-clock working hours come at a cost, often disrupting the balance and harmony between our other commitments as parents, children to ageing parents, siblings or family members to other family members in need, and as volunteers.\"\n\nShe said the Law Society plans to release a guidance note to help lawyers maintain a sustainable legal practice while adhering to legal and ethical obligations owed to the court.\n\nThe society has other existing support schemes for its members, including a helpline for those facing issues at work, and counselling administered in conjunction with a third-party service provider.\n\nSelina Lum\n\nSenior Law Correspondent\n\nATTORNEY-GENERAL\n\nLEGAL SERVICES SECTOR\n\nMental Health\n\nLAWYERS\n\nSINGAPORE LAWYERS\n\nSINGAPORE LAW\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nOct 19, 2024, 11:45pm\n\nAGC considering further action against academic Donald Low\n\nOct 25, 2023, 09:19am\n\nAGC says letter bearing its logo and asking recipient to pay fee 'for justice' is fake\n\nJul 19, 2022, 01:24pm\n\nFootball match held in honour of late prosecutor who fought against match-fixing\n\nJun 15, 2022, 02:14pm\n\nVeteran prosecutor G.

Ms Huang said it was too devastating for her and her two daughters to see him go, so they waited outside the ward.\n\n\"The doctors said he passed away peacefully,\" she said.\n\nMs Huang added that her daughters, aged four and seven, were kept in the dark about what happened to their father. She was worried that they would be afraid and only let them see him through video calls.\n\nShe said: \"It might be better for them not to understand what happened. Then they wouldn't have to go through the sorrow.\"\n\nThe stoic wife said she was heartbroken, but had to stay strong for her daughters.\n\nMs Huang also wanted to thank everyone who had answered the family's plea.\n\n\"I'm very grateful for everyone's help,\" she said. \"I'm really, very grateful.\"\n\nliver failure\n\nDeath\n\nliver donor\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nIKEA Singapore\n\nPlan your dream home affordably with IKEA Home Design service​\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/69aec2884aaf684e4bbac37150c295579a6f445ff6d3efda3a07f8cd21a35923/imgonline-com-ua-collage-3pvnocnmnoppx.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "Mr Desmond Lee’s condition deteriorated and his family made the difficult decision to take him off life support.", "caption": "Mr Desmond Lee’s condition deteriorated and his family made the difficult decision to take him off life support.

Thangah would even accompany Fatimah to her Quran-reading class.\n\nIt was only when she was 12 years old did Ms Koh, who was raised by an Indian-Hindu couple, found out that she was of Chinese descent. She had taken her birth certificate to school to have her identity card (IC) made.\n\nMs Fatimah, who was a year Ms Koh's junior, was adopted by a Malay-Muslim family.\n\n\"I did wonder why Thangah was fair-skinned, unlike her adoptive family, but I never bothered to ask,\" said Ms Fatimah, now 70.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 16, 2025, 08:55am\n\nDad's emotional support after her mum's death helps taekwondo champ fly high\n\nMore related stories\n\nMs Koh told Malay Sunday newspaper Berita Minggu that their biological mother was advised by a fortune teller that Ms Koh would bring misfortune to the family, so she should be given away to a non-Chinese family.\n\n\"Fatimah was born with her big toe smaller than her other toes, which was deemed a bad sign, so she, too, was given away,\" said Ms Koh, who asked her adoptive parents about her biological parents only years later, when she had to renew her IC.\n\nShe looked up her biological family and found out she had many siblings, including Fatimah. The family had moved out of the Aljunied village as their mother could not bear the daily reminder that she had given away her daughters.\n\nThe practice of Malay or Indian families adopting Chinese babies in Singapore started in the early-1930s. Factors leading to the adoptions included financial situations, death of the mother or the old wives' tale that the baby would bring bad luck.\n\nThe differences in ethnicity, language and religion were not an issue back then, family and gender anthropologist Theresa W. Devasahayam told Berita Minggu.\n\n\"Children were given away arbitrarily, undocumented, but the family taking them in would give them love and a good life. There were even families that adopted other children to become companions for their own children,\" said Dr Devasahayam, whose own mother was given away by a Chinese family.\n\nAdoption in Singapore was regulated only in 1972, under the Adoption of Children Act.\n\nThe story of Ms Koh and Ms Fatimah, as well as other similar stories of adoption in olden Singapore, have been compiled by Dr Devasahayam in her book Little Drops: Cherished Children Of Singapore's Past ($29.30 on Amazon).\n\nFAMILIES\n\nAdoption\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:22am\n\nHe quit his career to care for his son who has muscular dystrophy\n\nJun 15, 2025, 12:21am\n\nCancer survivor, 69, is full-time caregiver to 14-year-old son with special needs\n\nMay 31, 2025, 09:58pm\n\nMSF will keep building on collaborative approach in supporting families\n\nMay 11, 2025, 01:26am\n\nMothers open up about postnatal depression on new podcast\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Robert Oppenheimer, hailed his \"visionary director\", while Downey Jr, portraying the protagonist's bitter rival, praised the movie as a \"masterpiece.\"\n\nIn winning best director, Nolan fended off Greta Gerwig, who helmed Barbie - the other half of the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon that grossed a combined US$2.4 billion ($3.2 billion) last year at the box office.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 6, 2025, 01:08pm\n\nS'porean actor Sunny Pang on filming Netflix's Havoc: 'They rehearse until everything is on point'\n\n3\n\n0\n\nMore related stories\n\nTurning nostalgia for the beloved doll into a sharp satire about misogyny and female empowerment, Barbie was the leading film heading into the night with nine nominations, but ended the gala with just two prizes.\n\nIt won the award for best song, for a tune written by Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas. And as the year's highest grossing movie, it claimed a newly created trophy for box office achievement.\n\n\"We would like to dedicate this to every single person on the planet who dressed up and went to the greatest place on Earth, the movie theatres,\" said Margot Robbie, the film's star and producer.\n\n\"Thank you to all the Barbies and Kens in front of and behind the screen,\" added Gerwig.\n\nBut Barbie surprisingly lost out on best comedy to Poor Things - a surreal, sexy bildungsroman which also earned Emma Stone best actress for her no-holds-barred turn as Bella Baxter.\n\n\"Bella falls in love with life itself, rather than a person.

Between February 2017 and June 2018, he had duped nearly 40 of his athletes of more than $100,000, selling them false tour packages for overseas marathon trips or non-existent Garmin watches.\n\nNow, the 51-year-old is back in the spotlight again, with his alleged victims claiming to have been cheated of over $32,000. The police confirmed on Jan 4 that two reports have been made and that investigations are ongoing.\n\nIn one case, a sales manager who only wanted to be known as Andrew reportedly invested $20,000 in Tan's sports shoe business, with the former stating that the contract stipulated that he would receive a payout of 15 per cent of that sum every six months.\n\nBut Andrew, who had previously purchased shoes from Tan, did not receive any invoice or updates after transferring the amount to him in September 2022.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 14, 2025, 06:24am\n\nMan charged for collecting $150k in cash, jewellery for scammers\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe 42-year-old did not get his payout of $3,000 in March 2023, and in mid-2023 requested for the return of his full investment from Tan, who requested for a one-month extension. But Tan stopped replying to messages thereafter, prompting Andrew to file a police report in August.\n\nAndrew said: \"I was trying to get more healthy (during the pandemic) and I joined the community - we went for runs and I started to know more people. But because of this incident... it has taken the fun out of the run.\"\n\nA\n\nrenovation contractor, who only wanted to be identified by his surname Yeo, said he invested $12,500 in a Singapore International Bikini Run that Tan was supposedly organising.\n\nThe event started in Pattaya a few years ago and Tan claimed that he had obtained the franchise for it to be held at Sentosa on April 23, 2023.\n\nYeo, 53, transferred the money to him in November 2022 and their contract stated that the money would be returned to him in May 2023.\n\nBut as the date of the event approached, Yeo asked Tan for updates but the latter tried to delay their meeting, saying that he was sick and there were not enough investors and funds.\n\nThey finally met two days before the run was supposed to happen, with Tan telling Yeo he was looking to move the event to East Coast Park as there were not enough investors and Sentosa was too expensive.\n\nYeo requested for his money to be returned, but after several delays and failed attempts to contact Tan, he made a police report in December.\n\nHe said: \"We hope that he learns a lesson and stops targeting other people. For some, it may seem like an insignificant amount but for someone else, it can be a matter of life and death.\n\n\"Moving forward I hope no one else is affected… As a coach, you're supposed to be someone who walks the talk and acts as a mentor to many, and yet you are doing all the ugly things which I don't think is correct.\"\n\nAnother alleged victim, a secretary who only wanted to be known as Ng, told The Straits Times that she knew of Tan's past but wanted to give him a chance.\n\nThe 43-year-old, who joined Tan's running club in 2021, previously bought three pairs of running shoes from the group but dealt with a different person - her orders were fulfilled then.\n\nIn October 2022, she ordered a pair of Xtep running shoes and paid Tan $229.\n\nBut this time, the shoes never arrived. After six months of waiting, she contacted Tan, who said he would give her a refund. He did not and stopped responding to messages after that.\n\nAnother runner Oh Yu Song, 36, ordered a pair of Nike Vaporfly shoes for $279 from Tan in April 2023 but the shoes were not delivered.\n\nAfter several delays, Tan told Oh, who works in the science industry, that the shoe size was not available and he would issue a full refund, which only came in August 2023.\n\nKimberly Kwek\n\nSCAMS\n\nSPORTS AND RECREATION\n\nMARATHONS\n\nathletics\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:21am\n\nPolice probe 536 over scams, unlicensed moneylending\n\nJul 12, 2025, 04:11am\n\nMore NSFs may be deployed to fight scams online, say police\n\nJul 10, 2025, 07:48am\n\nMan charged over $80,000 money mule activities\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

The workers were obstructed by two plywood panels while working, and one fell from a height of about 6m while removing one of the panels. The worker was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and died of his injuries on the same day.\n\nMOM said Ding had told the workers to carry out work at a location without ensuring that a concealed floor opening there did not pose any danger to the workers, despite being aware of the opening.\n\nThree other people were earlier fined for this workplace accident.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJul 15, 2025, 07:51am\n\n$10 million Toto results to be announced on July 17\n\n1\n\nMore related stories\n\nSeparately, Cheok was the director for excavator rental business Synergy-Biz, which also transports the machines to and from its clients' premises.\n\nOn Aug 25, 2022, Tan Tiong Chee was tasked with transporting a forklift out of a worksite via a lorry, even though he was not a trained forklift operator. After reversing the forklift up the lorry, he went to its front to secure it, but the forklift rolled forward and ran over him.\n\nHe was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, and died of his injuries on the same day.\n\nMOM's investigations showed Synergy-Biz had failed to ensure a risk assessment was conducted for the loading and unloading of machinery onto a lorry, or that there were safe work procedures to mitigate the risk of this action. The ministry added that the company had failed to ensure workers were trained properly to do the required work.\n\n\"Both cases reflect a blatant lack of workplace safety and health ownership, resulting in the tragic deaths of workers. Everyone must play their part to ensure that our workplaces are safe, for workers and businesses to thrive,\" MOM said.\n\nThe ministry added that employers must implement effective measures to ensure worker safety. They can learn more about programmes to strengthen safety practices at\n\ngo.gov.sg/wshprogrammes\n\nWorkers must observe safe work procedures and report any unsafe work activities via\n\nSnapSAFE\n\n.\n\nThe ministry added: \"MOM takes a serious view of errant employers and workers who put the lives of others at risk, and will not hesitate to prosecute those responsible for the wrongdoing.\"\n\nHelmy Sa'at\n\nSingapore\n\nMinistry of Manpower\n\nWORKPLACE SAFETY AND HEALTH\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 15, 2025, 03:01am\n\nPassers-by scramble over Jurong West egg spill\n\n12\n\nJul 14, 2025, 08:28am\n\n'It's almost revolting': Singapore's durian craze is not for all\n\n5\n\nJul 13, 2025, 08:39am\n\nTwenty dishes and drinks which have shaped Singaporeans' taste buds\n\n1\n\nJul 13, 2025, 07:14am\n\nWoman receives funeral wreaths from loan shark after identity stolen\n\n4\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\nYahoo!

Glitter particles were also strewn over the floor and bed in one of the rooms.\n\nSuch was the state of a four-bedroom condominium unit in Ang Mo Kio when the landlord made a visit recently.\n\nWhat's worse, the tenants had \"disappeared\" without having paid three months' worth of rent, reported\n\nShin Min Daily News\n\n.\n\nThe landlord, Ms Wang, said the apartment was in good condition before she leased it to a Spanish expat couple and their young daughter.\n\nThe 47-year-old music teacher sensed nothing amiss with the couple as they had stable jobs and valid employment passes until 2025. The tenant worked with a multinational company, his wife was a Spanish teacher at an international school and their  daughter studied at a school here.\n\nRelated\n\nStory\n\nJun 16, 2025, 02:28am\n\nStone thrown down Telok Blangah condo narrowly misses pickleball player\n\nMore related stories\n\nThe couple signed a two-year lease with a monthly rent of $3,900 in August last year and moved in a month later. The transaction was completed with the help of a property agent named Ms Ma.\n\nBut soon after the one-month deposit was made and the contract was signed, the tenant started acting up.\n\nMs Wang claimed the man told her former tenants, who were still staying in the apartment at the time, to vacate promptly. He also asked for a new fridge, which she gave him.\n\nShe told the Chinese evening daily that she considered withdrawing the lease but chose not to as she believed cultural differences were to blame for the tenant's behaviour.\n\nMonths later, after learning from a neighbour that her tenants had not been seen for a while, she decided to pay a visit to the apartment and discovered the mess they left behind. She also claimed that the tenant had not paid rent in three months.\n\nShe contacted Ms Ma, who found out that the tenant's work pass had expired in September 2023, before the family moved in, and that they had to leave Singapore in October.\n\nMs Ma, 57, then sent several WhatsApp messages to the tenant's Spanish number, but he chose to ignore them. However, she said she received a missed call from him when she was asleep. Other than that, she has been unable to contact him.\n\nMs Wang lamented the incident, saying it was the first time in many years of leasing the property that it has happened to her. She said she plans to report the matter to the police.\n\nShe said: \"Hopes of getting back the money owed are slim, but I hope my situation can serve as a warning to other landlords.\"\n\ncondominium\n\nrental\n\ntenant\n\nShare this article\n\nRelated\n\nStories\n\nJul 3, 2024, 02:12am\n\nTempers flare as guards try to stop car from leaving condo\n\nJan 4, 2024, 09:24am\n\nNotice comparing condo to HDB 'in poor taste'\n\nDec 18, 2023, 03:40am\n\nThree people taken to hospital after bee attack at East Coast condo\n\nSep 6, 2023, 10:27am\n\nCondo resident punched, hurled chair at security guard after he confiscated laser pointers\n\nTop Stories This Week\n\nJul 14, 2025, 12:49am\n\nRetiree discovers that half of his $800 printed SG60 vouchers are invalid\n\nJul 13, 2025, 04:17am\n\nMan clashes with McDonald's store manager over 48-min order\n\nJul 14, 2025, 09:45am\n\nCustomer cries foul over $24 chicken rice at Yishun stall\n\nJul 9, 2025, 01:24am\n\nCyclist's demand for right of way in crowded MBS draws netizens' ire\n\nJul 8, 2025, 04:17am\n\nNetizens call Star Awards 2025 a 'trainwreck' despite star-studded night\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nAd\n\ntopicvoyager\n\nInvestor Options Most Don’t Consider\n\nAd is Hidden\n\nPlease tell us why you hid this ad?\n\nInappropriate\n\nMisleading\n\nMisinformation\n\nRepetitive\n\nIrrelevant\n\nDistracting", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/thenewpaper/a952a285a892669588801f47b79c64bb7ad3d0a1b880bcdbcdd1dcd5093a0e78/new_project_-_2024-01-07t112252.369_1.jpg?w=965", "alt_text": "The landlord was shocked when she visited the condominium unit and found the mouldy sofa and a hole in the washbasin.", "caption": "The landlord was shocked when she visited the condominium unit and found the mouldy sofa and a hole in the washbasin.
