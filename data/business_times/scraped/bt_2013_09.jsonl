Individuals sold a net 3.1 trillion won of shares last month, the most in nine months, while trading of Kospi index stocks fell to a six-year low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe retreat by those investors, who accounted for about 45 per cent of the nation's equity trading last month, threatens to limit gains in the Kospi, which has rallied 8 per cent since the end of June, according to Barclays plc and Hanwha Investment & Securities Co. Consumer confidence sank to a five-month low last month, even after a rebound in exports fuelled the fastest economic growth in two years last quarter.\n\n\"Local participation is quite low,\" Chanik Park, the Seoul-based head of Korea equity research at Barclays, said last Tuesday. \"Consumer sentiment and investor sentiment at this moment is not that positive.\"\n\nThe Kospi has climbed 4.4 per cent last month to 2,011.80, bringing its gain this year to 0.7 per cent. The won strengthened 3.4 per cent to 1,073.65 last month, while the cost of protecting the nation's sovereign debt against non-payment using credit default swaps fell 10 basis points to 76, according to CMA. The yield on the nation's five-year government bonds fell five basis points to 3.06 per cent last week.\n\nForeign investors have fuelled the Kospi's rally as data showed the economy expanded 1.1 per cent in the three months through June and exports jumped at a quicker-than-estimated 7.7 per cent rate in August.\n\nInternational money managers ploughed a net US$7 billion into South Korean shares last month, the most on record, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. The Kospi is valued at 1.06 times net assets, a 47 per cent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index.\n\n\"Local retail investors are likely to return to the equity market by the end of this year when the economic uncertainties are cleared and this year's corporate profit figures are released,\" Cho Seong Joon, a Seoul-based strategist at NH Investment & Securities Co, said last Friday.\n\nFor now, sales by individual investors are accelerating. Outflows last month were more than twice as large as the 1.4 trillion won of withdrawals during the first eight months of the year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 100-day average value traded of Kospi shares declined to 4.03 trillion won last Friday, the lowest level since June 2007.\n\n\"Individual investors will be the group that could drive up trading volumes but this won't be easy,\" Kang Hyun Cheol, a strategist at Woori Investment & Securities Co, said in Seoul last Wednesday.\n\nIndividuals have low confidence and are also reluctant to buy as Kospi has struggled to pass a resistance level at 2,050, Mr Kang said. The benchmark gauge has approached that level at least six times during the past two years before resuming declines, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nFinance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said last Wednesday that household spending is weak due to high levels of debt. Consumer confidence fell to the lowest level since April this month, according to the Bank of Korea. Home loans and credit extended to households increased 1.8 per cent in the second quarter to a record 980 trillion won, the monetary authority said on Aug 22.\n\nLee Won Tae plans to start selling his 40 million won of equity investments to repay debt before interest rates rise. The 42-year-old senior manager at CJ Systems Co, an information technology service provider, took out a 200 million won mortgage four years ago to buy a three-room apartment in Mokdong, an eastern Seoul neighbourhood known for its cram schools.\n\nSouth Korea's central bank, which kept its benchmark interest rate at 2.5 per cent for a fourth straight month on Sept 12, will probably increase it to 3 per cent by the end of 2014, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n\"I'm eyeing a good time to exit,\" said Mr Lee, who earns about 100 million won a year and has two elementary school children. \"I can barely support my family as I want my wife to take care of kids at home. Our budget will become much tighter as the kids grow.\"\n\nYounger professionals are also exiting the stock market as rental costs rise. Kookmin Bank's index of lump-sum deposits used to pay rent in in Seoul, known as Jeonse, climbed to a record 102.5 in August, the highest level since the lender began tracking the data in 1986.\n\nThe average Jeonse rent for Seoul apartments has increased for 12 straight months to 280 million won as at August, according to the Korea Appraisal Board. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

Traditional banks are now playing the role of arrangers.\"\n\nFrench banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Natixis and other European lenders said last year they would cut exposure to risky and dollar-denominated assets such as shipping and aircraft financing to meet tougher capital rules and shore up reserves.\n\nThey have given way to Asian banks such as Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, South Korean and Chinese banks, as well as Middle Eastern lenders such as National Bank of Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\n\"We see South-east Asian banks developing expertise and there's lot of interest from Japan and South Korea gaining an interest in the sector,\" said Mr Collet. \"They clearly want to grow outside of their region.\"\n\nAsian giants such as Singapore Airlines, AirAsia, All Nippon Airways and Lion Air are among companies that have ordered planes worth billion of dollars to support growing passenger numbers.\n\nAirbus has recently raised its 20-year jet demand forecast, saying the world needed to double its fleet to meet demand. The planemaker says Middle East plane orders account for 8 per cent of its total backlog as at end-August.\n\nEmirates, which has the world's largest fleet of the A380 superjumbos, used a mixed bag of funding including bonds, operating leases, US export credit facilities and financing leases to raise US$5.5 billion in the current financial year.\n\n\"The challenge for airlines would be to diversify funding sources as growth comes back to the aviation industry,\" said Mr Collet.\n\nCapital markets will also have a bigger role to play in aircraft financing - it will account for about 14 per cent of total jet financing in 2013, up from 10 per cent last year, Boeing said in an annual forecast in December.\n\nPension funds and insurance companies, which have traditionally stayed clear of aircraft finance, are also looking at the sector, attracted by reasonable stability and the long-term nature of the financing, said Mr Collet. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

DTZ's research showed that average gross rents for first and upper-storey conventional industrial space stayed at $2.15 per square foot per month (psf pm) and $1.75 psf pm respectively.\n\nFor hi-tech and business park developments, rents remained at $3.10 psf pm and $4.70 psf pm.\n\nAs for capital values, average resale prices for first-storey and upper-storey freehold conventional industrial space in Q3 were unchanged from the previous quarter, at $627 psf and $470 psf respectively.\n\nMs Lee said that the various government measures mean industrial property prices should \"stabilise going forward\", which will benefit genuine end-users who want to buy their own property to avoid rental fluctuations.\n\nMany industrialists tend to prefer larger, single-user facilities that are more flexible for production layout, DTZ said. URA data shows that the net supply of single-user factories in the first half of 2013, at 4.3 million sq ft, is already 23 per cent higher than the entire supply last year.\n\nThere is also a trend of tie-ups between specialised firms and property players for purpose-built industrial space, DTZ said.\n\nBut the bulk of private industrial space to be completed next year will be warehouses and multiple-user factories, with a large proportion being strata-titled developments.\n\nBetween the second half of this year and 2014, some 64 per cent of a huge pipeline of 46 million sq ft of private industrial space expected to be ready by 2016 will come on stream.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The airline demanded Boeing fix the state-of-the-art jet, saying it needs repairs after less than 30 days in service.\n\nInvestment analysts say the glitch involving a hydraulic pump is minor and isolated, and it is unlikely to affect Boeing's stock price, which is towering at record levels. But Norwegian Air's vocal airing of its complaints is another black eye for the troubled Dreamliner. It follows a string of electrical and other safety problems that included battery meltdowns so severe they prompted regulators to ban the long-haul jetliner from flight for more than three months this year.\n\nOn Sunday, Polish airline LOT 787 flying from Toronto to Warsaw was forced to land at Iceland's Keflavik airport after problems with its air system.\n\nNorwegian Air's formal request on Saturday for Boeing to take charge of fixing the plane throws a spotlight on an often overlooked facet of the 787's performance: reliability. And it shows how quickly a plane that cannot fly can hit a carrier's bottom line.\n\nLike other airlines with small long-haul fleets, Norwegian Air does not have a spare plane it can use if a jet breaks down. The carrier said it had to rent planes and cancel tickets when it could not use its 787s, and the company's stock has fallen 6 per cent since a peak earlier this month, hit by a string of 787 problems and concerns about its broader business.\n\n\"Reliability is a big deal, especially for low-cost carriers such as Norwegian,\" said Russell Solomon, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service in New York.\n\nBut since the problem appeared to be a \"one-off\" and part of the normal growing pains for a new plane, he added, it probably would not unsettle Boeing investors.\n\nWhen Norwegian Air began long-haul operations this year, it aimed to capitalise on the Dreamliner's lower operating cost and the jet's promised 20 per cent savings on fuel burn.\n\nBut the first two Dreamliners, delivered recently and part of a planned fleet of eight, broke down more than half a dozen times in September, forcing Norwegian Air to lease back-up planes on short notice or cancel flights.\n\nNorwegian Air grounded its 787s several times, citing problems with brakes, hydraulic pumps and power. On Sept 23, the carrier said one Dreamliner was beset with problems in the oxygen supply to the cockpit. A problem with a valve on the airline's second 787 was repaired around the same time, but only after delaying a flight from Oslo to New York.\n\nBoeing said the repairs of the latest problem, to be carried out in Stockholm where the aircraft is parked, would take a matter of days. That is much better than with the 787's volatile battery system, which grounded the worldwide fleet of Dreamliners from January to April.\n\n\"Boeing has identified a number of specific improvements to address component reliability,\" the planemaker said.\n\nThe grounded planes have prompted Norwegian Air to voice its dissatisfaction with the aircraft. \"The aircraft's reliability is simply not acceptable,\" the airline said on Saturday. \"Our passengers cannot live with this kind of performance.\"\n\nSaturday's announcement capped a tough week for Boeing in which Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner flew to Oslo to face Norwegian Air bosses over the earlier 787 mishaps.\n\nLike Norwegian Air, state-owned LOT has had a list of problems with its Dreamliners, including last week delaying flights after check-ups showed two planes lacked gas filters.\n\nLOT also said last week Boeing had until the end of the year to agree on compensation for the three-month grounding of the 787 because of the battery issues, or it would take the matter to court. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The Land Transport Authority, which has many frontline enforcement officers in its ranks, is just one example.\n\nSeveral other agencies have also imposed block leave as a fraud prevention and deterrence measure, said PSD.\n\nPSD also announced that, from today onwards, all public officers will need to declare within seven days whenever they visit the two local casinos - at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and Resorts World Sentosa - more than four times a month, or if they purchase the $2,000 annual entry levy.\n\nFor certain groups of officers, the PSD said that even tighter rules will apply to them.\n\nThose who are in more vulnerable positions where they could be suborned or exploited, or whose misconduct will have \"significant reputational risk\" to the public service, will have to declare every visit within seven calendar days.\n\nOfficers who enforce operations in the two casinos, or regulate the activities of or negotiate business arrangements with the casino operators will also be banned from visiting the casinos, unless they are doing so as part of their official duties.\n\nPSD said it is now working with the various agencies on which officers need to be designated for the stricter casino visit rules.\n\nIn July this year, Head of Civil Service Peter Ong announced in a letter to all public servants that PSD would review the rules regarding visits to casinos here.\n\nThe review followed a slew of high-profile cases of misconduct by several senior public servants, such as the one involving a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau officer who was charged for misappropriating $1.7 million and gambling a large sum of that away at the MBS casino.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

House Republicans want to delay US President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare restructuring laws for a year and make other changes to the health laws. The president and the Democrats, meanwhile, have promised not to let that happen.\n\nThe consequences for failing to agree will invariably hit Americans hard. As things stand, if lawmakers blow the Monday midnight deadline in Washington (Tuesday noon, Singapore time), as many as 800,000 federal workers will be forced off their jobs without pay. Crucially, though, essential services such as border patrols, meat inspectors and air traffic control will continue, as well as Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\nMr Obama hit the nail right on the head when he warned that a shutdown of the US government would risk destabilising the world economy. His message to Congress was a simple one: \"Do not shut down the government. Do not shut down the economy. Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time.\"\n\nSome economists have predicted that a shutdown could reduce fourth-quarter economic growth by up to 1.4 percentage points depending on how long it lasts. The biggest effect would come from the output lost from furloughed workers. The mounting concern over the fiscal negotiations sent the dollar to a seven-and-a-half month low last week, while the cost of insuring against a US debt default has soared to its highest levels since May this year.\n\nMore worryingly, the gridlock over the budget could be just a prelude to an even more serious showdown expected later this month over the government debt ceiling. Republicans have said that they will refuse to lift the ceiling unless the healthcare law - known as Obamacare - is reigned back, which could mean the US Treasury would be forced to default on its mounting debt payments.\n\nYet, it's difficult to see which side - Republican or Democrat - will blink first at this point, with neither wanting to be the one to cast the final vote that would lead to a shutdown. Some recent surveys show that the American public is already deeply unhappy with its leaders in Congress, and rightly so. The man on the street is tired of such political one-upmanship and opposed to a prolonged shutdown that would impact their daily lives.\n\nThe truth is, even if lawmakers somehow wriggle their way out of a shutdown or a default, some damage has already been done. With so much uncertainty about the US economy, there's little hope that businesses, both local and foreign, will want to invest and hire there anytime soon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If the policy is painful but necessary, such as the tightening of foreign worker inflows for businesses, find ways to mitigate the downsides, communicate our intent and hold our ground on the core of the policies,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nThe key to getting things right is to implement policies well and translate them into specific programmes. Public-service leaders have to monitor results and trends in order to know when a change to the government's approach is necessary, he added.\n\nAlso important is for the public service to put forth a \"seamless and coherent organisation\" to the people. Mr Lee acknowledged that some members of the public have found it frustrating to have to deal with multiple agencies and conflicting policies; instances such as these would erode their trust in the public service over time.\n\nAnother way to maintain public trust is to uphold a high standard of integrity, which he said has been been \"painstakingly\" built up over many years.\n\nThat Singapore has a public service of integrity means businesses compete fairly instead of relying on improper influence, and public officers have the discretion and authority to exercise their judgment and knowledge when managing multi-million-dollar projects.\n\nSingaporeans also know that the doors are open for them in life if they work hard, regardless of their family background or personal connections, said the prime minister.\n\nHe noted that there has been a string of high-profile corruption cases involving public officers, including those at senior levels, in the past year, and that the public sector accounts for about a fifth of all corruption cases here.\n\nThe public sector must strengthen its systems to uphold its reputation for integrity and incorruptibility, and dispel any doubts that standards have dropped, he said.\n\nHe added that every officer, and the public service as a whole, should take pride in being clean and incorrupt. He called on all public-sector leaders to take the lead in putting in place the right systems, enforce rules fairly and firmly and deal with mistakes decisively - tasks they should not delegate or leave to their subordinates.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such an outcome will suck money out of the economy and spread anxiety among consumers and businesses in a way that is likely to hold back economic activity.\n\nAnd a default on the federal debt, which may occur within 30 days without congressional action, would be much worse, economists say. Failing to raise the debt ceiling would require the government to cut spending by about a third, potentially forcing delays in Social Security cheques, military pay and payments to doctors.\n\nThere are other risks, too. On Oct 17, the Treasury is scheduled to ask investors for US$120 billion in loans. But if investors grow nervous about whether the United States will be able to pay them back, they are likely to demand higher interest rates, which would cause rates to spike throughout the financial system, leading to more expensive mortgages, auto loans and credit card bills. Doubt could grow about the safety of parking money in US bonds.\n\n\"It's corrosive on the economy,\" said Mark Zandi at Moody's Analytics. A lengthy shutdown followed by a default would be \"the nightmare of the recession all over again\". Even if lawmakers find a way out of a shutdown or a default, this crisis is likely to have negative effects on the economy. With so much uncertainty in Washington, economists say that businesses, flush with cash, have been reluctant to invest and hire.\n\nBusiness interest groups, usually aligned with the Republicans, have urged the party to abandon their demand for policy concessions, such as delaying President Barack Obama's healthcare law, in exchange for funding the government and raising the debt limit.\n\nMuch of the government will close today without action by Congress. If the shutdown lasts more than a few days, it would affect the economy in numerous ways.\n\nFor example, the closure of national parks and museums may hurt hotels, restaurants and the people who work for them. The process of getting approval for a home loan could take much more time, slowing the housing recovery.\n\nEconomists estimate that the cumulative effect of a prolonged shutdown could trim economic growth in the final three months of the year by up to 1.4 percentage points. Under that scenario, the economy would hardly expand at all.\n\nBut economists are far more concerned about a potential default on the federal debt. The Treasury has warned that it will have only about US$30 billion in cash on hand by the middle of this month, and estimates are that it will run out of money by the end of the month. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Such was the case with the last missive that appeared in print \"Scrutinise financial investment seminars too\" on Sept 24 where reader Vincent Khoo makes a strong case for some form of regulation to be introduced to govern the dozens of \"free\" and paid investment seminars that are regularly advertised in the print and Internet media, particularly those that claim massive (sometimes guaranteed) profits in a short space of time.\n\nThe reasoning is that if financial advisers have to be licensed under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and are strictly limited in what they can say or sell to their clients, then so should those who conduct these \"get rich quick\" courses and seminars on trading commodities, property, stocks, currencies etc.\n\nGranted, speakers at these events do not have a lasting relationship with the audience, at least not of the form that could be construed as being fiduciary, but as Mr Khoo correctly pointed out, a gullible public which pays thousands to attend and then stand to lose thousands after attendance because they think that can surely get rich should still be protected.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The development, which was launched the previous weekend, saw 410 of the 505 units released for sale snapped up on the first day. The most popular units were the one-bedroom and two-bedroom units; the average price of a one-bedroom unit was $750,000, while a two-bedroom unit averaged $933,000.\n\nThe TDSR framework, along with the other property cooling measures, has also shifted interest to the non-central region, given the lower price quantum, said Nicholas Mak, executive director, research and consultancy at SLP International.\n\nThe SPRI for Non-Central Region (excluding small units) rose one per cent, following a 0.4 per cent gain in July.\n\nConversely, the SPRI for Central Region (excluding small units) slipped 1.1 per cent, reversing a 0.4 per cent gain in July. Central Region is defined as districts 1-4 (including the financial district and Sentosa Cove) and the traditional prime districts 9,10 and 11.\n\nThe Overall SRPI was up 0.1 per cent in August, after gaining 0.4 per cent in July.\n\nIt is worth noting that overall prices have stayed relatively flat despite a sharp reduction in transaction volumes, said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore Research at DTZ.\n\nBased on URA caveats, resale transactions of non-landed private homes fell 27 per cent month-on-month to 388 units in August from 529 units in July. This was the second-lowest monthly resale transaction volume since the beginning of the year; the lowest was in February, after the higher Additional Buyer's Stamp Duties (ABSD) and tighter financing restrictions were introduced.\n\n\"Despite the lower transaction volume, resale prices have generally held up as individual sellers in the secondary market have limited incentive to sell their properties unless they receive a premium as their replacement cost is now higher in lieu of the higher ABSD, especially if they are multiple property owners,\" said Ms Lee.\n\nMoving forward, Chesterton Singapore's Mr Han said he expects prices in the Central area to ease further, although this will likely be compensated by a slight increase in prices in the suburban areas.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
