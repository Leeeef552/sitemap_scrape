But many of them assumed it would be levied on net rather than gross gains, in keeping with international tax norms.\n\nThat means the money they have set aside over the past few years is likely to fall short of their actual tax bill, possibly by as much as US$4 billion, according to Shanghai-based investment analysts Z-Ben Advisors.\n\nThe details of the tax plan were revealed to investors on Thursday at a briefing in Beijing by municipal representatives of the State Administration of Taxation, the sources said.\n\nA slide shown at the briefing and seen by Reuters said:\"Transactions of equity investments are taxed based on gains from each transaction, and the applicable tax rate is 10 per cent. Netting of multiple transactions is not allowed.\" The tax applies to investors in the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) programme and the renminbi-denominated version of the same programme (RQFII) between Nov 17, 2009 and Nov 16, 2014. \"It is likely that the majority of QFII investors will find themselves under-provisioned not least because the agreement appears not to include netting and most QFIIs have provisioned based on netting,\" said Michael McCormack, executive director at Z-Ben Advisors. \"We expect a wave of net asset value clawbacks by fund managers and also a short-term wave of redemptions from QFII funds as investors attempt to escape prior to the tax clawbacks,\" he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/e3ced7628b829209fae8ece000ced9ab55d255b57b9fde648ff0c676f5228e79?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "China's tax authorities have alarmed foreign investors with a proposed capital-gains tax which would take 10 per cent of their share trading profits without taking into account any of their trading losses, according to sources briefed by tax officials."}]}

The new requirement will be introduced in full in relation to audits ending on or after Nov 1, 2016. \"Where auditors and actuaries fail to provide us with the information that we need to supervise firms effectively, we now have disciplinary powers which allow us to take action to rectify this,\" PRA chief executive and BoE deputy governor Andrew Bailey said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c25c1c83809dd6f078b7d17a2776e56d7bb414d8f06938ca4409ec6122ad18f9?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The Bank of England (BoE) has turned up the heat on accounting firms used by banks, saying they must provide the central bank with written reports from November 2016 on their audits of Britain's main lenders."}]}

Seven hundred new workers have already been hired since.\n\nIt said at the time that these new workers would be hired on temporary contracts and offered more secure ones once demand for its cars had stabilised but did not give a specific timeframe.\n\nFCA said its decision was also conditional on the new labour rules that finally came into force last week. The new rules ease firing restrictions for large private sector firms but also aim to reduce the use of short-term contracts. \"This is a historic agreement because it's the first time that we manage to officially agree with the Fiat group that after only six months more than 1,000 temporary workers would be offered permanent contracts,\" the union said.\n\nFiat declined to comment.\n\nRenzi, who pushed the labour reforms through in the face of stiff opposition from trade unions and many in his own centre-left Democratic Party, is hoping the new rules will encourage firms to hire, especially young people, among whom unemployment is running at more than 40 per cent.\n\nThursday's deal also includes an agreement to raise the number of shifts to four to meet rising demand for vehicles as a gradual recovery in Europe finally gains momentum after a six-year slump that pushed sales to multi-decade lows.\n\nUnion sources added that, given positive demand for all Melfi models, which also include the older Fiat Punto, new hires at the plant would likely exceed the forecasts given in January.\n\nUnions said they were told that production of the Punto at Melfi would continue throughout 2015, dismissing reports that the manufacture of this model could either be stopped or moved elsewhere.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/febaf366beac5e137d611a6e31415406ffc0778585576ee3674b99c3a2b3c85c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Fiat Chrysler has agreed to give permanent contracts to hundreds of new hires at its Melfi plant in southern Italy currently on short-term agreements, a union said on Thursday, in an early boost for Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's labour reforms."}]}

So did Boris Johnson, the mayor of London. For many tourists, even if they are not former US presidents, a trip to Hong Kong isn't over till they pick up a made-to-measure outfit from one of its family-run tailor shops.\n\nAs consumers worldwide seek out custom-made clothing to set them apart from the ready-to-wear crowd, the Hong Kong bespoke industry's reputation for quality and speedy delivery ought to have helped the former British colony build on its advantage.\n\nInstead, the local tailoring business is in danger of dying out after decades of underinvestment in the face of competition from low-cost centres such as mainland China. Nor has it matched the premium branding enjoyed by London's Savile Row and Milan.\n\nHong Kong's ageing army of tailors may be its last: years of training for demanding and painstaking work that yields low wages deters young people from entering the industry.\n\nAt 65, Cheung Wan-sun is among the younger master tailors at Bonham Strand, a bespoke tailoring firm in the Central business district. \"There will be no one to take over the business when we're all retired,\" said Cheung, one of eight tailors at the firm. \"It's not easy to make a living as a tailor.\"\n\nThe profession doesn't pay too well, with tailors taking home around HK$10,000 (US$1,290) a month, half the median wage.\n\nWhile the government pledged HK$500 million (US$64.5 million) in its budget on Wednesday to help the city's fashion industry, including promoting local designers and brands, master tailors have been left to fend for themselves. \"It doesn't provide any help to the tailoring industry,\" said Yally Yan, 24, an apprentice at Bonham Strand. \"To revive the industry, we have to do it ourselves.\"\n\nSome tailors have thrived through canny marketing of their sales to celebrities or whistle-stop world tours with marathon measuring sessions in hotel suites.\n\nAnthony Asaf, of Empire Tailors, whose clients include judges and senior executives, sells more suits during his infrequent US trips than from his main outlet in Hong Kong. \"As far as overseas business goes, we do as much as we can, not more, because there aren't many young people doing the cutting, stitching end of the process,\" said Mark, Asaf's 26-year-old son.\n\nDemand is still robust. It's just that most orders are from overseas and busy executives place orders by phone or online.\n\nA decade ago, new suits were delivered in three weeks. Now, skilled tailors are in short supply and it takes up to 12 weeks.\n\nTailored suits start at around US$600 in Hong Kong, less than half the price for an entry-level outfit in Savile Row or Milan. Both European centres have successfully revived once-declining sectors by focusing on high-end consumers, brand building and ploughing revenue back into training programmes.\n\nHong Kong's government-funded Clothing Industry Training Authority offers a part-time foundation course in men's suit tailoring that costs HK$14,000 (US$1,805), about two months' wages for an apprentice tailor.\n\nRegular customers say the shortage of gifted tailors could be just what Hong Kong needs to pump new life into the industry, pushing up prices and drawing a new generation to the trade.\n\n\"The pricing for premium tailors will go up,\" said Sebastian Svensson, managing director of Lifestyleasia.com, as he gets a suit fitted in the shopping district of Tsimshatsui East. \"Hopefully, supply and demand will adjust that moving forward.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/d5bf0d90c1132367e97c6f6c9f8f4b5ee474b34078cd4760a3b447af64316c6d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Bill Clinton did it.

But over the full year the preliminary data showed zero growth.\n\nAnd even Friday's upbeat industrial output figure - a 4.0 per cent on-month expansion - did not warrant much optimism, said Marcel Thieliant from London-based Capital Economics.\n\n\"While industrial production surged in January, firms are predicting a renewed decline in coming months as consumer spending remains sluggish,\" he said.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/55298f458a286517b1684dbfbd3dbb0ed70fabbfee01ad2531e1e698661324fd?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Japan's inflation rate has dropped to its lowest level since just after Tokyo launched a high-profile offensive in 2013 to battle years of falling prices and tepid growth, data showed Friday."}]}

Japan was next with 18 transactions, followed by Canada with 12.\n\nSome of China's most high-profile US investments have hit snags with CFIUS in recent years. China's Anbang Insurance Group Co recently received a go-ahead to buy New York's famed Waldorf Astoria Hotel from Hilton Worldwide Holdings.\n\nA China-US investment treaty could boost the still relatively paltry levels of direct investment between the two countries, and Washington expects Beijing will raise concerns over CFIUS scrutiny around their treaty talks.\n\nMost reviews arise from voluntary notices filed by companies, though CFIUS has the power to start its own investigations and companies often feel compelled to initiate the process.\n\nIn China, CFIUS review is the \"most talked about issue\"regarding an investment treaty with America, said Fang Jin, the deputy secretary general of the China Development Research Centre, a leading Chinese government institute.\n\n\"Chinese companies represent a disproportionately high percentage of cases covered by CFIUS,\" Mr Fang said at an conference in Washington earlier this month.\n\nThat appeared to be the case in 2013, although US data might exaggerate this. Commerce Department figures show China accounted for just under 1 per cent of US bound FDI in 2013.\n\nHowever, private estimates that include investments made through third countries like Singapore suggest China's share of new FDI might be several times higher.\n\nA senior Treasury official, which is the lead department among the government agencies that are part of CFIUS, said the total number of transactions covered by CFIUS in 2014 was probably above 140.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f959a39859c49b08701d5be2494f5c9672442e8da5736737e0be81084f6d7229?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Chinese investors faced more scrutiny from a US national security watchdog than those from any other country in 2013, the Obama administration said on Thursday in a report."}]}

During the quarter, the shipbuilder delivered nine vessels, compared to the six delivered a year ago.\n\n\"As compared to 4Q2013, the group's shipbuilding related segment registered a lower gross profit margin of 17% in 4Q2014, mainly due to completion of construction and delivery of orders secured prior to financial crisis in 2013, and vessel prices for orders placed post-crisis were comparatively lower than pre-crisis orders,\" Yangzijiang said.\n\nOther income got a boost from 108 million yuan in advances from previous shipowners of terminated shipbuilding contracts recognised. Yangzijiang said the point of recognition of such income is two years after the vessel was delivered to the new ship owner.\n\nFor the full year, the China-based shipbuilder's net profit rose 13 per cent to 3.48 billion yuan, while revenue rose 7 per cent to 15.35 billion yuan.\n\nShipbuilding-related businesses accounted for about 89 per cent of its total revenue. A total of 33 vessels were delivered in FY2014 according to schedule, compared to 34 vessels delivered in FY2013. But those delivered in FY2014 had relatively lower contract price and resulted in lower margin. Gross profit margin for shipbuilding related segment fell to 19 per cent from 27 per cent in FY2013.\n\nThe lower shipbuilding margin weighed down the overall gross profit for the group, which declined 13 per cent from a year ago to about four billion yuan.\n\nThis was cushioned by a significantly lower effective tax rate of 12 per cent for FY2014, compared to 33 per cent a year ago. This was due to the one-off credit balance of 349 million yuan to Jiangsu New Yangzi Shipbuilding Co, Ltd, given its \"High/New Technology Enterprise\" status. The yard is now enjoying a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15 per cent for three years starting from FY2013. The tax credit cushioned the decline in gross profit.\n\nYangzijiang's outstanding shipbuilding order book stood at 118 vessels with a total value of US$4.75 billion.\n\nIt has proposed a higher dividend of 5.5 Singapore cents per share, compared to five Singapore cents a year ago.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Exports rose only 3.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, after a 4.5 per cent gain in the third and an 11.1 per cent jump in the second.\n\nConsumer spending, which accounts for about 70 per cent of US economic activity, was the main driver of growth, rising 4.2 per cent, a four-year high.

Preqin researchers found, however, that the bulk of the investors they polled late in 2014 are sticking with hedge fund investments.\n\nStill, 68 per cent of the respondents said that fees, made up of a management fee plus a performance fee, should be reduced this year. In 2013, only 45 per cent of investors demanded cuts. \"This highlights the growing concerns investors have surrounding fees, particularly in the low-return environment of 2014,\" Preqin wrote.\n\nIn the past, many investors felt that managers were able to dictate fees because returns were good and demand was strong.\n\nInvestors were polled at the tail end of 2014, when the average hedge fund returned only 3 per cent, marking the industry's worst returns since 2011. Disappointment over returns was evident in the survey.\n\nPreqin said that 35 per cent of all respondents, more than double the number from the previous survey, felt that hedge funds failed to meet investors' expectations.\n\nNevertheless, the large majority of investors, 84 per cent, said they planned to maintain or increase their allocations to hedge funds this year. Roughly half said they would put in as much as US$50 million in new capital, while 8 per cent said they would put in US$500 million or more.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/1b0e7de11d2fbe55da934440c7dcf88c852f40ca133432cbf82e95da178e47fc?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Institutional investors are sending a strong message to hedge funds after last year's largely lackluster returns: charge us less and perform better."}]}

It is written by the victors and often by men; losers don't get to tell their side of the story, and women systematically get written out.\n\nIt is partly to address this problem that playwright Clarilyn Khoo wrote Three Inches of Alive. The play, which won TheatreWorks' 24-Hour Playwriting Competition last year, imagines a 19th century Malayan philanthropist by the name of Leila \"Anjung\" Keats, who contributed much to society, but of whom little is known and written about.\n\nIn the play, a modern-day archivist (Gyan Lee) meets the ghost of Anjung (Siti Zuraidah) to ask questions about her life. And, as it turns out, there is much more to her than what's provided in the entries in textbooks and historical accounts.\n\nAnjung was a poet, sculptor, philanthropist and landowner. Because she was a child of mixed parentage - an English father and a Malay mother - neither community wanted to claim her as its own. Her mixed parentage also made her \"unmarriageable\" because of the lack of acceptance of such women. She had no children or grandchildren to tell her story to.\n\nKhoo said: \"I based Anjung's character on Hajjah Fatimah, a real philanthropist of whom I read about two paragraphs in my Social Studies textbook, and who built a mosque which I visited when I was in school.\n\n\"Despite her great philanthropic work, when I was at the Malay Heritage Centre last year, I saw mostly male Malay pioneers such as Eunos Abdullah and P Ramlee celebrated by the museum.\n\n\"When we think about Singapore pioneers, we have far fewer female figures in history that we know of - though I am certain a lot of women made important contributions to the building of this country.\"\n\nKhoo feels that most Singaporeans have little awareness of the country's artistic pioneers, such Georgette Chen and Cheong Soo Pieng, because \"it's not knowledge you can directly use, and since you can't use it, you don't seek it\".\n\nAgreeing, the play's director Irfan Kasban said: \"Generally speaking, there's insufficient historicisation of our pioneers. We're often more enamoured of figures and facts with regard to the country's success and we tend to be more interested in the here and now, than in the past. We are more concerned with moving forward than where we came from.\n\n\"A play like this is interesting because it looks at the function and shortcomings of history, which becomes an especially important issue at a time when we are celebrating our 50th anniversary.\"\n\nThree Inches of Alive will be staged at the Mountbatten Community Club from Feb 26 to 28, the Malay Heritage Centre from March 13 to 15, and the Siglap South Community Centre from March 20 to 21.

State-backed companies including State Grid of China and shipbuilder China CSSC Holdings have sold 3.1 billion euros since Dec 31, seven times the amount in the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"We are advising issuers to consider euro bond sales,\" said Mr Liu. UBS was the biggest foreign underwriter of China's onshore bonds last year. \"While interest rates in Europe are declining toward zero, European investors are eager to buy bonds from China and other emerging-market nations that offer higher yields.\" China's buying spree in Europe, encouraged by the government's \"going out\" policy to expand overseas markets and secure commodities abroad, has included investments in Italian energy grids, a Maltese utility and a Dutch insurer. Chinese companies announced a record US$20.3 billion of acquisitions in Europe last year, as the yuan, which fell to the lowest against the dollar since October 2012 today, strengthened 11 per cent against the euro in 2014, the most since 2010.\n\nThe debt to finance some of the acquisitions appeals to yield-starved European investors as the region's central bank keeps benchmark interest rates close to zero. The Chinese borrowers include large state-owned groups dubbed national champions that the government began forming in the 1990s by consolidating smaller enterprises and listing them on exchanges.\n\nChina Construction Bank, China's second-biggest lender, is planning to issue bonds denominated in either dollars or euros, a person familiar with the matter said last week. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, the nation's biggest lender, sold 600 million euros of perpetual securities in December.\n\nFor Chinese companies, raising debt in euros provides a cheaper way than sourcing funds at home. The coupon on the seven-year euro notes sold in January by State Grid, the nation's China's biggest power distributor, was 1.5 per cent, compared with 4.45 per cent on its three-month yuan notes issued domestically that same month.\n\n\"It's cost-efficient to issue euro-denominated bonds,\" said Yves Jacob, the head of debt capital markets for the Asia- Pacific region at Societe Generale SA.\n\nState Grid bought a stake last year in Italy's CDP Reti, an energy-grid holding company. Shanghai Electric Power purchased 33 per cent of Enemalta Corp., the main electricity provider in the Mediterranean island nation of Malta. Anbang Insurance Group, the insurer that acquired New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, won Dutch government approval earlier this month to buy the insurer Vivat.\n\nThe European Central Bank has started buying bonds, helping to cut borrowing costs. The average yield on corporate notes in euros fell 89 basis points in the past year to 0.95 per cent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. That compares with 3.05 per cent for company debentures in dollars.\n\n'Investment Opportunities' Baoshan Iron & Steel, China's biggest publicly traded steelmaker, sold 500 million euros of three-year securities with a 1.625 per cent coupon earlier this month, Bloomberg-compiled data show. The notes carry an A- rating from Standard & Poor's. While still lower than rates onshore, the coupon surpasses the average 0.87 per cent on bonds in euros with similar ratings and maturities.\n\nEuropean investors favor Chinese euro bonds, particularly those from well-known companies, because \"Chinese spreads are wider for the same rating than issuers from other countries,\" Societe Generale's Jacob said. \"There is a global search for yields.\" Chinese companies' sales of offshore dollar and euro- denominated bonds may increase as much as 15 per cent this year, according to UBS's Liu. The majority of offerings will still be in dollars, Mr Liu said.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping said in November China's overseas investment will total $1.25 trillion over the next 10 years and the government will spend US$40 billion to revive the ancient Silk Road, which connected the country to Europe through Central Asia.\n\n\"Chinese companies have found many good investment opportunities as the European economy slows,\" Mr Liu said. \"If Chinese companies have demand for euros for mergers and acquisitions in Europe, euro bond sales would be a good and cost-saving option.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

And Iran went after Sands purportedly because the company's CEO, billionaire Sheldon Adelson, is known as a hawkish supporter of Israel.\n\nForeign \"actors\" are conducting reconnaissance and gaining digital access to US infrastructure systems, so they can launch a cyber attack if necessary in the future, he said.\n\nRussia and China had particularly sophisticated cyber capabilities, according to the director of national intelligence.\n\nRussia is creating its own cyber command that will be able to orchestrate propaganda and insert malware into adversaries' computer systems, he said.\n\nCountries such as Iran and North Korea have \"lesser technical capabilities but possibly more disruptive intent,\" he said.\n\nMr Clapper acknowledged America had \"offensive capabilities\" in cyberspace but offered no details.\n\nBut he said there were questions about how to use such weapons and what sort of doctrine would govern digital operations.\n\n\"I think the issue, though, is what is the policy? What is it that would achieve cyber deterrence? And that is an issue that, at the policy level, we're still, frankly, wrestling with,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and Israel were reportedly behind an elaborate cyber attack on Iran's nuclear programme in 2010 that damaged hundreds of centrifuges. Dubbed Olympic Games, the operation employed the Stuxnet computer worm that was introduced through an infected USB flash drive, according to the New York Times.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Unfortunately, underneath the movie's thin veneer of sophistication - beyond the fun locales, luxury hotel suites and designer wear - there is very little resembling quality entertainment.\n\nAfter a long run as a movie star with the Midas touch, Will Smith hit a roadblock with his last film After Earth (2013): you could say he lost focus. Despite his new film's title, he doesn't seem to have recovered it yet.\n\nHere, he plays Nicky Spurgeon, a third-generation con artist with the swagger that comes from being taught by the best in the business. One evening, he meets Jess (Margot Robbie), a hottie with blond ambition and decides to take her under his wing as an \"intern\".\n\nNicky and his veteran team show her the ropes and she proves to be a quick study; she also learns that there are little cons and big cons on his agenda. She's not quite sure who's conning whom but when she finds out, she doesn't like it one bit.\n\nThree years later, their paths cross again in Buenos Aires. This time she's on the arm of Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), a rich businessman who's in the process of being set up by Nicky for a major con. Garriga owns a motor racing team and wants Nicky to sell false information to a rival team. But, of course, it's not as straightforward as that - especially as Garriga's henchman Owens (Gerald McRaney) is suspicious of Nicky's motives. Meanwhile, Nicky professes that all he wants is to run away with Jess - complicating matters and jeopardising his well-laid plans.\n\nThere are a few more twists in the plot but never a sense that any of it is believable. Smith isn't required to do much more than smirk or act superior on cue: his screen character calls for a more subdued performance and he readily obliges. Robbie, who played Leonardo DiCaprio's bitchy second wife in The Wolf of Wall Street, is eminently watchable but she isn't required to do more than parade around in a variety of revealing outfits.\n\nAnother of the movie's reveals is how a team of pickpockets operates in crowded spaces at high-profile events. It's interesting to watch but if it were really as easy as the movie makes out, then we would all be well advised to leave home with empty pockets. Focus is fun in parts but most of the time, it is merely underwhelming.\n\nRating: C-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company took a charge of 551 million euros for penalties it related to delays of its A400M military transport. Sales rose 5 per cent to 60.7 billion euros.\n\nThe European aerospace company, which draws two thirds of sales from its airliner unit, has benefited from demand for new, more-fuel efficient aircraft as airlines seek to protect themselves from the volatility of fuel costs. Airbus today builds 42 single-aisle planes a month and was targeting 46 by 2016. Boeing co. is aiming for 52 single-aisle planes by 2018.\n\n\"We delivered more commercial aircraft than ever before, including our first A350, and our net orders were, once again, more than twice the number of deliveries,\" said chief executive officer Tom Enders in a statement issued today.\n\nThe company predicted \"slightly higher\" deliveries for this year than in 2014, and reiterated plans to break even with its A380 super-jumbo program, which has struggled to attract fresh orders. Sales will rise this year, and Airbus said it expects a \"slight\" increase in operating earnings before certain items, with a break-even on cash flow before acquisitions.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

For extra tax credit, no aisle seat. Must eat \"food\" offered from cart. Note: There is no carb-free option in Economy, please make liposuction arrangements at own expense. (b) Partake of at least 12 lunches at a hawker centre in approved heartland area. Cannot post ironic photo of meal on Instagram or epiphanies about how the other half lives on Facebook. (c) Initiate and successfully complete phone call to Internet service provider's call centre without losing temper. If only have premium account, assume a poor relation's identity so as to obtain authentic experience of incompetence and ineptitude. However frustrating the experience, it is unwise to ask: \"Do you know who my father is?\" Answer very likely to be: \"No. Try asking your mother.\" (d) Use ATMs for all cash transactions throughout year of assessment. To qualify for tax rebate, select ATM line in which the patron ahead of you is: (i) an individual with 10 passbooks to update, or (ii) an individual whose sole purpose consists of wandering haphazardly from one on-screen menu to another before finally cancelling the transaction five minutes later.

Seoul slipped 0.12 per cent while Sydney was up 0.37 per cent and Wellington added 0.08 per cent. Markets in Taiwan were closed for a public holiday.\n\nThe dollar eased Friday after rallying on inflation data that pointed to rising price pressures in some areas of the US economy, which could ease the way for the Fed to hike interest rates.\n\nIn Tokyo, the dollar weakened to 119.27 yen from 119.42 yen in New York, although it was still higher than 118.97 yen seen in Tokyo earlier Thursday.\n\nThe euro rose to US$1.1206, from US$1.1198, but it slipped to 133.65 yen from 133.72 yen in US trade.\n\n- The sharp fall in US consumer prices in January gave the price index its first 12-month fall since 2009. Yet while falling crude-oil prices continued to dampen overall inflation, rising pressures were revealed.\n\n\"Some analysts are going to use these data to warn about 'deflation' and say the Federal Reserve should hold off on raising rates. But the details of the report show we are not in the grips of deflation and the Fed should stay on track to start raising rates in June,\" said FT Advisors economists in a research note.\n\nSpeculation has been rising over when the central bank would pull the trigger on a rate hike, with Fed Chair Janet Yellen pointing this week to there being no hurry to raise interest rates from near-zero.\n\n\"Headline is known information, but the core measure surprised to the upside,\" Daniel Brehon, a New York-based strategist at Deutsche Bank AG, told Bloomberg News.\n\n\"Given that inflation surprises have been negative around the world, anything above consensus is a sign for optimism and a sign for higher rates in the US.\" Despite Tokyo's high-profile offensive, Japan's core consumer inflation, excluding volatile fresh food prices, came in at 2.2 per cent year-on-year, down from 2.5 per cent in December, with the rise in overall consumer prices standing at 2.4 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile in a mixed bag of figures, Japanese factory production in January rose a faster-than-expected 4.0 per cent on-month, growing for the second straight month.\n\nOil prices were up in Asian trade. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for April delivery eased 72 cents to US$48.89 while Brent crude for April rose 66 cents to $60.71.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCapital Markets & Currencies\n\nFrasers Hospitality Trust\u2019s proposed privatisation by sponsor gets SGX in-principle approval\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 AM\n\nStocks to watch: OCBC, SGX, Centurion, Sats, Frasers Property, Frasers Hospitality Trust\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:39 AM\n\nAims Financial Group raises stake in Aims Apac Reit to 18.7%\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:35 AM\n\nUS dollar has best week since February on tariff inflation risks\n\nJul 12, 2025 11:52 AM\n\nEurope: Stocks down with bank and healthcare drag, US-EU tariffs in focus\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:56 AM\n\nUS: Stocks edge down from records amid tariff threats\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:45 AM\n\nSingapore stocks notch 5-day rally ahead of GDP data\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:06 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2fb494b4547591d474b7a5a18b151990cd25c6062245d42fe839c45d38324ced?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": null}]}

She said the deal would benefit both countries.\n\n\"The concept of commodity sharing is simple - the government of Trinidad and Tobago will purchase goods identified by the Government of Venezuela from T&T's manufacturers, such as tissue paper, gasoline, and parts for machinery,\" Ms Persad- Bissessar said.\n\nIn Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves, citizens line up outside supermarkets for hours seeking a bag of clothing detergent, toilet paper or cooking oil. Price controls and a lack of dollars for importers have emptied stores of many basic goods, a situation Mr Maduro blames on hoarders conducting an \"economic war\" against his socialist government.\n\nOfficials at Venezuela's Information Ministry declined to comment.\n\nBuffeted by plunging oil prices, Venezuela's economy will contract 7 per cent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, while inflation, which accelerated to 69 per cent in December, is already the fastest in the world.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/never-underestimate-low-priced-wines", "site_title": "Never underestimate low-priced wines", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNever underestimate low-priced wines\n\nA simpler wine can be enjoyed in its own context, provided one approaches it with an open mind.\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Feb 26, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nQUALITY wines can be found even at the lowest end of the scale, and nowhere was that more true than at dinner in Bangkok over the Chinese New Year holidays. We had two Bordeaux wines, a Bordeaux AOC 2010, Antoine Moueix, and Chateau l'Eglise Clinet 2004.\n\nBordeaux AOC 2010, Antoine Moueix\n\nA blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, proportions not available.\n\nVery dark crimson red, faint aroma of ripe berry fruit. On the palate, good density and ripeness, but rather characterless except for those attributes. There was still a good third of a bottle of wine left, so the bottle was re-corked and drunk the next night together with the balance of the Eglise Clinet. Twenty four hours later it was a different animal.\n\nIn the intervening 24 hours, this wine had clearly developed. There was a stronger aroma, more pronounced - a pleasant scent of ripe berries. The palate had better definition, more character, and even a little complexity. The wine in fact had become a pleasant drink, quite acceptable. Notwithstanding its lowly status, AOC Bordeaux, at the bottom of the ladder, this wine did possess some potential commensurate with its classification.\n\nChateau l'Eglise Clinet 2004\n\nMerlot 80 per cent, Cabernet Franc 20 per cent\n\nThe owner, Denis Durantou, is one of Bordeaux's best-known oenologists.\n\nThis had a similar colour to the preceding wine but was darker in hue. The aroma was more developed than that of the Antoine Moueix, starting with a seductive whiff of ripe berries. The palate showed it to be a dense lush wine of ripe red berries, with good concentration and balance, laced with soft tannins and finishing clean and lingering, clearly a wine of considerable calibre.\n\nAs we could not finish the bottle, with a good third still remaining, we re-corked it and consumed it the next night. The result was amazing. It had developed over the 24 hours and was in full bloom. It was a big, rich wine, packed with perfectly ripe merlot fruit, lovely taste, perfectly balanced, with a clean, long and lingering finish. A lovely wine.\n\nHere were two wines, both drunk over the course of two evenings. One, a simple AOC Bordeaux by a Bordeaux negociant, the other from one of the top ten Pomerol Chateaux. No contest of course, but the experience demonstrated that notwithstanding the wide difference in statures of the two producers, the simpler wine was in its own context a wine that could be enjoyed, provided one approached it with an open mind. And of course, the difference in price corresponded to the wide difference in stature, origins and quality of the two wines. Price of Antoine Moueix 2010 is around 16 euros (S$24.50), while the L'Eglise Clinet 2010 checks out at 125 euros. \"You pays your money and you take your choice!\" as the saying goes.\n\nAntoine Moueix was founded in 1902, and from the information available, it owned a couple of unheard-of Chateaux and also produced an AOC negoce wine, an essentially mass-produced commercial wine. One could say that it was the vinous equivalent of a good beer, except it did have a small capacity for further development, which is something you could hardly say of beer, however good it is.\n\nThe l'Eglise Clinet 2004 demonstrated two things. It confirmed the high, and consistent quality of this Chateau whatever the vintage. Durantou has been quoted to say that he intends his wine \". . .to serve as reference points in our sensorial education\". It also reminded us not to sniff at lesser years such as 2004. It had the misfortune to be immediately succeeded and thus overshadowed by the great 2005. It became a forgotten vintage. Notwithstanding the wet spring and late flowering, like 1978, it too was saved by an Indian summer, and turned out to be a vintage with high yields and ripe fruit. Being from a lesser year also meant that it would be cheaper than one from a great vintage, and finally would be ready earlier than a big year such as 2005.\n\nSolaia 1990, Marchese Antinori\n\nCabernet Sauvignon 80 per cent, Sangiovese 15 per cent, Cabernet Franc 5 per cent.\n\nAlthough Antinori had already begun introducing cabernet sauvignon into his Tuscan wines with the debut of the 1971 vintage of Tignanello, the first vintage of Solaia was the 1978. Initially consisting of 80 per cent Cabernet Sauvignon, 20 per cent Cabernet Franc, the cepage has been fine-tuned and now contains Sangiovese 15 per cent, with the Cabernet Franc reduced to 5 per cent.\n\nTasting notes: Very dark reddish brown, a surprisingly bright hue of red considering the age of the wine. Very prominent cedary element to the nose, which also was more youthful than expected. A very ripe wine, very concentrated, a lovely blend of cedar, almonds, walnuts and ripe berry fruit, very long finish. Still astonishingly youthful.\n\nThis was very impressive. Its cabernet sauvignon heritage was clearly indicated by its cedary nose and palate, with the Sangiovese linking it to its Tuscan roots. Is it a Sassicaia-look-alike considering the similarity in cabernet sauvignon predominance in the cepage? Clearly no. There is a compactness to the palate, resulting in a greater firmness to the taste which distinguishes it from Sassicaia. Clearly also was its relative youthfulness despite its age, indicating a potential for further development over the next five to seven years.\n\nAll these three wines, all red, two young and one near maturity, were enjoyed with typical Thai food and all of them took the spices in their stride. Would a white have had equal success? The only white I have used in the past with Thai cuisine is German rieslings, whose sweetness and lovely acidity coped beautifully with the fiery Thai chillies. I would not be so comfortable with white burgundies.\n\nGood ripeness, good acidity and minerality, all in the correct proportions, are the keys. As always. But again and again I am reminded of an old truth: Drink the wine you enjoy with the food you enjoy. You cannot go wrong!\n\nWhat about age of wine? Well, the Solaia was 24 years old, an age at which most wines would be at or close to maturity. But to set the record right, this bottle of Solaia was still not quite at its peak. With really old Bordeaux or burgundy I would be a little more circumspect. They tend to be fragile and this has to be respected.\n\nThere is one very important guiding principle in selecting wines to drink with food. Does the wine come first or the food? I leave that question to be answered individually!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Wages for the roughly 19 million workers covered by negotiated wage deals rose more than three times as steeply as inflation, which was at 0.9 per cent on average last year.\n\nThe increase was far stronger than in 2013, when workers under collective wage agreements had a 2.4 per cent pay hike and in 2012, when their paychecks increased by 2.7 per cent.\n\nRising wages, a stable labour market and lower oil prices are helping to boost household spending in Europe's largest economy.\n\nPrivate consumption was the main driver of growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 and with consumer morale at its highest in more than 13 years, there is no sign of that abating, especially as Germany's biggest trade union won an inflation-busting wage deal earlier this week.\n\nEngineering union IG Metall secured a 3.4 per cent wage increase for 15 months from April plus a one-off payment of 150 euros in a deal that is likely to benefit 3.7 million workers.

Her rather matronly, \"tweedy\" yet essentially kindly air conveys the impression of a caring aunt, but there is a hidden steel behind the ready smile of the 70-year- old former vice-president of Taiwan.\n\nShe has no doubt about the ability of women to lead the world. Her favourite role model is German Chancellor Angela Merkel and she is quick to point out that the US may soon have a woman president (Hillary Clinton) while in South Korea, Park Geun-hye is the country's first female leader.\n\nTaiwan too, Ms Lu told the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan (FCCJ) in a feisty address there, could have a woman president next year in the person of Tsai Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who is seen as a shoo-in after the losses suffered by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party in local elections last November. Not that Ms Lu needs to cite others as role models or as examples of courage. A seemingly fearless political and feminist activist, she spent six years in jail for her convictions, survived an apparent assassination attempt as well as cancer, and then served for eight years as Taiwanese vice-president.\n\nA biography published by the University of Washington suggests that \"Lu's journey is the story of Taiwan\". Through her drive for gender equality, human rights, political reform and Taiwanese independence \"she has played a key role in Taiwan's evolution from dictatorship to democracy\", the biography says.\n\nMs Lu makes an eloquent case for preserving Taiwan's independence in the face of a fast-rising China. She does not challenge Beijing's assertion that \"there is only one China\". Taiwan is \"not China\", she told the FCCJ, but it is a \"country\" that has earned the right to live as it wishes.\n\nMs Lu and her political colleagues appear deeply resentful of what they see as the progressive sellout of Taiwan's economic and political independence to China under current Republic of China (ROC) President Ma Ying-jeou, and they are determined to preserve that independence.\n\nIt was hardly by accident that she chose Tokyo as the place to deliver her message this week. Taiwan was a dependency of Japan from 1895 to 1945, and some in Taiwan see it as being in Japan's interests as much as that of the US to ensure the island's continued viability.\n\nMs Lu's speech to the FCCJ might almost have been written by US President Barack Obama or Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. China, she said, \"has taken provocative and aggressive actions in both East and South China Seas to bolster its maritime claims, causing conflicts with Japan. the Philippines and Vietnam\".\n\nMr Obama, she went on, has sought a pivot to Asia to \"reassure (US) allies and partners and to counterbalance China's militant and aggressive pursuit of territorial expansion and domination of the region\". Japan, India and most Asean members welcome this, she said, although \"others like Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia remain ambivalent\".\n\nGeopolitically and strategically, Ms Lu noted, Taiwan occupies a critical position. If China were to \"own\" Taiwan, Chinese \"naval ships and aircraft would have free access to the Pacific Ocean and directly challenge the US-Japan alliance\". China's new maritime access would then represent a \"great menace to the balance of power in this region\". Taiwan may be small in size but it has formidable military assets, the two-term vice-president suggested. These take the form of five naval bases plus eight ports that could be converted to military use in time of war, a fleet of fast missile boats and an air force with 300 frontline combat fighters.\n\nIf the DPP wins next year's general election, the new government will hoist defence spending to 3 per cent of GDP, Ms Lu pledged. Former Taiwanese government ministers Michael Tsai and Parris Chang, meanwhile, spoke of Taiwan's determination to defend itself and the willingness of its people to step up as military reservists, as in \"Singapore or Israel\".\n\nBut the more insidious threat, Ms Lu suggested, is that Beijing will exert ever-increasing pressure on Mr Ma \"to enter a peace agreement and eventual unification\" with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping will try to create \"an irreversible framework to lock Taiwan into a one-China cage that cannot be undone\".\n\nThat, Ms Lu implied, would quench a flame of freedom in the Asian region. \"Taiwan is the lighthouse of liberty in Asia,\" she declared. \"Its unique developments in human rights and democracy, peace and high-tech elaborate the strength of its soft power.\" It is in the interests of Pacific powers to defend that freedom, she suggested.\n\nBut she acknowledged at the same time that there are limits to what can be achieved through physical defence actions. \"Concerned that Taiwan's security and sovereignty is being gradually negotiated away\", she noted that \"a group of civic organisations has founded an international Peace and Neutrality for Taiwan Alliance\".\n\nThe alliance plans a signature campaign, which will be followed by a national plebiscite on formally establishing Taiwan's \"neutrality\".

The SEC, which oversees FINRA, said in the order approving the new rules that they would help\"maintain the integrity\" of the arbitration system.\n\nThe rules exclude those who have worked in the securities industry, even for brief periods, from serving on three-member arbitration panels unless investors opt for a panel that includes an arbitrator with a securities industry background.\n\nLawyers for investors argued that the old system was unfair because it allowed veteran stock brokers and other industry professionals to serve as arbitrators in disputes pitting investors against brokerage firms.\n\nInvestors complained of bias in the mandatory arbitration system, which was implemented after a 1987 Supreme Court ruling upheld the practice. After that ruling, brokerages began requiring investors to sign contracts agreeing to resolve any future disputes in arbitration instead of court.\n\nArbitration is a private process for resolving legal disputes. Supporters of arbitration say it is more efficient and less expensive. Critics say it deprives investors of the right to a jury trial and to appeal the outcome.\n\nPro-investor groups praised Thursday's rule change but said it did not go far enough. \"We would have liked to have seen other industry professionals excluded,\" such as marketers for securities issuers, said Joe Peiffer, president of the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association (PIABA), a group of investors'lawyers that fought for the change.\n\nOpponents of the change, including lawyers and lobbyists for the financial industry, argued that the new rules could leave FINRA without enough qualified arbitrators. Other critics said FINRA had not adequately analysed the proposal's costs and benefits, a complaint that the industry has used successfully in recent years to convince courts to overturn other financial regulations they opposed.\n\nIn a nod to brokerages, the SEC rule will also apply to lawyers who have worked in the past for investors as well as for brokerages for more than 20 per cent of their time.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/636494fb9470254c3e44c86514c75a91fbffe3e515be62d4b28228e824b37fe7?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The Securities Exchange Commission on Thursday restricted the ability of financial industry veterans to judge investor arbitration cases against brokerage firms, pleasing investors who claimed they injected pro-industry bias into the process."}]}

Frustration over the city's widening wealth gap and soaring home prices have sparked widespread protests in Hong Kong. \"If the US raises interest rates, Hong Kong will follow suit...We need to be mindful that the risk is not that far away; the risk is getting closer and larger,\" Norman Chan, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de facto central bank, told reporters.\n\nThe city's currency is pegged to the US dollar and an increase in US interest rates would cause domestic rates to rise as well, increasing mortgage payments for home owners.\n\nFuelled by record high property prices and ultra low interest rates, borrowers have taken on more debt, pushing the household debt to GDP ratio to a high of 64 per cent.\n\nThe HKMA cut the amount of money home buyers can borrow to 60 per cent of the property's value, from 70 per cent for homes priced below HK$7 million (US$902,818), a step aimed at curbing speculative demand for smaller apartments. The debt-servicing ratio for second-home buyers would be lowered to 40 per cent for second-home buyers, from 50 per cent, he added.\n\nSome analysts questioned the longer-term impact of the measures. \"The impact of this will be very short-lived as interest rates are still very low and Hong Kong's inflation remains high relative to the region, which means effective real interest rates are still in negative territory,\" said Raymond Leung, an economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.\n\nSince October 2009, the government has taken a series of steps to curb prices, including a 15 per cent property tax on foreign buyers, mortgage restrictions and taxes on quick resales. However, price pressures have continued to pose policy challenges for officials.\n\nThe HKMA also reduced the amount of debt that borrowers can service to 40 per cent from 50 per cent for all mortgage loans taken for non self-use properties. All measures will be effective immediately.\n\nHome prices in the former British colony have surged about 130 per cent since 2008 due to low interest rates, a supply shortage and ample liquidity.\n\nThe moves, which were announced after the market closed, will likely pressure Hong Kong's stock markets and property shares on Monday.\n\nThe property sub-index on Hong Kong's stock market fell 1 per cent on Friday ahead of the measures, underperforming the Hang Seng index's 0.3 per cent drop. The sub-index has risen around 5 per cent so far this year as expectations of further price increases at home have helped offset concerns about China's cooling real estate market.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/5e57a3d84f043ea8571581a7c08bf7eeb1ad3275e5496a5a4a66793eae1199aa?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Hong Kong took fresh measures to cool one of the world's most expensive real estate markets on Friday, reducing the amount of money home buyers can borrow and capping the amount of debt they can take after house prices hit a record high last year."}]}

It has weakened almost 4 percent in the year. \"We need a competitive exchange rate to support exports of manufactured goods and decrease non-productive imports,\" Mirza Adityaswara, the deputy governor, told Reuters on Friday. \"The current exchange rate is competitive enough because the rupiah has weakened.\"\n\nChief Economics Minister Sofyan Djalil said after a meeting with the president and Bank Indonesia's governor on Tuesday that the central bank had not intervened significantly to defend the weak rupiah because both the government and the central bank are focused on improving domestic economic conditions. \"Why would we use our foreign exchange reserves to defend a falling currency if it was because of external factors?\" Mr Djalil said.\n\nCentral bank officials said the weak rupiah is mainly a consequence of a broadly stronger dollar, noting that the rupiah has actually appreciated against several other currencies this year.\n\nData from Bank for International Settlements showed the real effective exchange rate of the rupiah appreciating since the start of 2014.\n\nIndonesia's exchange rate had a volatile 2014, falling sharply by 4.5 per cent in the second half of the year.

The currency is already languishing at its weakest level since 2009 as the oil-exporting nation suffers amid sliding crude prices.\n\n\"The market remains wary of 1MDB's ability to repay its debt,\" Irene Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist in Singapore at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, said Feb 24. \"The ringgit is vulnerable to the near-term outlook for oil prices. A recovery is difficult.\" A weaker currency is a concern for Malaysia because it pushes up the cost of servicing the second-highest external debt burden among Asia's developing nations. Further losses in the ringgit may hasten an investor exodus from Malaysian assets and hurt the government's efforts to rein in its budget deficit.\n\nThe ringgit has tumbled 7.4 per cent in the past three months, the most among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg, and touched a six-year low of 3.6460 a dollar on Feb 23.\n\nThat day, a report in Malaysia's Edge newspaper suggested 1MDB may need a 3 billion-ringgit (US$832 million) cash injection from the government to service debt, just two weeks after it repaid 2 billion ringgit in overdue loans. The investment fund responded by saying it would seek refinancing \"from the best available sources.\" The cabinet has rejected the proposal for aid, the Malaysian Insider news website reported Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"Whilst the 1MDB issues remain unresolved, there could still be a long shadow cast on the ringgit,\" said Vishnu Varathan, a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd., a unit of Japan's third-largest lender. The currency also suffers from \"general concerns about fiscal risks,\" he said.\n\nThose concerns are showing up in derivatives prices. The premium on options giving the right to sell the ringgit in three months, over those allowing for purchases, widened to as much as 2.36 percentage points on Feb 23, risk-reversal data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThat's approaching the peak of 2.45 percentage points on Jan 30, which was the highest since September 2013.\n\nMizuho cut its year-end ringgit forecast to 3.4 to the dollar on Feb. 4, from 3.35 previously. Strategists have struggled to keep pace with the currency's slide, and the median of 25 estimates in a Bloomberg survey puts it at 3.64 by Dec 31, just 0.6 per cent weaker than Friday's level of 3.6190.\n\nHSBC Holdings, last year's most-accurate forecaster of the ringgit in Bloomberg Rankings, is more pessimistic after revising its year-end estimate to 3.75 on Jan 30, from 3.57.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz told reporters in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 24 that the ringgit is \"undervalued\" and should return to trading in line with economic fundamentals. In a sign the central bank may have intervened to support the currency, foreign-exchange reserves dropped 16 per cent in the past eight months to a four-year low of US$111 billion.\n\nA depreciating ringgit makes it more expensive for the country to repay foreign borrowings. Malaysia's proportion of external debt to gross domestic product is 54.6 per cent, the highest among 13 Asian emerging markets tracked by Bloomberg after Sri Lanka and level with Pakistan.\n\n\"While a weaker currency will improve export competitiveness, the slide in oil prices will have a bigger impact on Malaysia due to the government's dependence on oil revenue,\" Mizuho's Mr Varathan said. \"The circular impact of a weaker ringgit on external debt and consequent fund outflows could also add to the vulnerabilities.\" Worsening Budget The ringgit started its recent slide in September, when a decline in oil prices gathered pace. Malaysia's currency is particularly vulnerable to the 40 per cent drop in Brent crude since then because of the country's status as the sole net exporter of oil among Asia's major economies. Energy accounts for almost 20 per cent of Malaysia's GDP.\n\nThe damage wrought to the economy led Prime Minister Najib Razak to increase the government's 2015 fiscal-deficit target in January to 3.2 per cent of GDP, from 3 per cent. He cut the growth estimate to a range of 4.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent, from as much as 6 per cent.\n\nGlobal funds responded to the drop in the currency by reducing holdings of Malaysian government and corporate debt by more than 25 billion ringgit in November and December, the sharpest decline since mid-2013, according to the most recent data from the central bank. The weaker exchange rate, together with the loss of investment and oil revenue, may make it harder for Malaysia to achieve its target of attaining developed-nation status by 2020.\n\n\"It's difficult to say where the support will come from for the ringgit,\" said Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based currency strategist at Scotiabank, which sees the currency tumbling 4 per cent to 3.76 per dollar by year-end. \"Most factors are still fundamentally bearish.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2faee3a6e8f94a4bf00d1847cf31d1dea92f0f40cb4cb50ca1a483d8c38e9840?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Malaysia's task in propping up Asia's worst- performing currency just got a lot tougher."}]}

While there are no official figures for how much of the hidden money may be in Switzerland, more than two-thirds of funds that surfaced in Italy's most recent amnesty were from the Alpine nation, a sign of the potential hit to Swiss banks.\n\nThe deal gives the asset managers, already grappling with costly investigations from the US to France, a chance to retain clients even as bank secrecy is abandoned.\n\n\"This agreement is very good for Swiss banks, we needed it desperately,\" said Lars Schlichting, a partner and attorney-at-law at KPMG Holding in Lugano, Switzerland. \"Without it we could have lost all Italian clients because we cannot have undeclared money anymore.\"\n\nItalian clients will have to pay between 7 per cent and 12 per cent of their secret assets in taxes and penalties if they voluntarily disclose accounts to the authorities, compared with as much as 40 per cent if Switzerland hadn't reached the agreement, Mr Schlichting estimated.\n\n\"Italy was the biggest remaining market, for which a solution on undeclared assets had to be found,\" after the UK, France and Germany, said Andreas Venditti, a banking analyst at Vontobel in Zurich. \"Banks may be facing billions of gross outflows, but the biggest clients will probably keep their accounts here after declaring them.\"\n\nKPMG has already advised about 300 Italian clients this year on voluntary disclosure, starting with just three or four a week in January and increasing to about 70 last week, Mr Schlichting said. Of the 300 clients, only one decided to withdraw all money from Switzerland for personal reasons, while some clients chose to add to funds here after declaring them, he said.\n\n\"Italian individuals have a lack of trust toward the administration in Italy,\" said Louis Macchi, a Lugano-based tax adviser for PwC. \"This is one of the reasons why I believe clients will continue to have their money in Switzerland.\"\n\nSwitzerland is the world's largest centre for offshore funds, managing about US$2.3 trillion for clients who don't reside here, according to estimates by the Boston Consulting Group.

The Naples, Florida-based company said it's also reviewing its leadership, organisational talent, data integrity and decision-support systems. \"While the full benefit of these and other actions will take time, I am confident that Hertz is on the right path to deliver improved performance and value creation,\" Mr Tague said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It added that it will continue to operate as usual in providing customer services while it puts in place a scheme of arrangement. It had also said in its recent announcement that despite some cash flow difficulties, there was a reasonable prospect or rehabilitating the company if it was allowed to carry on its business \"without the threat and distraction of proceedings and other action which may be taken by its creditors\".

The boost in revenue was due in part to its four newly acquired student accommodation assets in the United Kingdom, and an increase in capacity of its workers accommodation. The group's revenue from its accommodation business grew by 90 per cent to hit S$24.1 million in Q4.\n\nFor the full year ended December, the group hit a record net profit of S$111.2 million, up 21 per cent from S$92.2 million a year ago. This included fair valuation gains of S$62.8 million and one-off trading profits which amounted to S$17.3 million.\n\nRevenue of S$84.4 million was 48 per cent higher compared to a year ago, on the back of strong performance by the accommodation business which contributed 62 per cent growth in revenue, driven by the expansion of both its workers and student accommodation businesses.\n\nRevenue from the group's optical disc business contributed S$8 million for the year as demand for physical optical disc media from its customers continued to decline.\n\nLooking ahead, Centurion said the outlook for its accommodation business remains \"encouraging\", supported by stable demand for both its workers and student accommodations businesses, and contribution from three new accommodation assets that will be completed in 2015.\n\nIt added that it intends to unveil more details on its plans to set up a workers accommodation Reit. This will allow the group \"to unlock value in certain assets as well as to recycle capital to pursue its growth strategies\".\n\nThe group has proposed to pay a second and final dividend of 1.0 cent per ordinary share for FY2014. Combined with the special interim dividend of 0.5 cents declared in Q1, the total amount to be distributed is 1.5 cents per ordinary share.\n\nCenturion's counter ended trading up half a cent, at 59 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The approval process has also been streamlined.\n\nIn Taiwan, insurance companies have been permitted to invest in overseas property since May 2013, although some stringent requirements still apply.\n\nSimilarly, in South Korea, the Financial Services Commission proposed to abolish the approval process for foreign-property purchases by insurance firms.\n\nMr Buser said hotel real estate is seen as an ideal asset for insurers diversifying their portfolios because fixed-income lease terms are often longer than those for other asset types, and yields are now higher than for traditional real estate segments.\n\n\"This has made hotels in large European cities such as Paris, Frankfurt and particularly London, attractive to Asian investors,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Asia's limited investable assets drives its insurers into other regions.\n\nCBRE predicts that the series of rule relaxations, coupled with the rise in the total value of assets held by Asian insurance firms, will raise insurers' investment assets from US$129.3 billion in 2013 to US$204.2 billion in 2018.\n\nThis translates into additional inflows of about US$75 billion into real estate, including direct and indirect investment.\n\nThis year, a large portion of global hotel transactions will be completed by Asian capital, CBRE said, judging from the recent high-profile acquisitions by Chinese investment groups in overseas real estate.\n\nFor instance, Chinese conglomerate Fosun acquired French holiday resorts group Club Med this year for US$25 million a share, valuing the company at US$953.5 million.\n\nIn response to the growing interest in hotels in Europe, the Middle East and Africa - a region known collectively as EMEA - CBRE Hotels has created the position of director of CBRE Hotels, EMEA, and appointed Jileen Loo to the post to focus on European-bound global capital, with an emphasis on Asian investors.\n\nShe said: \"We expect further overseas hotel acquisitions by Asian insurance firms as regulators gain more confidence about overseeing such investments, and insurers become more savvy about investing globally.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

James McRitchie, a private shareholder who often files corporate governance resolutions, said on Wednesday that Citigroup officials told him they will back a proposal he submitted for a vote at the company's annual meeting in April.\n\nIt calls for including on Citigroup proxy statement and voting forms candidates nominated by shareholders who may not own much stock, a change known as \"proxy access\". Mr McRitchie said he expects other companies to make similar reforms soon. \"It's the beginning of a huge wave,\" he said.\n\nA bank representative confirmed it will support the shareholder resolution. \"Citi has always worked to stay at the forefront of good governance and we value robust engagement with our shareholders,\" the bank said.\n\nGeneral Electric Co said on Feb 11 it had put a similar change in place with new bylaws. Advocates say the change helps make boards less insular and more responsive to investor concerns.\n\nBut some business groups including the US Chamber of Commerce worry such rules could advance the agendas of activist investors who buy stakes in companies and then lobby for strategic shifts or spinoffs.\n\nThe shareholder resolution that Citigroup will support would allow groups of up to 20 shareholders who together own at least 3 per cent of company stock, held for at least three years, to nominate directors for up to 20 per cent of its board seats, terms similar to those GE put in place.\n\nMr McRitchie said he hoped Citigroup would quickly adopt the changes if approved by a majority of shareholders. Its annual meeting is scheduled for April 28. REUTERS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

this is also a security issue as it fuels sectarianism, violent extremism and conflict in Iraq,\" she said in a statement.\n\nThe jihadists have controlled Mosul, Iraq's second city, since seizing it in a June offensive that saw them conquer large parts of the country.\n\nThey have systematically destroyed heritage sites, including several Sunni Muslim shrines.\n\nThe Mosul region was home to a mosaic of minorities, including the Assyrian Christians, who consider themselves to be the region's indigenous people.\n\nSeveral Assyrian villages were seized by IS fighters in neighbouring Syria in recent days and at least 220 people kidnapped.\n\nMs Bokova said the Mosul destruction was a violation of UN Security Council's resolution 2199.\n\nThe resolution was adopted earlier this month in a bid to curb trafficking of looted antiquities from Iraq and Syria, which is considered a key source of funding for the IS group.\n\nReferring to the destroyed artefacts in the Mosul museum, the man appearing in the video released on Thursday says: \"Even if they are worth billions of dollars, we don't care.\"\n\nBut in his Conflict Antiquities blog, Dr Samuel Hardy, an archaeologist and criminologist, argues that the jihadists are only destroying the bulky pieces that cannot be smuggled out of the country.\n\n\"All this video really shows is that they are willing to destroy things that they can't ship out and sell off,\" he wrote.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

Tapas-Sake Bar. After March 31, the festival will continue with monthly wine-pairing dinners at various local establishments.\n\nSenior manager of gourmet and festivals at Sphere Exhibits, Ian Lim, explains that it decided to focus on European cuisine because \"Europe has been recognised as world leaders in gastronomy, with many of the top chefs trained in the traditional culinary bastions of France and Italy\". He adds: \"Plus, in recent years, new culinary nations like Spain and Norway have cooked up a storm in the culinary world.\"\n\nSphere Exhibits, a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore Press Holdings, is organising the event along with food and beverage consultancy Poulose Associates. It also organises other food events such as Italian food festival Gusto Italiano, which is where the idea for Salon Gourmet came about in the first place.\n\nSays Mr Lim: \"Seeing the success of Gusto Italiano, some of the other European restaurants that we were having conversations with lamented to us that the other non-Italian European restaurants should have a platform similar to Gusto Italiano to showcase what they can do. From there, we decided to create a festival which focuses on European cuisines.\"\n\nHeadliners for Salon Gourmet are two Michelin- starred guest masterchefs - Ronan Kervarrec (two Michelin-starred La Chevre D'or in Nice) and Jean-Yves Leuranguer (one Michelin-starred Fouquet's in Paris). From Singapore, some of the participating locally-based European chefs are Chef Stephane Istel of Bar-Roque Grill, Chef Nicolas Reynard of Absinthe, and Chef Pepe Moncayo of BAM!.\n\nChef Reynard will host a dinner called Classical French Journey, paired with the wines of Domaine Fernand et Laurent Pillot, as a showcase of his personal approach to French cuisine.\n\n\"What is important for me is to cook my own dishes and show the specialities of my home town of Provence, and I always put all my heart into it to be sure my customers enjoy the food and understand the culture,\" says Chef Reynard.\n\nChef Moncayo of BAM! specialises in sake at his own restaurant, so he is taking his event at Salon Gourmet (Modern Spanish Cuisines with the wines of Emilio Moro) as an opportunity to return to his Spanish roots. He says: \"Salon Gourmet is going to be the very first event in which we'll be pairing our food with wine - a beautiful Spanish one from Emilio Moro winery. It's going to be a patriotic event for me.\"\n\nUltimately, the event hopes to give Singaporeans a deeper appreciation of European cuisine, as well as a \"gastronomic experience\", says Mr Lim of Sphere Exhibits. \"Such gastronomic experiences can be hard to come by on a normal private visit to the restaurants without paying through the nose. Beyond that, we also hope to offer the opportunity for aspiring home chefs to learn from the very best of our resident European culinary talents through the cooking workshops.\"\n\nFor more information, log on to\n\nhttp://salongourmet.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

About 32 million tonnes of it end up in municipal landfills, at a cost of about US$1.5 billion a year to local governments.\n\nThe problem is not limited to the United States.\n\nThe report estimates that a third of all the food produced in the world is never consumed, and the total cost of that food waste could be as high as US$400 billion a year. Reducing food waste from 20 to 50 per cent globally could save US$120 billion to US$300 billion a year by 2030, the report found.\n\n\"Food waste is a global issue, and tackling it is a priority,\" said Richard Swannell, director of sustainable food systems at the Waste and Resources Action Program, or WRAP, an antiwaste organisation in Britain that compiled the new report. \"The difficulty is often in knowing where to start and how to make the biggest economic and environmental savings.\"\n\nThe food discarded by retailers and consumers in the most developed countries would be more than enough to feed all of the world's 870 million hungry people, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.\n\nBut it is not just those countries that have problems with food waste. The report showed that it is also an issue in African countries like South Africa.\n\nThe problem is expected to grow worse as the world's population increases, the report found. By 2030, when the global middle class expands, consumer food waste will cost US$600 billion a year, unless actions are taken to reduce the waste, according to the report.\n\nFood waste is not only a social cost, but it contributes to growing environmental problems like climate change, experts say, with the production of food consuming vast quantities of water, fertiliser and land. The fuel that is burned to process, refrigerate and transport it also adds to the environmental cost.\n\nMost food waste is thrown away in landfills, where it decomposes and emits methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Globally, it creates 3.3 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases annually, about 7 per cent of the total emissions, according to the report.\n\nThe UN agency points out that methane gas from the world's landfills are surpassed in emissions by only China and the United States.\n\n\"Seven per cent is not the largest contributor of greenhouse gasses, but it's not an insignificant amount,\" said Helen Mountford, the director of economics at the World Resources Institute. \"But this is one area - reducing food waste - where we can make a difference.\"\n\nOver the past several years, some US cities and counties, including New York City, have started programmes to tackle the issue. Hennepin County, Minnesota, the state's most populous county, provides grants from US$10,000 to US$50,000 to local business and nonprofits to help recycle food products or turn them into compost.\n\n\"There is still a lot in the waste stream,\" said Paul Kroening, supervising environmentalist at Hennepin County Environmental Services. \"We are just scratching the surface.\"\n\nA coalition of food industry trade groups, the Food Waste Reduction Alliance, has also increased efforts to combat food waste. Meghan Stasz, the director of sustainability for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a member of the alliance, said the group was working with supermarket chains to reduce waste by clarifying expiration dates and selling smaller portions of food.\n\nMs Stasz said the group was also getting its members to donate more food and make changes in manufacturing processes to reduce the amount of wasted food. One member, the giant food company ConAgra, changed the way it placed dough in shell for its potpies and saved 235 tonnes of dough in a year.\n\nMr Swannell of WRAP applauded those efforts but said more still needed to be done.\n\n\"Awareness of food waste has risen, but we need to do more to tie that awareness to actions on the ground,\" he said. \"We need to find better ways to deal with food waste, but we need to prevent it in the first place.\" NYT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But four university students are blowing the dust off this old-school practice, and giving it a new lease of life as part of their final-year project - The Platform Collective. Their website acts as a congregator for small local businesses who are on a tight budget, and would prefer to barter their skills instead of spending extra money hiring someone. For example, a new cafe looking for help designing their flyers could set up an account on the site, and exchange their cafe's potential event space for someone else's design expertise.\n\n\"We created The Platform Collective to provide a community for startups. It's a great way to help businesses offset upfront costs and ensures that collaborations are based on good ideas and not just the right price,\" says Isaac Tan, 25, one of the people behind The Platform Collective.\n\nSo far, they have spent only about S$150 on purchasing the domain and backend for their website, and have walked the walk by bartering for most of the other elements of their startup.\n\nOver the next two weeks, The Platform Collective will be holding four talks at various locations in Singapore, as an opportunity for knowledge-sharing and networking. They will cover topics like ideas, passion, branding and failure. As for the future of their project, Tan says: \"Our final-year project ends in April, and we are in the midst of planning for the next phase - monetisation. We don't know how far this idea will go, but we're planning to carry on with it.\"\n\nBy Rachel Loi\n\nCONCERT\n\nChristina Perri: The Head or Heart Tour\n\nHERE'S a rock and roll fairytale come true: just five years ago, Christina Perri was working at a Los Angeles cafe by day trying to make ends meet and recording by night to live her dreams of becoming a pop star. But when the then-unsigned singer-songwriter's strings-driven power ballad, Jar of Hearts, was picked to be used on the reality TV show, So You Think You Can Dance, it became an instant hit and propelled the Philadelphia native to fame.\n\nMore success followed with the release of her major label debut album, Lovestrong, in 2011 and she scored an even-bigger hit with the soaring A Thousand Years, which featured on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 soundtrack.\n\nIn between writing and recording her second album, Head or Heart, Perri played Singapore in 2012 at the Kallang Theatre. She's back with an even-bigger show on Friday night at Resorts World Sentosa on the back of that record which sold 40,000 copies in the week of its release and made its debut at number four on the Billboard albums chart.\n\nIncidentally, the latest single off Head or Heart is Be My Forever, a duet Perri performed with English folk-pop sensation Ed Sheeran, who will be playing his own sold-out show in Singapore a fortnight later.\n\nAhead of the gig, Perri says: \"All my dreams came true when touring on Lovestrong. And now I've dreamt up all new dreams. I'm excited because I don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nBy Dylan Tan\n\nART\n\nGillman Barracks\n\nIF you didn't get a chance to check out Gillman Barracks at its best during January's Singapore Art Week, then this would be the last week to do so. Exhibitions closing on March 1 include the terrific show at the Centre for Contemporary Art by Chinese superstar Yang Fudong, for which there's a talk on Feb 27 at 7pm by curator and assistant professor Michelle Lim from NTU School of Art, Design and Media. Also closing this weekend are the exhibitions by Jimmy Ong at Fost, Maryanto at Yeo Workshop, Gregory Halili at Silverlens and Winner Jumalon at Yavuz.\n\nWhile there, you should certainly catch the first solo show by Singapore's Wong Lip Chin at Michael Janssen gallery.

In fact, her interest in baking started only about two years ago, when she was still working as an air stewardess and had some free time on her off-days.\n\nNow, she runs a quaint little bakery on Beach Road which sells an impressive variety of moist and fluffy cupcakes, going for S$3.80 each, S$14 for four, or S$20 for six.\n\nSome of her regular flavours include red velvet, peanut butter and Valhorna chocolate, but what gives her the edge is that her original flavours are definitely worth a try, such as the avocado gula melaka, miso caramel, carrot cake, or strawberry balsamic.\n\nBy Rachel Loi\n\nDINING\n\nAlvaro Palacios Wine Dinner\n\nFOR just one night only, be transported to the vineyards of Priorat, the southwest region of Catalonia.\n\nFollowing a trip last year to Priorat, Stephane Soret, Raffles Singapore's wine director, was inspired to recreate his experience by hosting an exclusive Wine Dinner at Raffles Grill on March 7. Mr Soret's carefully curated wine list for the evening reflects the refined quality of the wines he tasted and consists of wines by Spanish producer Alvaro Palacios, who is said to have single-handedly rejuvenated Priorat's old vineyards.\n\nRaffles Singapore executive sous chef Mickael Le Calvez will be creating a menu with dishes that complement and highlight the wines featured during the evening.\n\nDinner will begin with a glass of Herencia Remondo Placet Rioja 2011, a sensational white wine paired with Alaskan King Crab, Pink Radish Remoulade and Azafran Salsa. Notes of pineapple and green mango give the wine a crisp and refreshing taste that complement the crab's delicate sweetness.\n\nOther menu highlights include a classic Spanish dish of Grilled Octopus, Iberico Chorizo, Bomba Rice and Piperade Sauce paired with the full-bodied and berry-nuanced Petalos Bierzo 2012, considered one of the most sought-after wines from its region.\n\nDiners can also savour Suckling Pig Cutlets with Roasted Stuffed Piquillo Pepper, Beetroot and \"Spinola\" Xeres Reduction paired with a Bodega Palacios Remondo La Montesa 2011 that yields a heady perfume of quince, pomegranate and orange.\n\nBy Tay Suan Chiang\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A very dysfunctional family is furious at a child who broke all the rules and lived for decades beyond his means, subsisting on gifts and loans from his richer siblings. For five years now, the child has been trying to clean up his act, but at the same time has had to put up with severe punishment. Now, under the yoke, the child is finally rebelling at what he regards as unjust treatment.\n\nEurope is at an impasse. The Eurogroup of finance ministers demands that Greece respect the existing bailout programme. The Greek government resists accepting the status quo that it was elected to overturn.\n\nGreek people have risen up against the austerity policies of the past five years. Yet they have not been given a clear vision. The big question is: How can Greece stay within the family, abide by its rules and yet still prosper?\n\nAlexis Tsipras was voted in to bring change. For the left around the world, the new prime minister is an iconic figure. Now he has to deliver. The task is to slay the monster of the domestic establishment that has kept society hostage.\n\nFor decades, Greece developed its economy on an outdated model. The state absorbs resources from the private sector to feed the needs of a political elite, its voters, special interests and some oligarchs. Mr Tsipras has not previously been in government; he is from outside the system. He has but a few months to prove he can prevent his government from becoming absorbed by battles of yesteryear. Should he achieve that goal in a lasting manner, he will go down in history as the reformer of the modern Greek state.\n\nMr Tsipras was not voted in to bring back the drachma. He has to abide by the European mores that require mutual compromises to achieve a consensus. The premier has to promote, with his peers, a faster move towards fixing the European governance deficit. For the common currency to survive, further euro area political, fiscal and economic integration is necessary. In parallel, Mr Tsipras has to convince his fellow Greeks of the need to develop a modern and productive economy based on a thriving business environment. Domestically, this will involve rolling back some pre-election promises.\n\nThere are many performers in this drama, combining the roles of spectator, actor, and playwright. Can trust be rebuilt? Will the family survive intact? To enable these positive developments, a deal must be struck: less fiscal austerity coupled with more growth-enhancing reforms. The next few days will show whether we are on the right track. I am hopeful that this will be the case.

In fact, both the United Kingdom and the United States are grappling with a perceived STEM labour shortage that, if not addressed, could lead to shortfalls in sectors such as engineering, computer science and technology. This has led to concerted moves to promote STEM education.\n\nIn the UK, efforts to promote STEM education have resulted in the number of students in STEM courses reaching record highs. According to figures from Higher Education Funding Council, 98,000 students were accepted on to STEM undergraduate courses in the 2013-14 school year, a record number. In the US, concern over dwindling interest in STEM led to the launch of the \"Educate to Innovate\" campaign in 2009, which promotes STEM subjects among students and also addresses the shortage of teachers with the skills to teach in these fields. A more recent push for STEM is reflected in the Obama Administration's 2015 budget that invests US$2.9 billion in federal programmes on STEM education, a 3.7 per cent increase from 2014.\n\nSingapore, with its traditional focus on maths and science at the primary and secondary education levels, has also started to place a strong focus on STEM at the higher levels.\n\nDriven by Singapore's rapid economic growth and the gradual move towards a knowledge-based economy, there are now more opportunities for further study, resulting in a growing cohort of technically well-educated and creative individuals.\n\nHowever, promoting math and science in schools is not a panacea for a vibrant and self-sustaining STEM economy. There needs to be a \"value chain\" that supports STEM careers and STEM talent development in the long term. A mismatch in job opportunities or career pathways could force graduates to leave their fields or seek opportunities in other countries and cause a potentially devastating brain drain.\n\nIn the UK, there is growing evidence that many STEM graduates end up in non-STEM fields despite the job opportunities available. A similar trend is arising in the US - most maths and science majors don't end up working in their fields of study. One reason that UK STEM graduates gave for not working in their fields of study was the lack of career support at the university level. While a majority wished to pursue a STEM career, many did not seek career guidance at a university level but felt it would have helped them understand how their degree courses would relate to future career and occupations. As for the US, a large proportion of STEM talent are forced to leave due to restrictive immigration laws. Though more than 40 per cent of STEM students in Master's and PhD programmes are from foreign countries, these graduates face a tough battle to obtain their green cards and have to leave the country after they graduate - taking their skills with them .\n\nThere is a critical need for a supportive ecosystem to make careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics attractive, fulfilling, sustainable and rewarding - so that we as a civilisation can progress, innovate and make the world a better place.\n\nWe need to think quite deeply about these issues, beyond just education, and approach STEM not merely as areas of study but as enablers of innovation, creativity and lateral thinking. In addition, the startup culture needs to be more conducive and less averse to risk and failure.\n\nSTABLE FUNDING\n\nTo keep a country attractive for research and prevent a brain drain, one must look at developing an interrelated landscape of education, culture, career pathways and funding. Education aside, STEM professions and career pathways also need to be reassessed to make them more relevant and customised to meet current needs.\n\nIn Singapore, the traditional career structure for engineers works relatively well today, but the same model derived from existing UK and US models does not seem to work as well for biomedical scientists. For instance, one problem for biomedical researchers is that they are judged by how many publications they put out instead of looking at impact, projects, collaborations and achievements. Publishing a paper is an excellent outcome, but it should be just one step towards an end goal - that of translational research that leads to real-world solutions, better patient care and practicable outcomes.\n\nAt A*STAR, we have moved away from the numbers game. Instead of looking at publications as a measure for success, we look at what truly reflects our real-world impact. This could be the industry collaborations we have sparked, the companies we have anchored in Singapore as a result of our R&D capabilities, how we have managed to help local enterprises grow, the take-up for the patents and licenses we developed, and most importantly, the economic and social impact we have created.\n\nOf course apart from an environment that supports translational research, you need money - stable funding that supports the R&D landscape. I have experienced every sort of funding in my life - and been responsible for some controversial decisions to revise funding models. My own view is to keep funding systems mixed and varied.\n\nYou don't want chances of grant success to be so low that scientists spend most of their time futilely writing for grants instead of doing real work - yet you want some level of competition. At A*STAR, we have a system of mixed funding: having a core of funds that keep things ticking over, while also applying for projects competitively. I personally find this to be a good mix. It is stimulating but also reassuring to know we can keep things moving along. Having multiple, independent grant sources that encourage collaboration with industry and other sectors is also important. Based on the European and Singapore experience, this is a system that is taking off and doing well. Through joint R&D projects, A*STAR has attracted multinational companies to invest in Singapore and anchor their R&D facilities here, thereby creating high-value R&D jobs. Singapore's Biomedical Sciences Initiative as a whole has also resulted in the number of biomedical R&D jobs in the public and private sectors doubling from 2,150 in 2002 to 5,427 in 2012.\n\nWith the competition for talent at an all-time high, countries that are doing well in their research landscape need to be careful that this success is based on their own merits rather than others' failures; that is to say, creating pull factors rather than benefiting from push factors. And while Singapore is in a good position, it needs to continue to aspire to attract and retain top talent by making it such a great environment that people want to stay here.\n\nGood infrastructure, funding, opportunities and ease of relocation are all important - as are moves to give people more space and time to do the research that matters. I've seen Singapore make great strides in the last 10 years. Most recently, some good research outcomes have been made. We recently developed new drug formulations to effectively combat antibiotic-resistant superbugs in respiratory illnesses; created a molecular test kit which predicts kidney cancer patients' survival and drug responses; identified new biomarkers for cancer and other diseases; and now we're even helping in the global fight against Ebola.\n\nAs STEM becomes increasingly integral as a building block of our world, its growth cannot be sustained unless we take the time to support, nurture and drive it. Only then can we empower society to continue progressing. Supporting STEM does not stop at the promotion of STEM education. It has to be a long-term investment and we need immense patience to follow it through, in order to reap all the rich rewards it will bring.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

EU member states jealously guard the right to decide their own energy mix.\n\nGermany, for example, depends largely on Russian gas and is shutting its nuclear plants; Poland relies almost entirely on its own coal mines while Britain favours renewables and is investing heavily in new nuclear plants.\n\nThe Commission tackled this head on, calling on the 28 to sink their differences and create a single market to provide the environmentally sound, cheap and secure energy needed for the future.\n\nIts report said this \"fundamental transformation of Europe's energy system\" will require investment in resources and infrastructure of more than one trillion euros by 2020.\n\nSome 75 per cent of the EU housing stock is energy inefficient, the transport sector relies on oil, 90 per cent of which is imported, while distorting subsidies cost 120 billion euros, the report said.\n\nWorse still, EU electricity prices are 30 per cent higher than in the United States and gas prices more than double, putting the bloc at a serious economic disadvantage.\n\n\"Europe needs to make the right choices now,\" the report said, adding that it should seize the \"historic opportunity\" of current low oil and gas prices.\n\nThe global situation including the standoff with Russia over Ukraine also showed the need for action, the Commission added.\n\n\"The political challenges over the last months have shown that diversification of energy sources, suppliers and routes is crucial for ensuring secure and resilient energy supplies,\" it said.\n\nRussia supplies about a third of all EU gas needs, with half of that amount transiting Ukraine. It also remains the sole source for many former Soviet republics in eastern Europe.\n\nEarlier this week, Russian giant Gazprom warned it could cut off supplies to Ukraine, threatening a repeat of 2006 and 2009 when Moscow tightened the screws on Kiev.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Commission recommended that work on the EU's Southern Corridor pipeline, bringing gas from central Asia, \"must be intensified\". President Vladimir Putin abruptly cancelled Russia's South Stream pipeline in December, saying the EU was deliberately sabotaging a project designed to bypass Ukraine and avoid supply problems.\n\n\"When the conditions are right the EU will consider reframing the energy relationship with Russia based on a level playing field,\" the Commission said.\n\nBusiness groups largely welcomed the Commission report but environmentalists found serious fault.\n\n\"The proposed holistic approach is a good foundation to balance the EU's energy, climate and industrial challenges better than in the past,\" the BUSINESSEUROPE group said.\n\nEU energy ministers will take up the recommendations next month, with work to turn them into legislative proposals for member states to agree likely to take some time.

This year, the holiday was in February. \"In the context of stabilising macroeconomic policies including recent tax cuts and increased infrastructure spending, market demand rose and business confidence strengthened,\" the NBS said, adding that stabilising crude oil and raw material prices were also important factors.\n\nThe services PMI showed growth in that sector picked back up to 53.9, up from 53.7 in January, which the NBS attributed in part to strong holiday spending.\n\nAccounting for 48 per cent of China's US$10.2 trillion economy last year, the services sector has weathered the growth downturn better than factories have, partly because it depends less on foreign demand.\n\nFrom the breakdown of factory data, economic performance is uncertain. Employment, in negative territory for the last 12 months, contracted further to 47.8, its weakest reading since February 2013.\n\nOutput, while remaining positive, declined from 51.7 to 51.4. New orders rose slightly to 50.4, but export orders and imports both remained below 50, although the rate of contraction decreased.\n\nThe production and business outlook, however, rebounded sharply to again show growth, at 54, compared to the previous month's 47.4.\n\nBut the overall PMI figure remained below 50 and that, in combination with earlier negative surprises from trade and inflation data, appears to have sparked the central bank to act more quickly than some analysts anticipated.\n\nLate on Saturday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) cut interest rates, its second easing move in four weeks, as regulators show signs of intensifying concern that the drumbeat of lacklustre data since the fourth quarter is hurting investment and consumption.\n\nThe PBOC had already cut interest rates in November and reduced the reserve requirement - the ratio of cash that banks must set aside as reserves - earlier in February, the first such reduction in over two years.\n\nA newspaper owned by the central bank warned on Wednesday that China was dangerously close to slipping into deflation, highlighting the nervousness among policymakers about a sputtering economy not gaining speed.\n\nThe final February reading for the HSBC manufacturing PMI survey will be announced on Monday. The flash estimate showed factory growth edged up to a four-month high in February, but export orders shrank at their fastest rate in 20 months.\n\nA housing slump, erratic growth in exports and a state-led slowdown in investment to help restructure China's economy dragged growth to 7.4 percent last year - a level not seen since 1990.\n\nReflecting China's \"new normal\" of slower but better-quality growth, economists at state think-tanks said the government is likely to lower its 2015 economic growth target to around 7 percent, from last year's 7.5 percent.\n\nSunday's PMIs are the last official Chinese data before this week's opening of the annual session of China's legislature, where leaders will announce a 2015 growth target.

Passenger yield measures the average fare paid per mile per passenger. The company's shares closed down more than 3 per cent.\n\nMr Topcu also said the airline was in the final stages of arranging its first planned bond issue to diversify its sources of aircraft financing and that this was expected to be completed in the first half of the year.\n\nThe bond would be at least US$500 million and could reach a volume of US$2-3 billion with a maturity of up to 14 years, chief financial officer Coskun Kilic said, adding that it would be used to finance existing aircraft as well as new planes.\n\nMr Topcu said Turkish Airlines was in the early stage of talks with Malaysia Airlines over leasing aircraft. He said the carrier would need larger Boeing 747-8 and Airbus A380 aircraft in the future but no management decision had yet been taken.\n\nA senior executive at the airline said in January that it was considering expanding its fleet and was studying a list of Boeing and Airbus models including the double-decker A380.\n\nNet profit rose to 1.82 billion lira (S$997 million) from 683 million lira and in line with a Reuters poll forecast of 1.81 billion.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/low-taxes-may-be-luxury-hong-kong-singapore", "site_title": "Low taxes may be luxury for Hong Kong, Singapore", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nLow taxes may be luxury for Hong Kong, Singapore\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Feb 26, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nBEFORE now, no one would have described the leaders of Hong Kong or Singapore as Asian Robin Hoods. Both cities have earned well-deserved international reputations for high efficiency and low taxes, with income taxes topping out at 15 per cent in Hong Kong and 20 per cent in Singapore. Their decades of sustained prosperity would seem proof of the virtues of trickle-down economics.\n\nThat dogma may finally be shifting, though. Clearly worried about rising inequality, Singapore's government this week announced the first increase in the top income tax rate in decades, raising levies on the richest 5 per cent of citizens. Even Hong Kong's fabled billionaires are concerned about the widening gap between haves and have-nots, which helped drive last fall's Umbrella Revolution. Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man, has said that he's losing sleep over the issue. Henderson's Lee Shau Kee has begun donating land to non-profit organisations to build old-age homes and youth hostels.\n\nYet in its own Budget this week, Hong Kong resisted lifting taxes on the wealthy, instead tossing a few sweeteners at the poor and elderly, and trimming personal taxes slightly. Apparently Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying believes that the city can still afford to coddle its tycoons. That's an increasingly questionable assumption.\n\nEarlier this month, the Group of 20 for the first time signalled joint concern about mounting inequality across the world economy. As French economist Thomas Piketty argues in his best-selling Capital in the Twenty-First Century, returns on money have outpaced gross domestic product over the past 30 to 40 years. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development says that the rich-poor gap in most of its member countries has reached its most egregious levels in three decades. The top 10 per cent now pockets 9.5 times more than the poorest 10 per cent, up from 7 times in the 1980s. Things look to get even worse. Oxfam predicts the richest one per cent will control most of the world's wealth by 2016.\n\nGrowth in Asia has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, but at a cost. According to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), four-fifths of Asians - nearly three billion people - live in nations where inequality has been rising for 20 years now. That's deadened the benefits of even rapid growth, meaning that Asia's output tends to be more about quantity than quality.\n\nThe rise of China in particular has been both boon and curse. While the mainland provides a huge market for Singaporean and Hong Kong entrepreneurs to tap, the powerful competitive forces its 1.3 billion people have unleashed are dragging down Asian wages. At the same time, rich Chinese are buying up property in Hong Kong and Singapore, pushing prices out of the orbits of average families (although in Singapore at least, measures to pop the luxury property bubble are having some effect).\n\nTIME FOR PRAGMATISM\n\nThe answer, development economists agree, is for governments to strive to raise productivity, curtail corruption, invest in education and establish secure safety nets. In a report last year, the ADB recommended four steps to reduce inequality: implementing more efficient fiscal policies that invest in education and support poor families; developing new industries; supporting small-and-midsize enterprises; and looking for innovative solutions to spread the benefits of growth.\n\nSingapore's Budget tries to address all these points. But it also acknowledges that the government needs to collect more revenues if it's going to build Western-style welfare systems to support the most vulnerable households. By contrast, Hong Kong's government still seems focused on growth as a panacea; its Budget offers additional relief to the tourism industry and other businesses affected by the weeks of pro-democracy protests. The measures do little to address the fundamental problem - an economic structure that's impeding the ability of lower-income households to move upward.\n\nWhat Singapore's government at least seems to recognise is that urgent action is needed - bold investments in affordable housing, social-safety nets and job training that perhaps only a tax on top earners can finance in short order. The city is already ranked 26th out of 136 economies for income inequality; standing pat will only continue to hollow out the middle class. As in Hong Kong, what used to be a competitive advantage - a generous tax regime that attracted businesses and talent from around the world - may simply be unaffordable.\n\nThe Umbrella Revolution showed that fears about social unrest are not idle. Along with attractive business environments, Singaporeans and Hong Kongers long prided themselves on something else: pragmatism. It's time to exercise some.

We are just being prudent,\" he said.\n\nThe weak quarterly results dragged down its net profit for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2014, which fell 27 per cent to 47.6 billion ringgit.\n\nPetronas expects crude oil prices to hover around the US$55 a barrel level for 2015.\n\nPetronas group CFO George Ratilal said the company's average crude price for the fourth quarter was around US$70 a barrel as compared to US$109 a barrel a year earlier, adding that profitability will be hurt in 2015 due to lower prices.\n\n\"Outlook is going to be bad for 2015.

For example, he has created outdoor furniture from engineered wood by timber company Samko, inspired by his memory of his visits to ABC Brickworks market in his younger days.\n\n\"I used to think that the name represented how the HDB flats were stacked in many layers of brick-like rectangular blocks,\" he said. His design for the outdoor furniture, taking a cue from that, is aptly titled Brickworks; comprising \"brick\" made from timber, they come with concealed magnets so the furniture can be easily reconfigured.\n\nFor Mr Loh, making good design accessible is key in establishing Singapore as a global centre for design. \"Design thinking could be like a dialect we speak in Singapore and a cultural foundation on which we leverage to elevate ourselves as a forward-thinking economy,\" he said.\n\nWho: Zhang Zhoujie\n\nParticipating in Maison & Objet Asia\n\nInspired by the ancient Chinese philosophy of Taoism, Zhang Zhoujie believes his role as a designer is to \"interfere as little as possible\" and let nature take control. \"Taoism is a way to find what is true in nature,\" he said.\n\nHe will take part in Maison & Objet Asia's specially-curated showcase called Rising Asian Talents. For this, he will present work based on the concept of \"spontaneity\" in a digital environment.\n\nHe said: \"I will exhibit my Digital Chair, which was generated from my computer according to human-body figures. It's a kind of new way to think about design and furniture in a digital context.\" With many facets and finished in polished metal, the chair is not one that will easily go into mass production - and that's part of the point. \"We all know the market is huge and fast, so there are some design products that go to market even without finalising the design - the bad quality will definitely have a bad influence. The main challenge as a designer in Asia is intellectual property protection,\" he said.\n\nWho: Masayo Ave\n\nParticipation in Many Ways of Seeing Seminar/Exhibition\n\nDesigner/architect Masayo Ave believes that children who learn from multi-dimensional sensory impressions will have an unfailing antidote for boredom and disenchantment. Over the years, she has developed design-education programmes that encompass a variety of sensory-based design experiences for professionals, craftsmen, young designers and children. She also founded the Haptic Interface Design Institute in Berlin to teach sensory-based innovative design.\n\nIn Singapore for Singapore Design Week's Many Ways of Seeing (MWOS), a DesignSingapore Council's core programme to inspire and cultivate design and creativity in the young, she will run a Master Class workshop for pre-school educators. The workshop is open to educators who have previously participated in both DesignSingapore Council's Masterclass Level 1 and Train-the-Trainer workshops. Members of the public can visit the MWOS exhibition (which she curated) during the Singapore Design Week.\n\nOn the need for educators to be better informed on design for children, Prof Ave said that while German, Japanese and Singaporean children would view the world with the same curiosity, wonder and excitement, an adult's general appreciation for such a child's vision will differ slightly from place to place.\n\nMWOS began in 2003 as a design-appreciation project for school children, under which they collaborated with a teacher, a designer and a mentor in small-project settings. In 2012, the council expanded the programme to include the pre-school sector as well. To reach out to this audience, DesignSingapore Council has been working with the Early Childhood Development Agency.\n\nProf Ave is now facilitating Train-the-Trainer and Master Class workshops for early-childhood educators.

Firstly, there is a mood of protectionism within US Congress at present. The country must avoid becoming protectionist, and must not erect tariff walls as it did in the years following 1929, with disastrous effects on global trade.\n\nSecondly, weakening US economic power has reduced US ability to intervene abroad unilaterally, signalling a switch to multilateralism following 2008. Similarly, the US had consciously adopted a policy of isolationism in 1929 following its bitter participation in World War I.\n\nAfter both crises, the weary American giant began looking inwards to carry out domestic economic reforms.\n\nThere is growing evidence that protectionists in US Congress may block two major free trade agreements, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Both pacts are each expected to raise global income by about US$295 billion a year, with US$78 billion as the yearly US share.\n\nDespite America's business-friendly environment, many US Congressmen view free trade pacts as a threat. They argue that the vast American continent is self-sustaining, with foreign trade accounting for just 23 per cent of GDP. As a result, there are not many devotees of international trade among US Congressmen.\n\nIn January, nine of the 16 new Democratic Party lawmakers in the House of Representatives opposed President Barack Obama's request for authority to fast-track TPP and TTIP, arguing that these deals threaten US jobs, hurt American business owners, and impair the ability of Americans to govern themselves as an independent nation. \"Our constituents sent us to Congress to get American trade policy back on track - not give away its authority to do so,\" the Congressmen wrote in a letter.\n\nThey argued that the TPP, which the US is negotiating with 11 other trading partners, interfered with non-trade issues such as land use, copyright and patent standards. US industry groups oppose free trade deals which carry \"harmful provisions\" that \"uphold the one-sided concerns of corporate interests\" who are unconcerned about the impact of these policies on American firms and people.\n\nNonetheless, the White House has declared that its goal is to complete the TPP with Asian countries this year.\n\nThe effects of 2008 are still being felt in 2015. The 2008 financial crisis started when an overheated US housing market triggered worldwide recession following dramatic failure of Lehman Brothers. In a display of solidarity, the G-7 attempted to stem the crisis by lowering interest rates sharply, pumping liquidity into the financial system to quell panic, and supporting important financial institutions. Yet it did not prevent protracted global recession, which led to weak and uneven global growth that continues to the present day.\n\nMULTILATERAL ACTION\n\nThe Crash of 2008 has compelled the US to avoid unilateral military interventions abroad, and instead to work with partners. In a major foreign policy speech in May 2014, Mr Obama explained that the crisis in Ukraine, the proliferation of weapons in Iran, and the use of such weapons in Syria were instances of US efforts to enforce international norms in collaboration with foreign partners.\n\n\"There are a lot of folks, a lot of sceptics, who often downplay the effectiveness of multilateral action,\" Mr Obama declared. \"For them, working through international institutions like the UN or respecting international law is a sign of weakness. I think they're wrong.\"\n\n\"This is American leadership,\" he continued. \"This is American strength.\"\n\nThe Great Depression of 1929-39 also pushed the US to adopt a posture of isolation caused by the embittering US experience in World War I, and distaste for the enervating politics of Europe, as well as the rejection of the League of Nations by the US Senate. The internationalism espoused by president Woodrow Wilson was replaced by narrow nationalism and isolationism under the following Republican administrations of presidents Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover.\n\nSome economists blame Hoover for sparking the Great Depression by pushing through his now-infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, a protectionist law that isolated US trade by raising US tariffs on some 890 products. They believe this was one of the factors that caused the Great Depression. Other countries soon retaliated with their own protectionist policies, and world trade shrank precipitously. By end-1934, world trade fell 66 per cent from the 1929 level.\n\nWhen the Smoot-Hawley law was passed the US economy was beginning to descend into the Great Depression. Two years later, in 1932, US unemployment reached almost 24 per cent as more than 5,000 banks failed, and hundreds of thousands people became homeless and lived in shanty towns known as \"Hoovervilles\".\n\nSome Americans suspect that the Great Depression originated abroad. Economic historian Charles Kindleberger argues that the Great Depression did not originate in the US, but was a worldwide phenomenon rather than an American recession. Paul Samuelson, however, believes that the Crash of 1929 on Wall Street intensified the depression. Milton Friedman has declared that it was caused by US monetary policy.\n\nAfter World War I, the world fell into turmoil as war reparations paid by Germany and the war debts of the Western allies corrupted the global economy. Trade tariff increases by the US and Britain hurt the world economy.\n\nIn the 1932 US election, Democratic Party candidate Franklin D Roosevelt charged Hoover for the depression caused by speculation in stocks, loans, and high tariffs, which made it hard for countries to repay their debts.\n\nHistorian Joan Hoff Wilson believes that the US deliberately kept high tariffs and favourable trade balances in order to maintain its post-World War I global economic supremacy.\n\nGiven the current protectionist mood among some US Congressmen and industry groups, it appears the ghost of Smoot-Hawley is still around.\n\nThis is the seventh article in a series on US foreign relations\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Market watchers note that the \"fairness\" aspect, which is computed based on the revalued net asset valuation (RNAV) of the company, is subjective. Within the research community alone, analysts recommendations have posited Keppel Land's RNAV to span from S$4.64 to S$6.64.\n\n\"(The position of between S$6.58 and S$6.79) is at the higher end of what the research community has come back with,\" noted a market watcher.\n\nThe independent financial adviser also qualified that the revaluation of properties, which forms a large part of the SOTP surplus value, has been done on an 'as is' basis which assumes that the properties will be disposed of at the assessed values and accordingly, has not considered any potential development profits should the properties be developed and completed.\n\nOn the other hand, the offer can be deemed reasonable for a number of reasons. Keppel Corp on Jan 23 launched the offer to take its real estate subsidiary Keppel Land private at a base offer price of S$4.38 per share. This will be raised to S$4.60 per share if acceptance levels exceed the 90 per cent threshold that turns the offer into a compulsory acquisition.\n\nThese reasons include the fact that the base offer price and higher offer price represent significant premiums to the median share price, and that given that Keppel Corp already owns and controls 54.6 per cent of the total issued share, this means it is unlikely that there will be another bidder offering better terms in the near term.\n\n\"Even if the offer does not result in a delisting or compulsory acquisition of the offer shares, the offer itself may reduce the free float and trading liquidity of the shares,\" KPMG noted.\n\nThe key valuation metrics, as implied by the base offer price and the higher offer price, also compare favourably to the median of Keppel Land's listed peers and to the median of precedent transactions involving Singapore property developers.\n\n\"On an intrinsic value basis, the offer falls short of being 'fair' from a financial perspective, although we note that effort may have to be expended to dispose of the assets and realise the intrinsic value. However, there is evidence to suggest the offer is 'reasonable',\" said KPMG.\n\nThe independent directors concur with KPMG's assessment of the offer and its recommendation.\n\nAccordingly, they have recommended that shareholders take one of three routes:\n\nKeppel Corp ended trading on Thursday up three cents at S$8.77 while Keppel Land lost one cent to end trading at S$4.53.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some employee e-mails were also leaked by a hacking group called the Lizard Squad, according to postings on Twitter. The group has previously targeted Sony Corp's online PlayStation video game network.\n\nThe hackers apparently took over Lenovo's site by altering the records with the domain name registrar used by the company, according to Matthew Prince, co-founder and chief executive officer of CloudFlare Inc, a San Francisco security company.\n\nLast week, Lenovo apologised to customers and pushed out fixes to remove software made by a company called Superfish that Lenovo pre-installed on many consumer devices. The attackers had used a free CloudFlare account to disguise their origins, Mr Prince said, and then redirected traffic from lenovo.com to CloudFlare's network. CloudFlare disabled the account used by the attackers, Mr Prince said.\n\n\"One effect of this attack was to redirect traffic from the Lenovo website,\" Lenovo said. \"We are also actively investigating other aspects. We are responding and have already restored certain functionality to our public-facing website.\"\n\nThe company said it was reviewing network security and will take appropriate steps to bolster the site and protect user data. Shares of Lenovo rose 0.3 per cent to close at HK$11.90 in Hong Kong.\n\nThe world's largest PC maker faced a deluge of criticism from cybersecurity specialists regarding Superfish's ability to monitor Web behaviour and suggest advertisements based on images that a user might be viewing. The technology essentially broke the encryption between Web browsers and banking, e-commerce and other sites that handle sensitive information, potentially exposing PCs to hacking.\n\nThe hack of lenovo.com was corrected in about an hour, said Andrew Hay, director of security research at OpenDNS, a San Francisco-based security company. Based on publicly accessible information, the attack involved altering the records of Lenovo's domain name registrar, which is Web Commerce Communications, located in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nAn attack against a company's domain name registrar isn't an attack directly against the company itself. It's a circuitous way to hijack website traffic by telling Internet servers to go to a different address than the company's homepage. Domain name registrars manage that routing information for companies, and they have been hacked in the past by attackers stealing employees' passwords and accessing administrative accounts.\n\nTwitter Inc was able to deflect a similar attack in 2013 that sidelined visitors to the New York Times and Google Inc by using a simple tool called a registry lock that prevents hackers from making such changes. The cost for the registry lock is as little as US$50 a year.

Vessels built by Maersk Line and its competitors had grown ever larger to save fuel since containerisation went global in the 1970s. Maersk Line set itself apart as a pioneer, claiming at least four world records for the biggest ships over the past two decades. Its most recent mega-ship project was in 2011, when it ordered 20 Triple-E class vessels that each carry more than 18,000 containers.\n\nThe industry is still suffering from overcapacity. Excess supply in 2009 triggered a slump in freight rates as volumes contracted in the wake of the global financial crisis. Though there's still too much capacity in some parts of the industry, \"the situation looks better now than it has for a while\", Mr Andersen said.\n\n\"We need to get new ships by 2017 if we want to keep up with the growth in the market, and we will place orders this year, probably already in the first half,\" he said.\n\nMaersk Line needs its new ships to have a combined capacity of 425,000 standard-size containers in the period 2017 to 2019 to keep its market share, according to its earnings report published on Wednesday. That's equivalent to about 23 of the Triple-E ships on the market.\n\n\"We may order Triple-E ships, but don't expect an order of 20 or 30 ships this year because we need to time it carefully so we grow with the market,\" Mr Andersen said. Though the lower oil price makes larger ships less attractive, Maersk is still \"looking at both smaller and larger ships and we will probably place orders in both segments,\" he said.\n\nMaersk Line said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter net operating profit after tax more than doubled to US$655 million as higher shipping volumes and lower fuel costs more than countered a decline in freight rates.\n\nMaersk Line's shipping volumes grew 6.8 per cent last year, as the global market expanded 6 per cent, according to an estimate provided by Bimco, the world's largest international shipping association. The company now has a global market share of 15.7 per cent, compared with 15 per cent six months ago, according to data from Alphaliner.\n\n\"We're not intentionally trying to gain market share,\" Mr Andersen said. \"When some of our competitors scale back, that leaves more for us. We're not having a price war as customers have come to us.\" Maersk Line expects to invest about US$3 billion a year through 2019 on new vessels and on retro-fitting current ships. The money will also go towards more containers, according to a September presentation.\n\nMaersk Line will in the next four months get the last five Triple-E vessels it ordered in 2011 from Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering.

They also get to keep in shape themselves and make a contribution to society at large while bonding with each other.\n\nThese are the offshoots of three \"people practices\" in the company which Goodrich is most proud of: I-CUBE; Football With A Heart (FWAH); and Healthy Employees' Award.\n\nI-CUBE is a worker-participation scheme introduced in March last year. It stands for Ideation, Innovation and Improvement; and is part of Goodrich's effort to build \"a culture of innovation, problem-solving and continuous improvement at all levels\" in the firm.\n\nThe aim specifically is \"to transform great ideas generated from employees into innovative solution and improvement initiatives\", Goodrich says in a submission for the Best Employers award. Essentially, the scheme entails staff offering ideas which - if accepted - will be put into practice with the help of managers or experts provided by the firm. The staff are rewarded for their contribution.\n\nFWAH is a charity fund-raising event in which Goodrich's staff take part to raise money for needy and handicapped people. Staff not only play in the football matches but also hand out food and drinks, cheer their team and clean up.\n\nThis has \"brought us closer as a caring company which believes in corporate social responsibility\", Goodrich says.\n\nThe Healthy Employees' Award hands out S$400 yearly to staff who keep themselves healthy. It also provides free annual health checks, health talks and exercises.\n\nGoodrich says that the award has helped push the number of healthy workers up from 10 per cent to over 50 per cent of the the company's workforce. It has also led to lower absenteeism and medical costs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We think this is a slight positive for construction companies such as Chip Eng Seng in 2015, as contractors are likely to have factored in the rise in levies in 2015 when bidding for new contracts previously. With the absence of the increase in levy this year, it suggests possibly higher profits for construction companies in 2015.\n\nFor 2015, Chip Eng Seng will also continue to enjoy contributions from the property development segment with the expected TOP (Temporary Occupation Permit) of Junction Nine and Nine Residences in Q4 FY15. As at Dec 31, 2014, 99 per cent and 84 per cent of Junction Nine and Nine Residences have been sold respectively.\n\nFor 2016, Chip Eng Seng will receive an additional boost in its recurring income, with the Park Hotel at Alexandra expected to be completed by mid-2015. We expect the soft launch of the hotel to be done in mid-2015, but the full financial impact from the contribution of the hotel only to be felt in 2016, as the hotel ramps up occupancy rates.\n\nStarHub | Hold\n\nFeb 26 close: S$4.31\n\nTarget price: S$4.50\n\nCIMB Research, Feb 26\n\nQ4 FY14 core net profit fell by 3.6 per cent quarter-on-quarter due to higher handset subsidies. FY14 was in line at 100 per cent/102 per cent of our consensus forecasts. As expected, a quarterly dividend per share of five Singapore cents was declared, bringing full year dividend per share to 20 Singapore cents. We raise our FY15/16 core net profit forecasts by 4.4 per cent/2.6 per cent to factor in higher service revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margins. We maintain our \"Hold\" rating with a 6 per cent higher discounted cash flow-based target price of S$4.50. We see a healthy outlook for its mobile and fixed network businesses, while its broadband business should start to stabilise from H2 FY15 onwards. However, we do not expect StarHub to raise its annual dividend per share of 20 Singapore cents or pay any special dividends over the next three years due to high capital expenditure and spectrum payments.\n\nCompiled by Chan Yi Wen\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

It was the third straight month of decline in the index.\n\nIn the 12 months through January, the CPI fell 0.1 per cent, the first decline since October 2009 and a sharp deceleration from November's 0.8 per cent rise.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI falling 0.6 per cent last month and slipping 0.1 per cent from a year ago.\n\nSeparately, the Commerce Department said a gauge of business investment plans rebounded in January after four straight months of declines.\n\nNon-defence capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending intentions, increased 0.6 per cent last month after a revised 0.7 per cent fall in December.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders increasing 0.3 per cent in January after a previously reported 0.1 per cent dip in December.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans filed more claims for US unemployment insurance benefits last week, pushing the number back above 300,000, according to Labour Department data released on Thursday.\n\nInitial jobless claims totalled 313,000 in the week ending February 21, an increase of 31,000 from the prior week's upwardly revised level.\n\nThe Labour Department said there were no special factors influencing the latest weekly claims number, an indicator of the pace of layoffs.\n\nThe four-week moving average of new claims, which helps to smooth out week-over-week volatility, rose by 11,500 to 294,500. A year ago the average was 338,000.\n\nThe claims average has trended lower as the labour market tightens, with strong job growth over the past year bringing the unemployment rate down to 5.7 per cent in January.

Among them is Kenneth Chan, now chief executive and president of McDonald's China.\n\nThe high number of such talent says much about McDonald's leadership development and training system for employees.\n\n\"The McDonald's Leadership & Training Academy is a centre of expertise focused on the delivery of the McDonald's structured curriculum and the professional development of our people,\" the fast food chain says in a submission for the Best Employers award. \"Here, we work with our regional trainers and Hamburger University to develop strong functional and leadership capabilities, along with business literacy,\" it adds.\n\n\"We organise regional and leadership courses for our people, and this is also where we train our people to become the creative and entrepreneurial minds behind Menu Innovation at McDonald's.\"\n\nSuch developments also help to retain staff, according to the fast-food chain.\n\nBut McDonald's Singapore spends as much time, effort and resources on recruitment, especially now when it is caught in a labour crunch that has hit practically all businesses in Singapore, and the restaurant sector in particular.\n\nIn fact, tackling labour shortage is now the fast-food chain's biggest challenge, according to McDonald's.\n\nMcDonald's Singapore has already put in place various recruitment schemes. The National Hiring Day is a biannual one-day hiring blitz which sees McDonald's staff go out in full force to attract new workers. Critical Store Hiring is a more targeted scheme led by the human resources team to deal with urgent staffing needs in the restaurants.\n\nThe fast-food chain has proven to be adept in drawing youths to work for McDonald's. It now also has the Golden Power Club which makes use of the fast-food chain's mature service crew to reach out to old folks.\n\n\"These recruiters are given a unique identity that includes a stylish set of uniform, badges and customised hiring tools in specific languages - such as flyers written in mother tongue,\" McDonald's says. \"The recruiters are tasked to seek potential service crew hires at 'hotspots' such as wet markets and bus interchanges.\"\n\nThey managed to attract 170 applicants at four hiring events last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding fair value and other gains, its pre-tax profit rose 21 per cent to S$515.2 million on higher revenues, lower finance expenses and higher share of profits from associated and joint venture companies.\n\nWhile Singapore accounted for 89 per cent of UOL's total asset value at S$11.9 billion, up from 87 per cent in 2013, it only accounted for 48 per cent of UOL's revenue, down from 73 per cent in 2013 due to waning development sales.\n\nGroup revenue last year rose 29 per cent to S$1.36 billion, bolstered by a one-off gain from the sale of land at Jalan Conlay in Malaysia and revenue recognition from the completion of The Esplanade development in Tianjin, China.\n\nIts property development business rose 65 per cent in revenue from a year ago to S$675.9 million, thanks to the S$220.1 million revenue recognition from the Jalan Conlay land sale and S$213.5 million in revenue from the newly completed The Esplanade in Tianjin, China.\n\nUnder its hospitality segment, revenue contribution from hotel ownership and operations rose 4 per cent to S$437.6 million while revenue from hotel and other management services slipped one per cent to S$20.3 million.\n\nPan Pacific Hotels Group chief executive Bernold Olaf Schroeder said that revenue per available room (RevPar) in Singapore marked a 12 per cent rise last year to S$217 - the biggest jump across markets.\n\nUOL's revenue from property investments last year rose 10 per cent to S$198.2 million with the opening of the OneKM mall in Paya Lebar in Q4 and from the full-year operations of Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road.\n\nBut OneKM mall, which is 95 per cent occupied, has seen lower than expected footfall. Mr Liam said he expects retail rents to be flat this year as challenges from manpower crunch and online shopping have prompted retailers to close unprofitable stores.\n\nAs for the office segment, however, rents are expected to rise by 5-10 per cent this year given low vacancy rate and limited supply this year, Mr Liam said.\n\nCiting a plunge in transaction volumes last year, Mr Liam reckoned that many of the potential buyers have deferred their purchases. \"But having said that, our experience on the ground is that a strong product with superior location attributes and the right price can prove to be resilient,\" he added.\n\nUOL's Thomson Three, launched right after the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) was implemented, has sold 97-98 per cent of all units to-date. Its 186-unit freehold project Seventy St Patrick's was 79 per cent sold since its launch in September 2014. But its Riverbank@Fernvale has seen slower sales, with 53 per cent of its 555 units sold since February 2014. Mr Liam said the group is not slashing prices there to move sales.\n\nThis year, UOL will be launching two other residential projects in Singapore that could yield a total of 1,460 units. The 797-unit Botanique at Bartley is slated for launch in Q1 while the Prince Charles Crescent site may be launched in the second half.\n\nElsewhere, the group's mixed development in Shanghai's Changfeng comprising 398 residential units and 4,000 sq m of net lettable retail space is targeted to launch in the second half of this year. UOL is reviewing the scheme for its mixed development in London, its first foray in Europe, to intensify the number of rooms for the Pan Pacific-branded hotel and the number of residential units.\n\nShares of UOL slipped one per cent on Thursday to S$7.73. The group announced a first and final dividend of of 15 cents a share for the full year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The move is a first by a Singapore law firm to list its professional services arm in the Republic.\n\nRHT Holdings Limited, a professional services group in Asia, on Thursday said that the proposed listing is scheduled for the first quarter of 2016 or earlier. It is the holding company for four of 12 subsidiaries under the RHT Group of Companies - RHT Compliance Solutions, RHT Corporate Advisory, RHT Capital and RHT Management Services. RHT Holdings has appointed Hong Leong Finance Ltd as its financial adviser and sponsor for the proposed listing.\n\nTan Chong Huat, the holding company's non-executive director, said that the proposed listing will provide funds for the group's international ambitions. \"In three short years, RHTLaw Taylor Wessing LLP and the RHT Group have become premier names in Singapore for legal and professional consulting services, respectively. We now wish to tap into capital markets to accelerate growth both in Singapore and internationally.\"\n\nAsked about the amount to be raised, Mr Tan said that it hinges on the valuation, which could be higher as the company is now looking to make one or two acquisitions.\n\nHe noted that the Republic is the group's home base, and its reputation as a financial hub will fuel the company's growth. And while \"the price earnings given to businesses on the Catalist\" in Singapore is \"actually quite low\", Mr Tan said that the professional services industry is a business that investors here will understand, so he thinks that the company is poised to do well in Singapore.\n\nCiting the example of consultation papers released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore in recent years, Nizam Ismail, who heads RHT Compliance Solutions, noted that the financial industry here is facing a tremendous amount of rule changes, and this represents business opportunities.\n\nIn the 18 months since RHT Compliance Solutions was started, it now has a client base of 100 organisations, said Mr Nizam.\n\nIn line with its strategy to stay ahead of the competition, the company plans to gain a foothold in Indochina next, Mr Tan said, followed by Hong Kong.\n\nLast November, Zico Holdings, which provides professional services in areas such as trust advisory, business support and advice on syariah or Islamic law, was listed on the Catalist board on the Singapore stock market.\n\nIt was set up to mainly serve the customers of Kuala Lumpur-based legal outfit Zaid Ibrahim and Co, commonly known as Zico, and was a way for Malaysia's biggest law firm to tap capital markets while adhering to local rules that forbid non-lawyers from owning law firms.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This comprised eight offshore support services and offshore engineering services units.\n\nThe deal kicked off MMA's thrust into the international market, adding 27 offshore vessels to MMA's fleet and providing it with two onshore facilities in Singapore, and Batam. The group now has a headcount of 1,400 globally.\n\nIn the past year, MMA has reconfigured the work at both the Singapore and Batam shipyards. The Batam facility, which is working on three vessels, is where it has chosen to focus its newbuild programme.\n\nThe facility could eventually be expanded into a supply area for the oil and gas industry, like what MMA already has in the Dampier base in Australia, where it provides marine logistics services and ship repair and maintenance facilities, said Mr Ross. \"We see Batam being a core business for going forward in the ship repair space, and also being a potential oil and gas supply laydown area for the industry.\"\n\nIn Singapore, the Tuas shipyard has been converted into a oil and gas mobilisation area. \"We find that if we can work with our clients not only directly in vessels but also adding further services to them, we can create a better business model for our clients going forward,\" Mr Ross noted.\n\nIn the longer term, the firm will probably open offices in the Middle East and West Africa in the coming years, but Singapore will remain as a hub for MMA's international operations.\n\nThe group posted a 55.7 per cent rise in net profit to US$37.7 million for the half year ended Dec 31, while revenue soared 80 per cent to US$456.3 million, as it added the earnings from the Jaya assets to the fold.\n\nOil prices have plunged since the completion of the deal in June last year, bringing pressure on the rates and utilisation across all vessel segments. This has turned the group's immediate focus to efforts to consolidate, increase productivity and reduce costs.\n\nMMA has embarked on an exercise to cut costs and increase productivity to save A$15 million (S$15.9 million) over the next two years.\n\n\"There's a lot of productivity gains (that can be made) from us doing things smarter ... we'll see the savings flow through in the second half, and the majority of them will come into play the next financial year,\" said Mr Ross.\n\nWhile exploration work has quietened with oil majors slashing capital expenditure, and the number of operating rigs in the market reduced, most of MMA's fleet are involved in shallow water exploration that is expected to hold up better in the current oil price environment, he added.\n\nIn the longer term, the group considers a diversified geographical footprint and a varied fleet profile across construction, production, exploration and seismic sectors part of its defensive strategy against fluctuations in the oil price.\n\n\"What is key to us is being present in those regions as the market changes,\" pointed out Mr Ross. \"You need to be able to adjust the fleet as you move between construction projects around the world.\"\n\nMMA also hopes to build a fleet that is flexible enough to work across the various parts of the construction, exploration and production value chain.\n\nBut for now, inorganic expansion is not a priority. \"We don't have any desire to move forward in new acquisitions or assets other than our newbuild (programme),\" said Mr Ross. \"Our focus now is on improving profitability of our fleet, improving services to our clients, and trying to develop greater depth in client engagement going forward.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Thus, it has put in place various programmes aimed at employee well-being.\n\nThey include flexible benefits to tailor perks according to staff's individual needs; flexible work arrangements for employees to achieve a better work-life balance; and regular town hall meetings to keep staff engaged and up-to-date on important matters.\n\nMr Little discloses that Roche Diagnostics is also working towards a Once Voice 2018 Vision guided by a five-year roadmap.\n\n\"One key objective of the One Voice vision is to create a regional culture that touches us personally and creates an Asia-Pacific pride that others want to be part of,\" he says.\n\nThe company listens to employees and seeks their feedback through a regular employee survey. \"The results are taken seriously and are discussed openly within teams, with improvement plans developed and followed through,\" Mr Little says.\n\nBecoming a Best Employer did not happen by accident. \"It takes commitment and effort from the leadership team and the company as a whole,\" he says.\n\nTo become the Best Employer for Commitment to Engagement, Mr Little says that it is important for staff to understand and feel part of the overall strategic direction of the company. A key goal of the One Voice 2018 Vision project is to reinforce this.\n\n\"Our leaders (must) understand what it takes to be a leader in Roche,\" he adds. \"We have seven Leadership Commitments which are communicated to all leaders, and all our people managers are strongly encouraged to attend a globally run programme which seeks to embed the commitments.\"\n\nMr Little says that employees pick up on this strong and positive leadership culture, which in turn has an impact on engagement.\n\nLast year, Roche Diagnostics invested S$1 million to review and revamp a number of programmes to build its leadership pipeline. They include the company's Assessment\n\nDevelopment Centre, which helps its high potential staff understand their strengths and areas for development.\n\nAPAC Discover is a dynamic nine-day management development programme for people managers on the fundamentals of being a people manager.\n\nAnd there is an advanced leadership development programme, run in conjunction with INSEAD, for Roche Diagnostics' next-in-line general managers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's awaiting a license from the local authorities, he said. This would be the second such project in Europe for S3, which plans to offer zero- gravity flights from its Swiss base later this year.\n\n\"Udbina was chosen because there are few places in Europe with such open skies in a flat field, with easy access and a favorable climate, as well as nearby tourist centers,\" Mr Bosanac, a former physicist at a Zagreb institute, said in an interview.\n\nCroatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, wants to boost income from tourism as it struggles to emerge from a six- year recession. Tourism, centered around the country's 5,800km island-dotted Adriatic coast, accounts for about one-fifth of the country's US$50 billion economy.\n\nS3 Croatia will first offer zero-gravity parabolic flights as high as 15km above ground which make it possible to experience weightlessness, allowing bodies and materials to float free of the earth's gravitational pull, according to Bosanac. They will last less than 2 hours and S3 will charge from 2,000 euros to 50,000 euros per passenger depending on the luxury options chosen, according to its website.\n\nAt a later stage, suborbital space flights of as high as 150km into space, with return to the launch location, will be added, as well as suborbital intercontinental flights with short travel times, Mr Bosanac said.\n\n\"Imagine traveling from Udbina to near New York or Tokyo in one hour,\" Bosanac said. \"The Udbina operation intends to follow the Payerne operation in all the stages, including providing research and engineering work.\" Udbina, with a population of 1,800, lies in the Krbava plains and is connected to the Adriatic coast by a six-kilometer tunnel through the rugged mountain range of Velebit. There is a nearby airfield built by the former Yugoslav army forces.\n\nS3 partners include Dassault Aviation SA, Kuznetsov OJSC and Airbus Group NV, among others.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

A spokesperson for the US State Department, when asked to comment on the Chinese state purchasing moves, said the United States was \"very concerned that many aspects of China's recent regulatory actions - touted as means to bolster cybersecurity - are neither effective cybersecurity measures nor consistent with the principles of free and open trade\".\n\nUS tech groups wrote last month to the Chinese administration complaining about some of its new cybersecurity regulations, some of which force technology vendors to Chinese banks to hand over secret source code and adopt Chinese encryption algorithms.\n\nThe CGPC list, which details products by brand and type, is approved by China's Ministry of Finance, the CGPC official said. The list does not detail what quantity of a product has been purchased, and does not bind local governments or state-owned enterprises, nor the military, which runs its own system of procurement approval. The Ministry of Finance declined immediate comment.\n\n\"We have previously acknowledged that geopolitical concerns have impacted our business in certain emerging markets,\" said a Cisco spokesman. An Intel spokesman said the company had frequent conversations at various levels of the US and Chinese governments, but did not provide further details. Apple declined to comment, and Citrix was not immediately available to comment.\n\nIndustry insiders also see in the changing profile of the CGPC list a wider strategic goal to help Chinese tech firms get a bigger slice of China's information and communications technology market, which is tipped to grow 11.4 per cent to US$465.6 billion in 2015, according to tech research firm IDC. \"There's no doubt that the SOE segment of the market has been favouring the local indigenous content,\" said an executive at a Western technology firm who declined to be identified.\n\nThe executive said the post-Snowden security concerns were a pretext. The real objective was to nurture China's domestic tech industry and subsequently support its expansion overseas.\n\nChina also wants to move to a more consumption-based economy, which would be helped by Chinese authorities and companies buying local technology, the executive said.\n\nPolicy measures supporting the broader strategy include making foreign companies form domestic partnerships, participate in technology transfers and hand over intellectual property in the name of information security.\n\nWang Zhihai, president and CEO of Beijing Wondersoft, which provides information security products to government, state banks and private companies, said the market in China was fair, especially compared with the United States, where China's Huawei Technologies, the world's largest networking and telecoms equipment maker, was unable to do business due to US security concerns. Local companies were also bound by the same cybersecurity laws that US companies were objecting to, he added.\n\nThe danger for China, say experts, is that it could leave itself dependent on domestic technology, which remains inferior to foreign market leaders and more vulnerable to cyber attack.\n\nSome of those benefiting from policies encouraging domestic procurement accept that Chinese companies trail foreign competitors in the security sphere. \"In China, information security compared to international levels is still very far behind; the entire understanding of it is behind,\" said Wondersoft's Mr Wang.\n\nBut Mr Wang, like China, is taking the long view. \"In 10 or more years, that's when we should be there.\" REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

It stood at 0.5 per cent in the year to December, well below the BOJ's target nearly two years into the adoption of quantitative easing.\n\nBut Mr Kuroda countered criticism made by some analysts and opposition lawmakers that his stimulus had proved ineffective. \"There has been no discussions in the board that our stimulus was ineffective, could be ineffective or that the programme should be altered,\" he said.\n\nHe also said it was too early to debate an exit strategy for the stimulus programme as Japan was still halfway in meeting its price target.\n\nThe BOJ's balance sheet has expanded to 277 trillion yen (S$3.16 trillion) as of Wednesday, nearly two-thirds the size of Japan's GDP, due to its aggressive asset purchases.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

I have made substantial changes,\" he said.\n\nEurope's biggest bank has admitted failings in compliance and controls in its Swiss private bank after media reports said it helped wealthy customers conceal millions of dollars of assets in a period up to 2007.\n\nIt adds to a long list of banking scandals that have emerged since the financial crisis, including several at HSBC. The bank was fined US$1.9 billion two years ago by US authorities for lax controls that allowed criminals to launder money and was also hit with a US$611 million penalty by regulators in November for alleged manipulation of currency markets. \"It's a terrible list,\" Mr Flint said when a UK member of parliament read out the recent fines and investigations.\n\nHe said the bank was more than halfway through a transformation to make it simpler and create more central control. \"I sincerely hope there are no more skeletons,\" Mr Flint added.\n\nMr Flint said the allegations of wrongdoing had had a devastating impact on the bank's reputation that would take time to rebuild.\n\nThis has also caused a political storm in Britain ahead of an election in May. The opposition Labour Party has criticised Prime Minister David Cameron for appointing former HSBC chairman Stephen Green as a trade minister after he left the bank.\n\nMr Green was responsible along with the rest of the management team for the control environment at the time, but Mr Flint said the people most responsible for the Swiss bank failings were local management.\n\nMr Gulliver's own tax affairs have been thrust into the centre of the scandal after Britain's Guardian newspaper said he had sheltered millions of pounds in HSBC's Swiss private bank via a Panamanian company. Mr Gulliver denied any wrongdoing and said being domiciled in Hong Kong did not represent aggressive tax avoidance. He said he had paid all his UK taxes and opened his Swiss account via a Panama company so colleagues could not see his finances. REUTERS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tougher regulations and higher capital requirements are putting pressure on financial firms globally, with Standard Chartered, CLSA and Nomura Holdings among those to cut staff in Asia.\n\n\"Banks everywhere are now cutting costs,\" said Dickie Wong, an executive director of research at Kingston Financial Group in Hong Kong, adding that more reductions loom amid weakness in market sentiment in places including Europe and South-east Asia.\n\nThe bank also said on Thursday that it had received approval from the central bank to confirm Mr Zafrul as its group CEO and executive director with immediate effect.\n\nMr Zafrul joined CIMB Group on Jan 2, 2014 and was made acting group CEO nine months later after former chief Nazir Razak relinquished his post and took over as chairman. Mr Zafrul led a review of CIMB's investment banking operations in the Asia-Pacific region with an eye to cutting costs in the segment by 30 per cent this year.\n\nCIMB, which took part in failed talks for a merger to establish Malaysia's biggest bank, said this month that it plans to reduce investment-banking costs by about 30 per cent this year in anticipation of slower growth. The latest staff reductions are in addition to CIMB closing its Australian offices, affecting 103 jobs, a move announced on Feb 9.\n\nCIMB was part of a plan for a three-way merger with RHB Capital and Malaysia Building Society. After the deal was scrapped last month, CIMB said it will seek only minor takeovers as part of its efforts to expand in South-east Asia.\n\nStandard Chartered said last month that it was shutting its unprofitable institutional equities business globally, eliminating 200 jobs, mostly in Asia. Chief executive officer Peter Sands pledged to eliminate about 4,000 consumer banking jobs worldwide as part of a plan to cut US$400 million in costs this year.\n\nJapan's Nomura cut about 12 Asia equities jobs, a person with knowledge of the matter said last month. CLSA, a Hong Kong-based brokerage, was also trimming staff numbers, another person said. About 25 CLSA staff were affected, mainly in equities, the person said, adding that the reductions amounted to about 2 per cent of the firm's global workforce.\n\nNot everyone is cutting.\n\nHaitong International Securities Group, a unit of a Chinese brokerage, said last month that it was looking at hiring more staff in Hong Kong, including workers fired by global firms.

In the fourth quarter alone, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a seasonally-adjusted 0.7 per cent, driven mainly by private consumption and construction investment,\" the labour office said. \"During the course of 2015, the economy will continue to improve. The labour market is relatively unaffected by any economic volatility and continues to develop positively.\"\n\nEconomists welcomed the better-than-expected data. \"The data shows very clearly that the positive trend is strengthening in the new year,\" said BayernLB economist Stefan Kipar.\n\nThe national minimum wage introduced in Germany at the start of the year \"has so far not had any negative effect on the official data\", the economist added.

Meanwhile, underlying profit before tax worked out to A$367 million, compared to a A$252 million loss a year ago, eclipsing Qantas' own profit guidance as all the group's operating segments were profitable in 1H15.\n\nThe bottom line was also bolstered by cheaper jet fuel - which delivered a A$33 million gain - as well as moderating capacity growth in both the domestic and international markets. Depreciation charges were also A$208 million less after a A$2.56 billion write down of its international fleet in the last financial year.\n\nQantas International chalked up its first profit since the global financial crisis with underlying earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) of A$59 million, a turnaround of A$321 million. Of this, A$159 million came on the back of its transformation programme while a further A$100 million was due to lower depreciation.\n\n\"Competitor capacity growth in the international market has slowed significantly . . . with 2 per cent growth in the first half and a small contraction forecast in the second half,\" the group said.\n\nOn the domestic front, Qantas' underlying Ebit rose A$170 million year on year to A$227 million as yields and loads showed signs of recovery.\n\nIts low-cost arm Jetstar saw an underlying Ebit of A$81 million, translating to an improvement of A$97 million from a year ago.\n\nMr Joyce also said that Singapore- based Jetstar Asia was profitable in the second quarter, after carriers started to curb growth in the wake of overcapacity in the market.\n\nQantas is now seeking A$675 million in transformation benefits for FY2015, higher than the earlier target of A$600 million.\n\nAccording to media reports on Thursday, Australian unions reacted to the news of Qantas' rebound by demanding the cessation of job cuts. The Flying Kangaroo, as it is known, plans to shed up to 5,000 jobs over the three-year transformation programme.\n\nCommenting on the outlook for the second half of the financial year, Mr Joyce appeared upbeat, pointing to steady demand in the international market, easing capacity growth from competitors, stabilising yield and load factors, lower fuel prices as well as the weakening Australian dollar. As such, all operating units are expected to be profitable for the full year.\n\n\"While fuel prices produced a modest benefit in the first half, we expect fuel costs for the full year to be no more than A$4 billion at current prices - which will be a significant boost to the bottom line in the second half,\" he added. Qantas plans to increase capacity by 1.5-2 per cent in the second half of FY15 vis-a-vis 2HFY14.\n\nCAPA - Centre for Aviation said in a report: \"Lower fuel costs will deliver Qantas a minimum A$500 million benefit, setting the group up for a full-year profit around A$1 billion. The fuel tailwind is an added bonus. Even without it, there are structural changes that will continue to flow through irrespective of that windfall.\"\n\nIn the last financial year, Qantas reported a hefty A$2.84 billion loss as it was weighed down by massive write-downs to its fleet and restructuring costs.\n\nShares in Qantas, which hit a high of A$3 on Thursday, finally closed at A$2.85, up four cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Turnover at 1.1 billion units worth S$946.2 million was below the S$1-1.1 billion average of the past week. Excluding warrants, there were 188 rises versus 225 falls.\n\nThe weakness here was in contrast to Hong Kong where the Hang Seng Index traded in the black throughout the day before ending with a 0.5 per cent gain.\n\nBrokers described the session as a continuation of 2014, when daily sessions in December saw volume dip regularly below S$1 billion.\n\nThere was speculation that January's daily figures - which were regularly above S$1 billion - had been boosted by various factors such as institutions re-entering the market, Keppel's takeover of Keppel Land and the aborted takeover of United Engineers, and that the market was now settling back to its familiar slow state.\n\nApart from the pressure on the banks and Jardine counters, commodities firm Noble Group was in focus after short selling firm Iceberg Research issued a second report on Thursday, following up on its first last week. In both reports, Iceberg alleged that Noble's accounting policies have allowed Noble's financials to appear better than they are.\n\nNoble responded by suspending trading in its shares and releasing announcements refuting Iceberg's claims. It also said that statements made by Iceberg are materially and factually inaccurate.\n\n\"Our core businesses are in robust health and the statements made by Iceberg cannot be relied upon in assessing the company's financial condition. In addition, the Iceberg report does not take account of the contributions of our many other businesses, such as oil liquids, power and gas, and metals, and our energy solutions business\".\n\nAfter 5pm, Noble announced net profit of US$132 million for the year ended 31 Dec, 2014, which it said was arrived at after taking significant impairments and provisions.\n\nShares of casino operator Genting Singapore have weakened following the release of disappointing earnings recently and on Thursday, they finished unchanged at 98 Singapore cents on volume of 39 million. Macquarie Warrants noted that the loss on Wednesday took the stock below S$1 for the first time in five years but said that Macquarie Equities Research (MER) believes it is not time yet to bottom fish.\n\n\"Despite the stock having fallen 15 per cent over the past six months (vs 5 per cent gain for the STI), Genting Singapore is still the most expensive gaming stock in Asia on a price-to-earnings ratio at 21x (based on projected earnings for 2015),\" said MW. \" Its EV / Ebitda ratio is at 9x, at a premium to mature market casinos in New Zealand, Australia and Malaysia\".\n\nIn the second line, shares of water treatment firm Moya Asia stood out when they surged 1.9 Singapore cents or 70.3 per cent to 4.6 Singapore cents on volume of 21 million.\n\nThe company on Wednesday announced that an Indonesian hydroelectric firm Tamaris Infrastructure is buying a 29 per cent stake in Moya, paying eight Singapore cents per share for 367.5 million new Moya shares. This price was almost a 200 per cent premium to Moya's weighted average price of 2.67 Singapore cents on Feb 23, the full market day before the subscription agreement was signed.\n\nMoya also said the deal fits in with Tamaris's desire to become a utilities company and that the net proceeds to Moya amount to S$29.3 million.

Mr Urwin will be based in New York while Colin Fan, the other co-head of the corporate banking and securities division, oversees trading from London.\n\nDeutsche Bank is seeking to earn more from advising clients on deals and selling securities as low interest rates, tougher regulation and the electronification of markets crimps trading revenue. Germany's biggest bank also aims to expand in the US, where fees on deals are more lucrative than in Europe.\n\n\"They needed to find a replacement,\" Omar Fall, a Jefferies Group LLC analyst who recommends investors buy Deutsche Bank shares, said in a phone interview. \"This is a very strategic part of their business, especially since sales and trading is slowing down relative to corporate finance.\" Deutsche Bank probably made its decision to hire Mr Urwin mostly for his client relationships, Mr Fall said.\n\nMr Urwin joined JPMorgan in 2008 when the bank acquired Bear Stearns Cos, which he joined in 1996, according to Deutsche Bank's statement.\n\nMr Urwin went from being JPMorgan's global head of investment banking to sharing responsibilities with Carlos Hernandez after a reorganisation last year. They oversaw corporate banking, investment banking and treasury services, according to an April memo from their boss, Daniel Pinto, who overhauled the leadership after the departure of his former co-head, Mike Cavanagh.\n\nMr Hernandez, who has spent three decades at JPMorgan, was named sole head of global banking, Mr Pinto said on Wednesday in a memo to employees. JPMorgan is ranked first in investment-banking fees, he wrote.\n\nDeutsche Bank is preparing a new strategy for the firm after stricter regulation and legal costs curbed profitability, and the stock dropped the most among the biggest banks last year.\n\nMr Urwin will report to co-CEO Anshu Jain, according to the statement. He will become a member of Deutsche Bank's group executive committee, a key body for consulting on strategic matters before decisions are taken by the company's management board, the firm said.\n\nDeutsche Bank held exploratory talks about the job that Mr Urwin is taking with Hugh \"Skip\" McGee, who previously was Barclays Plc's most senior banker in the US, two people with knowledge of the matter said in February.\n\nMr Rankin left Deutsche Bank in January to become CEO of Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd, the family investment firm of Australian billionaire James Packer.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/time-think-design", "site_title": "Time to think design", "publish_date": null, "content": "Time to think design\n\nNext month, Singapore Design Week will put design - from fields as diverse as advertising, architecture, fashion and interior design -front and centre through a slew of events for the public.\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Feb 26, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nDESIGNERS will have their time in the spotlight when Singapore Design Week (SDW) returns in March. After a successful first run which pulled in more than 90,000 visitors at its events across the city last year, the organisers, DesignSingapore Council, have extended this year's edition of SDW by six days.\n\nThis ensures the design festival coincides with the mid-term school holidays, so even more people can attend the events.\n\nRobert Tomlin, chairman of DesignSingapore Council, said: \"One of the objectives of Singapore Design Week is to raise public awareness and appreciation of design through our line-up of events and activities.\"\n\nThe council has also increased the number of events by about 10 per cent to more than 60 events across the various design disciplines. Anchor events include the International Furniture Fair Singapore and the Singapore Design Business Summit.\n\nMr Tomlin added: \"The design industry, by definition, is highly fragmented. We provide the mechanism to bring them together. We provide them a platform.\"\n\nAmong the events, Paris-based Maison & Objet Asia is likely to be a crowd-pleaser. Last year, the home accessories fair alone welcomed 13,700 visitors. It took more than five years of negotiations by the DesignSingapore Council and the Singapore Tourism Board to bring this influential fair to Singapore.\n\nThe managing director of Maison & Objet Philippe Brocart said: \"Singapore is at a crossroads where many talented Asian designers will converge and meet with their European counterparts to exchange and explore new ideas, to network and, most importantly, showcase their works.\"\n\nThe exact size of the contribution by the design sector as a whole to Singapore's economy is unknown; however, the operating income of the Singapore furniture industry alone has been growing at an average of 3 per cent year-on-year since 2010, the Furniture Industry Survey 2013 found - and this was expected to grow from the S$5.8 billion in 2012 to S$6.3 billion last year.\n\nWith SDW 2015, DesignSingapore Council hopes to give the public an insight into the evolving role of the designer today.\n\nJeffrey Ho, executive director of the council, said: \"Designers are not just graphic designers and interior designers. Nowadays, designers go into the whole notion of business strategy.\" He added that designers' job scope now includes design management, which entails managing the design process, using design for the company's innovations and even to manage its branding.\n\nTo this end, the council's Design Thinking & Innovation Academy will conduct a design workshop specifically for those involved in the food and beverage sector under the auspices of SDW 2015.\n\nFor younger members of the public, SDW 2015 will feature work by children at the \"Many Ways of Seeing\" (MWOS) Exhibition. MWOS was conceived to instil a \"sense of wonder\" in children by \"heightening their senses\". Mr Ho added: \"We believe we should start them young - not just to make them designers, but to think creatively and think design.\"\n\nAt the other end of the events spectrum is SingaPlural 2015, a showcase of work from various design disciplines - ranging from advertising and architecture to fashion and interior design.\n\nCurated by Mervin Tan of Plus Collaboratives, SingaPlural 2015 is expected to be more \"holistic and thematic\" than in previous years. Through the works on display, visitors are expected to experience the important elements of design beyond just the end product - hence the exhibition theme, \"Process\".\n\nThis year, there will also be more large-scale installations, including one on landscape art and a full-scale mock-up of an apartment. Mr Tan said some of the work on display will likely be quite \"conceptual\", but that SingaPlural would be for everyone.\n\n\"The purpose is to make it relatable,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Talk in the market is that sizes of the office units will range from 440 square feet to 1,600 sq ft. The indicative pricing is S$2,900-3,600 per square foot, depending on the level of the unit as well as its size.\n\nIn all, there will be 259 strata office units on Levels 3-28 of the building available for sale. The owners are expected to retain the first two levels, which will have 21 retail units. GSH Plaza is on a site with a balance lease of about 73 years. The owners are not seeking any lease top-up from the authorities.\n\nThe building is being vacated - the last tenants are expected to move out next month - and will undergo a massive refurbishment that could span 18-24 months. The building will have a new facade; a \"proper\" drop-off point will also be created, among other things.\n\nGSH Corporation, controlled by Sam Goi, last year took a 51 per cent stake in the consortium that acquired the former Equity Plaza from Keppel Land and its fund management arm Alpha Investment Partners for S$550 million. The price worked out to S$2,181 psf of net lettable area. Other members of the consortium are Vibrant DB2 (a joint venture between listed Vibrant Group and niche property developer DB2 Properties); and Mr Goi's private investment vehicle TYJ Group.\n\nKnight Frank, JLL and ERA are said to have been appointed to market the strata office units.\n\nThe attraction of GSH's strata office units is their relatively bite-size investment sums of below S$3 million for most units - given that the units are small.\n\nOccupiers and investors who need larger office units are likely to head for Prudential Tower across the road, where a consortium headed by KOP Limited that bought 191/2 floors last year from Keppel Reit has begun to sell a few strata office units. Sizes of units are either half-floor (5,102 sq ft or 5,952 sq ft) or full-floor (about 12,000 sq ft). BT understands that the KOP-led consortium is in the midst of getting approvals for subdividing some of these units into smaller strata areas matching current tenancies.\n\nAsking prices are S$2,800-3,000 psf for half-floor and full-floor units. The units that have been sold so far include half of the 11th floor (5,952 sq ft at S$2,750 psf transacted in October last year). In late-December, both half-floor units on the 19th floor were sold to different buyers for S$2,800 psf. Prudential Tower is on a site with a balance lease term of about 80 years.\n\nThe ground-floor lobby area in the 30-storey building is expected to be upgraded this year.\n\nCBRE is the sole marketing agent for the the strata office units at Prudential Tower in Singapore. Savills is the overseas marketing agent.\n\nGalven Tan, director, investment properties at CBRE, said: \"Interest from owner occupiers continues to be strong at Prudential Tower. However, the main challenge remains the relatively long time being taken by banks to revert on loan approvals to potential buyers.\"\n\nCrown At Robinson, a brand new freehold strata office project coming up on the former Chow House site at 140 Robinson Road, is expected to go on the market as early as next month. The project will offer a mix of large and small office units. Word on the street is that the guide price is S$3,500-3,800 psf.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If March wage negotiations lead to higher base pay, that's also good for consumers. It just takes time for all these factors to help consumption,\" he said.\n\nA slew of data on Friday will underline the patchy nature of Japan's economic recovery.\n\nFactory output is likely to have risen 2.7 per cent in January from December, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nBut household spending likely fell an annual 4.1 per cent in January, down for a tenth straight month, and retail sales are forecast to have dropped 1.3 per cent, according to the poll.\n\nThe mixed data will keep the BOJ under pressure to maintain its stimulus, although governor Haruhiko Kuroda has stressed he saw no need to ease again soon.\n\nSeparate data is also likely to underscore the dilemma the BOJ faces as slumping oil prices pull inflation further away from its ambitious 2 per cent target.\n\nStripping out the effects of last year's tax hike, core consumer price index (CPI) likely hit 0.3 per cent in the year to January, slowing from 0.5 per cent in December, the poll showed.\n\nThe BOJ argues that falling oil prices will lift inflation in the long run as it allows households and companies to spend more on other goods, thereby boosting the economy.\n\nBut analysts are deeply suspicious of whether the BOJ can meet its pledge of hitting its inflation target in the year beginning in April, as they expect it to take at least six months for the benefits of oil price falls to boost growth.

Roughly US$1 million - and up.\n\n\"I thought I would just build and make it exactly like I want,\" said Ms Gray, a managing partner at a venture capital firm, who moved into her grey-speckled stone home three months ago.\n\nThe spacious new homes that Toll Bros, one of the US' top builders, are constructing on 187 hectares 48km west of downtown Philadelphia may represent just one small slice of new-home construction, but they also tell a larger story of an economy that is increasingly driven by the needs and desires of the nation's most affluent consumers.\n\n\"There are big barriers to homeownership for lower-income households,\" said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Trulia, an online real estate company. \"More homes have been selling in the million-dollar-plus range as the economy has recovered, and high debts and poor credit history are particularly strong challenges for many lower-income households.\"\n\nIn the initial years after the collapse of the US housing bubble, a severely wounded industry focused mostly on putting up more affordable duplexes and other multi-family housing, including rental apartments.\n\nBut some economists say that demand for multi-family construction is levelling off. Home price appreciation in general is slowing as well - the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller index report on Tuesday showed the pace of growth in the single digits.\n\nIn this environment, builders are turning to the wealthy as the most reliable market on which to place their bets.\n\n\"That buyer is financially very sound, and they are putting a significant amount down,\" said Douglas Yearley Jr, chief executive of Toll Bros. \"So, yes, we like the profile of that client and we are very confident they will close.\"\n\nIt is not just builders in the affluent north-east and along the California coast who are building million-dollar homes. Developers near Minneapolis, Houston and elsewhere are rapidly selling newly constructed million- dollar homes as well.\n\nHome sales of US$1 million and higher account for only a small share of the overall US market. Sales of new homes over US$750,000 made up 3.7 per cent of all new-home sales in 2013, according to census data. But for Toll Bros and several other builders, the million-dollar price point has become a new sweet spot for attracting buyers.\n\nLast year, Toll Bros sold 585 homes across the US priced at US$1 million or more, according to Metrostudy, a research company that focuses on residential real estate development and new-home construction. That was nearly three times the number it sold just two years previously, the company reported.\n\nToll Bros has long included the high end in its spectrum of new homes, but even builders known primarily for affordable offerings, such as DR Horton, are selling a lot more million-dollar homes. According to Metrostudy, DR Horton in 2012 sold just five homes for US$1 million or more; last year, it sold 145. PulteGroup-Del Webb-Centex, Taylor Morrison and Lennar followed similar patterns in recent years.\n\nFor wealthy buyers, the recession is long gone, said Mike Castleman Jr, senior vice-president of Metrostudy. \"If the builders want to stay in business and keep the flywheel running, they go after that market.\"\n\nEven apart from the million-dollar level, many builders are moving upscale as fast as they can. The price of newly constructed homes has risen significantly faster than the price of existing homes, according to an analysis from Zillow, the online real estate firm. In September 2005, the average price gap between existing and new homes was about US$32,000; by December 2014, it had widened to US$122,000.\n\nAt the Newtown Square development, called Liseter, even the harsh winter weather was doing little to slow the bulldozers breaking through the frosty ground this month for homes that will feature cathedral ceilings, hand-scraped hardwood floors, winding staircases, his-and-her walk-in closets and garages with what look like antique barn doors.\n\nBuyers can tweak the floor plan, pick from a variety of shower designs and fireplace tiles, and adjust the number of data ports in the walls. Since construction began in January 2013, Toll Brothers has sold 136 homes at Liseter and hopes to sell about 300 more.\n\nNot all the Liseter homes begin at US$1 million, but buyers want extras - sunrooms, built-in wine storage, even the ultimate man cave, or male sanctuary, with a glass-encased room for brewing beer - that push the price as much as US$300,000 higher.\n\n\"We're trying to cater to the higher end just because that's what the market is demanding,\" Brian Thierrin, a Toll Bros senior vice-president who is overseeing the Liseter project, explained as he meandered through model homes after showing off a clubhouse that looked like a fancy restaurant and a spacious gym in a separate building.\n\nIn expensive cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, million-dollar homes and apartments are hardly a rarity. But now they are spreading more widely across the US, and builders are eager to please the growing number of baby boomers who have risen to high salary levels and managed to accumulate substantial savings.\n\nInside a model home at Liseter, a soon-to-be-retired couple hovered over the blueprints of their new US$1 million home, fussing over plans for their five-car garage to house a small Corvette collection. Their friends expected them to downgrade when they retired. Instead, by picking a new four-bedroom home, roomy enough to host grandchildren, they were doing the opposite.\n\nIn suburban Minneapolis, buyers of million-dollar homes include executives from corporations that have headquarters nearby. While few large new developments are in the works, several custom builders are putting up designer homes in Edina, Minnetonka and other upscale suburbs.\n\nLast year, 468 homes, new and previously owned, sold for US$1 million or more in the Twin Cities metro area, just over the number sold in 2004, around the time of the previous peak, according to Chris Prescott, a real estate agent with Redfin, a national brokerage. \"One million dollars buys a heck of a lot more in Minnesota than it does on the coast,\" said Mr Prescott, who has worked in the area for 25 years.\n\nThe same goes for areas outside Houston such as Sugar Land and Woodlands, where US$1 million buys a 3,500-square-foot home with a swimming pool on a half-acre lot, according to Tara Waggoner, a Redfin agent there. Many of the buyers are in the oil industry, relocating from the coasts or overseas, she said.\n\nDevelopers say the rise of million- dollar home building reflects in part the challenges of gambling on open space in an uncertain market. As the recession eased, many builders bought only the most desirable sites, paying top dollar.\n\nStan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow, said the US housing market would not return to full health until builders were able to attract customers of all income levels. And with the job market finally improving, developers say more affordable homes may be on the way.\n\n\"Clearly, new construction has skewed to the high end during the recovery,\" Mr Humphries said. \"To get back to normal, they're going to have to eliminate that bias and serve a larger, more representative, set of homebuyers.\" NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/3da3c86f6f8e676a4a41bda77ac21b2656358cae14cf2f1673ae52862378a3c7?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Homes costing US$1 million and more are spreading across the US with builders eager to please the growing number of baby boomers who have risen to high salary levels and accumulated substantial savings."}]}

When it comes to the antics of a showbiz family, things can get quite rock and roll even in the folk-singing Wainwright household. They don't even need a reality television show to air their dirty laundry - you'll hear it all in their songs.\n\nFather Loudon Wainwright III - a folk-pop icon in the seventies - wrote I'd Rather Be Lonely, about wanting downtime from his daughter Martha (whom Snow Patrol fans might recognise as the guest vocalist on the Britpop band's hit, Set Fire to the Third Bar); in turn, she fired one back at him with a ditty titled B**** Motherf***** A**hole; mother Kate McGarrigle penned Go Leave after her husband walked out on the family; while son Rufus took a shot at his estranged father with Dinner at Eight and another at his sister in Martha, after she failed to return his calls following the death of their mother in 2010.\n\nIt's all in a day's job for the Wainwrights as they make an art out of family feuds; though these days, things have mellowed slightly and it's common to often find the children sharing the stage with their dad. Just earlier this month, father and son performed together, to critical acclaim, in Toronto.\n\nRufus, himself, will also be heading to Singapore next month, playing his first-ever show here at the Esplanade. Suffice to say, performing runs in his blood, and he's happy to be on the road even though he doesn't have a new album to plug at the moment. His last, Out of the Game, is almost three years old now.\n\n\"I grew up touring with my mother quite a bit and my father was on the road most of the time,\" says the openly-gay singer-songwriter over the phone from Denver, Colorado, where he was playing last week. \"I'm a working musician and I feel (playing shows) is necessary to finance my other exploits - I like writing operas and classical pieces.\"\n\nSome of those side projects include Five Shakespeare Sonnets, commissioned by the San Francisco Symphony; and Prima Donna which he has recently finished recording through a successful crowdfunding campaign.\n\nThe New-York-born, Montreal-raised Wainwright is already writing a second opera, based on the story of the Roman Emperors Hadrian and Antinous, that is set to premiere in Toronto in late 2018.\n\nBut fans need not worry about the 41-year-old ditching pop for classical - \"I've been writing a lot of songs in between and going to the studio secretly,\" he reveals. \"One thing about writing an opera is when I'm sick of it, I'll just write a pop song so there's no way I will abandon my rock and roll career!\"\n\nHighly revered by his peers (Elton John calls him \"the greatest songwriter on the planet\"), his musical genes were evident from the critical success he enjoyed with his self-titled debut (1999) and the equally strong follow-up, Poses, two years later. Both records won Best Alternative Albums at the Junos, the Canadian music industry's version of the Grammys.\n\nThe prolific artist has also released seven studio albums to date; three \"live\" albums including one which he pays tribute to his idol, Judy Garland; and he has collaborated with a range of pop stars from Elton John to David Byrne, Boy George, Joni Mitchell, Pet Shop Boys, Robbie Williams and Mark Ronson, who produced Out of the Game.\n\nWainwright promises to play a selection from across his entire discography at his Singapore show and possibly even new songs like the three which he has written about his daughter, Viva Katherine Wainwright Cohen.\n\nConceived with Lorca Cohen, daughter of singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, the four-year-old is also being raised together with Wainwright's German theatre producer husband/\"deputy daddy\", J\u00f6rn Weisbrodt. On parenthood, the typically-flamboyant Wainwright coos: \"It's exciting and terrifying - like opera on steroids - and she's very smart so I have to try not to let her dominate my ego!\"\n\nRufus Wainwright performs at the Esplanade Theatre on March 17 at 8pm. Tickets from S$48 to S$108 are on sale now at Sistic and at the venue's box office\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Amount to be distributed also came in flat, at US$5.08 million. For the quarter under review, charter revenue was US$31.9 million, 12 per cent below the previous year. The business trust said the decrease in revenue was due mainly to reduced charter rates for four vessels which had their charters renewed over the course of the year.\n\nIts net profit was US$11.2 million, reversing a loss of US$8.04 million in the year ago quarter, during which a US$20.8 million non-cash vessel and goodwill impairment was recognised. No provision for vessel and goodwill impairment was required in Q4 as this was already provided for in Q3.\n\nAs a result of the impairments in Q3, Rickmers Maritime registered a loss of US$16.0 million on a full-year basis compared with a profit of US$23.5 million a year ago.\n\nExcluding the impact of the impairments recognised in both years, profit for the year would have risen from US$44.2 million in FY2013 to US$47.0 million in FY2014 as the trust benefited from the recognition of a US$11.4 million one-off gain following the early settlement of the convertible loan owed to Polaris Ship Management during the second quarter of 2014, at a 20 per cent discount.\n\nCharter revenue for the full year fell 9 per cent to US$130.3 million from US$143.5 million a year ago. DPU for the full year was 2.4 US cents.\n\nThomas Preben Hansen, the CEO of Rickmers Trust Management, noted that long-term charter agreements with fixed rates secured near long-term historical average level years ago have enabled the trust to deliver relatively consistent results over the years, even amid a prolonged downturn in the industry. He said the coming year, however, might be more volatile. \"In the coming year, a number of these existing charter agreements are set to expire, and we are actively seeking to secure new employment for the relevant vessels prior to the end of the current contracts. These new agreements, however, will have to be made at spot rates that are likely to be lower.\"\n\nRickmers Maritime's counter ended trading down half a cent, at 28.5 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The privately-owned company is a provider of leading-edge technology to the global building industry. It has invested ceaselessly to further develop its staff, offering them opportunities through job rotation and overseas postings and \"promotion as experts\".\n\n\"Potential managers are identified by team leaders, calibrated among the management team, assessed through projects and development centres, developed through a period of time,\" the company says in a submission for the Best Employers award.\n\nHilti has an International Talent Development Program which picks potentials from various Asian countries to work together in a project team and gives them the opportunity to present their proposals and findings to the senior management team in Asia.\n\n\"Every year, each team member has an open discussion with their team leaders,\" Hilti says. \"Their competencies, potential, career aspirations, readiness, motivations and mobility are discussed. After a calibrated session with the management team, feedback is given to team members about their development plan and actions.\"\n\nThrough this disciplined process, Hilti has managed to develop many team members who first joined the company as engineers into sales professionals and later into marketing executives.\n\n\"All team leaders are measured on two criteria: developing people and achieving outstanding results,\" Hilti says. \"This shows how important people development is to us.\"\n\nAn employee poll last year revealed that 97 per cent of Hilti's staff were proud to work there. Some 87 per cent of them would recommend Hilti to others as a great place to work, and 94 per cent were willing to do their utmost for the company's success.\n\n\"How we work at Hilti and the way we treat each other is characterised by our corporate values,\" the company says. This \"unique\" corporate culture, which Hilti combines with corporate responsibility, \"is the foundation for our long-term financial success\".\n\nHilti says that employees in the company live daily by this corporate culture, which rests on integrity, teamwork, commitment and the courage to embrace change.\n\nThe company's human resource practices are totally aligned to its culture. \"We hire team members who uphold our values of integrity, teamwork, commitment and courage,\" Hilti says. \"We promote team leaders who are able to develop their team members as well as deliver outstanding business results.\"\n\nThe company invests more than 35,000 working days per year globally in corporate culture workshops to ensure that its employees are future-ready. \"In these workshops, we build confidence within teams and energise team members to focus on the challenges ahead,\" it says.\n\nHilti also offers in-house programmes to develop and boost leadership quality throughout the company. Sales managers spend three-quarters of their time coaching account managers.\n\n\"They would go on field rides with the team members, make observations, coach them on their skills and agree with team members on follow-up actions,\" Hilti says.\n\nStaff provide leaders with feedback on their leadership every year through the employee survey and monthly forum. The leaders then work through the areas of weakness with their teams so that they can improve.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Referring to Zendesk's US$30 million acquisition of Zopim as a landmark deal here last year, he added: \"Both relatively young companies (formed in 2008), they have grown to become market leaders in the online customer-service space ... (and demonstrated) the entrepreneurial spirit that we would like to see more of in Singapore.\"\n\nSteve Leonard, executive deputy chairman of the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, said Zopim and Zendesk's office expansion not only added to the growing energy and attractiveness of the Singapore startup ecosystem, but also spoke to the Republic's ambition to become a \"smart nation\".\n\nZendesk, which has offices in Europe, the US, Australia and Japan, picked Singapore as its regional headquarters because of the talent pool here, and a \"motivated government supportive of innovation\", Zendesk founder Mikkel Svane told BT.\n\nSince its acquisition last April, Zopim has become a core part of Zendesk, he said. Its live-chat software, which Zendesk said was \"far superior\" to its own, has been enhanced and integrated into Zendesk.\n\nMr Svane said live chat represented a shift in the way companies were engaging their customers; the platform enabled them to be proactive - no longer just reactive - in real-time on web and mobile.\n\nRoyston Tay, co-founder of Zopim and vice-president and general manager of chat at Zendesk, said: \"It's an ideal marriage for both companies, thanks to the synergies in our products, similar startup working styles, and a shared fun-loving culture.\"\n\nMr Tay, who founded Zopim with fellow NOC (National University of Singapore Overseas Colleges) peers Wu Wenxiang, Kwok Yang Bin and Lim Qing Ru, stressed that this milestone would not have been possible without early support from the university.\n\nLily Chan, chief executive officer of NUS Enterprise, said as much: \"The NOC programme has spurred many of our students to set up companies that develop innovative solutions for the global market. Beyond the financial returns, Zopim's success has inspired the local startup community and created more high-value jobs.\"\n\nThe tight-knit NOC community may be the closest thing Singapore has to the PayPal Mafia, said serial entrepreneur and NOC alumnus Darius Cheung, referring to the group of PayPal founders and employees - among them Peter Thiel, Elon Musk and Reid Hoffman - who went on to set up tech firms such as LinkedIn and YouTube.\n\nZendesk, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last May, had a market cap of US$1.8 billion as at Thursday and more than 52,000 paid customer accounts across 150 countries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nearly half - 49 per cent - of the staff polled reported that they team up more with colleagues to work on projects, and 77 per cent of the employees found the working environment better.\n\nThis must have contributed to the giant software developer winning the Aon Hewitt Best Employer award for a second time.\n\n\"The award affirms that Microsoft is an amazing place to work at, not only because of what we do, but because of the talent of our employees and the culture they have collectively created,\" says Microsoft Singapore's managing director Jessica Tan.\n\nIn Microsoft's New World of Work, which is a response to the changes in the way people live and work because of globalisation and advancement in technology, staff can work every where.\n\n\"There are no assigned desks or private offices for managers, and employees can work anywhere in the office by using a PC, handset, webcam or smartphone,\" the company says in a submission for the Best Employers award. \"This encourages open communication, and employees can choose a space that suits their needs be it work benches, cafe style booths or formal meeting rooms, depending on the activities they need to complete.\" This freedom entails a new working culture that rests on trust and allowing employees to take control of their own schedule.\n\n\"Once trust in the new way of working is established, and with the technology in place, our people can choose to work from wherever they will be most productive on any particular day, whether that be home, office or elsewhere,\" Microsoft says.\n\nThe flexible work style works together with the company's flexible work arrangements and has the added benefit of being family-friendly, it adds. This helps to further Microsoft's work-life balance initiatives.\n\nThe software developer says that the New World of Work is already an attractive proposition in recruiting and retaining talent in a highly-competitive local market.\n\n\"It has also delivered a positive and measurable improvement on our overall employee satisfaction levels,\" Microsoft says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Citigroup said in January it was recording US$2.9 billion in expenses in the fourth quarter to bolster its legal reserves.\n\nBanamex is the second-largest bank in Mexico and was once seen as a model of Citigroup's strategy of capitalizing on growth in emerging markets. But Banamex's standing, and Citigroup's management of the subsidiary, were called into question in 2013 when it lost money on loans to Mexican homebuilding companies and again in 2014 when it disclosed losses from apparent fraud in lending to a supplier of Pemex, the Mexican oil company.\n\nManuel Medina-Mora, who rose from being CEO of Banamex to chief executive of Citigroup's global consumer business, said last week that he will retire in June.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

He runs alternative asset management company Renshaw Bay, a firm he founded. His lack of Asian experience, as well as not having any familiarity with retail or corporate banking, was the focus at the hastily assembled media conference at 5pm on Thursday.\n\nStill, Temasek Holdings - which is StanChart's biggest shareholder with an 18 per cent stake - welcomed Mr Winters' appointment.\n\nBut it said that board renewal at the bank must continue.\n\n\"We take this opportunity to welcome Bill Winters as the next CEO of Standard Chartered, to build on and grow its excellent franchise,\" said Temasek in a statement. \"He brings with him considerable experience as well as an excellent reputation for building good teams.\"\n\n\"This ongoing process for board renewal must continue as the requirements and challenges facing the banking and financial sector across the world have become much more complex and onerous,\" it added.\n\nMr Sands - who had an uninterrupted 10-year run of profit growth until 2013 - said that he had had an \"exciting, enjoyable and challenging time\", with the \"last couple of years somewhat tougher\". Profits for 2013 dropped and it is expected that they will also have fallen for 2014. Results will be posted next Wednesday.\n\nStanChart's share price has plunged to five-year lows as the bank announced three profit warnings in the past 12 months. On Thursday, it rose 2.8 per cent to 952 pence following the board announcements.\n\nStanChart chairman John Peace (who himself will step down next year) said Mr Winters, who ran a successful global business, has \"an exceptional understanding of the global regulatory and conduct environment\".\n\nOn Mr Winters' lack of Asian and retail banking experience, a source said you can \"expect he'll bring in the people with the necessary experience\". The more important question is whether the senior management will continue to sit in the UK, he wondered.\n\nAlthough StanChart gets more than 90 per cent of its income and profits from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Mr Sands and some of the most senior executives sit in the United Kingdom. In contrast, HSBC boss Stuart Gulliver resides in Hong Kong, with Europe's largest bank getting more than 70 per cent of its profits from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nMr Winters has been a UK resident since 1993. He was the only career banker to be invited to be a committee member of the Independent Commission of Banking, established by the UK government in 2010 to recommend ways to improve competition and financial stability in banking. Subsequently, he also served as adviser to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and was asked by the Court of the Bank of England to complete an independent review of the bank's liquidity operations.\n\nStanChart said Mr Winters will be paid an annual base salary of \u00a31.15 million (S$2.41 million), and is eligible for a bonus of up to 200 per cent of his fixed pay.\n\nMr Sands is entitled to 12 months' notice under his contract. He will continue to receive his current salary, pension and benefits until Dec 31, 2015. His 2013 salary was US$1.68 million.\n\nMr Bindra is also entitled to 12 months' notice under his contract. He will continue to receive his current salary, pension and benefits until Feb 25, 2016. His 2013 salary was US$835,000.\n\nStanChart also announced further changes to its board in line with its multi-year succession plan.\n\nThe three longest serving independent non-executive directors will step down and two new independent non-executive directors have been appointed.\n\nThe intent is to reduce the board size to 14 directors in due course, the bank said.\n\nRuth Markland, senior independent director, and Paul Skinner, independent non-executive director (iNED) - who have both served on the board since November 2003 - will retire by the end of 2015. In addition, Oliver Stocken, iNED who has been director since June 2004, will step down on Friday.\n\nTwo new iNEDs will join the board on April 1: Gay Huey Evans and Jasmine Whitbread.\n\nMs Evans, 60, is an experienced non-executive director with significant commercial, financial services and regulatory experience, having spent 26 years working in a variety of executive roles in a number of global finance and banking institutions, the bank said. She is a non-executive director at Aviva plc, ConocoPhillips, and Bank Itau BBA International Ltd, and deputy chair of the Financial Reporting Council.\n\nMs Whitbread, 51, brings significant business leadership experience as well as first-hand experience of operating across markets, the bank said. She is chief executive of Save the Children International, a role she has held since 2010, with extensive experience and a deep understanding of operating successfully in highly regulated, political and unpredictable environments.\n\nA StanChart spokeswoman said the bank currently has 18 board members. By the end of 2015, that number will be reduced to 16.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Malaysia and Singapore have been set a loans growth target of 8-9 per cent, and Indonesia 13-15 per cent.\n\nNotwithstanding a sluggish first half and challenging year, Maybank managed to achieve its key targets for 2014 including 13.8 per cent ROE (13-14 per cent target), 13.4 per cent group loans growth (13 per cent guidance) and an increase in total group assets to RM640.3 billion (from RM560.3 billion in FY13).\n\nIn the first six months, its domestic loans growth was a mere 2.5 per cent, but this accelerated in the second half to 15.2 per cent for a full- year average of 9 per cent, slightly above industry average of 8.7 per cent.\n\nMaybank Singapore's loans growth of 13.3 per cent was particularly impressive as it was more than double the 5.9 per cent sector average.\n\nIndonesia underperformed on the other hand - its 5.4 per cent was about half the average of 11.4 per cent as global banking loans shrank, a strategy that was deliberate according to Mr Farid as the bank focused on consumer and business loans.\n\nOverall income for the group grew across most of its business lines with international operations achieving the highest year-on-year income growth of 6.5 per cent to boost its contribution to group income to 36 per cent from 34.4 per cent a year ago.\n\nAnnouncing the results on Thursday, Mr Farid said various regional initiatives had helped Maybank overcome the impact of slower capital market activities and margin compression and these would be continued in 2015 with a focus on key areas including strengthening revenue growth, group wide productivity, efficient capital deployment, and international markets. In addition, it intends to tap opportunities in Islamic finance as well as focus on Greater China and Asean - two regions with the best growth prospects, according to its projections.\n\nThe quality of its assets remains robust; the group net impaired loans ratio is 1.04 per versus the industry's 1.25 per cent and Maybank Singapore's 0.18 per cent. Impairment losses were significantly reduced to RM471 million from RM880 million in FY13.\n\nGroup gross deposits improved 11 per cent year-on-year on the back of a 17.5 per cent rise from international operations and a more moderate 7.4 per cent improvement from Malaysian operations.\n\nMaybank Singapore continued to leverage its strengths in investment banking, equities and asset management, posting a 4.4 per cent rise in pretax profit to S$433 million. Net income rose 14 per cent, lifted mainly by a 20 per cent rise in net fund-based income and a 13 per cent expansion in loans.\n\nCustomer deposit growth of 16.5 per cent was more than double the industry average of 7 per cent and was fuelled by business and consumer deposits, which grew 20 and 14 per cent respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Interbank futures imply a 52 per cent probability of an easing next week.\n\nAfter a decade of massive expansion, mining investment is in retreat as projects reach completion while steep falls in prices for many commodities are forcing companies to cut costs.\n\nAnalysts at ANZ estimate annual spending on resource projects could shrink to just A$32 billion in 2017, from A$88 billion in 2014 and A$103 billion the year before.\n\nPolicy makers have been hoping other sectors would fill the investment gap, but so far the performance is patchy.\n\nHousing is doing its part as the amount spent on home construction rose 10 per cent over 2104 to a record A$54 billion, while approvals to build new homes are at all-time highs.\n\nCommercial construction has declined with approvals for new work falling sharply in recent months, while public spending on infrastructure will take up some slack but long lead times and political uncertainty make it unreliable. \"There's a lack of animal spirits,\" said JPMorgan chief economist Stephen Roberts, echoing a lament much-voiced by RBA officials. \"It certainly adds to the case for another rate cut and we have a move pencilled-in for May.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

And investors hoping for a breakthrough for United Envirotech might be drawing parallels with Shanghai Industrial Holdings' 2010 acquisition of the then beleaguered Asia Water Technology.\n\nBut the big question is whether the market's optimism has been misplaced. For the ballgame appears to be different for United Envirotech. And investors holding their breath for history to repeat itself may be in for disappointment.\n\nCitic's conditional offer to acquire over 50 per cent of United Envirotech is due to come 4-6 months after its pre-conditional offer was launched last November. That should be mid-March onwards. With Citic's support, more doors will swing open for United Envirotech to tap the Chinese water sector. It will also enjoy wider, cheaper financing options to expand its business in the capital-intensive wastewater treatment space.\n\nMaybank Kim Eng analyst, Wei Bin, predicts water tariff hikes to be the organic growth driver of China's water sector for the near-term at least. It's a sound call. Based on 2010 data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the average water and sewage tariffs in China was US$0.42 per cubic metre, versus the global average of US$1.50-4.30. As China's economy matures, naturally its water tariffs will head north.\n\nOver the next three years, Mr Wei forecasts China's water tariffs to rise 10 per cent year on year and lift the sector's return on equity by 180 basis points, on average, to 8.9 per cent. Still, United Envirotech has the least wastewater treatment capacity among Singapore-listed players. Its current capacity is roughly 1.4 million tonnes per day, versus SIIC's 4.5 million tonnes and Everbright Water's 3.8 million tonnes, Mr Wei's data revealed.\n\nFor every 10 per cent increase in water tariffs, he estimates SIIC's and Everbright Water's net profit gain at 11 and 9 per cent respectively, while predicting United Envirotech's net profit to grow just 7 per cent.\n\nUnited Envirotech traditionally relies more on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) projects, which offers volatile, one-off returns. Post-acquisition, the company will seek to boost its recurring income base by expanding its wastewater treatment capacity, thus improving overall earnings and returns stability. A way forward is to acquire Chinese water companies, United Envirotech's executive director Chong Weng Chiew told The Business Times.\n\nWith Citic's entry, it is natural to expect United Envirotech to follow the path of SIIC, whose revenue since acquisition has multiplied almost five-fold to 286 million yuan (S$61.75 million) as at Dec 31, 2014, mainly through the merger & acquisition (M&A) of Chinese water companies. Since acquisition, SIIC's counter has more than doubled in value to S$0.134.\n\nBut United Envirotech is being acquired at an entirely different time. Last November, SIIC's management had announced that there are fewer acquisitions of Chinese water companies with treatment capacity of over one million tonnes per day available than a few years ago. Instead, they guided that it would be more common to acquire companies or projects with treatment capacity of only 0.1-0.3 million tonnes per day in the future. It would henceforth be unrealistic to expect United Envirotech to grow its capacity at the same pace that SIIC did in the past few years.\n\nAn alternative method to boost recurring income is for United Envirotech to bid on new government wastewater treatment projects, which will take at least a year or two for the company to turn earnings accretive, Dr Chong said.\n\nDisregarding the past, SIIC still has a headstart to United Envirotech. The former's parent company, Shanghai Industrial Holding, has a joint venture which owns more than five million tonnes per day of water treatment capacity, providing SIIC a possible avenue for fast asset injection.\n\nBut United Envirotech is set to be Citic's sole water vehicle. It could thus take a while for United Envirotech to significantly expand its wastewater treatment capacity to further benefit off rising water tariffs.\n\nUnited Envirotech's valuations are also rich, trading at 31.6 price-earnings ratio, versus SIIC's 21.9, data from the Singapore Exchange shows.\n\nThat is not to say that United Envirotech falls short of SIIC and Everbright Water entirely. It does have a stronger foothold in the industrial wastewater treatment space, where fewer merger & acquisitions have occurred. The industrial wastewater treatment sector also holds greater barriers to entry and offers better returns, albeit higher risks, than that of municipal wastewater treatment, in which SIIC and Everbright Water are more active. But if priority is to improve earnings stability, that is best offered by the lower-risk municipal wastewater treatment sector.\n\nWhile there is no doubt that United Envirotech will benefit off Citic's backing, with SIIC's cheap valuations, following China sovereign wealth fund CIC's exit, and Everbright Water's M&A potential, with its low gearing ratio, cash-rich reserves and having had an M&A dry-spell over the past 12 months, one must be patient enough for United Envirotech's longer-term potential.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unlike the Pioneer Generation Package - where we're talking about a specific slice of Singapore only - now anybody who turns 65, subject to (a few) criteria, will basically automatically qualify.\"\n\nIndeed, Silver Support is permanent - both for the needy senior's life, and for future generations of elderly poor in Singapore.\n\nThis, she said, is \"not the traditional model\" that the government tends to use - where caveats are aplenty and assistance is temporary. \"The Silver Support Scheme is one further step to the left,\" added Ms Ling.\n\nGiovanni Ko, assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Division of Economics, also pointed to the fact that the scheme is \"conditional on need, not on work\".\n\n\"Until now, the government has been very much focused on talking about the need for people to be self-sufficient and so on. That's why I think this is quite a big deal. There is a softening of the stance away from a very - I don't want to say harsh - but a very productive kind of welfare system where you get what you put in. (Now, the narrative is along the lines of) let's all help each other, let's take collective responsibility.\"\n\nSo even though he described the amount of cash provided by Silver Support as \"not groundbreaking\", Dr Ko believes the scheme \"says more than it (appears to) at first\".\n\nTaken together with Budget 2015's surprise announcement of an increase in the top marginal rate of personal income tax to 22 per cent from 20 per cent, and the larger-than-anticipated S$32.1 billion earmarked for social development - a 16.3 per cent increase over the previous financial year - all panellists at the ESS event agreed that Budget 2015 marked a clearer intent to mitigate inequality.\n\nAs for whether the Singapore government will continue to roll out more left-leaning social policies and redistributive measures in the years to come, speakers like Ms Ling and CIMB economist Song Seng Wun certainly think so.\n\n\"I think the pace at which they're moving in that direction is still politically acceptable - in fact, it's kind of good timing,\" said Mr Song. \"But more importantly, from an economic standpoint, it is right to do more. I believe a happier middle class is a more productive middle class.\"\n\nStill, Ms Ling stressed that even as the government ramps up social spending, it will continue to adopt a prudent approach, where targeted help is extended to those most in need. She said: \"The government probably has a little bit more of a left tilt to go. But I think the point is really that it's not the traditional welfare model that you see in the West. They've been quite clear, even with the Silver Support Scheme, that it's not a free-for-all. You probably won't (see Singapore) get to the stage where you have unemployment benefits, or (the types of policies) that Western welfare models have.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company has handed the information over to the regulators and does not intend to take any legal action against the person.\n\n\"We don't plan to spend any management time on it or shareholders' resources on it... Our stakeholders will judge us not by an anonymous blogger but by our results, and that's what we want to focus on.\"\n\nThe largest commodities trader in Asia by revenue posted a net quarterly loss of US$240 million - its first since September 2011, against a net profit of US$117 million a year ago. For the three months ended Dec 31, revenue dropped 14 per cent to US$21 billion.\n\nFor the full year, net profit almost halved to US$132 million, missing by far the average estimate of US$470.6 million by 13 analysts, according to Bloomberg data. Revenue was 4 per cent higher at US$85.8 billion.\n\nNotwithstanding these, \"2014 was a landmark year for us\", said Mr Alireza, pointing to how the sale of Noble Agri had freed up its balance sheet, and \"breakthroughs\" in performance and market penetration, in particular by its oil liquids and power businesses in the US.\n\nThe group said that it had written off US$438 million for the year, including a US$200 million charge for Yancoal Australia, the valuation for which had been criticised by Iceberg Research.\n\nThe little-known research firm had earlier questioned Noble's accounting treatment of certain subsidiaries and said that the group overstated the value of Yancoal - the Australia-listed coal miner in which Noble has a 13 per cent stake - by US$603 million.\n\nNoble, however, said that its latest results had not been affected \"in any way\" by the Iceberg report. The group reviews the value of its associates and investments on a quarterly basis, and on a more detailed level annually.\n\nIt arrived at the value for Yancoal based on a cash flow model that has been verified by both internal control functions and its auditor EY, and used conservative assumptions around input variables such as production levels, fuel inputs and coal prices.\n\nThe model provides for a range of values, and \"we have impaired Yancoal right below the bottom of that range\", said Mr Alireza, who also called Iceberg's suggestion of using the market capitalisation of Yancoal as its value \"naive\".\n\nBoth its board and auditor are comfortable with the adjustments in value, he added.\n\nNoble's shares have fallen 12 per cent since Iceberg published its first report on Feb 15. Its website does not provide any contact details nor other identifying information.\n\nIn its second report on Thursday, Iceberg pointed to a \"divergence\" between Noble's net profit and operating cash flow as a result of Noble overstating the fair value of its long-term contracts.\n\nNoble has a practice of booking the entire profit for long-term unrealised contracts the same day they are signed, said Iceberg. It also suggested that Noble had manipulated projections for forward prices and tonnage to inflate the fair values of these contracts. \"These contracts surged from near zero in 2009 to an unprecedented net US$3.8 billion,\" it said in a 28-page report released before Noble announced its results. Impairing these values would \"dramatically impact\" Noble's financial performance.\n\nIceberg further accused Noble of stretching accounting rules \"to the maximum\", though it said that there was no outright accounting fraud.\n\nNoble rejected these claims of inflated unrealised contract values as \"factually incorrect\". Iceberg had ignored the fair value of inventory, and the effect of short-term rolling hedging versus the long-term physical contracts, it said.\n\nThe group has a consistent mark to market - or the practice in measuring the fair value of its contracts - policy, Mr Alireza emphasised. \"This is our core business.\"\n\nAs part of the asset-light strategy that the group is pursuing, its business model relies on the group's ability to manage market, credit and operational risks for buyers and sellers. The group manages 12,000 contracts with a weighted average duration of five years.\n\nThese are marked to market in order to provide profit and loss figures daily, said Mr Alireza. \"It's a function of risk management.\"\n\nIceberg Research is expected to release a third report that will focus on Noble's debt levels and its investment grade credit rating. Noble's shares, which were suspended on Thursday morning following the second attack by Iceberg, will resume trading on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rapid pace of growth in Singapore is something evident to anyone who has visited the city. A port, a mega city, a financial services hub and a free economy. Singapore also happens to share these titles with another rapidly growing city, Hong Kong. Cities that are similar in a myriad ways, yet so uniquely different. Twin cities and arch rivals.\n\nHong Kong's greatest strength is its role as a connector between China and the rest of the world - something that HK CEO CY Leung has always believed in. More than 30 per cent of Hong Kong's inward-bound foreign direct investment comes from China. Add to that the recently established Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and you have a city with a special place with regard to the Asian giant.\n\nWhat Hong Kong is to China, Singapore is to the Asean region and India. Singapore's strategic location as a port, with a sound political system and strong legal framework make it a choice destination for foreign investment. With a double taxation avoidance agreement with India, Singapore sees a great deal of investment from India. According to the Indian High Commission here, about 28 per cent of India's trade with Asean came from Singapore in 2012-2013, making it India's largest trade and investment partner from Asean.\n\nSingapore's position as an important port and maritime centre is another reason for its popularity. Hong Kong, however, in recent times has seen a drop in its ranking as more ports develop in southern China. From being among the three busiest ports in the world, it is now in fourth place, according to Forbes.\n\nHong Kong has also seen its share of political upheavals lately. If proximity to China is its biggest trump card, it could also take a direct hit if there are changes in Chinese policy. But while China's economic slowdown has economists concerned, they are also certain the drop isn't severe enough to be a reason for worry.\n\nJPMorgan's chief market strategist for Asia, Tai Hui, based in Hong Kong, says that both Singapore and Hong Kong have their own niches. \"Both cities have a clientele in financial services. Hong Kong has an advantage with China, while Singapore caters more to the Asean markets. So the clientele doesn't really overlap. They have their own niches, and there's definitely enough space for two.\"\n\nYet, as they grow, both need to turn inward and dig deeper into what could give them the leading edge. Infosys founder Narayana Murthy says both of them have the potential to become technology hubs of the future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its latest offering, the third Timbercreek Opportunity Fund, was started in April 2011 and has purchased 1,986 units valued at C$186 million spread across major Canadian cities.\n\nOther rental companies are also reaping the rewards of rising rental demand. Shares of Canadian Apartment Properties Reit, the country's largest apartment Reit by units, are up 13 per cent this year, the best-performer on the Standard & Poor's/TSX Capped Reit Index.\n\nThe Toronto-based Reit is set to gain from \"improving economic growth in Ontario, easing of migration outflows as Alberta's growth slows and an apartment market that remains supply constrained\", Heather Kirk at Bank of Montreal said in a research note. Fourth-quarter rents for the firm rose in all major cities, according to financial documents.\n\nThere are 21 large rental projects under construction or in a planning phase in Toronto and its nearby regions, according to data compiled by Urbanation Inc. If completed, that would be the most erected in a decade, surpassing the 12 built in 2012, according to Canada Mortgage & Housing Corp.\n\nWhile a flood of new condos leased out by investors has helped fill demand for rental units, vacancy was 1.6 per cent last year and has held under 2 per cent since 2010, suggesting supply isn't catching up fast enough.\n\nProjects in the works now range in size and location from the 23 storey \"66 Isabella\" downtown with its own theatre and rooftop lounge to a two-tower complex replacing aged townhouses with about 520 rental units midtown.\n\nHome prices in Toronto have surged 60 per cent from 2006 and gained 7 per cent to an average C$581,000 last year alone, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, prompting people to hunt for cheaper alternatives. The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment unit rose 17 per cent to C$1,609 over the same period.\n\n\"Affordability is a big reason\" for rising rental demand, said Sam Crignano, president of Cityzen Development Group. \"A lot of young people starting out don't have the down payment and so their only option is to rent.\"\n\nMr Crignano is benefiting from investor demand. The developer was preparing to build The Selby, a 49-storey red brick and glass condo tower, with Stephen Diamond, chief executive officer of Diamond Corp, up until last year.\n\nReal estate agents sold 210 units worth C$80 million, according to Insider Condo Club, the marketing firm that ran the sales event on Nov 15. It took just three hours to sell the units at a packed red-carpet event.\n\nA week later, Mr Crignano and Mr Diamond agreed to sell the site to an institutional investor who's planning to build it as a rental instead.\n\n\"We're probably going to do more of these,\" said Mr Crignano, whose latest condo project is the 58-floor L-shaped tower designed by architect Daniel Libeskind. \"As long as conditions remain the way they are, institutions will continue seeking out these types of investments.\"\n\nAnother reason companies are building rental towers is it's faster and more profitable as the condo market cools, Mr Diamond said. It's taking longer to offload hundreds of units and it's more difficult to secure financing to start building.\n\nAnd the city's developers can't raise condo prices like they used to. Prices for new high-rise units have levelled off since their 2011 peak, according to data compiled by RealNet Canada Inc. High-rise prices gained about 4 per cent to C$450,014 at the end of September 2014 from the prior year, the data show.\n\n\"Condo development is still cyclical and we're coming from an environment where you announced the project and you sold it out in two days and you just built it out,\" Corrado Russo at Timbercreek said last month. \"We were going a little too fast and now this is a healthy pause to try and let the market catch up.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

About a third of the property, opened in 2013, is occupied, he added.\n\n\"We are taking a long-term view by making sure we have a good client base and by not diminishing its value,\" Mr Mann said. \"We have a class-A, top-notch asset.\"\n\nOffice demand in Moscow slumped at the end of last year as a drop in oil prices, a tumbling rouble and economic sanctions levelled against Russia discouraged companies from expanding in the city.\n\nThe average vacancy rate for the highest-quality office space in the city climbed to 29 per cent at the end of 2014 from 18 per cent a year earlier as new properties added to supply, Jones Lang LaSalle Inc (JLL) said in a report.\n\nMr Abramovich acquired White Gardens from VTB Capital, TPG Capital LLP and the sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corporation.\n\nThe complex, which consists of two buildings connected by an open-air arcade with terraces and rooftop gardens, has won design and environmental awards.\n\nAlmost half of the retail space in the atrium remains closed. The Cheapside Josper Bistro, named after a street in the City of London financial district, was the busiest place at lunchtime on a Friday this month, with about half of the tables occupied by office workers enjoying burgers and beers.\n\nThe adjoining Box Bar and the newly-opened Trattoria Siciliana were almost empty.\n\n\"It's bit of a ghost town here,\" Kamil Anderzhanov, a risk analyst at Deloitte, said over a coffee in Cheapside. \"I don't think workers in the surrounding area realise this complex is even open.\"\n\nOwners of properties coming onto the market recently face greater challenges than those who secured new tenants before last year.\n\nMoscow City, a collection of newly built towers located three kilometres west of the Kremlin, has a vacancy rate of about 45 per cent, according to Tom Mundy, head of research for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States at JLL.\n\nThe White Square development directly to the south of Mr Abramovich's complex opened in 2009 as the first phase of the White District office area.\n\nThe properties are almost full after signing up long-term tenants including JPMorgan Chase & Co, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and McKinsey & Co. It was sold to Russian real estate company O1 Properties for US$1 billion in 2013.\n\nRestaurants on the ground floor, including steakhouse Torro Grill and the Italian Osteria della Piazza Bianca, were buzzing with large groups of bankers and consultants last Friday.\n\nMr Abramovich has achieved 100 per cent occupancy at his other premium office blocks at Krylatsky Hills and Baltschug Plaza in the city centre, according to Mr Mann. Both were completed in 2004. The 48-year-old is the world's 90th richest person with a US$12.7 billion fortune, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nThe vacancy rate has been climbing in Moscow's office market as projects that were started while Russia's economy was growing deliver new stock.\n\nSpace in the capital grew by 1.4 million square metres last year and it's anticipated to climb to 18 million square metres by the end of 2015 as skyscrapers open in the Moscow City district, according to JLL. A record amount of top-tier space was completed last year, the US broker said.\n\n\"A lot of stock was coming on to market and vacancy rates were ticking up as the economy slowed even before Putin unexpectedly annexed Crimea,\" JLL's Mr Mundy said. \"Rents fell 20 per cent last year and will drop by another 15 per cent this year, but we see things levelling off by the middle of the year.\"\n\nRetail landlords across Moscow are feeling the pinch too, with rents falling last year by 25 per cent in the most sought-after space locations and by 30 per cent for second-tier areas, JLL said in a report on Tuesday.\n\nRussia's economy is set for a 5.6 per cent contraction this year and it probably won't repeat the rapid rebound that the country experienced in 2009, \"particularly given the rising risk of further sanctions\", Morgan Stanley economist Alina Slyusarchuk said in a note in January.\n\nWhile Mr Abramovich's White Gardens has secured tenants including Microsoft Corp, private-equity investor Baring Vostok and law firms Dentons and Baker & McKenzie LLP, it's not enough to dispel the sense of emptiness.\n\n\"It's one of the most luxurious business class offices but it's empty, with only three floors taken in our building,\" said Irina Buyanivna, a legal assistant at Dentons, whose firm moved to White Gardens a year ago. \"The main problem for us is the lack of a canteen, but the are lots of places around here to eat.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/3b9d97f75e76871ec5b185153a00236126d8836e464ba48291f1d1bc7aa97091?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Mr Abramovich has secured new leases accounting for less than 10% of White Gardens' 63,000 square metres of space."}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/consumer-healthcare/more-pay-hourly-wage-workers-us", "site_title": "More pay for hourly-wage workers in US", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMore pay for hourly-wage workers in US\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Feb 26, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nWalmart\n\nFollow\n\nNew York\n\nFOR Anthony Rodriguez, every diaper for his two-year-old son means less money to put food on the table, or to fill up his car at the petrol station.\n\nMr Rodriguez, 26, makes those trade-offs even though he already receives above-minimum wages at Wal-Mart, and will make at least US$10 an hour next year, part of a move by Wal-Mart to raise wages for hundreds of thousands of workers.\n\n\"It's not going to help us. We need the hours,\" said Mr Rodriguez, a member of the union-supported workers' group, OUR Walmart.\n\nHe says that he constantly begs his managers for full-time work at the bustling Wal-Mart superstore in Rosemead, California, but is assigned as little as 18 hours a week. \"I work as hard as I can, and when they offer me hours, I stay,\" he said. \"But when the time comes, and I beg them for hours because I'm not going to afford rent, they don't want to help me.\"\n\nThe move to increase hourly wages by Wal-Mart, which employs 1.3 million workers as the country's largest private sector employer, is sending ripples through the retail industry. On Wednesday, the TJX Cos, which runs the discount chain TJ Maxx, said that it would follow suit, raising the pay of its hourly wage workers to at least US$9 later this year, and to US$10 next year.\n\nWith some progress on the hourly wage front, labour activists are highlighting another long-standing demand: more hours - and more consistent hours - for hourly-wage workers like Mr Rodriguez, something that they say will make as much a difference to workers' pocketbooks as an increase in wages.\n\nWal-Mart says that about half of its hourly-wage workers work part time, and that percentage can be even higher at other retailers. Stores change many of their workers' schedules week to week. And while many people prefer to work part time - for instance, college students eager for extra spending money - the number of part-timers who would prefer to work full time is surging, especially in the retailing and hospitality industries.\n\n\"Wages are just the first step in getting Wal-Mart on the road toward being the type of employer that treats its employees with respect, and part of that is to set some standards around hours and work schedules,\" said Rashad Robinson, executive director of ColorOfChange, an online civil rights organisation that has campaigned for Wal-Mart to raise wages and give workers better hours.\n\n\"It's about creating an environment where employees are not just at the whim of Wal-Mart,\" he said.\n\nAt the heart of demands for higher wages and better hours, experts say, is the dwindling number of middle-class jobs. More primary wage earners who in the past may have held stable blue-collar jobs in manufacturing are now relying on low-wage jobs at Wal-Mart or other discount retailers to support their families.\n\nMr Rodriguez, who works at Wal-Mart assembling bikes and barbecue sets, supports his fianc\u00e9e on an income that can be as little as US$900 a month. After spending about US$550 on rent, US$65 on petrol, as well as paying for food, diapers, mobile phone costs and insurance, he can rarely afford new clothes or recreation, and when hours are especially scarce, he borrows money from his sister. He is looking for a second job to supplement his income, most likely a graveyard shift as a security guard. He is already US$4,000 in debt.\n\nAt the same time, Wal-Mart and other retailers, facing stiff competition and shrinking margins, have taken a more severe approach to controlling labour costs, doing more to align staffing to customer traffic. Sometimes that involves sophisticated software that tracks the flow of customers and allows managers to assign just enough employees to handle the anticipated demand.\n\nBy hiring a large pool of hourly workers whose hours can expand or contract depending on business need, retailers can better sync hours to demand, experts say; posting schedules with limited advance notice allows managers to further minimise the risk of assigning too many hours. Restricting work hours also limits outlays on overtime and employee benefits.\n\n\"A number of companies have become more focused on keeping a very tight link between variations in consumer demand and the number of staffing hours,\" said Susan Lambert, an employment expert at the University of Chicago. \"It's easier to do that if you have a lot of people who can be scheduled for very short shifts, and who are hungry for hours.\" She added, \"But that makes it harder, harder and harder for these workers to move up the ladder in terms of wage growth.\" Wal-Mart has said that on top of raising wages, it will work to give some employees more control over their schedules.\n\nKory Lundberg, a company spokesman, said, \"We're pursuing comprehensive changes to our hiring, training, compensation and scheduling programs.\" \"The company is creating clearer career paths for associates so they know what is expected of them in order to move from entry-level positions to jobs with more responsibility, including full-time positions,\" he said.

Those were the two top problems reported by owners.\n\n\"Vehicle owner expectations of advanced technology capabilities are growing,\" said Renee Stephens at J D Power. \"Owners clearly want the latest technology in their vehicles, and they don't hesitate to express their disapproval when it doesn't work.\"\n\nThe two connectivity issues were also the most often cited in J D Power's 2014 initial quality study, which is based on reports after the first 90 days of ownership.\n\nJeff Wrona, GM's executive director for vehicle engineering and powertrain quality, said it equips dealers to address technology issues at the point of sale and beyond. \"We have 50 connected customer specialists across the US,\" he said. \"These are people who are specifically trained on infotainment systems, and they support and train the dealers.\"\n\nSam Butto, a Toyota spokesman, said the company wasn't disappointed by the results of the J D Power study. \"When we see the rest of the industry doing well, that's good for everybody,\" he said.\n\nGM's Cadillac ranked fourth with 114 problems per 100 vehicles, as all four of the company's brands were in the top 10, including ties. Toyota's third brand, Scion, also made it into the top 10. Honda Motor Co's namesake brand was fifth at 116. The score for Nissan's main brand was 128.\n\nThe industry average was 147. Because the study was redesigned for 2015, the scores aren't comparable to those from previous years.\n\nFord Motor Co's namesake brand was below the industry average, at 188, while its Lincoln was seventh with 118. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Chrysler brand was at 173, and the company's only marque above the average was Ram, at 134.\n\nThe study is based on responses from more than 34,000 original owners of 2012-model vehicles, J D Power said.

When it didn't, we saw the reaction on the (Aussie) dollar,\" said Adam Myers, European head of FX strategy at Credit Agricole in London.\n\nThe Aussie recovered quickly, however, and Mr Myers said that forward interest rates had not moved to price in any more likelihood of a cut in borrowing costs by the Reserve Bank to follow the reduction at its meeting earlier this month. \"They've done one, they will not do another immediately, it will be wait and see for a little bit, then they'll go again,\" said Mr Myers. \"So the market had got a bit ahead of itself.\"\n\nThe US dollar was bang in the middle of ranges that it has held for respectively four weeks and three months against the euro and yen, frustrating the bulk of investors who - positioning data shows - are betting on further gains for the greenback. \"Janet Yellen has done a fair bit in recent days both to help stop the (US) dollar's advance and to suck volatility out of the FX market,\" said Kit Juckes, a strategist with French bank Societe Generale in London.\n\nThe next obvious cue is US consumer prices data due at 1330 GMT. The euro was marginally lower at US$1.1353. The US dollar inched down to 118.73 yen. \"If we get a surprise on CPI (consumer price index), if the core is lower for example, then the euro is going to go higher,\" said Mr Myers. \"There are a lot of people who have been short (of euros) for a while and are just going 'come on, come on'.

Revenue was flat at S$1.02 billion. The company did not report a separate breakdown of its fourth-quarter results.\n\nHigher net profit in 2014 was due to lower feed costs for the pork business as well as lower staff, depreciation and utilities costs.\n\nQAF, which is also known for its Gardenia and Bonjour brands of bread, guided for a \"comparable or a better level of profitability\" for its first quarter ending March 31, 2015.\n\nFor 2015, QAF expects its main bakery business and its pork business to \"achieve sales increases in terms of their respective domestic currencies in the markets that they operate\". Sales in other business segments are also expected to be satisfactory.\n\nQAF declared a final dividend of four Singapore cents a share, unchanged from a year ago. Total dividend for the year was five cents, unchanged from a year ago.\n\nSubsidiary Rivalea, a pork production business in Australia that includes feed milling, farming and production, meat cutting and deboning, and distribution, reported segmental results of S$10.2 million in 2014, from S$2.3 million in 2013.\n\nThis was due to higher selling prices, productivity gains and lower material costs. Segmental revenue was down 5 per cent to S$401.7 million due to the weakening of the Australian dollar against the Singapore dollar, but was slightly higher in Australian dollar terms.\n\nQAF's main bakery segment reported segmental results of S$54 million, up 4 per cent, on segmental revenue of S$510.7 million, up 3 per cent. QAF said increased revenue was due to new products, higher production capacities, increased market share and higher selling prices. Profitability improved due to higher sales, efficiencies and economies of scale.\n\nHowever, QAF's new bakery operations in Fujian, China, incurred losses due to start-up and market development costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's trading and logistics segment reported improved results due to higher sales from its wholesale and trading company Ben Foods, and increased rental income from providing cold storage services. QAF's investments segment reported higher profit due to a sale of a non-core dairy business in Australia.\n\nNet asset value per share at end-2014 was 74.7 cents, up from 72.6 cents at end-2013.\n\nQAF ended trading on Thursday at S$1.04, up half a cent, before the results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The central focus is the composition of human, animal, scenery and foliage. \"I start with sketches first, collected over time,\" he says, through an interpreter in a phone interview.\n\nAfter making his key sketches, Kachacheewa then takes his time to find the imagery to fill in the sketches. \"I sketch because I like its line and I keep those sketches because I may use them sometimes. In a short while, I realise that there are stories in those lines and sketches; probably it could be called a process or thinking method,\" he says.\n\nThe main figures are humans and animals, and their stories are very much inspired by his personal experiences and the situations that he encountered.\n\nHe believes that the Singapore audience will be able to relate to his paintings, as he tries to capture the emotions of sadness or happiness. \"I think it's the daily things that touch people, rather than politics or big events.\"\n\nAs for style, his technique focuses on light and shadows, he explains, which is a very Western concept. He notes that Thai art has long had a tradition of two dimensional depictions where primary elements are kept isolated. Kachacheewa's composition has been described as a blend of East and West. His characters have a surreal quality but they remain real enough to relate to.\n\n\"The Jungle of Form, Colour and Tempo of Knakorn Kachacheewa\" will run from March 5-26 on the fourth floor of Raffles City Convention Centre, foyer area.\n\nFor more information, e-mail\n\ninfo@odetoart.com\n\nor call 62501901\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But construction shrank by more than first thought.\n\nNet trade gave a boost to GDP too, contributing 0.6 percentage point to the quarterly growth rate, a rare encouraging sign for Britain's attempts to rely less on domestic demand.\n\nThe slowdown in growth at the end of last year has not prevented Prime Minister David Cameron from putting the economy front and centre in the campaigning by his Conservative Party ahead of national elections on May 7.\n\nBritain's economic growth of 2.6 per cent in 2014 as a whole was the fastest in seven years.\n\nPrivate sector readings of the economy in the first two months of 2015 suggest the year got off to a strong start.\n\nBritain's economic output is now 3.4 per cent bigger than its previous peak before the financial crisis in early 2008 and is about 8 per cent bigger than at the time of the last elections in May 2010.

Over 2014, they fell 15 per cent. \"The sharp decline in crude oil prices and slowdown in global economic growth have exacerbated the need to push for greater productivity and cost efficiency,\" Chief Executive Mohd Bakke Salleh said in a statement.\n\nNet profit declined to RM437.4 million (S$165.28 million). Revenue, however, inched up 0.3 per cent to RM10.74 billion.\n\nMalaysia, the world's second-largest palm grower, saw its overall palm production fall 22 per cent in December alone due to the flooding. Sime Darby said that the heavy rain and severe floods were responsible for its fresh fruit bunch yields dropping 12 per cent in quarter.\n\nThe company last month won the approval from the European Commission to buy New Britain Palm Oil for US$1.74 billion, which would give Sime significant and high-yielding land holdings in Papua New Guinea.\n\nMr Bakke said that the proposed takeover is \"progressing well\" and that Sime looks forward to completing the deal by the end of this quarter.\n\nThe benchmark May contract on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was trading at RM2,270 per tonne on Thursday. Prices have gained nearly 6 per cent in February but are flat for the year so far. Shares of Sime Darby fell 1.37 per cent to RM9.37.

So the best employers in the human resources consultancy firm's reckoning are not necessarily generous paymasters.\n\nYet there are payouts aplenty for those on the payrolls of Aon Hewitt's Best Employers in terms of a great place to work and grow. They get to enjoy what they are doing and can look forward to better prospects in climbing the corporate ladder.\n\nWhen a company makes more money, employees can enjoy bigger bonuses and salaries every year. But these bonuses and pay hikes will eventually be capped by the employees' job scopes and skills. To earn even more, employees need to learn new skills and get promoted.\n\nBest Employers winners offer employees an opportunity to upgrade and scale new corporate heights.\n\nMcDonald's Singapore, this year's top winner, offers not just a fun and caring work place for its crew. The fast-food chain also grooms and put them through formal learning schemes so that they can move on to jobs with bigger responsibilities and higher pay in the company.\n\nAnd McDonald's, recipient of the Best of the Best award, makes it a point to ensure that there are openings for its employees, in both its local and overseas restaurants.\n\nHilti Asia Pacific, a provider of leading-edge technology to the global construction industry that is a four-time Best Employers winner, displays a similar passion for people development. Four in five of the company's management openings are filled internally; it hires externally for only one-fifth of its vacancies.\n\nIt is a win-win situation. Happy workers make for good business. They are loyal and go the extra mile for the company. They make the company a choice employer, which will be a big draw for new workers at a time of labour scarcity.\n\nThus, while a bigger number of the Best Employers (when compared with others) put people issues first, Best Employers also have higher profits - nearly a third higher than the market average, according to Aon Hewitt's study.\n\nBest Employers also experience 25 per cent less job-hopping. Almost nine in 10 of their staff would recommend others to work in the company, against 63 per cent for non-Best Employers. Over three-quarters of Best Employers' workers believe that their bosses deliver on their promises, against 56 per cent for other employees.\n\nNearly four in five of their employees believe their senior management when they say that their employees are the company's most valuable assets; only two in three of non-Best Employers' staff believe that.\n\nBest Employers' focus on people is reflected in a \"significantly\" higher score on employee engagement, 80 per cent versus 59 per cent for non-Best Employers.\n\nEvery one of the Best Employers integrate their high potential programme into their talent management processes, compared with 60 per cent for others.\n\nThis year, 12 winners clinched the Best Employers award, including newcomer Goodrich Global, a dealer in interior wall-coverings, which received the Special Recognition SME award - a new category dedicated to small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nRoche Diagnostics Singapore & Regional HQ, which was not on last year's Best Employers list, won a Special Recognition award for Commitment to Engagement. Another new Best Employer is Hongkong Land, a property developer based in Hong Kong.\n\nLast year's Best of the Best winner, The Ritz Carlton, Millenia Singapore, received the Best Employers award for Hotels in 2015. Holiday Inn Singapore Atrium, the 2014 Best Employer for Hotels, was presented with the Special Recognition award for Generation Y this year.\n\nThe Best Employers award was established by Aon Hewitt in 2001 as an exercise in discovering how to create a competitive advantage through people, and exploring what goes into making a workplace of choice.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will be raised to S$4.60 per share if acceptance levels exceed the 90 per cent threshold that turns the offer into a compulsory acquisition.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Among the hospital's engagement initiatives is one which encourages and makes it easy for staff to engage in value conversations at all levels.\n\nSenior leaders, managers and supervisors are taught skills to engage their staff. TTSH also provides a guidebook offering tips to deepen understanding and practice of staff engagement.\n\nThe hospital, which has more than 7,000 staff on its payroll, anchors its people strategy on three key initiatives: A nursing-shared governance model for collaborative decision-making; a patient associate framework; and \"creatively inclusive\" health and well-being schemes.\n\nUnder the first initiative, nurses are given a say through their elected council members in policy recommendations and decisions on issues affecting nursing practice, education, quality and research and work-life governance.\n\nThe patient service associates play an important role in patient care by assisting the medical staff with operational procedures and are key to delivering prompt and excellent frontline services to patients.\"\n\nThe \"creatively inclusive\" health and well-being programmes present to staff a range of work-life balance initiatives and workplace health promotion schemes.\n\nThe earlier version of the story quoted Tan Tock Seng Hospital and reported it has 8,000 staff on its payroll. The hospital has clarified that is has more than 7,000. This is in paragraph 7 which has the updated figure.

The number of recruits grew 23 per cent compared with 2013, while the number of active agents rose by 16 per cent, he said.\n\nThe expansion of its agency force comes at a time when the web aggregator - which will allow consumers to compare general and life insurance products - is to be rolled out by the Monetary Authority of Singapore by the end of next month or so.\n\nThe introduction of the web aggregator paves the way for the sector to be digitised, and this has raised concerns that tied agents and financial advisers might be redundant.\n\nHowever, Mr Tan said the majority of consumers still prefer personalised, face-to-face advice when it comes to purchasing life insurance products, so his agency force will be further strengthened in size and in competency to deliver quality advice.\n\nThe insurer also said its consumers like to search and compare products online. To build on its content strategy and digital marketing work, it has stepped up its search engine marketing and search optimisation.\n\nAlso a contributor to the company's growth is its bancassurance channel. Early last year, the insurer begun selling its products through Citibank's Asia-Pacific retail branch network.\n\nAIA Group on Thursday announced a 22 per cent jump in full- year profit, led by business growth in China and Hong Kong. Net income rose to US$3.45 billion, or 28.73 US cents a share, in the 12 months through November, said the Hong Kong-based insurer in a statement to the stock exchange.\n\nThe value of new business leapt 24 per cent to US$1.85 billion, while its annualised new premiums went up 11 per cent to US$3.7 billion.\n\nOperating profit after tax, which excludes US$508 million of net stock investment gains, rose 16 per cent year-on-year to US$2.91 billion.\n\nThe insurer, which traces its roots to Shanghai, raised its final dividend by 19 per cent to 34 Hong Kong cents a share, bringing full-year payout 18 per cent higher at 50 HK cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Approved direct investments rose to a record 235.9 billion ringgit (S$89 billion) last year from 219.4 billion ringgit in 2013, International Trade and Industry Minister Mustapa Mohamed said in Kuala Lumpur Thursday. Domestic investments accounted for about 73 per cent of the total, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak is dismantling decades of subsidies and increasing his focus on luring foreign investment, boosting education standards and adding high-quality jobs to propel the economy into developed status by the end of this decade. The government is depending on the private sector to drive capital spending as it cuts operating expenditure to narrow a budget deficit.\n\n\"We are planning to introduce tax and location incentives for principal hub companies,\" Mr Mustapa told reporters. \"These also include customized incentives.\" Mr Najib unveiled an Economic Transformation Programme in 2010 to attract US$444 billion of local and foreign private sector-led investment in Malaysia by 2020, ranging from oil storage to a subway in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nApproved investments last year are projected to create more than 178,000 new jobs, Mr Mustapa said. So far, there are projects worth more than 65 billion ringgit in manufacturing and services that are waiting to be approved in 2015, he said.\n\nThe services industry accounted for about 63.4 per cent of approved investments in 2014, compared with about 30.5 per cent for manufacturing and 6.1 per cent for the primary sector. Malaysia is forecasting a budget shortfall of 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product in 2015, bigger than an October target of 3 per cent after a decline in crude prices curbed the oil producer's revenue. The country has reduced its dependence on oil for revenue to 29.7 per cent in 2014 from 35.4 per cent in 2010, Minister Idris Jala said in a separate statement Thursday.

The surprisingly weak showing was due to a broad-based, uninspiring performance across all industrial clusters, save biomedical manufacturing and precision engineering.\n\nFactory output rose just 0.9 per cent in January on a year-on-year basis, far lower than the market's consensus forecast of a 3.3 per cent increase. Strip out the volatile biomedical cluster, and the result would have been even worse: a zero-growth outcome with unchanged output.\n\nWith February's factory output expected to be weak on Chinese New Year plant closures, private-sector economists now say Q1 GDP growth is likely to come in under the government's 2015 GDP forecast range of 2-4 per cent.\n\nGiven how much the inflation outlook continues to be subdued - thanks in part to lower oil prices and new subsidies announced in Budget 2015 - at least one bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, thinks the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will ease policy further in April.\n\nJanuary's meagre rise in industrial production was thanks to the biomedical manufacturing cluster, which expanded 5.3 per cent - a turnaround from December's 1.2 per cent decline.\n\nHowever, the 3.6 per cent growth in pharmaceuticals, coupled with a 4.1 per cent rise in precision engineering output, was not enough to offset contractions in the transport engineering (-2.2 per cent), chemicals (-0.5 per cent), and general manufacturing (-0.3 per cent) clusters.\n\nProduction in the key electronics cluster - which retains the largest weight of 33.4 per cent on the industrial production index - was unchanged in January.\n\nReleasing the data on Thursday, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) said that, after adjusting for seasonal factors, industrial production contracted 4.7 per cent month-on-month in January. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output would have fallen 4.6 per cent.\n\nThis was also worse than the 2.4 per cent decline private-sector economists had anticipated, according to an earlier Bloomberg poll.\n\nEconomists expressed surprise at January's lower-than-projected growth in industrial production; those from Barclays and Credit Suisse had been expecting some front-loading of production last month, ahead of plant closures in February due to the Chinese New Year festive season.\n\n\"But that didn't come through, and so the risk is probably that February will continue to be weak, based on the holiday effect. The broader point is that the first quarter is likely to be quite subdued for manufacturing, especially when compared to the fourth quarter (of 2014),\" said Credit Suisse's Michael Wan.\n\nHe believes Q1 GDP could decline about 0.4-0.8 per cent quarter-on- quarter in annualised terms. This, he says, would imply year-on-year GDP growth of up to 1.6 per cent in Q1, down from 2.1 per cent in Q4 last year.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin agrees that Q1 GDP growth will come under the official 2015 projection of 2-4 per cent. He also says that several Budget 2015 measures - medical and education subsidies, Service & Conservancy Charges rebates, and the deferment of foreign worker levies - could reduce inflation risks further.\n\nBecause of these factors, Dr Chua believes the central bank will ease monetary policy further at its April meeting - even after it surprised in January by reducing the slope of the S$NEER (Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate) policy band.\n\nHe said: \"MAS will likely re-centre the band lower to the prevailing level of the S$NEER. We expect MAS to maintain the current weak appreciation bias. We are not expecting MAS to shift to a neutral bias (of zero appreciation) as such a move is more drastic and occurs largely only in recessions and crises. We are not expecting a recession, but we think there is a high probability that the government will have to reduce the GDP growth forecast to 1-3 per cent before midyear, from the current 2-4 per cent.\"\n\nDr Chua also told BT that \"unless productivity growth really comes to the rescue\", one per cent GDP growth per year \"is probably a good number\" in the longer term.\n\nWhile Credit Suisse's Mr Wan now sees a higher risk of MAS easing, neither he nor economists from Citi or CIMB see this as their base case.\n\nSaid CIMB's Mr Song: \"Monetary policy was recently revised, and I think MAS has taken all of these (inflation and growth) factors into consideration already. So I don't see any further easing especially after the last round - unless we have a further significant downshift in either growth or inflation.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This translated to earnings per share of 14.17 Singapore cents, down from 15.85 Singapore cents a year ago.\n\n\"The decline in profit for 2014 when compared to 2013 is accentuated by the standard industry practice of immediately topping up general prudential provision when the loan book grew in 2014, ahead of the income generated from the increases in the loan portfolio,\" the company said.\n\nThis comes even as non-performing loans remain low, and are \"substantially secured\", Hong Leong said.\n\nIt set aside a S$2.02 million allowance for doubtful debts for the year. This compared against a writeback of S$2.34 million a year ago.\n\nNet interest income inched up 0.5 per cent from a year ago to S$149 million. While pricing for lending products came under some pressure, this was mitigated by the overall growth in the total loan book, Hong Leong said. Net loan assets including hire purchase receivables rose 5.4 per cent to S$9.58 billion. But its fee and commission income fell 20.9 per cent to S$12.3 million. Costs were controlled, with staff costs - the biggest cost component - dipping 0.8 per cent from a year ago to S$61.7 million.\n\nHong Leong noted that the property market continues to be subdued, given the series of cooling measures.\n\n\"The motor vehicle market is likewise experiencing a steep downturn due to the current rules and regulations and in place,\" it added.\n\nIt proposed a final dividend of six Singapore cents per share.\n\nShares of Hong Leong closed on Thursday at S$2.67, up two Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He is also using a ventilator to help him breathe. His doctors have restarted him on antibiotics and are continuing to monitor him closely, the statement added.\n\nMr Lee, a member of parliament for the Tanjong Pagar group representation constituency (GRC), was first admitted to SGH on Feb 5 for severe pneumonia.\n\nOn Saturday, the PMO had said that his condition was stable and that he was conscious and lightly sedated.\n\nMr Lee's extended illness meant that he had to miss his constituency's annual Chinese New Year dinner, on Thursday, for the third time in a row.\n\nLast year, he skipped the function because he was hospitalised for an infection, fever and cough. And in 2013, he was admitted to SGH for a suspected episode of a transient ischaemic attack, a condition in which an irregular heartbeat leads to a brief stoppage of blood flow to the brain.\n\nThe other four MPs of Tanjong Pagar GRC - Social and Family Development Minister Chan Chun Sing, Senior Minister of State for Education and Law Indranee Rajah, and backbenchers Lily Neo and Chia Shi-Lu - attended Thursday's dinner held at the campus of Shelton College International in Telok Blangah.\n\nThe event, which attracted some 1,500 residents and grassroots leaders, was hosted by Sam Tan, the Minister of State at both the PMO and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth. Mr Tan is the MP of the Radin Mas single ward, which neighbours Tanjong Pagar GRC.\n\nAs the guests streamed into the venue, most of them stopped to pen their well-wishes to Mr Lee on a large banner near the school's entrance.\n\nIn a speech delivered in both English and Mandarin, Mr Chan said that the best present that today's younger generation of grassroots leaders in Tanjong Pagar and Radin Mas could give to Mr Lee as he recovers in hospital would be to continue to take good care of the residents, especially the pioneers and the less-privileged.\n\nMr Chan, the newly appointed deputy secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, also gave his take on this year's Budget that was delivered by Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in parliament earlier this week.\n\nHe said that it was \"not a one-year Budget for a short-term gain\", but rather one that charts the course for a long-term trajectory for Singapore to invest in its workers and companies.\n\n\"This year's Budget is not just about redistributing to help the poor. More importantly, it's an investment in the future, to set the foundation for us to compete in the future,\" he added.\n\n\"We will make sure that, year after year, we continue to enlarge the pie (so) that our workers have better salaries and better working conditions, and that our businesses can succeed not just in Singapore and the region, but in the global environment too.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More than 96 per cent of the contracts were granted as part of 2008 compensation. Last year marked the first time bankers were able to take advantage of those awards.\n\nGoldman Sachs's stock has more than doubled since it granted 36 million options in Dec 2008 to give top performers incentive to stay. The bank had been forced to slash compensation costs that year, as a global credit crisis endangered the firm and pushed its shares down 61 per cent.\n\nThe more-than US$2 billion total disclosed in a regulatory filing this week is the pretax gain from exercising the options. Recipients - who can choose to keep the stock or convert it to cash - may include former employees who left the New York-based company after receiving the options.\n\nCurrent partners, who make up fewer than 2 per cent of the firm's 34,000 people, have accounted for an outsize portion of the payoffs. As of August, partners had reaped pretax gains of almost US$800 million from the 2008 options. The bank has yet to disclose their activity in the last four months of the year.\n\nThe investment bank's most senior leaders didn't receive the options, as Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C Blankfein and President Gary D Cohn took no bonus for 2008.\n\nThe options were granted at an exercise price of US$78.78 and vested over years. Another US$1.4 billion of the 2008 options were still outstanding at the end of 2014, when the stock closed at US$193.83.\n\nGoldman Sachs has cut the portion of revenue it pays employees since the crisis as it seeks to boost returns amid higher capital requirements.

Jakarta responded by warning that threats were not part of diplomatic language. \"It was a positive sign that the conversation took place,\" Mr Abbott told reporters in Canberra. \"It's a sign of the depth of the friendship between Australia and Indonesia.\" Mr Abbott declined to comment on the conversation in detail. \"I don't want to raise hope that might turn out to be dashed,\" he said. \"I want to ensure that as far as is humanly possible, I am speaking out for Australians and for Australian values, but I also have to respect and defend Australia's friendships.\" Indonesia's Attorney General HM Prasetyo said on Wednesday the planned executions, to be carried out by firing squads, would not be delayed or cancelled in the face of diplomatic pressure. He declined to specify a date.\n\nJokowi, who took calls from Brazil, France, and the Netherlands this week - who have nationals on death row in Indonesia - has warned these nations against interfering in Indonesia's sovereign affairs.\n\nIndonesia has harsh penalties for drug trafficking and resumed executions in 2013 after a five-year gap.\n\nOn Tuesday, a court in Jakarta threw out an appeal by the two Australians, Myuran Sukumaran, 33, and Andrew Chan, 31, against Jokowi's rejection of their request for presidential clemency.\n\nLawyers for the members of the so-called Bali Nine group of Australians, convicted in 2005 as the ringleaders of a plot to smuggle heroin out of Indonesia, have said they plan to appeal that decision.\n\nThe Australian government has stressed that Sukumaran and Chan have been rehabilitated in prison, where they mentor younger inmates.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

There is a three- or four-day gap.\n\n\"As a consumer, you can't find it, even though the artist says it's out there. So now they won't have to go looking on a pirate site - we are focusing them on the legitimate market,\" she said.\n\nLondon-based IFPI, which stands for the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, said it had consulted with the International Federation of Musicians, which represents global unions, as well as leading retailers and streaming services including Spotify.\n\nOne source of opposition has been independent retailers in the United States, the world's largest music market, who have supported a global release date but not on Friday.\n\nUS retailers generally chose Tuesday as it would otherwise be a slow day, and it offers ample time for albums to arrive over the weekend.\n\nIn recent years, artists including Beyonce and Madonna have also suddenly released albums without warning, either in response to leaks or sometimes to avoid them.\n\nMoore said that the Friday plan enjoyed broad support but that there would be no legal ramifications for anyone who insists on another day.\n\n\"There could be an artist or individual producer who decides at some point they're not going on that day... but there is a clear majority in favour of doing this, and I think eventually it will be aligned,\" she said.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

Though the man (played by Ong Kian Sin) does not say a word, his life is narrated by the sights of and the sounds made by these various objects. Through these, a story gradually emerges.\n\nMade by lesser artists, OneTwoSix might be an experiment that is at best, indecipherable, and at worst, unbearable. But the work is produced by well-regarded theatre company The Finger Players and created by three of the finest theatre designers in Singapore - so one can't help but be intrigued.\n\nThe three are sound designer Darren Ng, lighting designer Lim Woan Wen and spatial designer Lim Wei Ling. Between them, they've earned more than a dozen awards for their creations, including the National Arts Council Young Artist Award and several Straits Times Life! Theatre Awards trophies - not to mention the deep respect from fellow practitioners and theatre lovers over the years.\n\nSpeaking as a collective, the trio says: \"There is nothing in particular we would like to say or show with this work. Rather, it is an expression that we hope to share. We hope to explore the language of inanimate objects in space in a theatrical setting, using the design elements of space, light, sound and the element of the actor to accentuate the link between 'living among objects' and 'living within a city', and between the physical and the metaphysical.\"\n\nAccording to the trio, in the initial phases of the project, the man had plenty of lines to say. But as the trio began to fine-tune the work, they found the words to be superfluous and did away with them.\n\n\"There are narratives present in OneTwoSix in the form of light, sound, entity and space. To us, anything that flows in time-space continuum will naturally form narratives.\n\n\"We did not intentionally steer away from the spoken word, but we realised along the way that, as theatre designers, the nature of our work is non-verbal and the collective strength of the piece is better augmented when the words are stripped.\"\n\nIf the previous works by the three designers are anything to go by, one can expect a most unusual - and possibly sublime - time at the theatre.\n\nThe trio adds: \"We hope that the audience can come with an open mind and a quiet heart for the show. We think they will experience something simple and hopefully heartfelt.\"\n\nOneTwoSix plays at the Drama Centre Black Box from March 5 to 7 at 8pm. Tickets are allocated by pre-registration and on donation basis. Each person is entitled to two tickets each. Call 6738-6061 or e-mail\n\ntfplayer@singnet.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Switzerland is the world's largest center for offshore funds, managing about US$2.3 trillion for clients who don't reside there.\n\nSome bankers face an uncertain employment future as their firms struggle to withstand pressure on profits after years of low interest rates, an international crackdown on tax evasion and the sudden appreciation of the country's currency in January. With more than a third of the industry found to be unprofitable by KPMG in a study last year, many wealth managers are evaluating options for cutting costs.\n\nEFG reported full-year profit on Wednesday that beat analysts' estimates and said the best-performing private bankers are excluded from a hiring freeze aimed at controlling costs. EFG oversaw 85.1 billion francs for clients at its banks in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean at the end of December. The average amount managed by one of the about 440 private bankers climbed to 217 million francs at the end of 2014 from 174 million francs a year earlier, the firm said.\n\nOne EFG compensation model gives private bankers a base salary of about 200,000 to 250,000 francs a year and a 20 per cent share of profit generated for the firm, provided this exceeds 1 million francs, Williamson said.\n\n\"There aren't many client relationship officers who get into the millionaire category, but a very successful one can,\" he said.\n\nEFG added teams in Geneva and Zurich to focus on wealthy individuals with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to invest. A Zurich-based team concentrating on Hungarian clients will join in March.\n\nAside from compensation, EFG is seeking to lure from competitors private bankers who are fed up with changes in management and strategy or affected by decisions to cease dealings with clients in certain countries, said Williamson.\n\n\"Due to some regulatory or political problem they can exit overnight entire markets,\" he said, referring to larger rivals. He didn't identify specific banks.\n\nEven as EFG seeks top performers from rivals, it said it tightened minimum performance criteria for individual bankers last year and has parted company with those who were underperforming.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

Hutchison Whampoa Ltd, which operates industries ranging from telecommunications to infrastructure, reported profit doubled to HK$67.2 billion.\n\nThe results represent the final earnings before Li merges the two companies by late June as part of a US$29 billion reorganization of a business empire spanning more than 50 countries. The 86-year-old tycoon, known in Hong Kong as \"Superman,\" isn't done deal making as Hutchison is in talks to buy British wireless carrier O2 for as much as 10.25 billion pounds (US$16 billion) and is discussing adding phone assets in Italy.\n\n\"With this new structure, they are going to be more aggressive in pursuing assets in Europe, particularly in the telecom sector,\" Jackson Wong, associate director at United Simsen Securities in Hong Kong ahead of the earnings release.\n\nThe reorganization, codenamed \"Project Diamond\" before being announced in January, comes as Mr Li prepares to hand over the reins to his 50-year-old son Victor. Though subject to approval from Hutchison shareholders, the proposal aims to lump all of Mr Li's businesses into a new company called CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd and then separate the real-estate assets into a newly created entity called Cheung Kong Property Holdings Ltd, which will be the second-largest landlord in Hong Kong.\n\nCheung Kong shares rose 0.7 per cent to close at HK$153 in Hong Kong before reporting earnings, while Hutchison dropped 0.1 per cent to HK$105.50.

He said the railway would not be privatized. \"Over the next five years, the railways have to undergo a transformation,\" Mr Prabhu said in a speech that was short on details.\n\nHe said the share of rail revenue available for investments would rise to 11.5 per cent in the fiscal year starting on April 1, up from 8.2 per cent in the current fiscal year.\n\nIndia has more funds available for investment thanks to a sharp drop in the price of diesel fuel that powers most Indian locomotives.\n\nThe BSE share index reacted negatively to the speech, sinking 0.7 per cent, with wagon makers Titagarh Wagons down 2.6 percent, while Texmaco Rail & Engineering lower 7 per cent.\n\nPassenger fares are subsidised by freight revenues that are high compared to other countries. Mr Prabhu said he planned to raise the amount of freight carried to 1.5 billion tonnes a year, from 1 billion tonnes at the moment.\n\nMr Prabhu said spending would be focused on improving and expanding existing railway lines, many of which are operating at more than full capacity, with the average speed of the country's best trains a sluggish 70 km per hour.\n\nAccidents are common and trains, platforms and toilets on the network are often filthy.\n\nIndia's is the world's fourth largest rail network, but has been outstripped by China, which now has more than six times a much track.\n\nProviding jobs for 1.3 million people, the railway is India's largest single employer, and reform is politically sensitive. Successive governments have shied away from modernization, preferring instead to use the system to provide cheap transport and create jobs.\n\nMr Prabhu did not announce any new trains in the budget, departing from a tradition of laying on new services to politically important constituencies.\n\nThere are over 300 projects pending that need about 1.8 trillion Indian rupees ($28.9 billion), said a senior official.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

Vessels built by Maersk Line and its competitors had grown ever larger to save fuel since containerization went global in the 1970s. Maersk Line set itself apart as a pioneer, claiming at least four world records for the biggest ships over the past two decades. Its most recent mega-ship project was in 2011, when it ordered 20 Triple-E class vessels that each carry more than 18,000 containers.\n\nThe industry is still suffering from overcapacity. Excess supply in 2009 triggered a slump in freight rates as volumes contracted in the wake of the global financial crisis. Though there's still too much capacity in some parts of the industry, \"the situation looks better now than it has for a while,\" Mr Andersen said.\n\n\"We need to get new ships by 2017 if we want to keep up with the growth in the market, and we will place orders this year, probably already in the first half,\" he said.\n\nMaersk shares rose as much as 3 per cent in Copenhagen trading and were up 2.5 per cent to 15,640 kroner at 9.32 a.m. The stock jumped 9.5 per cent Wednesday and now trades at a record high after exceeding a 2007 peak.\n\nMaersk Line needs its new ships to have a combined capacity of 425,000 standard-size containers in the period 2017 to 2019 to keep its market share, according to its earnings report published on Wednesday. That's equivalent to about 23 of the Triple-E ships on the market.\n\n\"We may order Triple-E ships, but don't expect an order of 20 or 30 ships this year because we need to time it carefully so we grow with the market,\" Mr Andersen said. Though the lower oil price makes larger ships less attractive, Maersk is still \"looking at both smaller and larger ships and we will probably place orders in both segments,\" he said.\n\nMaersk Line said Wednesday its fourth-quarter net operating profit after tax more than doubled to US$655 million as higher shipping volumes and lower fuel costs more than countered a decline in freight rates.\n\nMaersk Line's shipping volumes grew 6.8 per cent last year, as the global market expanded 6 per cent, according to an estimate provided by BIMCO, the world's largest international shipping association. The company now has a global market share of 15.7 per cent, compared with 15 percent six months ago, according to data from Alphaliner SA.\n\n\"We're not intentionally trying to gain market share,\" Mr Andersen said. \"When some of our competitors scale back, that leaves more for us. We're not having a price war as customers have come to us.\" Maersk Line expects to invest about US$3 billion a year through 2019 on new vessels and on retro-fitting current ships. The money will also go toward more containers, according to a September presentation.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

More sectors and companies will be added over time.\n\nIt is expected that Earn and Learn will benefit a third of all polytechnic and ITE graduates by 2025.\n\nThe SkillsFuture Secretariat said the aim of Earn and Learn is to enable these graduates to build on the skills and knowledge they had picked up in school and to ease their transition into the workforce.\n\nUnder Earn and Learn, they will be put through a programme lasting between 12 and 18 months at the company, where they will draw full salaries like all other employees.\n\nThe graduates will be assigned mentors as they undergo a skills-development programme in line with the company's talent-development plan.\n\nSeparately, the SkillsFuture Secretariat also shed more light on the\n\nnew SkillsFuture Credit scheme\n\n, which will reach over two million Singaporeans in the first quarter of next year.\n\nMr Tharman had said on Monday that the government will, for a start, put S$500 into the SkillsFuture Credit account of all citizens aged 25 and up, so they can use these funds to offset the fees of government-supported courses in, for example, the polytechnic and universities, and for selected courses at institutions like LaSalle College of the Arts and SIM University.\n\nThe funds will be topped up regularly for life, and the credit does not expire. The secretariat said this scheme will cost the government about S$900 million to fund until 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, Singaporeans in the earlier and middle stages of their careers who are keen to deepen their skills in growth sectors can take advantage of a new study award worth up to S$5,000, which can be use to help pay for the cost of their education and training.\n\nThe SkillsFuture secretariat identified advanced manufacturing, next-generation logistics, health care and financial services as examples of Singapore's future growth areas and those which meet social needs.\n\nWorkers more senior in their field can apply for a fellowship, a cash award of S$10,000 to help them master their skills even further. Up to 100 of these fellowships will be given out each year from 2016.\n\nEmployers who have played their part to develop their workforce will be eligible for a new award to be created; it will recognise them for having invested in employee training and developed structured skills-based career pathways for their staff.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFirst industries to get sectoral manpower plans identified\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yellen also made it abundantly clear that the US economy is recovering and she will be looking to normalise interest rates at one point. In the longer term that doesn't spell much optimism for gold.\"\n\nSpot gold was up 0.8 per cent at US$1,209.10 an ounce by 0216 GMT, after hitting its weakest level since Jan 5 on Tuesday at US$1,190.91.\n\nUS gold for April delivery rose one per cent to US$1,209.20 an ounce. Silver, both spot and US futures, jumped over 3 per cent at one stage.\n\nMr Lee sees US$1,230 an ounce as the initial resistance level for gold, but predicts that the metal could test US$1,100 this year.\n\nA US rate hike, which would be the first since 2006, reduces the appeal of non-interest-bearing assets such as gold.\n\n\"Overall, the Fed is still on track to lift its policy rate this year. June or September remains on the table,\" Mizuho Bank said in a note.\n\nMs Yellen was likely to take the same stance she took before the US Senate Banking Committee when testifying before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.\n\nIn China, premiums on the Shanghai Gold Exchange rose to US$5-US$6 an ounce over global spot prices from US$3-US$4 before the New Year break there that began on Feb 18, reflecting firm demand from the world's No 2 gold consumer.

The overall Thai index was down 0.22 per cent.\n\nThey had fallen 4.2 per cent and 3.4 per cent, respectively, on Wednesday after the media reports.\n\nMr Pridiyathorn said the government will not interfere with the planned auction to be held by regulator National Broadcasting and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC). \"The government will set up a new temporary committee to help oversee the digital economy policy, which will also consider 4G issues before handing over authority to NBTC,\" he said, adding he expected the committee to start meeting in March.\n\nAIS is expected to be most affected if the auction is delayed, given the market leader needs more spectrum to serve rising demand for data services, while third-ranked True Corp is likely to benefit from the delay, analysts have said.\n\nUnlike its rivals, AIS is the only mobile operator without 4G services.\n\nTrue, 18 per cent owned by China Mobile, is the country's largest 4G service provider.

It is therefore important for us to continue to raise the productivity level of the aviation sector, and to help businesses make the transition to innovation-driven growth,\" said Mrs Teo, speaking at the inaugural Aviation Productivity Conference 2015 on Wednesday. The conference was organised by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS).\n\nLast year, Changi Airport saw 54.1 million passengers, up just 0.7 per cent from 2013, in what was a challenging year for the industry. Demand for travel out of China slumped in the wake of the twin Malaysia Airlines tragedies, while political tensions in Thailand also dampened travel to the Land of Smiles. Meanwhile, overcapacity in South-east Asia depressed yields and prompted some airlines to curb capacity growth.\n\nGrowth this year is also likely to be \"modest\", she highlighted. Mrs Teo went on to add: \"Perhaps one of the most common misconceptions floating around is that technology adoption involves expensive equipment or substantial and costly research & development. However, impactful results can also be achieved through the adoption of mature technology, or through the implementation of simple yet clever ideas.\"\n\nSixteen projects which boost productivity were recognised at the conference, including those by Rolls-Royce, SIA Engineering, airport operator Changi Airport Group, Singapore Aero Engine Services and MAJ Aviation. These were participants in the Process Innovation Challenge (PIC), a competition-based incentive scheme under CAAS' Aviation Development Fund. The PIC funds half of project costs capped at S$75,000 per project.\n\nMAJ Aviation, for instance, has its staff use mobile devices to carry out daily aircraft checks, instead of the usual paper checklists and manual recording of aircraft parameters. This allows its employees to perform more aircraft checks at a quicker pace, enabling excess staff to be redeployed to handle other tasks.\n\nAnd Rolls-Royce has invented an air pallet dubbed the Flying Carpet, which uses the hover-craft concept to move loads by using a bed of high pressure air. Previously, shifting engines within its facility would require cranes and castors in a lengthy process that could take up to 100 minutes. With the Flying Carpet, Rolls Royce is able to do this in 37 minutes. It is also cheaper to implement, at about 40 per cent of the S$600,000 cost for a customised electric forklift.\n\nIn her speech, Mrs Teo also stressed other incentive programmes that the government is implementing to help firms raise productivity, such as by setting aside S$1 billion per year till 2020 under the SkillsFuture initiative to encourage lifelong learning and the continuous acquisition of relevant skills.\n\nFor Singaporeans aged 40 and above, education and training subsidies will also be bumped up for courses funded by the Ministry of Education and the Workforce Development Agency.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Canon Inc, Japan Post Holdings Co and Itochu Corp have led US$28 billion of purchases abroad so far this year, the fastest start on record for Japanese acquirers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg going back to at least 2006.\n\nThey're paying up, too, with takeover premiums that are about double the global average, the data show. And the trend is set to continue.\n\nAfter years of building up cash to a record 233 trillion yen (S$2.7 trillion) as of the end of September, Japanese companies are looking to convert those stockpiles into future growth by investing overseas where the outlook is brighter.\n\nWhile the yen's 14 per cent drop against the dollar in the past year has made foreign acquisitions more expensive, economists project the Japanese currency will weaken further amid Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's campaign to fight deflation. That gives companies the incentive to spend now.\n\nJapan Tobacco Inc, Asia's biggest listed cigarette maker, has declared a \"year of investments\" while machinery maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and brewer Kirin Holdings Co are also considering growth through takeovers abroad.\n\n\"Japan Inc's sense of urgency in making acquisitions abroad is strengthening,\" said Makoto Shiono, managing director of Tokyo-based consultancy Industrial Growth Platform Inc.\n\n\"Japan's massive monetary easing slashed the value of cash. So if you have tons of cash, investors will be pressing you to invest in companies to generate cash flow for future growth,\" he said.\n\nCompanies in Japan have agreed to pay an average 39 per cent premium for overseas takeovers and majority-interest purchases announced since Jan 1, compared with the global average of less than 20 per cent during the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Japanese purchases valued their targets at a median 23 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared to the global median Ebitda multiple of 9.4.\n\nThe takeover activity has been broad in nature, spanning a number of industries. This week alone, Hitachi Ltd agreed to buy Rome-based Finmeccanica SpA's stake in Ansaldo STS SpA, in a deal valuing the maker of driverless metro trains at 1.93 billion euros (S$3 billion). Japanese chemical producer Asahi Kasei Corp said it will buy Charlotte, North Carolina-based Polypore International Inc to expand its battery business.\n\nEarlier this month, Japan Post offered A$6.5 billion (S$7 billion) for Melbourne-based transport firm Toll Holdings Ltd in the biggest Australian acquisition by a Japanese company. Canon said Feb 10 it made a 23.6 billion krona (S$3.8 billion) cash bid for Sweden's Axis Communications AB, expanding into video surveillance as smartphone competition erodes digital camera sales. And in January, the 157-year-old trading house Itochu agreed to the US$5 billion purchase of a stake in China's Citic Ltd.\n\nThe combination of large cash hoards, cheap financing and Japan's shrinking and aging population is driving companies to invest overseas, said Shintaro Okuno, a partner at Bain & Co who specialises in mergers.\n\n\"They're coming to a point where they have to do these radical moves,\" Tokyo-based Mr Okuno said. \"And also, money here is so cheap.\" Even after weakening to 119 yen against the US dollar from a postwar high of about 75 yen in 2011, Japan's currency may still decline to 128 yen next year, according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Japan's economy is forecast to grow 1 per cent this year, compared with 3.1 per cent for the U.S. and 1.2 per cent for the euro area, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nOverseas purchases are likely to continue, and lenders are willing to finance deals, Japanese Bankers Association chairman Nobuyuki Hirano said Feb 19. That will help companies like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which said last August it's looking for more takeover opportunities as it targets 5 trillion yen in revenue by 2017. The industrial company was thwarted in a bid for Alstom SA's power business in June, after the French government backed a competing offer from General Electric Co. BLOOMBERG\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Other analysts are expecting a rise to NZ$4.80-4.90.\n\nNew Zealand's dairy production, which is pasture-based, has fallen in past months due to a dry summer, prompting the government to declare drought in the South Island, the country's fastest growing dairying region.\n\nLast month, Fonterra cut its annual collection forecast by 3.3 per cent from last year's record volumes, while announcing that it would reduce the amount of whole milk powder offered at its auctions by around 15 per cent over the next six months.\n\nAnalysts expect global dairy prices to continue rising in the coming months as supply remains tight, although another dip in prices may be in store in the second half of the year as supply from Europe and North America hits the market.\n\nEasing growth in China has weighed on consumption and has slowed the aggressive pace of buying by Chinese processors seen in 2013 and early 2014.

The latest staff reductions are in addition to CIMB closing its Australian offices, affecting 103 jobs, a move announced Feb 9.\n\nCIMB was part of a plan for a three-way merger with RHB Capital Bhd and Malaysia Building Society Bhd. After the deal was scrapped last month, CIMB said it will seek only minor takeovers as part of its efforts to expand in Southeast Asia.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

It is aimed at giving order to public gatherings,\" Col Winthai told Reuters.\n\nThe army declared martial law in May, days before it ousted an elected government in a coup.\n\nMartial law remains in place despite calls for it to be lifted from tourism industry operators who fear it damages the country's image. Martial law includes a ban on public gatherings of more than five people.\n\nThe coup followed months of street protests aimed at ousting former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.\n\nCritics say the law on restricting protests that sailed through its first reading on Thursday would help the junta to stifle dissent and maintain its largely unchallenged rule. \"This law will replace martial law and control political protests which is an infringement on people's rights,\" said Thanawut Wichaidit, a spokesman for the pro-Yingluck United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship activist group.\n\nThe bill must pass a second and third reading for it to come law, which looks likely given its support in the National Legislative Assembly whose members were picked by the military.\n\nIf the bill becomes law it would ban protests outside courts, parliament and the prime minister's offices, known as Government House, Jate Siratharanont, a member of the assembly, told Reuters.\n\nPolice would have to be informed of a protest at least 24 hours in advance and gatherings between 6 pm and 6 am would be banned unless protesters got permission, Jate said.\n\nBut authorities would need permission from the courts to disperse protests.\n\nMatthew Smith, executive director of Fortify Rights, a Southeast Asia-based rights group, said it would be difficult for Thailand to argue that the law was in the public interest. \"On the contrary, this appears to be a move that's inconsistent with Thailand's human rights obligations,\" said Mr Smith.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

Various projections place India's growth in 2014-15 at 5.5 per cent and Budget 2015, therefore, is riding high on aspirations. Anticipated to build on the current reforms momentum, this budget is expected to place the country back on the path to sustainable high growth, ushering in a stable tax regime and boosting positive sentiments in the business economy.\n\nThe Indian government is challenged to deliver a budget that is easy on the pocket of the common man, and yet sufficiently encouraging for corporates and foreign investors. The government, therefore, will have to strike a balance between expectations and fiscal prudence and lay down a clear and a stable policy framework to boost the Indian economy.\n\nOne of the key focus areas for the new government has been to revive the investment cycle. Widely regarded as one of the BJP government's priorities. the \"Make-in-India\" campaign initiated by the government late last year will play an instrumental role in addressing many of the issues faced by the country today. Increased investment in manufacturing facilities is expected to make India self-sustainable, create employment, increase disposable income for people and trigger the investment cycle while bringing pride amongst the citizens. The sector can be provided with considerable thrust through creation of specific manufacturing zones, hubs and industrial parks, as well as increasing the number of special economic zones and freight corridors.\n\nIn the past 12 months or so, we have witnessed a significant rise in the money through the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) route. However, India needs more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and this must be enabled by policy reforms on the FDI front. The government must update key policies and offer tax and non-tax incentives. Steps will also need to be undertaken to improve India's ranking in terms of ease of doing business. For example, a true single-window clearance mechanism should be implemented so as to reduce the multiple approvals which are generally sought at the national and state levels. The other major aspect to be dealt with is the contracts and time taken for various approvals. This can be achieved by building more accountability in the bureaucracy.\n\nAs per the prevailing wisdom, the government has relentlessly acted on its conviction about achieving the fiscal deficit target over the years. However, just weeks before the budget is launched a number of economists have asked the government to step up public spending by readjusting the fiscal road map. The idea that public spending needs to be increased had been mooted by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian in the mid-year review of the economy released last December. The argument is that the stressed private sector is not in a position to invest and the government needs to step in. This, in my opinion, can help spur investments, creating more jobs in the economy. To widen revenue collection through an increase in the tax base and additional revenues through non-fiscal resources such as divestments is another widespread expectation. A Goods and Services Tax (GST) will help in increasing the collection of revenue and reducing significant costs. And, therefore, a clear roadmap that helps bring together various indirect tax laws into GST and its implementation must be specified. Lower tax rates, enhanced tax breaks for investments and measures to ensure cheaper and efficient funding for the small and medium sector will also facilitate growth. Furthermore, the budget should include some policies on liberalisation and attract investment in other sectors.\n\nAbout a year ago, foreign investors were uncertain and unconvinced about the tax regime in India. With retrospective amendments and General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR), investors began rethinking their plans of doing business in India. Deferring GAAR for a specific period of time and bringing more clarity on the retrospective tax will further continue to build and strengthen confidence in a stable tax regime.\n\nThe bottomline is that Budget 2015 is a litmus test for the BJP government. The world is waiting and watching to know if the Indian government can translate words into actions as well as accelerate the reforms momentum for a more sustainable and inclusive growth.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was below the 2014 average of 121.1.\n\nIn terms of their current personal finances, 27 per cent (down 2 percentage points) of respondents said that their families are \"better off\" financially as compared to a year ago, while 11 per cent (up one percentage point) said they are \"worse off\".\n\nWith regard to expectations of their future financial situations, 29 per cent (down 5 percentage points) of respondents said that they expect their families to be financially \"better off\" in a year, while 8 per cent (up one percentage point) are more pessimistic.\n\nThese findings mean that less than a third of households surveyed believe that their personal financial situation is better now as compared to a year ago, or that it will improve in the coming year.\n\n\"The fall in consumer confidence over the month of February was fairly broad based, though the outsized fall in the assessment of personal finances over the next 12 months stands out, and continues to point to reticence as the most likely consumer behaviour going forward,\" said ANZ chief economist of South Asia, Asean and Pacific, Glenn Maguire.\n\nConsumer sentiment towards the purchase of major household items does not look too cheerful either, with only 20 per cent (down 3 percentage points) of respondents saying that now is a \"good time to buy\" such items.\n\nLong-term economic and financial outlook appears to be rosier, although less than half of Singaporeans are optimistic, with 44 per cent (down one percentage point) expecting \"good times\" for Singapore economically over the next 12 months.\n\nOf the respondents surveyed, only 45 per cent (up one percentage point) expect Singapore to experience \"good times\" financially during the next five years.\n\nMr Maguire described the \"overall tone\" of the surveys on personal financial situations as \"sombre\", citing the \"overhang of supply-side restructuring\" as a possible reason for low consumer confidence levels.\n\n\"It is difficult to turn optimistic on the outlook for consumer spending in Singapore till a larger number of households express confidence on either their own or Singapore's outlook.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That makes their goods more expensive abroad, a particular challenge if they have a high local cost base.\n\nBusinesses such as Distec are taking advantage of a reduced-working-hour programme under which companies temporarily reduce hours and the state pays for a shortfall in employees' wages.\n\n\"We need to lower our costs,\" said Loris Marsura, director of Distec, based in Disentis in the canton of Graubuenden. Some orders have been postponed three months, he said, adding that it's not yet clear how long the programme will be in force.\n\n\"We're a supplier of other companies, many of which are export-oriented and have been hit hard\" by the strong franc, he said.\n\nLast month, the government modified the rules under which companies can apply for reduced-working-hour compensation to include exchange rate fluctuations after the Swiss National Bank stunned markets by giving up its cap on the franc of 1.20 per euro.\n\nBusinesses that cut employees' regular hours by more than 10 per cent can request the lost wages be paid out of local unemployment office funds. The measure can be in force for 12 months during a two-year period.\n\n\"Companies strongly challenged by the franc's strong appreciation now have an additional instrument to save jobs,\" the Economy Ministry in Bern said on Jan 27. This measure already \"proved its worth in the 2008 financial crisis\".\n\nSmall and medium-sized businesses with fewer than 250 employees generate two thirds of employment in Switzerland. The export-oriented manufacturing sector constitutes about 19 per cent of annual economic output.\n\n\"With the shortened work compensation, the insurance offers employers an alternative to looming layoffs,\" the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs says on its website. \"The employer thus saves on the cost of fluctuation in personnel.\"\n\nThe system of reduced working hours, known as Kurzarbeit in German, is also common in Austria and Germany to lessen the impact of an economic shock. Rather than firing workers as the German economy contracted in 2009, companies were subsidised by the government to keep them on reduced working hours, saving almost half a million jobs.\n\nAt Distec, 68 employees are on shortened working hours, the municipal bureau of industry, business and employment said. The company has 85 staff, 23 of whom are apprentices, according to company website.\n\nFollowing the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings, as many as 5,000 companies and 92,000 workers in Switzerland were participating in reduced-working-hour programmes. That compares with just 222 companies and 2,500 employees in November 2014.

Share of results from associates had also increased on the disposal of a loss-making associate which runs its waste-to-energy plant, Rotary said in a statement.\n\nTaxation fell 77 per cent to S$1.5 million. Rotary said that taxation in the fourth quarter was in line with profits. In the same quarter last year, tax was higher relative to profits due to losses from its overseas subsidiaries for which no deferred tax benefits have been recognised.\n\nFor the three months ended Dec 31, 2014, Rotary's revenue plunged 31 per cent to S$125.68 million as the group reaches completion on some of its major projects.\n\nMeanwhile, Rotary's FY14 net profit more than doubled to S$50.08 million, while revenue surged 16 per cent to S$687.66 million due to increased business activities from the execution of major projects.\n\nWhile its business performance improved in the recent quarter, Rotary warned that any protracted weaknesses in oil prices from current levels may affect its business due to increased competition for projects. Since June 2014, crude prices have about halved in value on the back of oversupply amid weak demand.\n\nThe oil patch, coupled with a tight foreign labour market in Singapore, could pressure its margins and profitability, Rotary said.\n\nIn such challenging times, the group will focus on improving productivity and on executing current projects. As at Wednesday, Rotary's order book stood at S$204 million.\n\nAmid the current volatility of oil prices, Rotary remains confident that the long term fundamentals in the oil and gas industry remain strong. As such, the group says that its business development activities remain robust and that it will continue to actively develop its business through direct negotiations and via project bidding in Asean and Gulf Cooperation Council countries.\n\nRotary is also seeking and evaluating business opportunities that complement its existing activities and fortify its supply chain integration. These include strategic investments to diversify its sources of income and revenue in the longer-term.\n\nFor the three months ended Dec 31, 2014, Rotary's earnings per share stood at 2.1 cents while net asset value per share was 45.2 cents. A final dividend of 2.5 cents per share was declared for the period.\n\nBefore results were announced on Wednesday, Rotary closed up 0.9 per cent at S$0.545.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Positions are being cut and pay frozen as some projects are delayed or cancelled. The North Sea is one of the world's most expensive areas to extract reserves and is suffering from one of the steepest declines in output.\n\nActual job losses, which are \"extraordinarily difficult to estimate\", depend partly on the signal the government sends to the companies it needs to invest in the region, Mr Wood said.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne will make the case in his annual budget on March 18 after cutting a supplementary tax on the industry by 2 per cent in December.\n\n\"The net effect should be below 40 per cent to change the mind and mood of investment in the North Sea,\" said Mr Wood, whose review of the industry a year ago, including policies to promote development, was accepted in full by the government.\n\nMr Osborne seems certain to introduce basin-wide field allowances to spur investment, cutting the effective tax rate to 50 per cent from 60 per cent currently, according to Mr Wood, who says he isn't privy to Treasury plans. \"That's still too high though,\" he said. \"What is needed is a reduction in the headline or supplementary tax.\"\n\nThe industry's lobby has called for the UK to fast-track a public consultation on the investment allowance so the proposal can take effect from this year's budget. The Treasury declined to comment specifically on its plans but referred to an earlier statement that Mr Osborne had vowed to take further action.\n\nThe supplementary tax, cut to 30 per cent by the chancellor last year, is paid on top of corporation tax of 30 per cent. Mr Wood, chairman of oil services provider John Wood Group plc in the six years to 2012 and chief executive officer from 1982 to 2006, has advised a total tax take of 40 per cent or less.\n\nMeanwhile, an industry report said on Tuesday that UK North Sea investment will drop by more than half as tumbling oil prices and high taxation force energy producers to cut costs. Planned spending on new projects is seen shrinking to \u00a33.5 billion (S$7.3 billion) this year from \u00a38.5 billion in 2014, the annual survey by the Oil & Gas UK lobby shows. Investments may sink further to \u00a32.5 billion by 2018, it said.\n\n\"There is very little fresh investment,\" Malcolm Webb, CEO of the group that represents about 500 companies, said in a statement. It \"paints a bleak picture\", he said.\n\nMr Wood, though, remains relatively optimistic longer term.\n\nImprovements being implemented as a result of his review, including the creation of an industry regulator that can ensure better utilisation of oil and gas infrastructure, are helping, along with cooperation among operators in developing fields.\n\n\"Oil companies are completely supporting the collaboration because of the examples of the past with stranded assets or insufficient development,\" Mr Wood said. \"There's a lot more to be done.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": []}

So we will do it in the most business-friendly way,\" Abbott told reporters in Canberra.\n\nThe hepatitis A outbreak has been linked to poor hygiene and water supplies in a Chinese packaging plant.\n\nUnder current laws, the term \"made from Australian and imported ingredients\" is common, providing no details on the exact origins of all the ingredients in a product or where it was packaged.\n\nProducers have increasingly sought to show their Australian credentials after a 2013 Roy Morgan poll showed more than 60 per cent of Australians sometimes bought products because they were made in Australia even when they were more expensive than imported rivals.\n\nAustralia's largest food processor and packaging company SPC Ardmona, owned by Coca-Cola Amatil, began declaring on its labels that all tinned products were Australian grown and canned after it was forced to seek financial assistance.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

JPMorgan estimates the maximum financing available from the ECB and the Bank of Greece is 108 billion euros, and Greek banks have already borrowed 85 billion euros from them.\n\nReuters, quoting bankers, reported that outflows escalated in the run-up to the Jan 25 election as polls showed that a Syriza left-wing victory was all but certain, and then soared again as the deadline for a debt deal drew closer.\n\nSuch was the relief that creditors tentatively agreed to the reform proposals of the Syriza coalition government with the Independent Greeks that 10-year Greek sovereign bond yields tumbled from a 2015 peak of 11.4 per cent to 8.6 per cent and the stock market jumped 14 per cent on Tuesday before retreating 3 per cent on Wednesday.\n\nAs spots appear on rose-tinted spectacles, market participants are beginning to appreciate that Syriza has to sell its reform package to the struggling Greek populace, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel has to persuade the disenchanted German Parliament and constituents.\n\nThe Greek government has only four months to show creditors, notably the European Union, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that proposed economic reforms will be implemented.\n\nAlso, the German Parliament is still to vote on the recommendation that the nation can receive 7.2 billion euros to fund teachers, police, hospitals and other crucial services.\n\nBasically, the significant reforms of the Greek government are: counter direct tax evasion; improve the collection of sales tax; oppose tax avoidance schemes of the wealthy and work with European nations to broaden the tax net; improve efficiency of state and local authority departments; reorganise, modernise and potentially reduce pensions bureaucracy and costs, which account for 56 per cent of total public expenditure (for example, \"help identify non-eligible beneficiaries\" and raise the pensionable age); control health expenditure and improve medical services, while granting universal access to healthcare; make the fight against corruption a national priority (for example, counter smuggling of fuel and tobacco products, and tackle money laundering); activate legislation to ensure that media outlets pay market prices for broadcasting; and continue with privatisation.\n\nTo sell the reforms to the electorate, the creditors agreed that the government could support the most vulnerable households, and modernise bankruptcy laws. The government should also be able to negotiate with banks which wish to repossess homes following defaults of mortgages. The government can also phase in collective fair and flexible wage bargaining and eventually raise the minimum wage. The government should also be allowed to help people in poverty by issuing food stamps and potentially carry out a pilot minimum income scheme.\n\nMuch internal and external negotiating will take place in the coming few months, analysts warn. Total debt of the government, according to official statistics, amounts to 324 billion euros - 181 per cent of gross domestic product. Under current government policy within the strictures of the euro, the Greek economy will struggle to grow sufficiently to cut unemployment and improve the wellbeing of citizens.\n\nThe only positive is the 18 per cent decline of the euro since its peak last year, which should help raise tourism and exports. But the state must meet a massive debt obligation of 22 billion euros in loans, bonds and treasury bills due for repayment by the end of July. A potential default could cause an exit from the eurozone, economists say - and bookies contend that there is still a 33 per cent chance of this happening. German banks are already conducting scenarios and models on what to do if such an event occurs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The steeper fall in value occurred despite a 0.4 per cent increase in HDB households to 965,200 in 2014.\n\nPrivate housing assets held up better, with their total value on households' balance sheet up 2.2 per cent at S$425 billion. A 10.8 per cent jump in private property households possibly offset the impact of a 4 per cent drop in private residential prices last year. As at end-2014, there were 231,200 private property households.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan noted that while households' net worth has been on a downtrend since 2012, there were signs that the growth in assets picked up again in the fourth quarter.\n\nOn a quarter-to-quarter basis, households' total assets edged up 0.9 per cent in the fourth quarter to S$1.76 trillion as at end-2014, after a marginal 0.2 per cent quarter-on-quarter rise in the third quarter. For the full year, households' assets marked a 2.8 per cent increase.\n\nFinancial assets grew a slower 6.4 per cent in 2014 to S$943.2 billion on the back of a 6.1 per cent rise in cash (currency and deposits), a 10 per cent jump in the aggregate value of life insurance assets, and an 8.9 per cent increase in CPF assets.\n\nThe plunge in oil and gas stocks, however, probably hurt the value of shares and securities held by households in the fourth quarter, said Ku Swee Yong, CEO of Century21 Singapore. The value of this asset class dropped 1.4 per cent to S$174.5 billion on the balance sheet; that was still a one per cent increase year on year.\n\nMeanwhile, households' liabilities rose 5.1 per cent year on year to S$294 billion by the end of 2014. This marked the slowest growth since 2011, as growth in both mortgage loans and other personal loans cooled last year amid lending curbs introduced by the government.\n\n\"The liabilities growth rate has stabilised in 2014 across the four quarters,\" Mr Tan observed. But this year, the impending rise in interest rates and new homes being completed could cause a spike in mortgage liabilities. But the record number of new home completions is a double-edged sword, as it will also bolster the assets component of the household balance sheet, he said.\n\nRising wages amid a tight labour market and favourable economic conditions also remain supportive of asset growth for households, Mr Tan added.\n\nLast year, the total value of mortgage loans on households' balance sheet rose 5.5 per cent to S$216.7 billion, possibly due to more homes being completed and higher interest incurred on Sibor-linked loans.\n\nMr Ku said that although the latest set of data looks healthy, he is circumspect about how closely the aggregate value of residential property assets on the household balance sheet tracks the actual value.\n\n\"For HDB resale flats, price negotiation has become very tough, transacted prices have moved from cash-over-valuation to cash-under-valuation, but the resale price index only reflected a 6 per cent drop last year,\" Mr Ku said.\n\nThe aggregated public housing value on the household balance sheet may not reflect what people are feeling on the ground, he added. And since borrowers of housing loans for new HDB flats do not start repaying until the flats' completion, liabilities on this front are set to increase as new flats are completed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some of the world's largest fund managers say another selloff may be in the offing now.\n\nDomestic notes sold by emerging-market governments have returned 2.6 per cent this year in local-currency terms, the best start to a year since 2005, as interest-rate reductions from Indonesia to Romania cut yields to within 0.50 percentage point of equivalent dollar-denominated bonds. That's too small a spread to reward buyers for the exchange-rate risk, according to investors including Fidelity Worldwide Investment and Pictet Asset Management.\n\n\"We remain cautious on emerging currencies, which ultimately has an influence on the argument of local versus dollar bonds,\" said Simon Lue-Fong, who manages two of the world's five largest emerging-market debt funds, totalling US$12 billion, for Pictet in London. \"The narrowing spread has been a reasonable indicator that dollar-denominated bonds will outperform.\"\n\nWhile the central banks of India and Turkey are among those that have lowered borrowing costs, boosting bond returns, traders expect most are running out of room for further cuts as stabilising oil prices ease deflationary pressures and the prospect of interest-rate increases in the US threaten to curb investment flows. The last time the spread was so narrow was June 2013, before signals from the Federal Reserve that it was ready to pare back monetary stimulus sent JPMorgan Chase & Co's local-currency bond index down 3.9 per cent in three months, the most since the data started in 2003.\n\nThis year's rally in local-currency terms extends the gain over the past 12 months to 10.6 per cent, topping the 6.9 per cent return for emerging-market dollar debt, according to JPMorgan indexes. The extra yield investors demand to hold the notes instead of dollar-denominated securities dropped to a three-year low of 30 basis points last month, from a record 152 at the end of May, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nWhile local bonds have been paying less, exchange-rate losses have been growing. Currencies from Brazil's real to Indonesia's rupiah have tumbled this year on concern higher US borrowing costs will suck capital from developing nations. JPMorgan's gauge for emerging-market exchange rates reached an all-time low on Feb 11, sliding more than 30 per cent from a peak in 2011. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index has climbed 3 per cent this year.\n\nThe strength of the dollar will spur a \"flight to quality as investors prefer emerging-market hard-currency assets over emerging-market local assets,\" Steve Ellis, a London-based money manager at Fidelity, said in a Feb 12 e-mail. Local bonds offer \"very little\" premium, said Mr Ellis, whose US$888 million Emerging Markets Debt Fund returned 7.6 per cent in the past year, beating 99 per cent of peers, according to dollar-adjusted data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBy contrast, emerging-market dollar bond yields were 57 basis points above their five-year average, 370 basis points more than US Treasuries, as of Feb 24, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nDeveloping economies will grow 4.3 per cent this year, the slowest pace since 2009, according to the International Monetary Fund. Even so, only Hungary, Poland, Turkey and India will lower borrowing costs further by year-end, based on interest-rate swap data from 14 major emerging markets compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc. Mexico and South Africa will join Brazil in raising rates, while Chile, South Korea and Malaysia will keep theirs on hold, the data show.\n\nMr Lue-Fong, whose US$5.7 billion Pictet Global Emerging Debt fund handed investors a 6.8 per cent return in the past year, beating 74 per cent of its peers, favours dollar debt from Indonesia, Brazil and South Africa, he said by e-mail Feb 12.\n\nThere's still money to be made in the local debt markets, according to Sergei Strigo, the London-based head of emerging- market debt and currencies at Amundi Asset Management, which oversees US$980 billion.\n\n\"Active currency management is essential when investing in local-currency bonds,\" Mr Strigo, who recommends the domestic bonds of commodity-importing nations, such as Hungary, Turkey and Romania, while hedging the exchange-rate risk, said by e- mail on Feb 13.\n\nForeign investors are mostly exiting domestic debt. Fund managers pulled about US$800 million from the bonds this year through Feb 18, according to data compiled by EPFR Global cited by Barclays.\n\n\"What we're concerned about are the currency valuations and the dollar story,\" Mark Capstick, a London-based asset manager at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which oversees the equivalent of US$574 billion, said by phone on Feb 18. Mr Capstick has cut holdings of Indonesian and Thai local debt and is considering buying the international bonds of energy producers that carry higher yields.\n\n\"It's getting more clearly evident that central banks are becoming increasingly comfortable with currency weakness as a way out of economic troubles,\" he said.

We will request the Singapore Stock Exchange to lift the trading halt tomorrow 27 February before market opens,'' Noble said.\n\nEarlier, the company said its\n\nauditors had requested for more time\n\nto review their own internal processes before signing off on the group's annual accounts in the light of the allegations. The trading halt was requested in order to allow time for consulting the auditors and management about fresh allegations made.\n\nNoble stressed the allegations are without substance: \"To be clear, the statements made by Iceberg are materially and factually inaccurate. Our core businesses are in robust health and the statements made by Iceberg cannot be relied upon in assessing the company's financial condition.''\n\nIt added that the Iceberg report does not take account of the contributions of its many other businesses such as oil liquids, power and gas, metals, as well as energy solutions business.\n\nIn its latest report, the anonymous group, which launched its first analysis on Noble on Feb 15, 2015,\n\nalleges that Noble's profits are overstated\n\ndue to the \"remarkable increase\" in the fair values of unrealised commodities contracts (mark-to-market or MTM).\n\n\"These contracts surged from near zero in 2009 to an unprecedented net US$3.8 billion (US$5.8 billion assets and US$2 billion liabilities),\" Iceberg said in its second report on Noble, which analyses the group's fair values and operating cash flows.\n\n\"We have analysed Noble's OCF (operating cash flows) and working capital in depth over the past few years. The group has been largely unable to realise the MTM that matured during that period. Based on this analysis, we believe that at least US$3.8 billion in fair values are overstated and should be impaired. Impairing these fair values dramatically impacts Noble's performance indicators.''\n\nAccording to Iceberg, Noble books fair value gains on long-term offtake agreements it has with its suppliers upfront. That means expected profits for the duration of the contract which could be more than 20 years is booked on day one in the income statement. It asserts that Noble has been doing this for contracts that have yet to start, or from mines that have yet to secure financing.\n\nIt said the fair value of unrealised commodity contracts (mark-to-market) which are related to its long-term offtake agreements is too high and needs to be written down.\n\nIceberg said Noble's operating cash flows are weak and the reported operating cash flows are inflated as it excludes interest expenses and includes cash balances with futures brokers not immediately available for use in the business operations.\n\n\"The divergence between Noble's net profit and OCF is striking given its status as an investment grade company. Noble has recorded a combined US$2.7 billion net profit since 2009. However, its operations have lost US$485 million in cash in the same period. OCF have continued to deteriorate since 2011, e.g. (US$620 million) outflows in 9M 2014,'' it said.\n\n\"We believe the OCF would have been even worse without the help of inventories repos.''\n\nIceberg said there will be a third report which will focus on Noble's debt and the investment grade.\n\n\"We will show that the way Noble reports its debt (gross, net, post inventories), and its so-called \"liquidity headroom\" are highly misleading. Noble does not report its entire debt. We will also write about very obvious governance issues (e.g. the board of directors), the number of key executives who left the group, and the role of the auditor. We will present our final valuation of Noble,'' the report said.\n\nThe research group stressed that it is not claiming that Noble is performing outright accounting fraud, but rather stretching the accounting rules to the maximum.\n\nIt concluded that \"Noble is engaged in a vicious cycle...When a trader uses fair values to hide the performance of a bad quarter, the assumption is that the future quarters will be better. It is \"ok\" to do it because there will be better times later on...The problem for Noble is that the better quarters probably never came.''\n\n\"It is now too late for Noble. There will be no miraculous recovery. The market will progressively realise the company's fair values are largely fabricated,'' Iceberg said.\n\nResponding to the latest report, Noble insists it \"has a robust and disciplined profit recognition policy for its commodity contracts'' and that it takes a conservative risk management position.\n\n\"As the products underlying the contracts are delivered, cash is generated and profit is recognized as the difference between the cash inflow and the discounted value on the balance sheet.\"\n\nIt added that it is misleading to presume that the net fair value gains and losses equates to the profit and loss of the company.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

About 2.2 million shares changed hands, or 13 per cent above the six-month average trading volume of the stock, according to Bloomberg.\n\nTraders were not yet ready to adjust their bets based on the news.\n\n\"The stock wasn't a big deal today,\" one trader said. \"People just want to see what's going to happen next, what the successor is going to do. It's too early to say for now.\"\n\nStock analysts who cover the company stuck with their calls.\n\n\"This development is not totally unexpected as his contract is due for renewal this year,\" wrote Carmen Lee of OCBC Research.\n\nMs Lee, who did not expect a \"major impact\" on SGX's operations, stuck to her \"hold\" rating and target price of S$7.52.\n\nDeutsche Bank analysts Sukrit Khatri and Tracy Yu wrote: \"In the short term we do not expect a change in SGX's strategy of reviving and strengthening the security market infrastructure through reforms announced in June 2014...We also believe the new CEO will continue to build on SGX's strength as an Asian derivative house, as championed by Magnus during his time at SGX.\"\n\nDeutsche left its \"buy\" call and S$8.70 target unchanged.\n\nBut analysts also shared a list of daunting challenges for Mr Bocker's successor, who will be chosen with the help of search firm Spencer Stuart.\n\nCIMB's Kenneth Ng said the new CEO will have to improve liquidity in the Singapore market and keep it \"relevant in this world\". Fostering a South-east Asian hinterland through regional tie-ups will be key, so \"the new CEO will probably have to have a bit of negotiation and PR abilities\".\n\nOCBC's Ms Lee said the issue of specified and excluded investment products, which set out rules on which investors are suitable for certain investment products, remains a point of contention with critics arguing that some products are wrongly classified and thus hurting market liquidity. Improving trading activity is a top priority, she said.\n\n\"Trading volume has remained dismal, especially after the small-to-mid cap selloff, and this is one of the key issues that both market players and investors will be watching out for,\" Ms Lee said.\n\nBut Mr Bocker, who has had his fair share of critics, generally earned praise for the job that he has done so far.\n\n\"While Magnus had come under criticism from remisiers as average daily turnover fell 28 per cent from 2010, we believe his plans of cutting the board lot size and the introduction of market makers and liquidity providers have undoubtedly helped in boosting the cash market,\" Deutsche wrote. \"Magnus was instrumental for his push towards closer connectivity with China, including the launch of China A50 futures and the commodity products.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Instead, much of the business for Gulf clients is done out of European cities.\n\nIn another step that could help to change this, the DFSA last August created a new class of DIFC-domiciled funds, aimed at the richest and most risk-tolerant investors, which face less stringent regulation than existing funds.\n\nThe DFSA said on Wednesday that its new rules on professional clients would take effect on April 1, except for a provision increasing the minimum assets of one type of professional client to US$1 million from US$500,000. That will come into effect on April 1, 2016, to give firms time to adjust.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

The intersection was the scene of a fatal collision between an Amtrak passenger train and a car seven months ago.\n\nIn the accident on Tuesday, Metrolink passengers were launched from their seats as the train struck the truck and several cars derailed. Twenty-eight people were taken to hospitals, with broken bones and head, neck and back injuries, the authorities said.\n\nFour people were critically injured, including the train's engineer, whom the authorities credited with quickly pulling the emergency brake and slowing the train after he spotted the truck sitting on the tracks.\n\nWhen rescue crews arrived minutes later, they found three of the Metrolink cars on their sides and the truck engulfed in flames.\n\nOfficials said they did not know why the truck's driver, a 54-year-old man from Arizona, had steered onto the tracks. Jason Benites, Oxnard's assistant police chief, said an officer had found the driver about two km away, apparently disoriented and unsettled. He was taken to a hospital for observation and was said to be cooperating with the authorities.\n\nThe police later said the driver had been arrested on a felony hit-and-run charge.\n\nThe crash occurred at one of the potentially dangerous crossings in California, according to an accident prediction value generated by the Federal Railroad Administration. Of the 5,858 public crossings in the state, the crossing here at Rice Avenue and Fifth Street - an intersection often filled with produce trucks and agricultural equipment - has the eighth-highest accident prediction value. Only 52 public crossings in the nation are listed with a higher accident prediction value.\n\nThe metric takes into account certain physical characteristics of crossings and recent accidents, though it is not a perfect measurement of danger. It does not account for other factors, like topography and traffic congestion.\n\nThere have been 13 crashes involving trains and pedestrians or vehicles at this crossing since 1976, according to Federal Railroad Administration records. In June 2014, two people in an Infiniti G35 were killed at the crossing when they failed to stop at the lowered crossing arms and were struck by an Amtrak train. None of the train's passengers were hurt in that accident.\n\nPatricia Villafana, whose son Joel Arias was driving the car in the fatal 2014 crash, said she is haunted now when she is stopped at the crossing and watches trains rushing past.\n\n\"It's very difficult,\" she said. \"Every time I drive by there, the accident comes to my mind.\"\n\nDespite the statistics, Oxnard residents said on Tuesday they believed the intersection was no more dangerous than any other surface crossings where drivers must cross train tracks. Jerry Gomez said a friend's car had recently been clipped by a train and the friend hurt while crossing the tracks at a different intersection.

The hammer price was S$500,000. An additional S$250,000 was already pledged by UOB at the start of the auction.\n\nHalf of the sum, S$375,000, will go to The Business Times Budding Artists Fund, which provides music, dance, drama or art lessons for less privileged children and teenagers through programmes run by the Rice Company. The donation is the largest ever by UOB to the fund.\n\nThe other half of the money will go to the elderly through the Sage Counselling Centre. A UOB spokesman said: \"We wanted to give something to the young and something to the old.\"\n\nThe painting, which measures 1.5m by 1m, features famous landmarks in Singapore, including City Hall building and the Singapore River. It is executed in Chinese ink on rice paper by the 50-year-old Mr Gong, who's a two-time winner of the annual UOB Painting Of The Year Competition, in 2002 and 2011.\n\nUOB is an ardent supporter of the arts. It most recently inked a partnership with the soon-to-be-opened National Gallery to promote South-east Asian art through the three-storey UOB Southeast Asia Gallery. It will also open its own extensive art collection for the National Gallery to access, having amassed important works since the 1970s.\n\nOn Monday, The Business Times ran a picture of the painting being looked at by UOB Group deputy chairman and chief executive Wee Ee Cheong, group managing director (commercial and banking) Eric Tham and the artist.\n\nSubsequently, the bank received more than 40 SMSes from its clients expressing interest in the painting, with the highest offer coming in at S$250,000. The actual auction saw bids race quickly towards double that figure.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Members of the group have not been identified. \"The domain name service server hosting Lenovo's website was hacked. We do not have any further information at this time to share. We'll update as soon as possible,\" Lenovo said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nSan Francisco-based security firm CloudFlare said hackers transferred the domain to CloudFlare in order to point it to a defacement site. \"As soon as we at CloudFlare noticed, we seized the account and worked with Lenovo to restore service while they worked to recover their domain,\" Marc Rogers, Principal Security Researcher at CloudFlare, said in an email to Reuters.\n\nStarting 4 pm ET (2100 GMT) on Wednesday, visitors to the Lenovo website saw a slideshow of young people looking into webcams and the song \"Breaking Free\" playing in the background, according to The Verge, which first reported the breach. \"We're breaking free! Soarin', flyin', there's not a star in heaven that we can't reach!,\" Lizard Squad posted on its Twitter page, quoting the song from the movie \"High School Musical\". The hackers also posted a couple of screenshots of an email between Lenovo employees regarding the \"Superfish\" software.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security said in an alert on Friday that the \"Superfish\" programme makes users vulnerable to a type of cyberattack known as SSL spoofing, in which remote attackers can read encrypted web traffic, redirect traffic from official websites to spoofs, and perform other attacks.\n\nMr Rogers also said CloudFlare was able to restore service before Lenovo recovered the domain, suggesting that the outage was probably \"quite small\".\n\nHowever, Lenovo's website was inaccessible at 7.54 pm ET (0054 GMT). A message said the site was unavailable due to system maintenance.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

It's the fourth time in the past five quarters that the New York-based bank reduced earnings in the weeks after announcing them.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc - the three biggest US banks - previously settled with federal and state authorities over the probes, agreeing to pay a total of more than US$35 billion in cash and consumer relief.

I have made substantial changes,\" he said.\n\nEurope's biggest bank has admitted failings in compliance and controls in its Swiss private bank after media reports said it helped wealthy customers conceal millions of dollars of assets in a period up to 2007.\n\nIt adds to a long list of banking scandals that have emerged since the financial crisis, including several at HSBC. The bank was fined US$1.9 billion two years ago by US authorities for lax controls that allowed criminals to launder money and was also hit with a US$611 million penalty by regulators in November for alleged manipulation of currency markets. \"It's a terrible list,\" Mr Flint said when a UK member of parliament read out the recent fines and investigations.\n\nHe said the bank was more than halfway through a transformation to make it simpler and create more central control. \"I sincerely hope there are no more skeletons,\" Mr Flint added.\n\nMr Flint said the allegations of wrongdoing had had a devastating impact on the bank's reputation that would take time to rebuild.\n\nThis has also caused a political storm in Britain ahead of an election in May. The opposition Labour Party has criticised Prime Minister David Cameron for appointing former HSBC Chairman Stephen Green as a trade minister after he left the bank.\n\nMr Green was responsible along with the rest of the management team for the control environment at the time, but Flint said the people most responsible for the Swiss bank failings were local management.\n\nMr Gulliver's own tax affairs have been thrust into the centre of the scandal after Britain's Guardian newspaper said he had sheltered millions of pounds in HSBC's Swiss private bank via a Panamanian company. \"Do you have the moral authority to carry on this change process at HSBC?\" one of the lawmakers asked him during an often hostile grilling lasting almost two hours.\n\nMr Gulliver denied any wrongdoing and said being domiciled in Hong Kong did not represent aggressive tax avoidance. He said he had paid all his UK taxes and opened his Swiss account via a Panama company so colleagues could not see his finances.\n\nMr Gulliver has said the failings in Switzerland were in the past and that the business there had since been transformed.\n\nHe was appointed CEO of HSBC in 2011 and has sold or closed 77 businesses and axed more than 50,000 jobs at the bank as part of a restructuring of the group.\n\nHSBC's Swiss bank is under investigation by a number of countries, including France and Belgium, and tax authorities in Argentina, Switzerland and India are also investigating the allegations of tax evasion.\n\nBritain's financial watchdog is looking at standards at the Swiss bank, but no UK authority has announced any criminal probe.\n\nHMRC, Britain's tax authority, has faced criticism for not being tough enough on tax avoiders or the bank itself. One UK individual has been prosecuted and HMRC has reclaimed 135 million pounds (S$283.4 million) from names on the HSBC list, including 15 million pounds in penalties.\n\nLin Homer, chief executive of HMRC, said the data provided on the HSBC Swiss bank clients was of poor quality and authorities had pursued everybody they believes owed tax from the Swiss data received. \"We broadly think we have got it all,\"she told the panel of lawmakers.\n\nHMRC said in a statement the Swiss data can be shared with other government agencies and it will meet next week with the Serious Fraud Office, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Crown Prosecution Service, City of London Police, the National Crime Agency and EuroJust.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

After pressure from the Commission it offered a cut of 0.5 per cent this year.\n\nBecause disciplinary steps against Paris are already advanced, missing the deadline and adjustment targets could have meant a fine of up to 4 billion euros (S$6.1 billion).\n\nBut none came on Wednesday. Instead, the Commission will recommend to EU leaders at their next summit in March that they accept a 0.5-per cent structural deficit cut this year and ask Paris to present a major new reform plan in April. \"France has already announced several reforms in the past few days. These are steps in the right direction,\" Mr Moscovici said. \"This should be built upon and so we expect France to present an ambitious and more detailed national reform programme in April.\" The Commission will review if Paris is indeed meeting the promised structural deficit adjustment in May and, were it to not deliver again, it could again face a fine.\n\nSeveral euro zone policymakers, none willing to speak out in public, told Reuters the decision was bad for the credibility of EU budget rules, which were sharpened over the last three years to prevent overspending and a future sovereign debt crisis. \"So its official, the fiscal rules don't mean anything,\" one euro zone official said after the announcement.\n\nSince 2001, France had a deficit below 3 per cent only in 2006 and 2007 and has repeatedly missed consolidation deadlines.\n\nItaly's and Belgium's public debt has been rising every year since 2008. For Rome it is expected to peak at 133 per cent of GDP this year and for Brussels at 106.8 per cent.\n\nEU rules say governments must reduce their debt every year by one twentieth of the difference between 60 per cent and the current level.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

Ramnit has been infecting computers since 2012.\n\nThe British-led investigation is ongoing and Mr Gillen said he could not comment on any possible arrests of suspects because that could interfere with police operations.\n\nEuropol, the European police agency, has been coordinating cross border efforts to take down criminal infrastructure on the Internet and bring to justice those responsible.\n\nIn November, US and European authorities seized more than 400 secret website addresses and arrested suspects in an operation targeting black markets for drugs and other illegal services, known as Silk Road 2.0.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

At least that's what BHP Billiton Ltd. and Australia's central bank chief Glenn Stevens are signaling 3,500 miles away.\n\nBeing the most China-dependent developed economy Australia is highly attuned to the ebbs and flows in the world's biggest trading nation. While China's growth has slowed, the best estimate of Aussie exporters and policy makers is that housing demand from the migration of rural Chinese to cities will help avert an abrupt further slump in expansion.\n\nBHP, the world's biggest miner, forecasts a moderate recovery in Chinese demand for steel in 2015. The Reserve Bank of Australia chief says that growth in the second-largest economy is impressive. And one measure favored by some investors, iron-ore shipments from the remote northwest Port Hedland - the largest exit point for such exports - have stabilised near a record level.\n\n\"Australia's data show that China's economy is set to remain strong in 2015,\" said James Laurenceson, professor of economics and deputy director of the Australia-China Relations Institute in Sydney. \"I look at all the numbers - resources, agriculture and services - and see solid indicators across the board.\" One measure from China itself Wednesday offered evidence of a trough in what's been a downturn in industrial expansion. The preliminary purchasing manager's index for February from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed a rebound. The Aussie dollar - which tumbled 15 per cent in the past six months as China's slowdown deepened - gained after the release.\n\n\"The real thing that is impacting us at the moment is the slowdown in residential construction\" in China, John Edwards, a member of the Australian central bank's board, said in a Feb 17 interview. \"There are some signs that that is beginning to turn around. It will have to turn around, otherwise China won't be able to achieve its aims in respect of urbanization in the next decade or two.\" Chinese policy makers have taken steps to shore up the property market, lowering interest rates last year and cutting lenders' required reserve ratios this month. An embrace of greater liquidity helped spur a third straight gain in China's broadest measure of new credit in January.\n\nOfficials also are preparing measures to counter a housing market slump and will roll them out if the economy needs support, people with knowledge of the matter say.\n\nChinese residential construction is a boon for Australian resource producers. Rio Tinto Group, the world's second-largest mining company, estimates China's 1.3 billion people were 54 percent urbanised at the end of last year, and predicts that proportion will reach 70 per cent by 2030, supporting steel output and demand for iron ore.\n\nCrude steel production in China increased to about 830 million metric tons in 2014 and is on course to reach 1 billion tons a year by 2030, Rio said in its earnings statement Feb 12.\n\nWhile China's economic growth slowed in 2014 to 7.4 per cent from 7.7 per cent a year earlier, Australian policy makers say efforts by the Chinese to boost consumption at the expense of construction and to stamp out corruption bode well for the long term.\n\n\"One would hope that they will come out of this recalibration of their economy being stronger and in a better place to be an engine of growth,\" John Fraser, who recently took office as Australia's secretary to the Treasury and is a former chief executive officer of UBS Global Asset Management, told a parliamentary panel Feb 25.\n\nThe Treasury in December forecast growth in China of 6.75 per cent in 2015 and 6.5 per cent in 2016.\n\nAustralia's links to China tightened in the past decade as exports to what's now its largest trading partner almost quadrupled in five years. It exports 5.8 per cent of its gross domestic product to China, more than the combined 4.7 per cent France sends to Germany and Italy, according to data from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFor the RBA's Stevens, growth in China of about 7 per cent, down from 10 per cent years ago, is still good.\n\n\"They are by now, I think, the largest trading economy in the world,\" he said in testimony to a parliamentary committee Feb 13. \"An economy of that size growing at 7 per cent is still quite an impressive performance if they can do that.\" China's leadership is forecast to adopt a growth target of about 7 per cent at a gathering of the nation's leadership in Beijing next month, down from about 7.5 per cent last year.\n\n\"It is important not to get too bearish on commodity exporters,\" said Stephen Jen, co-founder of SLJ Macro Partners LLP in London. While he said it's possible that China's expansion slows to below 6 per cent in the next five years, it will continue to spur growth Down Under. \"In absolute terms, China's incremental growth even at a slower pace could be material for countries like Australia.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

TV manufacturing, which Sony split into a new business last year to boost autonomy and end losses, needs to be profitable to stay part of the company, he said.\n\nMr Hirai is targeting Sony's highest earnings in 20 years with an emphasis on games, image sensors and entertainment to underpin a turnaround. That strategy is being bolstered by a restructuring push under Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida as the company focuses on transparency for business units and profitability instead of volume growth.\n\n\"Splitting off units doesn't mean selling them or withdrawing from a business,\" Mr Hirai said. \"The goal is to increase the independence of each unit.\" Sony is on track to transform into a company that can generate 400 billion yen (US$3.4 billion) of operating profit in the 12 months starting April, Mr Hirai said, reiterating earlier comments. Earnings are expected to be 384 billion yen next fiscal year, according to the average of 20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"Not only is it possible, we stick with our 500 billion yen profit target next fiscal year,\" said Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore. \"Their mid-term plans look very modest.\" Sony said last week earnings would reach 500 billion yen in the year ending March 2018. That's the highest since 520 billion yen in 1998, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and about 25 times the 20 billion yen Sony is projecting for this year.\n\nShares of Sony rose 0.1 per cent to 3,280 yen in Tokyo on Wednesday. The stock has surged 86 per cent in the past 12 months.\n\nMr Yoshida's restructuring efforts are restoring credibility at the company, which he estimates has lowered its earnings outlook 15 times in the past seven years. The CFO will add the role of executive deputy president from April.\n\nSony last week said return-on-equity would become its primary performance indicator. The company is targeting the measure of earnings compared with shareholder equity to exceed 10 per cent for fiscal 2017, a return it hasn't achieved since posting 10.8 per cent in the 12 months ended March 2008'.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

This despite a net addition of 8,600 subscribers over the quarter and lower average monthly churn of 0.8 per cent due to the firm's retention programmes and promotional service bundles.\n\n\"The important thing is that the broadband subscriber base is growing and the churn rate is low which means we are keeping our customers. We saw healthy growth in our customer base across all lines of business even though competition was intense,\" said StarHub chief executive Tan Tong Hai at the results briefing.\n\nWhile the broadband business remains a bane, Mr Tan said there could be growth in this space in the second half. Meanwhile, the other segments - chiefly mobile and fixed network services - appear promising.\n\nMobile services - representing half of total service revenue for the quarter - grew nearly 3 per cent to S$321 million, buoyed by higher revenue from the post-paid services which mitigated the weaker showing in the pre-paid services realm. The decline in the pre-paid market was led by a law introduced last year that restricted consumers to only three pre-paid phone SIM cards at a time from 10 previously.\n\nStarHub gained 65,000 post-paid customers over the quarter from a year ago, bumping up its base to 1.277 million, but lost its grip on 269,000 pre-paid users, lowering its base to 871,000. The overall mobile customer base stood at 2.15 million, lower than 2.35 million a year ago.\n\nRevenue from fixed network services rose 3.7 per cent to S$100.9 million due to increased enterprise solution and take up of StarHub's data and Internet services, offset by lower voice services revenue.\n\nPay TV service revenue grew a marginal 0.2 per cent to S$100.1 million, mainly due to a larger subscriber base which clicked higher by 9,000 over the period to 542,000 households with a low and unchanged average monthly churn rate of 0.8 per cent.\n\nStarHub's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 10 per cent for the quarter to S$192.4 million while Ebitda margin as a percentage of service revenue came in at 33.8 per cent, up from 30.9 per cent a year ago and once again outperforming management's low-balled 32 per cent guidance.\n\nEarnings per share stood at 5.5 Singapore cents, up from five cents. The firm proposed a final dividend of five Singapore cents, unchanged from a year ago.\n\nStarHub shares advanced five Singapore cents, or 1.1 per cent, to S$4.41.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Top lawmakers have said the Fed has too much regulatory authority and not enough accountability in its handling of US monetary policy.\n\nThe House has passed a series of bills aimed at the Fed, but none gained traction in the Senate while under Democratic control.\n\nThat political pressure is expected to increase, with congressional efforts to fully audit the Fed coinciding with the central bank's complicated task of raising interest rates and selling down its US$4.5 trillion balance sheet.\n\nMs Yellen's demeanor on Wednesday contrasted with that of her predecessor, Ben Bernanke. While both are reserved academics, Ms Yellen showed more tenacity when facing lawmakers' pointed questions than Bernanke in his early years as Fed chief.\n\nYellen did not hide her annoyance at committee members who questioned the central bank's intentions.\n\nThe most heated exchange took place when Representative Mick Mulvaney, a South Carolina Republican, told Ms Yellen the Fed was \"sticking its nose\" where it didn't belong by trying to address issues such as long-term unemployment and income inequality. \"I've also talked about long-run deficit problems and budget problems in this country, and they're your responsibility, not mine,\" Ms Yellen replied.\n\nSeveral Republicans on the committee pressed Ms Yellen on her meetings with the White House and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and tried to corner the Fed chief into admitting an allegiance to Democratic Party principles. Ms Yellen was an economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and was appointed by President Barack Obama, both Democrats.\n\nHouse Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey pointed out that Ms Yellen had met with liberal-leaning groups, and that her schedule showed she had met with more Democrats than Republicans. \"We meet with a wide range of groups,\" Ms Yellen fired back. \"I think it is a complete mischaracterisation of our meeting schedules.\" Ms Yellen had a far less tense exchange with lawmakers when she testified on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nSeveral House lawmakers referred to a speech on income inequality that she gave in Boston last year, saying it was a sign of her support of Democratic and Obama administration agendas ahead of the presidential election last November. \"I believe that it (income inequality) is a problem that everyone in this room should be concerned about,\" Ms Yellen replied. \"I am not making political statements. I am discussing a significant problem that faces America ... I didn't offer any policy recommendations whatsoever in that speech.\" Some lawmakers took issue with the number of meetings Ms Yellen has had with Mr Lew, and asked that she make the transcripts of those conversations public. Yellen said she would not do so, just as she would not do so if she met with a lawmaker. \"The Federal Reserve is independent. I do not discuss monetary policy or actions that we are going to take with the (treasury) secretary or with the executive branch. We confer about the economy and the financial system on a regular basis,\" Ms Yellen said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c6b5c999f070551433889e421e62bcdff5ebad4fe801b86782ad89688135c7c4?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on Wednesday fended off a stream of aggressive questions from Republican lawmakers who accused the central bank of making Democratic political causes a higher priority than its stewardship of the US economy."}]}

But hours later, without giving any explanation, the bank did a sudden U-turn.\n\nThe earlier move had halted all trading between banks on behalf of their clients, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of official transactions in a market with turnover of hundreds of millions of dollars a day.\n\nIt also put the currency's true value in limbo throughout the day, with little or no trading taking place to set a price, before the bank jumped in to buy dollars before markets closed.\n\nA separatist war in the east of the country has made it difficult to stabilise an economy on the verge of bankruptcy, and the hryvnia currency has already lost more than half its value so far this year after halving during all of 2014.\n\nClearly concerned about the situation, the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday said it was ready to help Ukraine with its foreign currency issues. \"IMF staff are in close contact with the National Bank of Ukraine and stand ready to assist in designing measures that will address excessive and temporary imbalances in the supply and demand for foreign exchange,\" an IMF spokeswoman said in a statement released in Washington.\n\nWith only the bank buying dollars on Wednesday, the official exchange rate rose. But traders warned that demand for dollars had simply been pushed back, warning that this could drive the currency even lower once restrictions were removed.\n\nAt the market close, the central bank announced it had bought US$80 million at an official rate of 28.046 to the dollar, close to the rate at the start of the week and 12.8 per cent higher than the close after a plunge on Tuesday.\n\nEarlier in the day it had offered to buy dollars at a rate that would have implied a hike of nearly a third in the hryvnia's value. It gave no explanation for the discrepancy.\n\nPrime Minister Yatseniuk told a televised cabinet meeting that the ban was bad for the economy and criticised the bank for imposing it without consulting his government. He had found out about it in the morning from the Internet, he said.\n\nAfter an emergency meeting convened by President Petro Poroshenko, the government then signalled support of a kind for the bank, with Finance Minister Natalia Yaresko joining bank chief Valeria Gontareva at a hastily-arranged news conference.\n\nThey said little about the ban, but both said the recent plunge in the currency was unfounded, predicting that Kiev's finances would stabilise within weeks when they expected to start receiving funds from an IMF bailout. \"There are no fundamental reasons for such a severe fall in the hryvnia rate. The central bank sees none, the government sees none, and the IMF sees none,\" Gontareva said. \"As soon as we start getting real help from our international sponsors ... we are looking into the future with perfect calm.\" Exporters in Ukraine are required to sell 75 per cent of their hard currency income, helping to ensure there would be some supply when the central bank offered to buy dollars on Wednesday.\n\nBut traders said the restrictions would store up demand that would overwhelm the hryvnia once it was unleashed. \"So, they have halted trade until the end of the week. What happens then? Will the situation really improve? Where is the demand for currency going to go?\" said a currency trader at one bank, speaking on condition of anonymity required by the employer and before the ban was unexpectedly lifted. \"On the contrary, it will just build up and will speed up the fall of the hryvnia next week.\" There were hopeful signs from the eastern front on Wednesday, however, with the army reporting its first day without combat fatalities since long before a ceasefire deal was due to take effect on Feb 15. Pro-Russian separatists who initially ignored the ceasefire to advance last week were now pulling heavy guns from the front, as required under the truce.\n\nExchange kiosks in Kiev, permitted to buy up to 3,000 hryvnias from members of the public, were offering dollars for 39 hryvnias, around 20 per cent worse than rates advertised in the windows of commercial banks where dollars were simply unavailable.\n\nA construction worker exchanging dollars at a kiosk in a grocery shop in return for a bag filled with thousands of hryvnia, laughed and told shoppers: \"Soon we will have to walk around with suitcases for cash, like in the 1990s.\" There were no queues. A cashier at one central Kiev exchange booth said people were buying and selling only small amounts \"when they really need to\" because of the very high rates.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/e30a3f587478d7508114b7a11f319bee0f5a24c6d7c890edbdcae42ef5495339?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "People walk past a board showing currency exchange rates in central Kiev on Feb 25, 2015.

IE Singapore will fund up to 70 per cent of the professional fees required to engage overseas consultants, for a three-year duration.\n\nThese nine companies fall under three groups - building materials group whose target market is the Philippines; the home living group which intends to enter Europe; and the office sector group which aims to enter Australia.\n\nTo ensure sustainability of the three-year programme, SFIC has also established a framework to review programme progress and to measure customer satisfaction on the services rendered by the overseas in-market consultants, on a quarterly basis.\n\nErnie Koh, president of SFIC, said: \"In order for the Singapore furniture industry to deepen its footprint on the global map, local enterprises must adjust their mindset and reinvent their business models, by taking the 3i Approach - Improve, Innovate, and Integrate.\n\n\"Such business transitions are never easy and we are very encouraged by our local players' willingness to step out of their comfort zone and to embark on this exciting initiative with us.\"\n\nLast year, IE Singapore supported five trade shows and business missions led by SFIC under the International Marketing Activities Programme which defrays some of these costs while facilitating establishment of trade contacts in key markets such as Germany, China and the USA.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In this year's Budget announcement, the government pressed on with a consistent purpose: the economic transformation that Singapore embarked on several years ago must continue relentlessly so as to future-proof the country for a better tomorrow.\n\nTo secure a distinctive place in the global economy means we must deepen our skills and capabilities, make innovation pervasive, and strengthen the economic and social infrastructure of the country.\n\nIt has not been easy - and it will not be. Singapore's quest for productivity growth, underpinned by many broadbased measures in recent years, has not yielded significant results overall. This signals that measures with good intent and purpose must be changed if they do not deliver the desired outcome. This Budget seeks to do just that: the schemes (both existing and new ones) are more targeted, and there is a conscious effort to make them more accessible.\n\nThe small and medium-size enterprise (SME) sector - which contributes more than 50 per cent of economic output and 70 per cent of employment - is the backbone of Singapore's economy. Growing the nation will necessarily mean giving homegrown enterprises a lift. It is not surprising that SMEs are one of the main beneficiaries of this Budget.\n\nFor one, the Capability Development Grant scheme will be extended; more importantly, the scheme will be made more accessible with a simplified application process. Other funding schemes such as the venture debt risk-sharing programme have been introduced to further reduce the funding gaps for innovative startups. With the strong funding support now available to SMEs, it is time for our local players to think and act bigger and bolder.\n\nThis also means that SMEs should have the courage and appetite for scaling up and move beyond the comfort of our shores. Additional support from International Enterprise (IE) Singapore through its grant schemes and Double Tax Deduction for Internationalisation scheme will help to this end.\n\nThe usual lament by homegrown enterprises is that our tax incentive programmes often lean towards benefiting the MNCs. The introduction of a new International Growth Scheme is a welcome move to address this perceived gap. Homegrown enterprises can now expand overseas and enjoy a 10 per cent concessionary tax rate on their incremental income from qualifying activities, while retaining key business activities and headquarter functions in Singapore.\n\nStrengthening homegrown enterprises must go hand in glove with the upskilling of our population. The SkillsFuture initiative is innovative. SkillsFuture empowers every Singaporean to take charge of his career and lifelong learning.\n\nIt is hoped that trade organisations and industry bodies will make use of the SkillsFuture Credit to offer targeted training to meet the needs of the business sector.\n\nA FAIR AND JUST SOCIETY\n\nThis year, the Silver Support Scheme, which complements the existing Workfare, has been introduced to provide an income supplement for the bottom 20-30 per cent of senior Singaporeans during their retirement.\n\nIs Singapore leaning towards becoming a welfare state? Clearly, it's about striking a fair balance and, in my mind, this social security support is crucial to ensuring social cohesiveness. Fortunately, the foundation for our social security network remains that of family and community support. Hopefully, with higher incomes coming from continuing education and training, and greater retirement savings through our enhanced CPF scheme, every Singaporean can be self-reliant in the future.\n\nWith increased social spending, the finance minister expects that Singapore will see a tighter budget position in the coming years. For now, the government is tapping past budget surpluses and the \"redefined\" net investment income, and raising petrol duties.\n\nWhat has perhaps come as a surprise is the increase in the top marginal personal income tax rate from 20 per cent to 22 per cent, plus the tweaking of the tax rate structure that affects the top 5 per cent of our income earners, to strengthen Singapore's revenue position. While it cannot be said that this action was unexpected, this early announcement certainly demonstrates our government's confidence that this measure will not significantly dent Singapore's competitiveness.\n\nThe minister has indicated that the revenue measures that have been put in place will be sufficient for the increased planning needs until the end of the decade. So perhaps we won't see a GST rate increase until the end of 2020?\n\nThis is one of the most holistic and comprehensive budgets we have had. It has touched on every aspect of life that matters - from support for lifelong learning to sharper initiatives to help companies to continue to raise productivity, innovate and internationalise. It is laudable that there has been a shift in policymaking towards a more pointed and targeted approach, and simplifying our tax regime and making schemes more SME-friendly.\n\nThis Budget steers Singapore in the right direction. In celebrating Singapore's Jubilee this year, let's continue to act, believe in and plan to achieve the \"Singapore Dream\".\n\nHappy 50th birthday, Singapore!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bank, 79 per cent owned by the government, is under pressure from lawmakers to do more to support the domestic economy.\n\nChief executive Ross McEwan said last year that he wanted to increase the proportion of assets that RBS holds in Britain to 80 per cent of its global business from 60 per cent at present.\n\nMr Cullinan was appointed to run RBS's 'bad bank' in December 2013. He is on track to sell or wind down the majority of the \u00a338 billion (S$79.8 billion) of unwanted assets placed within it by the end of 2015, a year ahead of schedule, and his success in that role has persuaded Mr McEwan to enlarge his remit, the sources said.\n\n\"He's been phenomenal,\" said Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua. \"Given his experience and what he's delivered, I would not be surprised at all that Ross gives him something more. What is next in line in terms of cutting is the investment bank.\"\n\nThe bank hopes that slimming down and simplifying its business will enable it to bolster its capital and generate better returns, making it more attractive to investors and easier for the government to return it to private ownership.\n\nRBS's investment bank was built into one of the biggest in the world by former chief executive Fred Goodwin in the years before the financial crisis, and it grew further by the takeover of ABN Amro in 2007.\n\nIts investment bank had more than 20,000 staff and risk-weighted assets of \u00a3278 billion at the end of 2008, almost half of RBS's massive balance sheet that it has dramatically shrunk in the last six years.\n\nRBS is expected to announce that it will significantly scale back its operations in Asia leaving about 200 staff in the region, down from 2,800 at the end of last year, when it unveils full-year figures on Thursday, the sources said.\n\nThe move will mark the latest step in RBS's sharp retreat from both Asia and investment banking in the past six years following its \u00a345.5 billion bailout during the financial crisis. The bank had more than 12,000 staff in Asia at its peak, which included retail businesses that used to be part of ABN and were mostly sold in 2009.\n\nMr Cullinan will also take responsibility for managing RBS's exit from several European markets, the sources said. RBS has been in Asia Pacific since the 1820s and currently has offices in 10 countries in the region. Singapore is one of its global operational hubs. The bank currently supports clients based in Asia Pacific and execution services in Asian markets for US and European clients. REUTERS\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The team's major achievement, said the statement, had been to allow neuronal signals to stimulate the robot hand equipped with sensors that respond to electrical impulses in the muscles. \"Existing surgical techniques for such injuries are crude and ineffective and result in poor hand function,\" said Dr Aszmann. For their method, the team grafted muscle tissue taken from the thigh to the patients' forearms, and added nerves taken from elsewhere.\n\nBefore having their useless hands selectively amputated, the patients underwent nine months of training to activate the grafted muscle, and then learned to use the electrical signals to control a virtual hand. Once they mastered that, they practised with a prosthetic hand attached with a splint to their non-functioning hand.\n\nThe prosthesis costs about 15,000 euros (S$23,136) and the surgery and rehabilitation about the same, said Dr Aszmann. \"Some patients, in the end, will not be candidates for bionic reconstruction, either because there are not sufficient nerves available for reconstruction or they are psychologically not fit for that, or the environment is just not OK,\" he said.\n\nThe technique has since been successfully used in at least one person born without the use of a hand.

Several Gulf nations have a long history of pearl diving, and Qatar is building an artificial island off its coast named after the precious treasure.\n\nThe egg is the first of its kind commissioned since World War I. Faberge's last Imperial creation - the Steel Military Egg - was commissioned in 1916 by the Tsar just months before he was removed from power by the Russian Revolution and forced to abdicate in February 1917.\n\nNicholas II had arranged the egg as a present for his wife, Alexandra. The tradition of giving decorative eggs was started by his father, Tsar Alexander III, who surprised his wife Empress Maria with a bejewelled Easter egg in 1885. But as much as they were loved by the Russian royalty, the diamond-encrusted objets d'art have come to symbolise the family's excesses.\n\nThe new egg has been crafted \"to mark the upcoming (100th) anniversary since the last Imperial egg was commissioned\", Faberge spokeswoman Alize Morand said. She said the egg would be the first of several that will soon be unveiled by Faberge.\n\nAfter going on show for the first time, the egg will be sold at the end of the five-day exhibition in Qatar and there are already buyers interested in the piece. One estimate put the value of the new egg at US$2 million.\n\nBut Ms Morand would not confirm that and said the price could only be known \"on application\" for interested buyers. She added that several people had already expressed their desire to buy the piece.\n\nThe egg has been commissioned in association with the Gulf-based Al Fardan jewellery group, which is renowned for its pearls. The US$2 million price tag may end up being a conservative estimate. The last officially known price for an egg was US$18.5 million, which was sold at Christie's in London in 2007.

The EU would be wise to unravel the currency union and throw a lifeline to its distressed economies.\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Feb 25, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nTHE first sentence of the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the founding document of what would eventually become the European Union (EU), calls for \"an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe\". Recently, however, that ideal has come under threat, undermined by its own political elite, which adopted a common currency while entirely neglecting the underlying fault lines.\n\nToday, those cracks have been exposed - and widened - by the long drawn-out Greek crisis. And nowhere are they more evident than in Greece's relationship with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nWhen the euro crisis erupted in 2010, European officials realised that they lacked the necessary expertise to manage the threat of sovereign defaults and the potential breakup of the monetary union. For EU officials, avoiding the eurozone's collapse became the top political imperative, so they turned to the IMF for help. The irregularities in the Fund's resulting intervention attest to how serious the eurozone's problems were - and continue to be.\n\nFor starters, the IMF's Articles of Agreement require it to interact only with entities that are fully accountable for the help received - a member country's \"treasury, central bank, stabilisation fund, or other similar fiscal agency\". But the institutions with which the IMF is dealing in the eurozone are no longer responsible for their country's macroeconomic management; that power lies with the European Central Bank. In lending to Greece, it is as if the Fund had lent to a sub-national unit, such as a provincial or city government, without insisting on repayment guarantees from the national authorities.\n\nAnother problem is the sheer magnitude of the Fund's intervention. The size of the Greek debt necessitated lending on a scale far exceeding what other countries could expect. The \"exceptional access\" to IMF resources granted to Greece in 2010 was set at a \"cumulative limit of 600 per cent\" of the country's IMF quota, a measure of a country's financial commitment to the IMF. Instead, in April 2013, cumulative financing was programmed to peak at 3,212 per cent of Greece's quota.\n\nThe reason the IMF had to take on such huge exposure was Europe's initial refusal to contemplate debt reduction for Greece, owing to the authorities' fear that financial contagion would overwhelm the eurozone's firewall-free banking system. That decision resulted in uncertainty about the currency union's capacity to resolve the crisis and aggravated the contraction in Greek output. When a debt-restructuring agreement was finally reached in 2012, it provided a window for private creditors to reduce exposure by offloading their residual claims onto taxpayers.\n\nInitially, the IMF took the official position that Greek debt was sustainable. But IMF staff knew otherwise. In 2013, the Fund admitted that its analysts knew that Greece's debt was not sustainable, but decided to go ahead with the programme \"because of the fear that spillovers from Greece would threaten the euro area and the global economy\".\n\nIn addition, from November 2010 to April 2013, the IMF revised downward its forecast for 2014 Greek nominal gross domestic product by 27 per cent. This cast doubt on the transparency and accountability of the Fund's debt-sustainability projections. The implication is shocking: the IMF was unable to provide a credible framework for the adjustment that Greece would have to make.\n\nThis background provides crucial context for the ongoing negotiations, for it reveals that the aim of the Greek bailout was not to restore prosperity to the country's people, but to save the eurozone.\n\nGiven this, the new Greek government is entirely justified in questioning the terms that the country was given. The agreements previous administrations made will certainly reduce the range of policies available to the new government, especially with respect to debt reduction, which would require a unilateral default and withdrawal from the eurozone.\n\nBut a democratically elected government need not be bound by its predecessors' commitments, and this is doubly true in the wake of an election that was a referendum on those very policies.\n\nUltimatums from unelected institutions that have compromised their own legitimacy have inflamed anti-EU sentiment across the continent. The single worst outcome of the current negotiations would be Greece's submission to its creditors' demands, with few concessions in return. Such a result would fuel greater public support for anti-EU parties and movements elsewhere, and would amount to a missed opportunity for Greece and Europe.\n\nThat opportunity is default and exit from the eurozone, which would allow Greece to begin correcting past mistakes and putting its economy on the path to recovery and sustainable growth.\n\nAt that point, the EU would be wise to follow suit, by unravelling the currency union and providing debt reduction for its most distressed economies. Only then can the EU's founding ideals be realised. PROJECT SYNDICATE\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Thus, FY14 revenue grew just one per cent to S$2,862.5 million, about 5 per cent below our forecast, while reported net profit after tax (Npat) slipped 12 per cent to S$517.3 million, or nearly 10 per cent below our estimate.\n\nGoing forward, Genting Singapore expects its VIP business to remain weak, with potential for more bad debt provisions in the near term; but will focus more on the mass premium market to help make up the numbers. A potential boost could come in June 2015 with the opening of its 550-room hotel in Jurong; this could bring an additional 1,500 daily visitors to its integrated resort this year. Nevertheless, we opt to pare our FY15 estimates for revenue by 12 per cent and Npat by 23 per cent, preferring to err on the side of caution. Having said that, our discounted cash flow-based fair value improves slightly from S$1.01 to S$1.03 as we include some contribution from its Jeju integrated resort from FY17 onwards.\n\nBumitama Agri | Buy\n\nFeb 25 close: S$1.02\n\nTarget price: S$1.48\n\nDMG & Partners Research, Feb 24\n\nFY14 core earnings were in line with our expectations, making it the first in a season littered with disappointments. We make no changes to our earnings forecast and S$1.48 target price, and maintain Bumitama as our sector top pick. Production growth was the strongest in our universe and beat our expectations despite drought concerns. Its improving age profile should continue to drive strong earnings delivery.\n\nBumitama's 2014 nucleus production growth of 26.7 per cent was easily the strongest in our universe, although its trees are not the youngest. The company's numbers were also stronger than its Central Kalimantan peers, which were mostly in their teens.\n\nWe expect Bumitama to continue delivering strong earnings numbers, driven by an improving age profile.\n\nCompiled by Chan Yi Wen\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

Many of our SMEs lack their own training capacity and are unable to plan for the future. To uplift the broad base of companies and to help Singaporeans develop their careers across our economy, we need\n\nnew forms of industry collaboration\n\n.\"\n\nThis training could take place in educational institutions, in Singapore's two life-long learning institutes, on industry campuses or at the workplace itself.\n\nThe sectoral manpower plans will be three-pronged: Firstly, these plans will factor in the outlook of the sectors, how they will develop in the coming years and the manpower and skills that will be required.\n\nNext, they will map out career-progression pathways that will indicate the competencies and skills needed for workers to progress through successive stages of their careers.\n\nFinally, the plans will spell out how companies can attract, retain and develop a deep pool of talent in their sector.\n\n\"This will ensure that Singaporeans, can, at different stages of their careers, pick up relevant skills that will enable them to advance to the next milestone of their career,\" said the SkillsFuture Secretariat, which noted that employers would find a more highly-skilled workforce a boon.\n\nGrahame Wright, a partner of human capital at Ernst & Young Solutions, said the move to identify specific needs of sectors that are struggling with manpower, as well as those with a strong growth potential, would enable the movement to focus on bringing value to both businesses and workers.\n\n\"The challenge facing industry and the training sector is to develop the necessary programmes and trainers that will bring the dream to life. SkillsFuture is a huge opportunity, but at the same time, an even larger responsibility,\" he said.\n\nOn a related note, SMEs here will soon be able to tap a pool of mentors - experienced professionals - to help them develop their workforce. The first sectors to benefit from this are retail, food, and logistics.\n\nFrom the third quarter of this year, Spring Singapore, the statutory board tasked to help local enterprises grow, will appoint partners such as trade associations and chambers of commerce to recruit and match these mentors to interested companies.\n\nThe pool of mentors, to be built up over the next two years, will hit about 200 in number; the plan is to have one mentor to every three firms.\n\nThe SkillsFuture Secretariat noted that although SMEs play a key role in developing the skills mastery of the workforce - given that they hire seven in 10 Singapore workers - they often face challenges developing internal training competence, given their small size.\n\nThe secretariat added: \"(The mentors) will help SMEs implement measures to deepen the skills of their workforce and help their supervisors and managers develop their coaching skills. Mentors will also provide feedback to the employer and trainee during the learning process.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFirms to get up to S$15k for hiring, training new ITE and poly grads\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That will give the institution scope to elaborate on the details of a 1.1 trillion-euro (S$1.69 billion) quantitative-easing programme designed to stave off deflation.\n\nMr Draghi, who will attend the European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday, is about to get data from Germany, Spain and Italy that will show a continued slump in consumer prices. The reports are a preamble to region-wide figures on Monday forecast to show prices falling at a near-record pace and new ECB projections due next week after a Governing Council meeting in Cyprus.\n\n\"Draghi is probably very relieved to avoid being forced to pull the trigger on Greece,\" said Teunis Brosens, senior economist at ING Groep in Amsterdam. \"He will now focus on QE, with inflation likely to remain negative at least until the summer.\"\n\nEconomists in Bloomberg's monthly poll forecast that euro- area consumer prices will fall 0.5 per cent this quarter and decline 0.1 per cent in 2015. The ECB will publish its new projections after its meeting on March 5. It forecast in December that inflation would average 0.7 per cent this year and 1.3 per cent in 2016.\n\nDirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman Sachs Group in Frankfurt, predicts Mr Draghi will announce a \"significant downward revision\" to the 2015 outlook for consumer prices, though growth projections may be raised.\n\nThe driving force behind weaker inflation and higher economic output is a slump in the cost of oil in the second half of 2014 that previous forecasts didn't incorporate in full.\n\nIn Germany, Europe's largest economy, consumer prices probably fell an annual 0.5 per cent in February, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists, matching the biggest fall in more than five years. Spanish prices plunged an annual 1.5 per cent, the same pace as in January, which was the most since Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1997. Italy's inflation rate was minus 0.3 this month, a separate survey showed. All data will be published on Friday.\n\nWith sovereign-bond purchases pledged to start early next month, Mr Draghi is under pressure to unveil details of the programme that go beyond its size and measures intended to ring-fence the risks, and the risk of unintended consequences.\n\n\"We had to give oxygen to the system,\" Governing Council member Luc Coene, the Belgian central-bank governor, said in an interview with De Telegraaf published on Tuesday. \"It remains to be seen what the impact will be, and we need to be careful to not create bubbles. We are aware of the risks.\"\n\nMr Draghi may also face inquiries about the state of Greek banks, which were cut off from regular ECB funding operations and moved onto emergency liquidity assistance after the newly elected government rejected the country's bailout package.\n\nEuro-area finance ministers approved an extension of the programme on Tuesday, paving the way for the ECB to resume direct support. Such a decision probably won't come before the March 5 meeting at the earliest.\n\nGreek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said in an interview with Real FM broadcast on Wednesday that the country will continue to cooperate with the ECB, the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission. His German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble told SWR2 radio that there are doubts in his country whether the Greek government's assurances can be trusted.\n\nMr Draghi has highlighted the fragility of the accord reached between Greece and its creditors in a letter to Eurogroup head Jeroen Dijsselbloem.\n\n\"The basis for concluding the current review, and also for any future arrangements, will be the existing commitments,\" he said.\n\nThose \"outlined by the authorities differ from existing programme commitments in a number of areas\" and will have to be evaluated to see if they're \"of equal or better quality\", he said.

The entire market recorded 240 gains versus 193 falls and volume was in line with recent averages at 1.38 billion units worth S$1.28 billion.\n\nWestern markets on Tuesday rose after Fed chief Janet Yellen said in her testimony to the US Senate Banking Committee that the central bank will consider interest rate policy from a meeting to meeting basis, referring to the six-weekly Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. Over in the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed at new all-time highs.\n\nGenting Singapore stood out with a S$0.065 or 6.2 per cent plunge to S$0.98 on volume of 130.3 million shares. It was the day's most active stock and the fall came after the casino operator reported a worse-than-expected set of Q4 figures due to a drop in China visitors and an unexpected fall in its win rate. Brokers responded with cautiously negative opinions - OCBC Investment Research said it is maintaining a \"hold\" on the stock with value emerging around S$0.95, whilst OSK DMG said it is \"neutral\" on Genting with a reduced target price of S$1.06 from S$1.14.\n\nIn contrast, wire agency Dow Jones reported that Goldman Sachs maintained its \"buy\" on Genting, albeit with a 12-month target price reduced from S$1.48 to S$1.42.\n\nElsewhere, shares of the Singapore Exchange (SGX) ended S$0.02 weaker at S$8.20 with 2.2 million shares done. The company on Tuesday said that its CEO, Magnus Bocker, has notified that he is not seeking an extension of his contract, which runs out on June 30.\n\nDeutsche Bank in its \"buy\" on SGX referred to the news of Mr Bocker's impending departure. It said that in the short term it does not expect a change in SGX's strategy of reviving and strengthening the security market infrastructure through reforms announced in June 2014.\n\n\"We also believe the new CEO will continue to build on SGX's strength as an Asian derivative house, as championed by Magnus during his time at SGX...We value SGX on a 10-year three-stage DDM (dividend discount model). On our unchanged estimates, SGX is trading at 25.7x FY15E P/E or 5 per cent discount to Asia-Pac exchanges, while offering an above-peer ROE of 37 per cent. Buy with a target price of S$8.70.\"\n\nIn the commodities segment, Noble Group's shares were unchanged at S$1.06 with 29.6 million shares traded ahead of its results announcement on Thursday. Morgan Stanley in its results preview said the consensus is expecting Noble to report US$465 million net profit before extraordinary items and that investors will be looking to management for insight on future capital allocations from its strengthened balance sheet.

Why the World is About to Get a Whole Lot Smaller forecast a sea change in the global economy, all driven by unsustainably high oil prices, where domestic manufacturing is reinvigorated at the expense of seaborne trade and people's choices become driven by the ever-increasing prices of fossil fuels.\n\nIn the book, Mr Rubin dedicates an entire chapter to the changing oil supply picture, with his main argument being that oil companies \"have their hands between the cushions\" looking for new oil, since all the easily recoverable oil is either gone or continues to be depleted - at the rate of around 6.7 per cent a year (IEA figures). \"Even if the depletion rate stops rising, we must find nearly 20 million barrels a day of new production over the next five years simply to keep global production at its current level,\" Mr Rubin wrote, adding that the new oil will match the same level of consumption in 2015 as five years earlier in 2010.

Of this, the cost of reaching the 10 per cent goal is roughly 40 billion, the Commission said, meaning it would be swiftly offset by the savings it foresees.\n\nThe Commission said 12 member states do not have enough connection to the rest of the EU electricity market: Britain, Cyprus, Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain.\n\nIt proposes to change that through a list of priority projects that will be entitled to faster planning procedures and some EU money that the Commission hopes will leverage much greater private investment.\n\nCritics of the European Commission's energy union plans include eurosceptics who say that the EU executive is trying to wrest control over energy decisions from member states.\n\nGreen members of the European Parliament are also critical, saying the Commission is seeking to invest too much in new pipelines to diversify gas providers when wind and solar were the obvious way to increase security of supply.\n\nLuxembourg Green politician Claude Turmes said the Commission was stimulating massive new investment in gas infrastructure instead of truly \"questioning Europe's insane fossil fuel import dependency\".

It combines FireEye's cyber security expertise - especially in the area known as APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) - with Singtel's info-communications capabilities and extensive regional data and telecom infrastructure.\n\nSpeaking to The Business Times, Bill Chang, Singtel's CEO of Group Enterprise, said the ASOC provides organisations with the latest technology, expertise and intelligence to enhance their security protection against the rapidly growing threat of advanced attacks in the Asia Pacific region. APT refers to a sophisticated form of cyber attack in which a set of stealthy and continuous computer hacking processes target a specific network over a prolonged period of time.\n\nThe ASOC is the first facility of its kind to be integrated into Singtel's existing network operations centre. This gives cyber security experts end-to-end visibility of Internet traffic, corporate networks and user end-points, for a swift response to security incidents.\n\nThe ASOC has 50 security professionals locally and access to a global network of FireEye SOCs (security operations centres) and security experts trained in handling sophisticated cyber threats and forensics. Singtel-FireEye customers will have access to experts who provide \"follow-the-sun\" capability 24/7 to detect, protect against and respond to cyber threats. The ASOC is FireEye's first such centre in Asia.\n\nMr Chang noted that Singtel has been involved in cyber security for a number of years and has several partnerships in this area. \"We are always on the lookout for partners since we are the leading telco in the region and we look to work with the best.\"\n\nOne such partnership is with Akamai to prevent what is known as DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks that were very prevalent a couple of years ago and are still a major cyber threat. In this type of cyber attack, a website or network is targeted simultaneously by thousands of hijacked computers from around the world, in order to overwhelm the network's security and bring it down.\n\nMr Chang noted that cyber security is one of the fastest growing businesses for the telco and \"will soon start to make a material contribution\" to Singtel's bottom line.\n\n\"Our vision is to be the top cyber security player in the Asia Pacific region within three years and one of the top global players within five years,\" Mr Chang said.\n\nHe added that the ASOC will be a cornerstone of Singtel's cyber security capabilities. \"Through our partnership with FireEye, Singtel will be able to provide the best-of-breed cyber security solutions and services for enterprises to better deal with these fast-evolving cyber threats.\"\n\nDavid DeWalt, FireEye CEO and board chairman, said: \"We are witnessing a new cyber arms race with nation-states and sophisticated criminal organisations operating with anonymity to breach almost any network at will. The economic growth and geographic proximity of Southeast Asia has made it one of the most active regions in the world for advanced cyber attacks.\n\n\"Together with Singtel, we can give our customers more visibility into these attacks and help keep their networks secure with what we believe are the best tools and expertise available.\"\n\nMr DeWalt added that Singapore has a strategic location for a number of reasons. \"When you look at the countries around the world, somebody has to step up and lead as a safe haven for cyber domains. The USA has its issues, as does China and Russia.\n\n\"If you look at the next decade, who is going to be the epicentre of cyber space? It's Singapore in a lot of ways . . . If you look at the defence architecture of the country, people will want to put in investment here, and this can make Singapore the cyber epicentre of the world.\"\n\nThe Singtel-FireEye collaboration fits into the government's plan to set up an apex cyber security body, called the Cyber Security Agency (CSA), which will become operational from April 1.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of the ASOC on Wednesday, Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim noted that operation centres such as the Singtel-FireEye collaboration are a key part of the cyber security landscape. He added that Singtel and FireEye will work together with other stakeholders, like CSA, to boost Singapore's cyber security defence capabilities.\n\nMr Chang said Singtel \"stands ready to support CSA as a key part of the ecosystem and as a key stakeholder for the cyber security vision of the country and region\".\n\nAt the moment, Singtel is working out the protocols of engagement with CSA.\n\nThe Singtel official added that no single company can address the cyber security threat by itself. \"It's all about partnerships between technology players, service providers and the government.\"\n\nMr Chang added that Singtel was in talks with its regional partners, such as Airtel in India and Telkomsel in Indonesia, who have shown a keen interest in an ASOC type of set-up in their countries. \"We are having talks within the group regarding this. The idea is to do things in a cost-effective manner and tailor the services to market needs. We are looking at a hub- and-spoke kind of model, whereby mini-ASOC type of set-ups in the respective countries can hook into the main ASOC in Singapore.\"\n\nAlong with the ASOC in Singapore, Singtel and FireEye have set up a similar centre in Australia. It is likely to be officially inaugurated next week.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The FDA said last week that from 2013 to 2014 it received 75 reports, involving 135 patients, of possible contamination from reused duodenoscopes.\n\nDr Maisel said that if a new cleaning method is established, the agency would expect companies to reflect that in their labels. One possible protocol is being developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is close to being finalised, the CDC scientist leading the effort said on Friday.\n\nPentax Medical said it is talking to the FDA about updating its cleaning and sterilising instructions, known as reprocessing. Fujifilm said it recommends strict adherence to the company's reprocessing instructions but \"reserves the right\" to make new recommendations in the future \"whether as a result of new industry practices, FDA guidance, or Fujifilm-specific updates to best practices\". Olympus, whose devices were used in the UCLA outbreak, did not respond to questions about labelling changes.\n\nLabel changes, which can take months to complete, have been proposed in general terms before. But the latest outbreak has raised new issues that may require more specific measures to guard against infection from the flexible scopes, which are used to diagnose or treat disorders in about 500,000 procedures a year in the United States alone.\n\nThe FDA issued draft guidance on the labelling of reusable medical devices in May 2011, but such preliminary advice does not carry as much weight in the medical industry as its final guidance.\n\nAmong the draft recommendations: devices with \"features that make them difficult to clean will need to be disassembled in order to be completely cleaned\" and \"instructions/diagrams for adequate disassembly should be included in the cleaning instructions\". The draft guidance said labels should include \"any special warnings or precautions\" about the reprocessing procedure. The FDA plans to release final guidance this spring.\n\nLengthy delays between the issuance of draft and final guidance are not uncommon at the agency, and critics say the slow process is not helping the situation.\n\n\"The draft guidance would have made a difference if it had been finalised,\" said Mark Duro, director of sterile reprocessing operations at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston. \"This was asking the manufacturers to give us more information about how to reprocess the (duodenoscopes), and every bit of additional information would be better than we have now.\"\n\nThe 2011 draft guidance may also prove to be out of date as bacteria become more virulent and drug-resistant.\n\nThe FDA has known of infections linked to reusable devices since at least 2009. The draft guidance was issued partly in response to those concerns.\n\nBut the latest outbreak is novel in that the bacteria are surviving even when manufacturers' instructions are followed, Dr Maisel said. \"In 2009 we weren't aware of outbreaks of multi-drug resistant bacteria in these scopes happening when proper cleaning was followed,\" he said.\n\nWhatever the new labels say, some experts say they won't be enough to protect patients without additional safeguards. \"The devices need to be designed better, the instructions need to be more clear, the hospitals need better training, and adequate time needs to be given in hospitals to ensure sterility is top notch,\" said Mary Logan, chief executive of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, an alliance of healthcare providers which helps develop standards for use.\n\nAAMI will be issuing new guidelines on endoscope cleaning within the next two months.

In developing countries, the first 90 per cent of the construction is done quickly, the last 10 per cent takes almost as much time,\" he said.\n\nMany of the 200 young staff hired are Haitians who come from disadvantaged backgrounds or are bilingual Haitian-Americans.\n\nAddressing the new staff, Mr Clinton said: \"You have the chance to show the real Haiti to everyone coming to this hotel.

This condition remains in force even where a developer obtains URA approval to convert the entire development into serviced apartments.\"\n\nBT understands that a key motivation for developers seeking change is hope of exemption from the two-year sales deadline, without paying any penalty.\n\n\"Instead of paying extension charges, which are quite high,\" said a market watcher, \"these developers are probably hoping that if they were to turn their projects to serviced apartments, the QC condition could be lifted as they intend to operate the serviced residences.\n\n\"When the market recovers, these developers could potentially seek to convert the property back to a condo, obtain approval for strata subdivision and sell the condo units. Basically, their strategy is to convert the project to serviced apartments to ride out the market.\"\n\nA property consultant added: \"Basically, many of these projects are in the prime districts, and high-end prices have tanked, so these developers are not ready to accept fair value prices. They are looking for a way to buy time, hoping that the high-end market will recover or that the authorities will relax on QC conditions.\"\n\nUnder the Residential Property Act, a foreign company, defined as one that has even a single non-Singaporean shareholder and/or director, has to get a QC from SLA's Land Dealings (Approval) Unit before it may buy a private residential site. All listed property developers are deemed foreign companies.\n\nQC conditions require the developer to complete construction of the project and obtain TOP within the stipulated timeframe - since Aug 5, 2010, this has been set at five years, though prior to that, this could have stretched to seven years. The developer is also required to finish selling all units in the project within two years of the TOP date. The rules are aimed at preventing foreign developers from hoarding or speculating in residential land in Singapore.\n\nSince January 2011, a developer that wants extra time on either of these two deadlines has to pay extension charges - set at per annum rates of 8, 16 and 24 per cent of the site's purchase price for the first, second and third/subsequent years of extension, respectively. For the two-year deadline to finish selling the project, the extension charges are pro-rated based on the proportion of unsold units. The extension charges may be paid on a half-yearly basis.\n\nSites bought from the Government Land Sales Programme and on Sentosa Cove do not require QC.\n\nThe SLA spokesman said: \"In such a situation where the development is converted into serviced apartments, the developer would be required to sell the entire development as URA (Urban Redevelopment Authority) requires serviced apartments to be under one ownership and strata subdivision into individual units is not allowed.\n\n\"If it is unable to sell within the stipulated period, the developer can apply for an extension of time to sell and if approval is granted, an extension charge is payable by the developer.\"\n\nServiced apartments may be considered on land zoned for residential use in URA's Master Plan. This includes conversion of approved residential developments into serviced apartments.\n\n\"Serviced apartments may also be considered for the residential component of mixed-use sites,\" said a URA spokesman.\n\nShe said that the planning authority evaluates all serviced apartment proposals against a set of established guidelines. \"Generally, the proposed serviced apartments should not be located in the midst of established residential areas and should front major roads. The guidelines ensure that serviced apartment developments are compatible with the surrounding uses and minimise any potential nuisance or disturbance to surrounding users.\"\n\nSince strata division is not allowed in serviced apartments, developers who wish to restyle a condo into a serviced apartment development would need to make an application to the authorities to \"extinguish\" the strata titles in the project. Prior to that, the developer would have to buy back any units it had sold in the project.\n\nIf a developer wishes to turn, say, one block in a condo project comprising two or more blocks into serviced apartments, the authorities are likely to subject the application to detailed evaluation and may even impose additional criteria on the developer to ensure that the residents living in the strata-titled units in the other block or blocks are agreeable with the idea.\n\nThe topic of developers affected by QC conditions considering turning their housing projects to serviced residences has gained currency following City Developments executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng's comments last week on the Nouvel 18 condo that it developed jointly with Wing Tai. The project received TOP at the end of 2014. \"There are two blocks. I think . . . we still have two years to do something about it, but in the meantime, we hope to apply for a waiver for the Qualifying Certificate . . . there is also a possibility we may convert one block into serviced apartments. Don't forget Shangri-La, at the side, they also have very beautiful serviced apartments which are doing very well.\"\n\nBack in 2013, OUE is said to have enquired with the authorities about changing its Twin Peaks condo project in Leonie Hill Road into serviced residences but did not proceed as it found the conditions and regulations too impractical. The 462-unit project received TOP recently.\n\nWord on the street is that Bukit Sembawang too has considered converting its Paterson Collection project which it has yet to launch, into serviced apartments.\n\nProperty industry players told BT that it would not be easy to convert a completed condo project or even one under construction into serviced residences - as there may not be provision for back-of-house facilities such as for laundry services and storage of towels as well as a breakfast area, reception and concierge services.\n\n\"Also,\" said an observer, \"for serviced apartments, you need sprinklers within the units. Internal walkways in the development will also have to be sufficiently wide for service trolleys.\"\n\nBesides interior criteria, URA probably also factors in the external environment, including the width of surrounding roads to gauge if they can handle the additional traffic arising from the conversion to serviced residences, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's almost equal to the floor area of two Empire State Buildings and enough for tens of thousands of employees. A total of about 1.85 million sqm of office space is expected to be added between 2015 and 2017 in the Makati, Bonifacio Global City, Ortigas and Quezon City business districts in Metro Manila, according to Colliers.\n\nMore than half of the supply entering the market this year had been leased as of February, says Rick Santos, chairman of property services firm CBRE Philippines. Lower operating costs and an English-speaking workforce have lured firms such as Google, Accenture, Citigroup, JPMorgan and HSBC to relocate some of their business processes to the Philippines.\n\nThe demand for office space has boosted average lease rates in the capital by 8 per cent to 816 pesos (S$25) per sqm as of the end of 2014, compared with a 4 per cent gain in 2013, data from CBRE Philippines shows. Meanwhile, the vacancy rate in business hubs in Manila - the No.2 outsourcing destination after Bengaluru according to strategic advisory firm Tholons - fell to 4-5.5 per cent in 2010-2014 from 9 per cent in 2009.\n\nLocal property players Megaworld and Ayala Landare ramping up supply. \"We have close to 200 tenants in our portfolio, so we already know their growth requirements, and that prompts us to create the supply,\" Megaworld senior vice president Jericho Go said.

Listed in mid-July 2013 after raising nearly RM1 billion in its initial public offering, the airline has seen its shares founder. The stock is valued at 42-52 sen compared to its IPO price of RM1.25. A cash call has been made to raise US$109 million.\n\nAzran Osman-Rani, the previous chief executive, has been replaced by Benyamin Ismail, who was named acting CEO. He will be supported by AirAsia X group chief executive Kamaruddin Meranun, one of the founders.\n\nThe airline also suffered some reputational damage after an AirAsia Indonesia aircraft crashed into the Java Sea en-route from Surabaya to Singapore in December.\n\nTo turn around the business, management has indicated that it will focus on maximising revenue through higher base fare and ancillary income, cost reductions (headcount cuts and contract renegotiations) and capacity management (redeploying capacity).\n\nNon-performing routes such as Adelaide and Nagoya have already been trimmed and cuts in the working crew are set to come next.\n\nAnd despite planning to keep AirAsia and AirAsia X operations separate, RHB Investment Bank said, management has indicated that ground operations would be merged as it strives to achieve a 5-7 per cent improvement in unit costs (ex-fuel) in FY15.\n\nRHB analyst Ahmad Maghfur Usman said cost initiatives were crucial in getting to a breakeven load factor. He saw the moderation in the drop in yields as suggesting that it is approaching an upward inflection point in the coming quarter.\n\nAllianceDBS analyst Tan Kee Hoong is less optimistic. AirAsia X's Thai and Indonesian associates will be a drag on net profit, he said, while the restructuring of ailing Malaysia Airlines' longer-haul routes is likely to be effected only after the second quarter. (Fares are seen remaining tight until then).\n\nOn cheaper fuel, he expects a significant portion of savings to be passed on to consumers in a bid to attract more passengers. In any event, he pointed out, the strong US dollar would affect the carrier's bottom line as three-quarters of its cost base is in the currency.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it's playing a very different role on either side of the Atlantic.\n\nIn the US, a platform like Lending Club typically helps individuals fund pet projects or personal needs - lining up \"Rebecca, Durham NC\" with US$5,000 at 9.98 per cent interest to \"pay off credit cards\". In the UK, by contrast, websites like Funding Circle are providing funding for genuine businesses - \u00a340,000 (S$84,100) to \"Guy in Bradford\", say, to modernise his yarn business. These Web-based platforms could serve as a much-needed bridge between bank loans and capital markets.\n\nA report by Cambridge University's Judge Business School estimates that the European market for online alternative lending - encompassing everything from reward-based crowdfunding to business loans - has the potential to reach seven billion euros (S$10.8 billion) this year, a near sevenfold increase in just three years.\n\nWhat's most interesting is how peer-to-peer lending (or P2P, for short) is developing as a genuine source of business capital, not just a way for bands to record their next album or designers to try reinventing the cupboard. In the UK, Europe's biggest P2P market with more than \u00a32.1 billion of outstanding loans, two-thirds of lending goes to companies, one-third to individuals, according to the P2P Finance Association.\n\nThe Cambridge study, which surveyed 255 lending platforms covering more than 85 per cent of the total European market, estimates that non-UK lenders provided 385 million euros of early stage, growth and working capital to almost 10,000 European startups and SMEs (small and medium-size enterprises) over the past three years, with more than half of that cash provided in 2014. Moreover, business lending is by far the fastest-growing segment: Peer-to-peer business lending grew by 272 per cent between 2012 and 2014, reward-based crowdfunding grew by 127 per cent, equity-based crowdfunding grew by 116 per cent and peer-to-peer consumer lending grew by 113 per cent in the same period.\n\nI've written previously about the over-reliance of European SMEs on bank funding, which inhibits their access to investment capital at a time when bank balance sheets are constrained. The European Central Bank has explicitly acknowledged that its quantitative easing programme is designed to channel funds to SMEs. And earlier this month, European Union Commissioner Jonathan Hill revealed his proposals to create a unified Capital Markets Union to make it easier for smaller companies to use the equity and debt markets for funding.\n\nBut it might be easier to focus on expanding P2P. Moody's Investors Service says there are ways to turbocharge the market's growth. It notes that financial institutions, professional money managers and institutional investors, as well as individuals, are getting involved in P2P funding. In a report this week, Moody's suggests that securitisation - the process of bundling small loans into a single transaction to create a liquid, tradeable security of sufficient size to become a viable investment for fund managers - could accelerate an expansion. Almost US$1.2 billion of such US loans have already been corralled into rated securities, according to Moody's, the most recent being a US$327 million transaction issued earlier this month by US P2P lender Prosper Marketplace. The rating company sees securitisation as a propellant: Securitisation could drive more funds towards European P2P lending. By tapping investors in the rated securitisation market, P2P lenders could attract larger investment volumes or lower their funding costs and hence increase their scale and the amount of lending they provide. Investors looking for exposure to SMEs or consumers but are prohibited from investing directly in P2P loans would be able to invest indirectly through securitisation.\n\nBut European institutions could play a critical role, too. Suppose that the ECB allocated part of its asset-backed purchase programme explicitly to P2P securitisations. Existing platforms that seek to connect lenders and borrowers could repackage the loans into viable capital- markets instruments for purchase by pension funds and the like. The total volume of funds available for companies in the marketplace would increase.\n\nGranted, it will be critical to maintain safeguards to prevent lenders from getting fleeced. But provided that's the case, it seems like a combination of old-school financial engineering and new-fangled Internet connectivity could deliver a modern solution to the problem of financing small companies.

The company's emphasis on developing new products underpinned its purchase of Swiss drugmaker Nycomed: Having married Nycomed's broad commercial footprint in emerging markets with its own innovative pipeline, it now has a commercial presence in 37 emerging markets around the region.\n\nTakeda said its five emerging market areas will account for 70 per cent of the total projected pharmaceutical growth between 2013 and 2017.\n\n\"We are in the process of accelerating registration and launch of products in gastroenterology, diabetes and of course, in oncology,\" said Mr Platford.\n\nTakeda had led the Japanese charge for large deals in recent years, plonking down more than US$20 billion in two deals - Nycomed in 2011 and US biotech firm Millennium Pharmaceuticals in 2008.\n\nThe company's new Biopolis office spans almost 14,000 sq ft. It will raise its staff strength by about 50 per cent, bringing the total headcount to some 200.\n\nIts vaccine business unit based here hosts a new laboratory that is primarily used for analytics and product development against infectious diseases in the region, with dengue fever being a key focus. The vaccine targeting dengue fever will soon enter Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nMr Platford named emerging markets, gastroenterology and oncology as the company's three key areas of growth.\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration ceremony on Wednesday, Beh Swan Gin, chairman of the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), noted that Takeda's focus on product development for infectious diseases, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases was very much aligned with Singapore's research priorities.\n\nTakeda is among the eight of Japan's top 10 pharmaceutical companies which have set up their regional headquarters here, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be held on the March 27-29 weekend, the original dates of the Natas fair.\n\nNatas, representing some 340 travel agents, has held two fairs a year, in March and August, since 1987. Its event, to be held at the Singapore Expo, has since been moved to an earlier slot - the weekend of March 6-8.\n\nAdmission to both fairs will be free.\n\nAlicia Seah, spokesman for Travel Revolution 2015, said that advertising value exceeding a million dollars has been committed to publicise the event via both new and traditional platforms including online, social, mobile, print, radio, TV and out-of-home media.\n\n\"With our promise of revolutionary holidays with revolutionary savings and value, we are hopeful of achieving a total of 80,000 in visitors and S$100 million in sales turnover for the three-day event,\" she said.\n\nTravel Revolution 2015 - The Event will be open from 10am to 9pm.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She moved to the United States from India with her husband in 2011 when he was hired with an H-1B visa.\n\nMs Gupta has been unable to work in the United States. \"I miss my job, I miss my financial independence,\" she told reporters on a conference call organized by FWD.US, a tech industry immigration lobby group. \"I'm looking forward to getting back to what I love doing,\" she said.\n\nAustralia and Canada have made similar offers to spouses of temporary high-skilled workers in recent years, noted Lynden Melmed, former chief counsel at USCIS.\n\nThat put pressure on the US government to make the same accommodation, Mr Melmed said, noting the waiting period for green cards can be longer than 10 years in some cases. \"The inability to work for that period of time is potentially career-ending,\" said Mr Melmed, now a partner at immigration law firm Berry Appleman & Leiden.\n\nThe regulation change was one of a half-dozen tweaks that Mr Obama announced in November to address concerns by tech companies that have pushed to lift the cap on H-1B visas and speed up the process for green cards.\n\nThe USCIS is trying to move as quickly as possible on the other measures, Mr Rodriguez said, declining to offer a more specific timeline.

Even women approaching middle age are wary of retailers that are perceived as old, she said. \"Forty-year-old women are not dressing in the sort of frumpy way that their mothers dressed,\" said Ms Dunn, who is based in New York. \"There's a lot more interest in looking youthful. It's a lot harder for Ann Taylor and Chico's to compete.\"\n\nThe shift adds to the challenges facing potential acquirers of the businesses. Private-equity firms such as Sycamore Partners, which is said to be interested in Chico's, have a track record of snapping up retail brands, cutting costs and selling off underperforming businesses. But the task of coping with a cultural shift may be beyond their abilities, Ms Dunn said.\n\nAs workplace attire becomes more casual, women have less need to buy business suits - once a calling card for Ann Taylor. In an effort to adjust, Ann added the Loft chain in the 1990s to sell more laid-back looks. More recently, it has begun using its Lou & Grey nameplate to offer clothing with an athletic vibe. The company also brought in actress Kate Hudson as a brand ambassador.\n\nStill, Ann Taylor may have a hard time shaking its reputation as a dowdy brand, said Wendy Packer, who runs the website Fashion Over Fifty.\n\n\"They really have to reinvent themselves,\" she said. \"The societal norms are shifting - 50 isn't old anymore. Women are still wanting to look good, still wearing sexy clothes.\" Ann's same-store sales fell 4.3 per cent in its most recently reported quarter, compared with an increase of 3.7 per cent a year earlier.\n\nRetailers that cater to older professional women have been in the cross hairs of private equity for some time. Sycamore, a New York-based firm, bought Talbots Inc in 2012 and acquired the intellectual property of Coldwater Creek last year with plans to relaunch the brand. Both Chico's and Ann have been in discussions with private-equity buyers, according to people familiar with the talks. Neither company has announced a deal.\n\nChico's emerged as Sycamore's latest target earlier this month. On Feb 11, the retailer's stock jumped the most in eight months on speculation that an acquisition was close. The Fort Myers, Florida-based chain hasn't reached a final agreement yet and is still exploring other options, including cost cuts and a debt-funded share repurchase, a person familiar with the situation said at the time. Chico's has a market value of almost US$2.8 billion.\n\nAnn, meanwhile, has reached out to at least two potential buyout firms, according to people with knowledge of the process. The company, which said in October that it planned to review its strategic options, is working with JPMorgan Chase & Co, the people said.\n\nThe retailer entered into a confidentiality agreement last year with Golden Gate Capital, its biggest shareholder. The firm has said that it's consulting with Ann \"as a long-term public investor.\" Ann has been under pressure to explore a sale since last August, when Engine Capital and Red Alder said the retailer could garner as much as US$55 in a buyout. The company has a market value of about US$1.65 billion.\n\nCatherine Fisher, a spokeswoman for New York-based Ann, declined to comment, as did Lynn Willis, a representative for Chico's. A representative for Sycamore also declined to comment.\n\nIf a private-equity firm bought Ann or Chico's, it could invest in the pieces of the businesses with the most potential. For Ann, that may be the Lou & Grey line. Chico's has a number of brands besides its flagship chain, including White House Black Market, Soma Intimates and Boston Proper. The company may be more valuable in pieces than all together.\n\nThe broader apparel industry is struggling with the growth of fast-fashion chains like Hennes & Mauritz and Inditex SA's Zara, said Tiffany Hogan, an apparel analyst at industry consulting firm Kantar Retail in Columbus, Ohio. Such retailers offer rapidly changing styles at relatively low prices, and that appeals to women of all ages, she said.\n\n\"Fast fashion is disrupting apparel retail as we know it,\" Ms Hogan said. \"It does change the way everyone is thinking of shopping and fashion. H&M can bridge generations.\" E-commerce sites and social media also have made US women more fashion-conscious. With infinite choice online, shoppers are holding onto youthful styles for longer, said Talmage Advisors' Dunn.\n\nMs Dunn, 40, said she doesn't like to tell people that she shops at Ann stores. It isn't clear how new owners would change that reputation, she said.\n\n\"In terms of turning around brand perception, I'm not seeing any private-equity firms have success with that,\" Ms Dunn said. \"It takes a lot - brands are spending a lot on marketing and doing a lot on social media - and I'm not sure it's working.\" WP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But its business-friendly aspects should not be underrated.\n\nCompanies and businesses have much to cheer in this year's Budget, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The difference this time though is that the approach to economic restructuring has shifted slightly. Moving away from the carrot-and-stick approach of restricting the supply of foreign workers to companies while subsidising their adoption of labour-saving technology, the government has introduced productivity-inducing measures that are more targeted and which will hurt companies less, if at all. With the productivity drive not having achieved the level of gains that had been expected, Budget 2015 shifts the focus to three elements in particular: innovation, internationalisation, and skills upgrading.\n\nProvided companies make the effort, innovation and internationalisation will help them boost topline growth. In line with this, the demands of the new Singapore workforce will also change to cater to a business environment where companies are expected to be more innovative, technologically driven, outward-looking and operating higher up the value chain. The Budget is farsighted in seeking to fulfil the future needs of the workforce by focusing on skills upgrading. The SkillsFuture scheme is exactly what is called for; it is flexible and can be customised to individuals. SMEs, which may not have the resources to provide adequately for skills upgrading, will be the major beneficiaries of this. By thus making training a \"public good\" which can benefit all companies, the government may have given the productivity drive a major boost.\n\nBudget 2015 also includes measures to encourage companies to scale up through targeted and enhanced schemes for mergers and acquisitions (M&As). For one, it has extended the M&A scheme to enable companies to claim tax allowances for another five years. In addition, it has also made the scheme more attractive by increasing tax allowances for acquisition costs from 5 per cent at present to 25 per cent. This should make it easier for SMEs to scale up by reducing M&A costs. It will also help larger companies looking to make big-ticket acquisitions. Over time, more Singapore companies will be able to reap economies of scale, and become more price-competitive and more resilient.\n\nAs for costs, the increase in CPF contribution rates will no doubt make it more expensive for companies to hire older workers. But employers will get partial relief via the special employment credit which provides a wage offset for workers above age 50 and even more for workers aged 65 and above.\n\nThe Budget also contains additional measures to contain costs. Most notably, the deferral of foreign worker levies for one year will be a major relief for companies, both in terms of yielding cost savings and enabling them to take on more workers. The extension of the Wage Credit Scheme will also help them adjust to the tight labour market more gradually. The move to extend the 30 per cent corporate income tax rebate by a further two years (albeit with a lower cap of S$20,000) will help SMEs too, as will the one-year 100 per cent road tax rebate for commercial vehicles. Overall, businesses should end up with lower costs after Budget 2015. And if they make the most of the incentives for innovation and internationalisation, they should see their topline grow as well.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its net profit attributable to shareholders for the three months ended Dec 31 stood at US$12.4 million, down 22.3 per cent from US$15.9 million a year earlier, which included US$234,000 from its divested cocoa processing operations.\n\nExcluding the discontinued operations, net profit dropped 21.1 per cent.\n\nRevenue for the confectionery manufacturer was largely flat at US$131.2 million, as a depreciation in regional currencies, especially the Indonesian rupiah, against the US dollar weighed on the group. The rupiah had fallen an average of 15 per cent in 2014, Petra Foods said. In constant exchange rates, revenue would have risen by 5 per cent, Petra Foods said.\n\nFor the full year, net profit more than doubled to US$48.8 million, from 2013's US$20.6 million, the latter after accounting for a US$38.8 million deficit from discontinued operations. Revenue of US$504 million was 0.9 per cent lower. Ignoring discontinued operations, net profit fell 17.8 per cent.\n\nThe period saw a tougher operating environment, with steeper competition, higher cost inflation, weakeness in regional currencies and the business bearing the full brunt of the headquarter expenses that were previously shared between the two business units.\n\nCEO John Chuang said Petra achieved strong results despite the adverse environment because of investments in product innovation, portfolio expansion, aggressive brand development and route-to-market capabilities. Petra Foods plans to invest in expanding capacity and capabilities, and increase productivity and efficiency in its manufacturing and distribution capabilities.\n\n\"To add further value over the longer term to our quality earnings, we will continue to explore opportunities to enter new markets and to extend to new categories,\" it said.\n\nPetra Foods, which is now in dispute with Barry Callebaut over the post-completion adjustments to the final selling price of the cocoa ingredients business, said that proceedings at the Singapore International Arbitration Centre are still ongoing.\n\nIt is also contesting tax claims by Barry Callebaut. According to the latter, the Brazil tax authorities has made claims totalling US$12.8 million in total against a unit in Brazil that is part of the cocoa ingredients business. Petra Foods is requesting Barry Callebaut to defend the claims. The group has declared a final dividend of 1.92 US cents, and a special dividend of 1.64 US cents per share.\n\nShares in Petra Foods last traded at S$4.09.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This could spark national bankruptcy, a run on banks and even a chaotic exit from the eurozone with untold wider consequences.\n\nTo win this breathing space, Greece presented its creditors with reform proposals focusing on tackling tax evasion, corruption and an efficiency drive throughout the government, including eliminating politicians' perks.\n\nBut Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had to temper pre-election promises to hike the minimum wage, reinstate laid-off civil servants and alleviate poverty with promises that this would be done only in consultation with Greece's creditors.\n\nFinance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said on Wednesday that Greece has no immediate problem with government liquidity, but faces trouble in making debt payments to the IMF and European Central Bank in the spring and summer.\n\n\"We will not have liquidity problems for the public sector. But we will definitely have a problem in repaying instalments to the IMF now and to the ECB in July,\" he told Alpha Radio.\n\nA finance ministry official said on Tuesday that Greece expected to start discussions immediately with its EU/IMF partners on filling the state's funding gap.\n\nFollowing interest payments this month of about two billion euros to private bondholders and official lenders, Greece must repay an International Monetary Fund loan of around 1.6 billion that matures in March.\n\nThen it needs 0.8 billion euros for interest payments in April and about 7.5 billion in July and August for maturing bonds held by the ECB and for more interest payments.\n\nMr Varoufakis also played down suggestions that he had difficult relations with German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble. \"I continue to say that of all my colleagues at the Eurogroup, I have the greatest respect for Wolfgang Schaeuble,\" he said. \"When he speaks, I enjoy listening to him and disagreeing with him.\"\n\nAlready on Tuesday the plans received a cool response from the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which together with the European Commission hold the lion's share of Greece's 320 billion euros in debts.\n\nIMF chief Christine Lagarde said that the list lacks \"clear assurances\" on Greece's previous reform promises, while the ECB said that the measures \"differ from existing programme commitments in a number of areas\".\n\nEurozone finance ministers said too after an hour-long conference call on Tuesday that those three institutions believed Greece's new plan was merely \"sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point\" for further negotiations.\n\n\"We avoided a crisis but there are many challenges ahead,\" EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said.\n\nNonetheless the news buoyed financial markets, with Greek stocks soaring almost 10 per cent on Tuesday as fears of a \"Grexit\" - a eurozone exit by Greece - receded. Greek stocks added modestly to those gains on Wednesday.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has championed the bitter pill of austerity as the only cure to the eurozone debt crisis, asked her party on Tuesday to back the extension in a Bundestag vote on Friday, a lawmakers said.\n\nBut she stressed that the \"task is by no means done\", the MP said.\n\nFrench President Francois Hollande hailed it as a \"good compromise\". Spanish Finance Minister Luis de Guindos - whose government is facing a major challenge from the anti-austerity party Podemos - called it a \"positive solution\".\n\nGreece has had to be bailed out twice - in 2010 and 2012 - and has also benefited from a mammoth private-sector debt writedown or \"haircut\" worth another 100 billion euros.\n\nA number of debt interest repayments are due in the coming months, and Greece needs to firm up its reform promises and show by the end of April that they are bearing fruit before it can receive the final bailout disbursement of 7.2 billion euros.\n\n\"We must outdo ourselves . . . We are in unchartered territory,\" a Greek finance ministry official said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Things are not rosy,\" Labour Minister Panos Skourletis said on Wednesday. \"We are in a very difficult position, we know that the road ahead will be tough. But qualitatively we are in a new position.\" AFP, REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

When it comes to the SGX, which was formed by the merger of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (Simex) and the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) 15 years ago, very few people outside of the exchange think of the Simex side of the business; instead, almost everyone focuses on the SES's portion.\n\nTo be honest, this is not surprising. The growth and contribution from derivatives are only statistics in the minds of the investing public, largely invisible and out of their reckoning because this segment is the preserve of sophisticated institutions. How many people, for instance, think of iron ore, rubber or China A50 contracts when they think of SGX?\n\nFrom the viewpoint of an SGX shareholder though, it is the derivatives side which is arguably more important given the recent decline in contribution from the stock market - for Q2 2015 ended Dec 31, 2014, only 26 per cent of SGX's revenue came from securities whilst 39 per cent came from derivatives.\n\nThe problem, however, that will confront the incoming chief is that even if the stock market now contributes proportionately less to the exchange's bottom line, it is vastly more visible since it is the primary capital-raising platform for the local corporate sector and the repository of the savings of many retail investors.\n\nMoreover, the equity market is of paramount importance since - in theory at least - it provides the economy's link with the future by allocating scarce resources to their best possible uses.\n\nBecause of this visibility, equities garner the greater share of the public's attention. In this connection, persistent complaints about an archaic dual-role model and the prolonged absence of vibrancy, liquidity, quality of offerings and retail investor presence have been widely publicised and it explains why when asked about the task ahead for SGX's next CEO, the focus of the majority of respondents would be on how to improve the equity business and not the derivative.\n\nWhat the issue boils down to is this: the next SGX chief must find a way to bridge the gap between the demands of the exchange's shareholders and the demands of its stakeholders.\n\nShareholders would be more than happy with the company's profitability and dividend payouts over the years - even given the diminished contribution from the stock market - and would demand that SGX maintain its growth in the mainly institutional-driven derivatives business. The exchange is today a cash-rich, fundamentally solid company, having been transformed into a major Asian derivatives player under Mr Bocker's guidance.\n\nMany stakeholders with an interest in the stock market on the other hand - among them brokers, retail investors and corporate finance people involved in IPOs - would wish for greater vibrancy and consideration for retail interests.\n\nThis is not to say that SGX has ignored the equity market - in the past five years under Mr Bocker, the local market's capitalisation has grown by an impressive 80 per cent to S$980 billion and the returns from equity investment have far exceeded savings rates.\n\nBut it is to say that the successor must find a way of accommodating the needs of all interested parties - not just shareholders.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cost of sales and administrative expenses grew at a slower pace. A final dividend of 1.5 cents a share was declared, compared to 1.4 cents a year ago. This brings the total dividend for the year to three cents, up from 2.6 cents a year ago.\n\nFor the full year, net profit was up 22.3 per cent to S$47.6 million while revenue was up 5.6 per cent to S$726 million.\n\nGroup CEO Lim Hock Chee said the company will continue to expand its retail network in Singapore.\n\nOut of the revenue increase, 2.3 percentage points was due to the eight new stores opened in 2012, and 3.3 percentage points was due to same-store sales growth for the rest. Sheng Siong had 34 stores at end-2014.\n\nLonger operating hours, growth in new stores, marketing initiatives and renovation in some old stores helped revenue growth, Sheng Siong said. It added that most of the new stores are growing within expectations.\n\nGross profit margins increased throughout the year to hit 24.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, from 23.2 per cent a year ago. This was due to lower costs resulting from Sheng Siong's Mandai distribution centre, a better sales mix, and stable selling prices.\n\nIn 2014, Sheng Siong made a major investment by buying a 3,876 sq m site at Block 506 Tampines Central 1 for S$65 million. The site has 75 years left on its lease. Sheng Siong also placed out 120 million new shares to raise S$80.4 million, using most of the money to pay for the site.\n\nA new supermarket on the second floor of the property has opened in January, and the group will also start to get a small amount of rental income from units in the property rented out to non-related parties.\n\nSheng Siong closed at 72.5 Singapore cents a share, down half a cent, before results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 49.5, little changed from January's final PMI of 49.7.\n\nBut even as factory activity grew marginally, the survey suggested that manufacturers still faced considerable risks from weak foreign demand and deepening deflationary pressures. While domestic demand picked up slightly, the new export orders sub-index shed three hefty points from January to skid to 47.1, the sharpest rate of contraction since June 2013.\n\n\"Domestic economic activity is likely to remain sluggish and external demand looks uncertain,\" said Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief economist in China. \"We believe more policy easing is still warranted at the current stage to support growth.\"\n\nInput and output prices also fell. Though prices did not drop as sharply as they did in January, the trend pointed to further pressure on companies' profitability.\n\nEmployment in factories shrank as well for the 16th straight month as firms dismissed workers to adjust to slower business. The Australian dollar and emerging Asian currencies extended early gains after the PMI report, though shares in China and Hong Kong remained slightly lower.\n\nAlthough the PMI is supposed to be adjusted for seasonal fluctuations in activity, including over the long Chinese New Year holiday when thousands of factories are shut, many analysts believe they have to wait until March for reliable data.\n\nWeighed down by a cooling property market, industrial overcapacity and slowing investment, China's economy grew 7.4 per cent in 2014, its slowest expansion in 24 years.\n\nEconomists expect growth to cool further to 7 per cent in 2015, even with additional stimulus measures.\n\nTo lift flagging growth, the central bank reduced the amount of cash that banks have to hold as reserves earlier in February for the first time in over two years. In November, it cut interest rates, also for the first time in over two years.\n\nMost analysts believe policy will be loosened further in coming months in the form of rate cuts and reserve ratio reductions. This is especially after data this month showed growth in broad M2 money supply slumped to its lowest in January.\n\nSome economists said the plunge in M2 growth was a sign that more capital was leaving the world's second-largest economy as it cools, a trend that would tighten liquidity conditions and spur the central bank to ease policy.

He said start-ups developed by the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC) and Cyberport had attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in investment.\n\nTo further promote the financing of new enterprises, Mr Tsang said the HKSTPC would earmark HK$50 million to set up a corporate venture fund on a matching basis with private funds. The money would be invested in start-ups that were either located in the Science Park or had participated in one of its incubation programs.\n\nMr Tsang also earmarked HK$150 million for a new phase of the Enhancing Self-Reliance Through District Partnership Program, covering 2016-17 to 2019-20. He said the money would be used to encourage commercial sector participation in social enterprises and promote a greater variety of social enterprises.\n\nMr Tsang said that human resources development was a central aspect of the Budget. \"The government has devoted substantial resources to improving the quality of manpower to further diversify the economy and steer our development towards high value-added activities,\" he said.\n\nHe unveiled a number of human resources' initiatives in his Budget, which include HK$960 million for a pilot programme allowing 1,000 students per cohort to pursue designated self-financing undergraduate programmes that reflect Hong Kong's manpower needs.\n\nA total of HK$130 million will be allocated to strengthen childcare services. The funds will also help more women join the workforce. And the Integrated Employment Assistance Programme for Self-reliance will be extended for two years with HK$220 million. The programme encourages employable, able-bodied recipients of the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme to gain employment.\n\nBeyond creating employment opportunities for women and older people, Mr Tsang's Budget also targeted healthcare and retirement protection. He reiterated the Chief Executive's January Policy Address announcement that HK$50 billion would be set aside to provide better retirement protection for the elderly in need.\n\nBesides the above long-term measures, the secretary said he will launch a series of short-term measures to support sectors affected by the \"Occupy Central\" movement of last year.\n\nMr Tsang said a total of 18,000 travel agents, 2,000 hotels and guesthouses, 26,000 restaurants and operators, and the transportation sector will benefit. \"More importantly, we need to rebuild international investors' and tourists' confidence in Hong Kong and uplift our international image. I shall allocate an additional HK$80 million for the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB) to step up its promotion efforts in the coming year,\" he said.\n\nThis series of support measures and promotion efforts will cost HK$290 million.\n\nMeanwhile, he offered a range of initiatives to develop Hong Kong's pillar industries: trading and logistics, tourism, business and professional services, and financial services.\n\nFor the financial sector, Mr Tsang announced that he would launch an inflation-linked retail bond, or iBond, issue of up to HK$10 billion, with a maturity of three years. The issuance would target Hong Kong residents.\n\nThe secretary also said that Hong Kong was also exploring a closer economic partnership arrangement with Macao, and that the government will hold discussions with the Walt Disney Company on Phase 2 development of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.

Ms Yellen declined to provide much insight into when the word \"patient\" might be dropped from the Fed's monetary policy statement. Instead, she emphasised that dropping the word would not necessarily mean rate hikes were imminent.\n\nWhether to raise rates will depend on economic data and will be decided on a meeting-to-meeting basis, she said. \"Some investors were positioned for more hawkish comments and they were disappointed,\" said Yujiro Goto, a currency strategist at Nomura. \"We still hold a dollar bullish bias and if the US jobs data surprises to the upside next week, we could see a return of dollar strength.\"\n\nThe dollar index was down 0.25 per cent at 94.245, with the greenback shedding ground against almost every major currency. It fell 0.2 per cent against the yen to 118.73 yen , while sterling rose to a eight-week high of US$1.5538. Against the euro, it was up 0.1 per cent at US$1.1355.\n\nThe dollar's drop was seen as temporary. The Fed still appears to be on track to raise rates later this year, although probably not in June as a few large banks had forecast.\n\nIn contrast, the European Central Bank is beginning a 60 billion-euros (S$92 billion)-a-month bond buying programme next month. The Bank of Japan is already deep into a similar quantitative easing programme. That makes the dollar a buy on dips, traders said. \"We attribute the FX market's reaction largely to positioning going into the (Yellen) event,\" said Susanne Galler, a currency analyst at Jefferies.\n\n\"In a nutshell, if the 'patient' phrase remains in the March statement, forget about a hike in June. If it is dropped, anything goes as of June. But whether a hike will take place in June or as late as December will simply be data dependent.\"\n\nThe Australian dollar rose 0.7 per cent to US$0.7885, aided by the greenback's weakness and a survey showing that activity in China's mammoth factory sector edged up to a four-month high in February.

The US Federal Reserve chair deftly parried conflicting calls for more patience and higher interest rates in congressional testimony on Tuesday. What she didn't do is offer clarity on the timing of a rate hike.\n\nMs Yellen proved once again at her semi-annual appearance before Congress that she can keep cool in the hot seat. She smoothly dodged questions from Senator Elizabeth Warren, a major Wall Street critic, on whether a Fed official's harsh comments about some Dodd-Frank financial reforms were appropriate. She even waved around a copy of the Fed's financial audit while pointedly rebutting calls for closer government scrutiny.\n\nBut she was also maddeningly unclear. Advocates for an interest rate increase could have interpreted her praise for recent job growth and steady inflation to mean a move is imminent. Concerns about the low percentage of labour market participation and sluggish wage growth, however, may have left those hoping for continued rock-bottom rates reassured.\n\nMs Yellen also rebuffed senators pressing for more evidence of a hike, indicating that the Fed would only move when it felt economic indicators were just right. Likewise, she pushed back on those wanting the central bank to maintain ultra-low levels indefinitely, reiterating the importance of normalising policy.\n\nThe Fed chair's performance seems to have satisfied analysts holding divergent points of view. UBS said in a research note, for example, that Ms Yellen affirmed its opinion that rates will rise in June, while BNP Paribas economists took her testimony to mean a boost won't occur until September.\n\nThe failure to give firmer guidance on the timing of a rate increase or the economic conditions that will trigger it means that a policy change will probably come without explicit warning. That offers the Fed valuable flexibility, of course, and it can't offer a detailed script in any event. But while the strategy may calm markets for now, no one likes to be caught off guard.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Republicans, now in control of both legislative branches, have been leading efforts to rein in the Fed, but Democrats are pushing for more transparency too.\n\nMs Yellen, who took over as Fed chief just over a year ago, maintained a calm, deliberate demeanor throughout the questioning, which touched upon currency manipulation, insurance regulation and a bill to fully audit the central bank. She was, however, not pressed on when the Fed might raise interest rates amid expectations that it will make the move later this year.\n\nAlabama Republican Richard Shelby, who chairs the committee, took an aggressive tack at the start of the session, issuing a statement saying that the Fed had gained \"unprecedented power\"and needed greater oversight. But in his questions to Ms Yellen, Mr Shelby showed respect and patience.\n\nThe harshest questioning came from Mr Warren, who has frequently criticised Wall Street and financial regulators and is being pushed by liberal Democrats to run for the presidency in 2016.\n\nMr Warren asked Ms Yellen to explain why the Fed has not honoured her request for a briefing into leaked Fed meeting minutes several years ago, and she took aim at certain statements made by Fed general counsel Scott Alvarez, saying they showed he was critical of parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law.\n\nSeveral times, as Ms Yellen tried to answer, Mr Warren interrupted to demand a simpler response, saying at one point, \"we just need a yes or no here.\"\n\nMs Yellen reaffirmed her strong opposition to the so-called \"Audit the Fed\" bill before Congress.

For fiscal 2015, profit will be US$3.53 to US$3.73 a share, missing an estimate of US$3.95.\n\nHewlett-Packard, which gets about two-thirds of its sales overseas, said the impact of foreign currency exchange rates will be greater than it anticipated last year.\n\nAt the same time, the rise of services delivered via the Internet, also known as cloud computing, is chipping away at sales and earnings from traditional storage equipment and hardware.\n\nThe company, which is breaking up to become more responsive to corporate customers, said it will incur about US$2 billion in costs over two years related to the split.\n\n\"The thing that we're wrestling with is the separation cost is so high,\" said Jayson Noland Sr, an analyst at Robert W Baird & Co. \"We didn't appreciate how much it would cost - that's a lot.\"\n\nHewlett-Packard shares dropped as much as 8 per cent in extended trading following the report. They gained less than one per cent to US$38.49 at the close in New York, leaving them down 4.1 per cent this year.\n\nThe US dollar has gained 21 per cent against the euro in the past 12 months, eroding the value of revenue US companies generate overseas when it's brought back home. Hewlett-Packard got 65 per cent of sales outside of the US in fiscal 2014. That compares with 55 per cent outside the Americas at International Business Machines Corp, and 83 per cent for Intel Corp.\n\nFor the first quarter, which ended on Jan 31, profit before certain items was 92 cents a share, compared with analysts' average prediction of 91 cents. Net income fell to US$1.37 billion, or 73 cents, from US$1.43 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier.\n\nSales shrank 4.7 per cent to US$26.8 billion from US$28.2 billion, short of an average analyst estimate for US$27.3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSales in Hewlett-Packard's personal computer unit and the enterprise group were little changed in the quarter from a year ago, while sales in its higher-margin printing division fell 5 per cent to US$5.54 billion. Revenue in enterprise services, software and financial services all fell in the first quarter.\n\nThe company's planned breakup will form two publicly traded companies, one selling corporate equipment and services and the other focused on PCs and printers.\n\nThe US$2 billion in costs for the split reflects a forecast of US$1.3 billion of charges for fiscal 2015, an estimated charge of US$500 million for 2016, and separation-related capital spending of US$300 million this year, chief financial officer Cathie Lesjak said.\n\nHewlett-Packard also anticipates foreign tax expenses of US$950 million relating to the split, though half of that may be offset by tax credits.\n\nThese costs, combined with the strength of the US dollar relative to other currencies, led the company to lower its free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2015 to US$3.5 billion to US$4 billion, from US$6.5 billion to US$7 billion.\n\nThe company also repeated its plan to cut 55,000 jobs by the end of this fiscal year.\n\nWeakness in the company's divisions may ripple out into its suppliers. More than 20 companies derive at least 10 per cent of their revenue from Hewlett-Packard, including key component makers and manufacturers Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, Quanta Computer and Intel Corp, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nChief executive officer Meg Whitman has steered clear of making large acquisitions since taking the helm in 2011. The company has made a number of small deals while dealing with the fallout of its US$10.3 billion purchase of UK-based Autonomy in August 2011, which led to an US$8.8 billion writedown. Now, Ms Whitman said the company may be on the lookout again.\n\nHewlett-Packard is \"now in a position where we can actually make acquisitions which we couldn't when we started\", Ms Whitman said.\n\nStill, Ms Lesjak, the CFO, said there's no one area where the company is seeking to add to its product line. \"We don't think there's a gaping hole anywhere.\"\n\nInvestors are focused on the company's planned breakup, and the performance of the two companies that will result. The split is expected to be completed in the last quarter of this year.\n\nOnce the breakup is final, Hewlett-Packard will probably start changing more rapidly to tackle transitions in markets where it competes, said Dan Morgan at Synovus Securities.\n\n\"The catalyst isn't a new software acquisition, it isn't a new service - it's going to be these two separate companies,\" he said. \"Until then we're waiting to see when this happens.\"\n\nMs Whitman will run Hewlett-Packard's enterprise company, and Dion Weisler will lead the new HP Inc, centred on PCs and printers. The two have spent the past year trying to convince investors that each of the company's businesses is capable of inventing its way back to technology leadership.

It also comes as Singapore evolves into a \"smart nation\".\n\nInstead of installing smart gadgets upon moving into a regular home, Qingjian homeowners will be able to plug into a smart home from the onset, said Qingjian general manager Li Jun. The developer will put in place the necessary infrastructure during construction, so buyers will save time, money and effort, not having to create smart homes from scratch.\n\nThe partnership, in the works since last year, will see the two conglomerates working \"very closely\" with each other indefinitely, Mr Li said. Their smart home vision will extend to all of Qingjian's projects.\n\nThe companies will also explore ways to help homeowners better connect their appliances with personal smart devices.\n\nAndy Sim, general manager of enterprise business at Samsung Asia, told BT that the MOU marks the start of a \"thousand-mile journey\" which Samsung is very excited about. Tizen, Samsung's lightweight operating system, will run in Qingjian's smart homes to connect the appliances.\n\nFor a start, customers who have already bought Qingjian property will be the first to benefit from the collaboration. Qingjian homeowners who will receive their temporary occupation permit (TOP) from this year onwards can buy general Samsung appliances at a preferential rate. Mr Sim declined to divulge the size of the discount, but said the appliances will be sold in bundles.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the developer will also use Samsung's smart products in its upcoming projects.\n\nIn particular, Qingjian has earmarked the tech giant as its \"single brand of choice\" for its executive condominium (EC) in Sembawang which launches next year, Mr Sim said. Valued at S$4 million, the deal will see Samsung providing its smart appliances such as built-in kitchen appliances and washing machines to the Sembawang homeowners.\n\nDespite the tepid property market, Qingjian told BT it is not worried about demand for its future smart homes because it believes the adoption of smart living technology here is \"inevitable\".\n\n\"So, regardless of how the market is, this is a path we have to take as a developer,\" Mr Li said. He hopes other developers will follow Qingjian's lead to create smart homes and eventually benefit all homeowners in Singapore.\n\nAs for when buyers can expect the first smart homes, Mr Sim said it hinges on when the technology becomes commercially available - which in turn depends on factors such as government endorsement and security, which are \"quite complex\".\n\nMr Ng agrees, but is confident that concerted efforts via the Smart Nation blueprint and by the consumer electronics companies can make smart homes a reality.\n\n\"The technology may not be fully ready right now for such a seamless integration, but nothing is impossible,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue rose 15 per cent to US$234.2 million, it said, missing the US$246.1 million average of estimates. The studio behind the Shrek movies is revamping its film business to focus on fewer, higher quality projects. DreamWorks Animation said on Tuesday it agreed to a sale and leaseback of its headquarters campus for US$185 million and refinanced a credit line, moves that with other cost-saving steps will boost its cash by about US$235 million.\n\nThe studio, led by CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, said in January it will reduce production to two films a year and eliminate 500 jobs to improve the quality and profitability of its pictures.\n\nThe company said results included US$210.1 million in restructuring costs, as well as an impairment charge of US$57.1 million for films that underperformed, such as The Penguins of Madagascar and Mr Peabody and Sherman. In addition to the property sale, DreamWorks Animation said it amended its US$400 million revolving credit facility and increased the size to US$450 million.

Instead, three American brands - the Tesla, the Buick Regal and the Chevrolet Impala - held their own in the top 10.\n\n\"Detroit vehicles are breaking through in new categories,\" said Mark Rechtin of Consumer Reports' car ratings team.\n\n\"Many have come a long way in performance, technology, and improved reliability. These are the cars that ignite the gasoline in our veins. That we trust. Respect. And love,\" the magazine said. \"They also happen to score high in our reliability ratings and shine in automotive crash tests.\"\n\nThe US$80,000-plus plug-in Tesla again captured the magazine's fancy as its overall top pick, and not just for the car's market-beating 426 km range without a charge.\n\nConsumer Reports praised the ability to update the Tesla's software over the Internet, and that the company surmounted early technical problems, including a handful of fires that started from objects on the road surface kicking into its underside battery pack. With those problems aside, Consumer Reports lauded the Tesla S's \"magnificence and sheer technological arrogance\".\n\nSubaru, whose all-wheel-drive models are popular with both sport driving fans and outdoorists, led three categories of the 10. The Impreza led the compact car group as a \"strong value,\" the Legacy was the best mid-sized sedan, and the Forester grabbed one of the hottest market segments, the small sport-utility vehicles.\n\n\"Subaru has nailed the recipe of combining practicality, safety, fuel economy, value, and interior accommodations,\" said the magazine.\n\nThe Audi A6 came in tops for a luxury car and, on the green car side, Toyota's hybrid Prius took the honours for the 12th straight year. Toyota's Highlander was best mid-sized SUV and the Honda Odyssey the winner among minivans.\n\nBut the surprise was the inclusion of the Chevrolet Impala as the best large car, beating out the Toyota Avalon and Lexus ES 350. Only slightly less surprising was the Buick Regal as the leading sports sedan. It is better known elsewhere as the Opel Insignia.

It will not affect individual account-holders.\n\nUnder new regulations aimed at riskier holdings at JPMorgan and other banks deemed \"systemically important\" by regulators, JPMorgan is required to hold \"much more capital\" against these deposits than other moneys, JPMorgan executives said in an internal memo to employees.\n\nThese regulatory requirements, imposed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, mean that keeping these deposits represents \"a costly and inefficient use of our balance sheet,\" said the memo.\n\n\"We will work with clients to encourage off-balance sheet alternatives... and we will likely charge for some deposits, or in some cases, ask clients to hold their non-operating deposits at a different firm,\" the memo added.\n\nThe changes were announced at JPMorgan's annual investor day. The bank also said it would reduce its branch count by about 300 through the end of 2016.\n\nJPMorgan said the rise of digital banking permits it to streamline its physical footprint, enabling fewer retail locations and smaller staffs at those that remain.\n\nChief executive Jamie Dimon told investors that JPMorgan's lower stock valuation compared with many peers was due to greater regulatory uncertainty given the bank's size and legal issues.\n\nIn two years or so JPMorgan's stock price would benefit as the regulatory cloud subsides and its financial performance strengthens, he predicted.\n\n\"I do think that one day those things will lift,\" Dimon said. \"In two years, I think most of these regulations will be in place... and a lot of the legal stuff will be over.\" The bank has announced multibillion-dollar settlements, including over its packaging of mortgage-linked securities, and faces ongoing probes into its foreign-exchange trades and its hiring practices in China, among other areas.\n\nJPMorgan executives offered a robust defense of the bank's business model, rebutting critics on Capitol Hill and from within the financial community who have called for a break-up of the bank.\n\nThe bank's ability to provide corporate, investment and individual banking functions is suited for private and government clients \"who need a large bank,\" Dimon said. \"It is not possible to do what they want with a small regional bank.\" Dow component JPMorgan Chase rose 2.5 per cent to US$60.82.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

The fourth quarter was better for Apple as it claimed 19.7 per cent, IDC data showed.\n\nWith Android and iOS holding some 96 per cent of the market, there has been little progress from alternative platforms, with Windows Phone losing momentum and BlackBerry nearly disappearing, IDC said.\n\n\"Instead of a battle for the third ecosystem after Android and iOS, 2014 instead yielded skirmishes, with Windows Phone edging out BlackBerry, Firefox, Sailfish and the rest, but without any of these platforms making the kind of gains needed to challenge the top two,\" said Melissa Chau, an IDC analyst.\n\n\"This isn't to say that vendors aren't making moves, especially for the growth segments - the low-end markets. With Microsoft bringing ever-cheaper Lumia into play and Tizen finally getting launched to India early this year, there is still a hunger to chip away at Android's dominance.\"\n\nIDC said Android phone makers sold over one billion handsets of the 1.3 billion delivered globally, with Apple selling 192 million.\n\nWindows phone saw its market share slip to 2.7 per cent in 2014 from 3.3 percent a year earlier.

They're paying up, too, with takeover premiums that are about double the global average, the data show. The trend is set to continue.\n\nAfter years of building up cash to a record 233 trillion yen (US$2 trillion) as of the end of September, Japanese companies are looking to convert those stockpiles into future growth by investing overseas where the outlook is brighter.\n\nWhile the yen's 14 per cent drop against the dollar in the past year has made foreign acquisitions more expensive, economists project the Japanese currency will weaken further amid Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's campaign to fight deflation. That gives companies the incentive to spend now.\n\nJapan Tobacco Inc, Asia's biggest listed cigarette maker, has declared a \"year of investments\" while machinery maker Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and brewer Kirin Holdings Co are also considering growth through takeovers abroad.\n\n\"Japan Inc's sense of urgency in making acquisitions abroad is strengthening,\" said Makoto Shiono, managing director of Tokyo-based consultancy Industrial Growth Platform Inc.\n\n\"Japan's massive monetary easing slashed the value of cash. So if you have tons of cash, investors will be pressing you to invest in companies to generate cash flow for future growth.\"\n\nHEFTY PREMIUMS\n\nCompanies in Japan have agreed to pay an average 39 per cent premium for overseas takeovers and majority-interest purchases announced since Jan 1, compared with the global average of less than 20 per cent during the period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe Japanese purchases valued their targets at a median 23 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, compared to the global median Ebitda multiple of 9.4.\n\nThe takeover activity has been broad in nature, spanning a number of industries. This week alone, Hitachi Ltd. agreed to buy Rome-based Finmeccanica SpA's stake in Ansaldo STS SpA, in a deal valuing the maker of driverless metro trains at 1.93 billion euros (US$2.2 billion).\n\nJapanese chemical producer Asahi Kasei Corp. said it will buy Charlotte, North Carolina-based Polypore International Inc to expand its battery business.\n\nHitachi fell as much as 3.3 per cent in Tokyo on Wednesday, the first day of trading after the Ansaldo acquisition was announced. The shares were down 0.9 per cent at 820.5 yen as of 1.56pm.\n\n'RADICAL MOVES'\n\nEarlier this month, Japan Post offered A$6.5 billion (US$5.1 billion) for Melbourne-based transport firm Toll Holdings Ltd in the biggest Australian acquisition by a Japanese company.\n\nCanon said Feb 10 it made a 23.6 billion-krona (US$2.8 billion) cash bid for Sweden's Axis Communications AB, expanding into video surveillance as smartphone competition erodes digital camera sales. And in January, the 157-year-old trading house Itochu agreed to the US$5 billion purchase of a stake in China's Citic Ltd.\n\nThe combination of large cash hoards, cheap financing and Japan's shrinking and aging population is driving companies to invest overseas, said Shintaro Okuno, a partner at Bain & Co who specialises in mergers.\n\n\"They're coming to a point where they have to do these radical moves,\" Tokyo-based Okuno said. \"And also, money here is so cheap.\"\n\nWILLING LENDERS\n\nEven after weakening to 119 yen against the US dollar from a postwar high of about 75 yen in 2011, Japan's currency may still decline to 128 yen next year, according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nJapan's economy is forecast to grow 1 per cent this year, compared with 3.1 per cent for the US and 1.2 per cent for the euro area, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nOverseas purchases are likely to continue, and lenders are willing to finance deals, Japanese Bankers Association Chairman Nobuyuki Hirano said Feb 19. That will help companies like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which said last August it's looking for more takeover opportunities as it targets 5 trillion yen in revenue by 2017.\n\nThe industrial company was thwarted in a bid for Alstom SA's power business in June, after the French government backed a competing offer from General Electric Co.\n\nSEEKING STOMACHS\n\nJapan Tobacco President Mitsuomi Koizumi said earlier this month that the company will speed up deals relating to other types of tobacco products, such as e-cigarettes. It's also interested in acquisitions in countries where it doesn't have much presence such as Brazil, Singapore and Bangladesh, Koizumi said. The cigarette maker completed 11 acquisitions totaling US$2.1 billion in the past five years.\n\nKirin, Japan's second-largest brewer by market value, is seeking acquisition opportunities in Southeast Asia and China, President Senji Miyake said Feb. 12.\n\nIts larger rival Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. is also weighing acquisitions in Southeast Asia as the company targets 100 billion yen sales in the region this year, Asahi spokesman Takuo Soga said by phone Feb 20.\n\n\"Japanese food and beverage makers need more stomachs abroad,\" said Tomonobu Tsunoyama, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.\n\n\"Asia, Indonesia for example, must be their primary focus because of the region's large and young population and a culture where Japanese brands are welcomed.\"\n\nToshiyuki Mitsuzawa, head of cross-border M&A at Frontier Management Inc., expects other Japanese consumer-products companies will join Mizkan Group Corp in making US purchases. Mizkan, a condiment maker founded in 1804, bought the Ragu and Bertolli pasta-sauce business from Unilever NV for US$2.15 billion last year.\n\n\"Beverage, food and confectionery makers will perhaps be pouring some of their investment into the US this year,\" Mr Matsuzawa said by phone on Feb 20. \"They are being hit the hardest by the aging and declining population in their home market.\"\n\nFast Retailing Co, which runs the Uniqlo clothing chain, may buy one or two brands in Europe, said Mikihiko Yamato, deputy head of research at JI Asia in Tokyo. A representative for Fast Retailing declined to comment.\n\nSuch deals could help this year surpass the record US$103.8 billion in annual Japanese outbound deals announced in 2012, led by SoftBank Corp's takeover of Sprint Corp and the purchase of US grains collector Gavilon by trading house Marubeni Corp.\n\nMany Japanese companies have boosted profit in recent years by cutting costs rather than increasing sales, said Bain's Mr Okuno.\n\n\"That's not sustainable, so now they're coming to the inflection point where they really have to think about growth,\" Mr Okuno said. \"And they have enormous amounts of cash.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM", "images": []}

The bank was fined US$1.9 billion two years ago by US authorities for lax controls that allowed criminals to launder money and was also hit with a US$611 million penalty by regulators in November for alleged manipulation of currency markets. \"It's a terrible list,\" HSBC Chairman Douglas Flint said when a UK member of parliament read out the recent fines and investigations involving the bank at a panel hearing where Flint was being questioned.\n\nThe latest allegations around HSBC's Swiss bank have damaged its reputation and caused a political storm in Britain ahead of an election in May. The opposition Labour Party has criticised Prime Minister David Cameron for appointing former HSBC Chairman Stephen Green as a trade minister after he left the bank.\n\nFlint and HSBC Chief Executive Stuart Gulliver apologised to the cross-party panel of UK politicians who oversee the financial industry for past failings at its Swiss private bank that allegedly allowed clients to dodge taxes. \"It clearly was unacceptable, we very much regret this and it has damaged HSBC's reputation,\" Gulliver told the Treasury Committee in regard to practices at HSBC's Swiss bank in the mid-2000s. \"I am responsible for clearing it up. I have made substantial changes,\" he said.\n\nGulliver told the lawmakers a Swiss account he held in the past was not to avoid tax, saying he had paid all his UK taxes and opened the account so colleagues could not see his finances.\n\nGulliver has come under fire after Britain's Guardian newspaper said he had sheltered millions of pounds in HSBC's Swiss private bank via a Panamanian company.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

Earlier that month, the company slashed its profits for 2013 and the first half of 2014 by a combined 1.43 billion riyals ($381 million) because of what it said were accounting errors.\n\nThe earnings restatement prompted the bourse regulator, the Capital Market Authority, to launch an investigation into Mobily, while the company itself began its own probe as it suspended Kaf.\n\nMobily put his deputy Serkan Okandan in charge on an acting basis. Mr Okandan is also chief financial officer of Abu Dhabi-listed Etisalat, which owns 27.5 per cent of Mobily. He has a mandate to remain at the helm until at least the end of March.\n\nSaudi Arabia's second biggest mobile operator said Mr Kaf, who had worked for Etisalat for 19 years before becoming Mobily's CEO in 2005, had offered to resign on Feb 21. The statement did not say whether Mobily had accepted Mr Kaf's resignation, merely that it discharged him from his position on Feb 24.\n\nMobily said in a separate statement that it would not pay a dividend for the fourth quarter of 2014, for which it reported a loss of 2.28 billion riyals.\n\nThis is the second successive quarter for which it will not pay a dividend, and analysts are now gloomy about the size of future payouts by the company, which was long considered a top pick among retail and institutional investors.\n\nHSBC has in recent days slashed its price target for Mobily shares to 38 riyals from 60 riyals, with a neutral rating. The stock is now at 35.30 riyals, down 64 per cent from last May's eight-year high, wiping off about $13 billion from its market value.\n\nThe firm on Tuesday announced its chairman Abdulaziz al-Saghyir had resigned with immediate effect, citing health reasons.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

However, to be more effective this service will have to be properly resourced with experienced staff who have timely and relevant labour market information and can provide effective guidance.''\n\nThe group, which was formed on Dec 8, 2013 at the PAP Party Convention, is also pushing for the new\n\nSilver Support Scheme\n\nto be flexible, simple and paid directly into bank accounts of seniors on a monthly basis. The Silver Support Scheme aims to help the bottom 20 per cent of Singaporeans aged 65 and above, providing between S$300 and S$750 in payouts every quarter.\n\nIn light of the numerous measures unveiled by the Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam at this year's Budget Statement on Monday, the group is suggesting the publication of a comprehensive information kit covering all areas from healthcare, employment, retirement adequacy to housing that will benefit the elderly.\n\n\"We suggest that the different agencies put all these information in one information kit, to better communicate with older Singaporeans so that they can get a more complete picture of how their welfare is being taken care of.''\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the 1960s Mao railed against \"the four olds\" - old customs, culture, habits and ideas - in his quest to remake society, and the trend has continued ever since.\n\nFormer president Jiang Zemin's somewhat intangible \"Three Represents\" theory was a call for more open membership of the ruling party, which has \"Eight Immortals\" among its elite revolutionaries.\n\nIn its editorial the People's Daily said the Four Comprehensives would \"lead the way for strategic layout for national renewal\".\n\nBut such political pronouncements are often catchphrases with little precise definition or impact on policy.\n\nThe first step in the strategy was \"achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people through the Chinese Dream\" - a phrase that has so far been the catchphrase of Mr Xi's administration.\n\nDespite the Communist Party moving away from its Marxist-Leninist roots to embrace a more market economy - \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" - propaganda output and official communications remain awash with jargon.\n\nMr Jiang's theory and his successor Hu Jintao's own \"scientific outlook on development\" - a call for sustainable economic growth that has little to do with science - were invoked regularly by cadres at all levels to support the party's policies, and have been enshrined in the national constitution.\n\nNearly five years ago Mr Xi himself, then vice president, gave a speech at the central party school decrying the use of political jargon that walled the ruling party off from the country's more plain-spoken citizens.\n\nHe gave no examples in his attack on \"empty words\".\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/fa49ec540ee27c5e8b666a4439a0ac46e092c07bfa869508ff97b349bf247e68?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Chinese state-run media gave wall-to-wall coverage on Wednesday to President Xi Jinping's newly declared \"Four Comprehensives\" political theory as he consolidates power and advances his own brand of Communist thought."}]}

Another possible step would be to let homeowners sell properties without paying sales tax after two years, down from five years.\n\nChina's new-home prices posted a record year-on-year decline in January, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysis of government data tracking 70 cities. Implementation of the new easing policies will depend on whether an economic downturn continues or worsens, the people said.\n\nThe finance ministry didn't immediately respond to faxed questions on the measures.\n\nAn interest-rate cut in November and the removal of some curbs have failed to revive the property industry. In September, the central bank allowed lower down payments and mortgage rates for some people applying for loans for second homes.

The next level of support for the stock remains at S$0.85, its low in 2010,\" noted Nicholas Teo, a CMC Markets analyst.\n\nGenting's share price has slid roughly 23 per cent this past year, but it has in fact outperformed its Hong Kong-listed counterparts - Sands China, Melco Crown, Galaxy Entertainment and SJM Holdings - which have lost on average more than 40 per cent this past year, Mr Teo added.\n\nGenting on Tuesday evening reported that its net profit fell 30 per cent to S$118.9 million, while revenue slipped 8 per cent to S$637.9 million in its latest quarter, a result that analysts called \"disappointing\".\n\nThis was mostly due to the casino operator's significantly below-average win percentage and VIP rolling volume, which affected its premium player business.\n\nThis, along with high impairments, also led it to miss Nomura's earnings forecast.\n\nBut Nomura analyst Tushar Mohata believes that Genting has priced in near-term market concerns such as a slowdown in Chinese players, slow growth in Singapore gross gaming revenue, and a possible deferral of Japan casino debate.\n\n\"We do not expect the share price to fall, as we believe management might resume its share buybacks. Since November, Genting has bought back 171 million shares, 1.4 per cent of total at levels between S$1 and S$1.10.\n\n\"One potential positive surprise might be an increased dividend payout. In case management sees little progress on the Japan casino legalisation debate by the end of the current Diet session in June, they are willing to explore a higher payout to pare down some of their cash balance which they have been conserving to invest in a potential Japan venture,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So we are in the process of accelerating registration and launch of those products in gastroenterology, diabetes and of course, in oncology.\"\n\nTakeda had led the Japanese charge for large deals in recent years with its US$20 billion acquisition of Swiss drugmaker Nycomed and US biotech firm Millennium Pharmaceuticals in 2008.\n\nBy leveraging the commercial platform with the acquisition of Nycomed, Takeda now has commercial presence in 37 emerging markets around the region.\n\nTakeda said its five emerging-market areas represent 90 per cent of the total projected pharmaceutical growth.\n\nThe new office, spanning almost 14,000 square feet, paves the way for the drugmaker to tap the talent pool here. It will increase its staff strength by about 50 per cent, bringing the total headcount to some 200.\n\nIts vaccine business unit based here hosts a new laboratory that is primarily used for analytics and product development against infectious diseases in the region, with dengue fever being a key focus. The vaccine targeting dengue fever will soon enter Phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

for now - and sidestep an almost certain exit from the eurozone.\n\n\"The two potential international risk events for markets had positive outcomes,\" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\n\"Janet Yellen's testimony moved expectations for a rate hike out in time while the boxes were ticked to cement a four-month funding programme for Greece.\" Tokyo edged up 0.14 per cent at the open, Sydney rose 0.28 per cent, Seoul jumped 0.74 per cent, while Wellington rallied 1.46 per cent.\n\nChinese markets also rose at the open in the first day of trade after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nBut Shanghai quickly reversed coursed, falling 0.38 per cent, while Hong Kong also lost opening gains as it slipped 0.08 per cent.\n\nGlobal markets zeroed in on the start of Ms Yellen's two days of congressional testimony, where she signalled that the Fed is deep in preparation for a rate hike this year, but she hinted such a move would not come before June.\n\n\"Yellen was decidedly noncommittal to the idea of a rate hike around the middle of the year,\" Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at the currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, told Bloomberg News.\n\n\"The reaction of the market is weaker dollar, lower yields, higher equities - the classic reaction you'd see from a slightly dovish Fed.\"\n\nSpeculation has been rising over when the US central bank would pull the trigger on a rate hike, amid growing optimism over the state of the US economy.\n\nBut Ms Yellen said the labour market still showed cyclical weakness and inflation continued to slow, adding that uncertainty over China and Europe posed a risk for the world's top economy, supporting the need to keep loose monetary policy in place a bit longer.\n\n\"A high degree of policy accommodation remains appropriate,\" Ms Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee.\n\nWall Street embraced the comments with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broader S&P 500 both closing at record highs.\n\nEuropean stocks also rose strongly, with a record close in London, as eurozone finance chiefs backed a four-month extension of Greece's bailout.\n\nDespite reservations expressed by the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank over the plan, eurozone ministers signed off on promised reforms which Greece's new left-wing government submitted to meet a demand made by its international creditors at 11th-hour talks last week.\n\nSeveral parliaments, including Germany's, must now approve the extension before the current bailout expires on Saturday, while key details will be hammered out in the coming weeks.\n\nThe euro held steady in Asian trading at US$1.1347 and 134.68 yen, against US$1.1342 and 134.90 yen in New York.\n\nMs Yellen's rate-hike comments helped push the dollar down to 118.69 yen against 118.94 yen in US trade.\n\nOil prices were flat ahead of the release of a key US energy inventory report and as dealers digested President Barack Obama's decision to veto the construction of a key oil pipeline between the US and Canada, analysts said.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose one cent to US$49.29 while Brent crude gained 25 cents to US$58.91 in mid-morning trade.\n\nGold fetched US$1,209.81 an ounce against US$1,198.59 late Tuesday.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCapital Markets & Currencies\n\nFrasers Hospitality Trust\u2019s proposed privatisation by sponsor gets SGX in-principle approval\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 AM\n\nStocks to watch: OCBC, SGX, Centurion, Sats, Frasers Property, Frasers Hospitality Trust\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:39 AM\n\nAims Financial Group raises stake in Aims Apac Reit to 18.7%\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:35 AM\n\nUS dollar has best week since February on tariff inflation risks\n\nJul 12, 2025 11:52 AM\n\nEurope: Stocks down with bank and healthcare drag, US-EU tariffs in focus\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:56 AM\n\nUS: Stocks edge down from records amid tariff threats\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:45 AM\n\nSingapore stocks notch 5-day rally ahead of GDP data\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:06 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM", "images": []}

The balance is expected to be obtained shortly and the convention will enter into force 12 months thereafter.\"\n\nIt is estimated that some 57,000 ships will need to comply. Assuming a maximum of 40 ships can be retrofitted a day, it will take nearly four years for all the retrofitting to be completed. That is quite some assumption and an awful lot of work.\n\nAccording to UK Club, experts have estimated that the whole process from selecting a BWM system to installing the system takes from a minimum of six months up to a year. But Ms Tan says: \"Worryingly, we are aware that a number of shipowners have yet to take even the first steps towards complying with this convention.\n\n\"As spaces in the major shipyards are already all booked up, there is a real possibility of serious bottlenecks occurring. Ships that fail to comply on time will face serious commercial disadvantages, as their trading limits will be severely restricted.\"\n\nThis could be bad news for shipowners who have not put plans in place to fit BWM systems but could be something of a bonanza for equipment suppliers and shipyards, worldwide and in Singapore\n\nIt might also, at least according to one major shipping accountant, be a signal for private equity to move into the ship equipment sector in a big way.\n\nInternational accountant and shipping adviser Moore Stephens says that the time is right for shipping to seek financial backing from the private equity sector to help fund investment in innovative products and services designed to keep the industry competitive and achieve regulatory compliance.\n\nAlison Jarabo of maritime efficiency specialist Fathom Shipping told the recent Moore Stephens Opportunities in Shipping Services seminar in London that regulation and the need to control costs were the two main factors driving the growth of technology in the shipping industry. She identified scrubber technology, ballast water treatment systems and ship performance management systems as some of the main technology opportunities in the industry today.\n\nShe asserted, however, that, \"technology and innovation may abound but, without end-users able to access the finance to deploy, the market will fail\".\n\nMs Jarabo is on the right track concerning the opportunities now emerging but the ballast water regulations will have to be complied with and the economic case for fitting scrubbers to allow operation in Emission Control Areas is becoming stronger all of the time. These two markets, at least, cannot fail. The money will be forthcoming.\n\nGOOD MATCH\n\nMoore Stephens shipping partner Richard Greiner says: \"The shipping services market is currently attracting a lot of interest from private equity, not least because it is a highly fragmented sector with a wide range of business sizes. It is providing services to a tightly regulated industry in which a large number of developments are taking place. Private equity investors who have a firm grasp on the potential risks and rewards available in today's shipping services sector could be a good match for well-founded shipping services and technology providers who have a clearly identified market for their products. Indeed, it could be argued that recent developments have created something of a perfect storm to bring the two together.'\n\nIt is always dangerous making predictions but the need to meet new regulation makes it inevitable that owners are going to have to dig into their pockets while yards will, for a while, find it hard to keep up with the surge in demand for BWM and scrubber retrofits. Boom times do not last forever but we must be entering a busy period set to last a number of years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, exports remain stalled and domestic consumption subdued, while government plans to spend heavily on infrastructure projects have not gotten on track.\n\nExports, which equal more than 60 per cent of gross domestic product, dropped 3.46 per cent in January from a year earlier, the Commerce Ministry said on Wednesday.\n\nThat was worse than the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll, in which the median number was an increase of 2.55 per cent. January's fall was the biggest since August.\n\nIn December, exports rose 1.9 per cent from a year earlier and imports were down 8.7 percent.\n\nThe ministry said exports to China dropped 20 per cent and those to Japan were off 7.5 per cent. It blamed the drop mainly on weak prices for agricultural exports, especially rubber, which fell 41 per cent.\n\nThai exports were weak even before political tensions rose in late 2013, hurting tourism, consumption and the overall economy. Exports fell in both 2013 and 2014, a big obstacle to economic recovery.\n\nJanuary was the fourth straight month in which imports dropped. Many imported materials are assembled into completed goods and shipped out again. Last year, they tumbled 9 per cent.\n\nWith exports and domestic demand poor, economic growth last year was only 0.7 per cent, the weakest since flood-hit 2011. For this year, the central bank sees GDP growing 4 per cent and exports only 1 per cent.\n\nToranee Chiochan, managing director at Sun Expo Services, an exhibition and machinery logistics company that's involved in trade, said this year \"we will have to hold our breath.

Certainly though, neither group has had the exposure to private banking - in some cases dating back centuries - common among many wealthy families in Europe.\n\nMost research still suggests that Asia's wealthy are more hands-on in managing their wealth than HNWIs in Europe. The concept of choosing and, more to the point, trusting a private bank is relatively new in Asia where, statistically, clients are still twice as likely as Europeans to \"spread the risk\" by maintaining relationships with three or more banks.\n\nSo with a lot of Asia's money relatively new, how relevant is the heritage of private banks like mine and many others? After all, sentiment isn't reflected on the balance sheet or assets under management (AUM).\n\nYes, what matters most are performance, watertight governance and compliance and, in private banking in particular, the quality of a bank's relationship managers. Never mind how good he might have been, a banker who died a century ago can't offer a client much in the way of advice today.\n\nYet there's a reason why, I believe tradition, experience and integrity are increasingly resonating with the wealthy in Asia.\n\nIt's because the concept of private banking is arguably more intrinsic to Asian traditions - and the importance attached to generations past and future - than even in Europe where private banking was born.\n\nSome family clients of ours in Europe have been banking with us - and more importantly investing their trust with us - since the late 19th century. There are few industries in which that happens - and there can be few better examples of a successful customer relationship.\n\nIt's usually a mistake to generalise about Asian cultures but one commonality is the absolute commitment to the security and future of the family; it's part of a social fabric that is tailored to the tenets of private banking - and vice-versa; private banking is about bespoke responses to personal and family and even corporate aspirations.\n\nThe growth of private banking in Asia is dovetailing with changing attitudes to wealth management. Many HNWIs in the region have now accepted the value of external advice and perspective and the importance of longer-term planning - eschewing their previous hands-on, \"play the market\" approach. Successive Asian and global financial crises were, no doubt, part of that shift in strategy and mindset.\n\nStudies in China have supported this notion of a change in investment behaviour. Several years ago, the principal wealth management objective cited by Chinese HNWIs in a Bain & Co study was \"wealth creation\". Fast forward to a more recent Bain \"China Private Wealth Report\" and that's now only the fourth priority: The top three are \"wealth preservation\" (including inheritance), \"quality of life\" and \"children's education\".\n\nWhile that study addressed only one market, the same pattern is clearly emerging elsewhere. The goals are longer-term and oriented towards future generations. That sounds rather familiar if, like me, you're working for a bank that's been around for a very long time.\n\nThe fact is we're now having the kind of conversations with Asian clients on subjects such as legacy and succession - once almost taboo outside the family - that we've been having with European clients for more than a century.\n\nYou could argue that we will only be able to say that acceptance of the European private banking model - sensitive, of course, to regional cultures and nuances - has been achieved in Asia when we can point to managing the wealth of a family from generation to generation.\n\nBut it's clear from the conversations our relationship managers are now having with clients on deeply personal issues - and even from the fee-based discretionary mandate many Asian clients now favour - that there is a growing demand for private banks who can earn, retain and grow trust over many, many years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The final generation could even talk.\n\nBy 2006, Sony was in trouble; its business model was broken and it was facing fierce competition from rivals in all fields. The AIBO, an expensive and somewhat frivolous luxury, had to go.\n\nThe company kept its \"AIBO Clinic\" open until March 2014, but then - politely - told dedicated and loving owners that they were on their own.\n\nFor Hideko Mori, 70, that nearly spelled disaster. Ms Mori has had her AIBO for around eight years. She enjoys the conversations she has with it, and thinks it far more convenient than a real puppy.\n\n\"He doesn't require feeding and he doesn't pee... actually he does pee by cocking his leg, making an indescribably beautiful tinkling sound.\" But, she said, nothing actually comes out.\n\n\"I never thought there was a limit to his life.\" But in May last year her beloved AIBO, whose name is simply \"Aibo\", became immobile.\n\n\"I e-mailed a former Sony worker (on behalf of the dog), saying: 'Do I have no choice but to die like this because I can't walk?',\" she said.\n\nThe engineer introduced her to A FUN, a company that employs former Sony engineers, who fixed her machine in two months.\n\n\"I was so happy to see him back to health and at home,\" she said.\n\nHiroshi Funabashi, 61, who supervises repairs at A FUN, said troubled AIBO owners think of him more as a doctor than an engineer.\n\n\"The word 'repair' doesn't fit here,\" he told AFP at his home in Kasama, north of Tokyo. Scattered around him are dozens of AIBOs sent in with problems owners typically describe as \"aching joints\".\n\n\"For those who keep AIBOs, they are nothing like home appliances. It's obvious they think their (robotic pet) is a family member,\" he said.\n\nFunabashi says he does not enhance the functions of aged AIBOs, but tries to restore them to health.\n\nThe problem is that repairs can take weeks or even months because of a shortage of spare parts. Dozens of AIBOs are now \"hospitalised\", with more than 180 on the waiting list.\n\nThe only source of genuine parts are \"dead\" robots, who become donors for organ transplantation, but only once the proper respects have been paid.\n\nBungen Oi, a priest at the 450-year-old Kofukuji temple in Isumi, east of Tokyo, says the AIBO service last month was an occasion on which the robots' souls could pass from their bodies.\n\n\"I was thrilled over the interesting mismatch of giving cutting-edge technology a memorial service in a very conventional manner,\" he said.\n\nIt is a mismatch that humans will probably become more used to over the coming years and decades, as robots with \"personalities\" become ever more part of our lives.\n\nLater this year, Japanese telecoms giant Softbank says it is going to start selling the humanoid Pepper to the public.\n\nDespite the US$2,000 cost, Pepper will be useless for housework, but developers say it will learn to imitate and intuit human emotions over time.\n\nThis blurring of lines means more people could feel the kind of attachment that AIBO owners know so well, said A FUN's Funabashi.\n\n\"I don't know if people will develop affection (towards a new generation of robots) in five, six years' time,\" he said. \"But I think we need to recognise they are not ordinary electrical devices.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/year-widen-your-investment-horizons", "site_title": "A year to widen your investment horizons", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA year to widen your investment horizons\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 24, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nPrivate banking\n\nFollow\n\n2015 IS shaping up to be quite a volatile year for financial markets. Oil prices ploughed new lows after losing more than half of their value since June 2014; multi-year-low commodity prices, besides excess productive capacity and sluggish demand, have driven consumer inflation below 0 per cent in Europe. Meanwhile, political uncertainty has increased in Europe with a far-left party assuming power in Greece with a mandate to renegotiate the country's debt.\n\nDespite all this uncertainty, we remain relatively constructive on global economic growth and asset prices. The US economy is expected to accelerate in 2015 as the unusually harsh winter seen in Q1 2014 is unlikely to be repeated, while a strong job market fuels a consumer demand-driven expansion.\n\nEurope and Japan are also likely to post slightly stronger growth on the back of record low borrowing costs and weaker currencies. The main growth concern is in China, which we expect to decelerate somewhat. However, this means that the authorities in Beijing are focused on much-needed reforms to turn the world's second-largest economy from an export and investment-driven engine to one powered by domestic consumption. And that naturally represents a trade-off between short-term and long-term growth.\n\nMeanwhile, the decline in oil prices should be a net benefit for the world economy - lower energy costs boost disposable income of households, increase corporate profits and keep inflation relatively benign. Low inflation is allowing central banks to loosen monetary policy - more than a dozen have cut rates so far this year alone! Central bank action is helping to keep borrowing costs low for both consumers and companies. Loose monetary policies are, in turn, investors' best friends in relatively riskier assets such as stocks and higher-yielding bonds.\n\nHowever, let's be clear - it's not going to be as easy a ride as the past six years, during which global stocks have more than doubled. Indeed, 2015 is likely to see traditional asset classes generate lower investment returns than in recent years. Bond yields have discounted a lot of disinflationary pressures, which means any upside surprise on the growth/inflation front could undermine bond returns as well. Also, the first Fed rate hike of the cycle - expected sometime in the middle of the year - is normally a period associated with increased market volatility.\n\nWe do not think this is something to be too concerned about. The Fed is expected to raise rates only because the US economy has recovered significantly from the financial crisis of 2008-09. Indeed, US employers hired more workers in 2014 than in any year since 1999. The good news is that the Fed looks keen to err on the side of caution. Therefore, any rise in interest rates is likely to be gradual and well-signalled.\n\nThus, we do not believe that we are near the end of the developed market-led bull rally in stocks. History teaches us that equity markets usually rise well into a rate hiking cycle - usually until the Fed's focus shifts from supporting growth to combating inflation. We believe this transition is some quarters away. It is likely to be a 2016, or even 2017, topic rather than a 2015 issue.\n\nHowever, lower returns and higher volatility will make investment gains feel much harder to achieve. It is against this backdrop that we believe investors need to widen their investment horizons to areas less travelled. A more conventional approach would be to buy developed market and Asian stocks on dips, a strategy we expect to remain profitable in 2015. It also includes investments in a basket of income generating assets - such as high dividend paying stocks and some Asian local currency bond markets such as China and India. Finally, there are many alternative strategies (such as employing a \"covered call\" strategy) that we believe will generate a good risk-return profile in 2015, relative to the more traditional asset classes. However, this would require professional investment advice.\n\nOverall, we remain constructive on risk assets, despite the ongoing volatility and the likelihood of the Fed hiking interest rates for the first time since 2006. However, we would recommend investors consider complementing global equity investments with less traditional sources of returns.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/finding-right-balance-0", "site_title": "Finding the right balance", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFinding the right balance\n\nWhen assisting clients in shaping the overall risk profile of their investment portfolios, private banks need to be prudent in using investment leverage and derivative solutions as these are not without pitfalls.\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 24, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nDBS\n\nFollow\n\nFOR quite some time now, investment leverage and derivative solutions have been pervasive features of investment portfolios of private banking clients. The investment thesis underpinning these developments is irrefutable: investment leverage and derivative solutions are tools that assist clients in shaping the overall risk profile of their investment portfolios. They make it easier for clients to execute portfolios that more closely reflect their risk appetites, allowing them to disaggregate and to defease specific risks. The use of investment leverage and derivative solutions, however, is not without its pitfalls.\n\nPITFALLS\n\nThe common pitfalls of using investment leverage and derivative solutions include: (i) currency mismatches (ii) term mismatches and (iii) misuse of leverage. These pitfalls impede the construction of investment portfolios and customer balance sheets that would be resilient to economic and market shocks.\n\nCurrency mismatches can arise in many ways. Clients may acquire fixed assets and investment assets globally. They may use loans to buy properties in a foreign jurisdiction. At the same time, their operating businesses may have suppliers who expect payments in different currencies. Often times, there could be auxiliary reasons why loans may be denominated in currencies other than the denomination of the asset. For example, a client may use a Japanese yen-denominated loan to acquire a Hong Kong office building as a result of favourable financing. Or simply because the client has a dim view of a funding currency or wants to benefit from lower nominal interest rates.\n\nTerm mismatches usually occur when loans that reset or mature at a short horizon are taken to finance relatively illiquid assets or assets with fixed payouts. Under such scenarios, it is possible that interest rates may spiral higher and income from the investment assets is insufficient to service the loan repayments.\n\nRelative to currency and term mismatches, the risk of misuse of leverage is more familiar to most. Investment leverage can be a useful servant in the quest for enhanced returns, but it can also be a cruel master when the investment environment sours. No matter how rosy the outlook, the best investment thesis can be defeated by forced exits arising from transitory valuation changes before the investment thesis has had a chance to exert itself to produce returns.\n\nGiven the pitfalls highlighted above, clients should consciously review and identify the imbalances in their balance sheets and investment portfolios with the help of their private banks. This is especially relevant in today's environment of low nominal interest rates as heightened volatility of exchange rates could easily impede the generation of significant returns on investment portfolios. Similarly, for clients who could be adversely exposed to rising interest rates, management of liquidity and interest rate exposures through liability management or the use of derivative hedging strategies has become a critical issue for their overall financial well-being.\n\nFUNDAMENTAL TENETS\n\nTo successfully help clients navigate a turbulent investing environment, private banks need to adhere to the fundamental tenets of KYC (Know Your Client), account planning and prudence in advising clients on balance sheet construction and liability management, even as they focus on helping clients generate attractive returns on investment portfolios.\n\nAccount planning starts with relationship managers spending considerable time to know and understand clients' risk appetites, investment objectives, life plans and liquidity requirements, so that investment solutions are both relevant and encompassing. Building up trust and increasing the depth of understanding of a client's global investment and business activities take time and effort on both sides. Sometimes a private bank's relationship with a client starts off from a satellite portfolio of relatively concentrated financial investments only, with the investment assets subject to the private bank's advisory being a fraction of the client's entire net worth. This poses a challenge for relationship managers, but is a reality that needs to be carefully navigated in today's competitive environment.\n\nIn cases where it is not possible to construct a holistic picture of a client's mismatches for their private investments and operating businesses, the approach to take is to avoid inadvertently creating balance sheet imbalances. When implementing derivative solutions, private banks need to put in place a multi-step quality assurance process before a new derivative solution is launched. Besides the standard investment thesis formation, basis mismatches and leverage need to be explicitly considered. Private banks need to closely review critical terms of embedded derivatives, so that the payoff structure expresses fully the specific investment thesis. A comprehensive risk classification methodology should also be applied in customer selection. These steps help to ensure that the derivative solutions are specific to the investment thesis and are delivered to customers with the risk appetites to accommodate the risk profile of the solution.\n\nPrudence, in essence, means that clients are advised to assess their risks against their goals and to retain a \"margin of safety\" such that the market value of their investment portfolio is always in excess of the loan outstanding as determined by the loanable value, also known as the collateral value, set by the banks. This is otherwise known as collateral adequacy.\n\nCollateral adequacy is a function of risk commensurability: investment portfolios which are highly concentrated, less liquid or are expected to be more volatile will be accorded a lower financing quantum. Collateral adequacy also takes cognisance of the multi-currency nature of clients' investment portfolios, as currency movements can affect the valuation of assets in the client's reference currency. Hence, a client may make use of margin facilities to put on currency derivatives hedges to protect the value of his/her investment portfolio. In calculating and monitoring the margin requirements of the client, it is thus necessary to take into account up-to-date valuations of currency derivatives and on the underlying assets. These three steps of collateral adequacy, risk commensurability and regular currency translations often result in an iterative and customised process that needs to be agreed among client advisers, risk managers and clients. It is challenging to manage, but the outcome can be rewarding.\n\nOften, clients see collateral adequacy as the means by which banks employ to protect themselves. However, in reality, the prudent use of leverage aligns the interests of the clients and the banks in helping to ensure the resilience of investment portfolios.

That we trust. Respect. And love,\" the magazine said.\n\n\"They also happen to score high in our reliability ratings and shine in automotive crash tests.\"\n\nThe US$80,000-plus plug-in Tesla again captured the magazine's fancy as its overall top pick, and not just for the car's market-beating 426km range without a charge.\n\nConsumer Reports praised the ability to update the Tesla's software over the Internet, and that the company surmounted early technical problems, including a handful of fires that started from objects on the road surface kicking into its underside battery pack.\n\nWith those problems aside, Consumer Reports lauded the Tesla S's \"magnificence and sheer technological arrogance.\"\n\nSubaru, whose all-wheel-drive models are popular with both sport driving fans and outdoorists, led three categories of the 10.\n\nThe Impreza led the compact car group as a \"strong value,\" and the Legacy was the best midsized sedan (it \"exceeds those drab, rental-car expectations... also has the best ride among its peers\").\n\nAnd the Forester grabbed one of the hottest market segments, the small sport-utility vehicles.\n\n\"Subaru has nailed the recipe of combining practicality, safety, fuel economy, value, and interior accommodations,\" said the magazine.\n\nThe Audi A6 came in tops for a luxury car, and, unsurprisingly, on the green car side Toyota's hybrid Prius took the honours for the 12th straight year.\n\nToyota's Highlander was best mid-sized SUV and the Honda Odyssey the winner among minivans.\n\nBut the surprise was the inclusion of the Chevrolet Impala as the best large car, beating out the Toyota Avalon and Lexus ES 350.\n\nOnly slightly less surprising was the Buick Regal as the leading sports sedan.

More than one million of the city's seven million people live below the poverty line.\n\nOne-off measures could include a salaries tax rebate, a waiver on property rates, raising the tax allowance for parents from HK$70,000 (S$12,250) to HK$80,000 per child and policies to support industries affected by the protests, according to local media.\n\nMr Tsang is also expected to dish out sweeteners worth more than HK$20 billion in the budget, local media reported.\n\nHong Kong, which has a minimum wage of HK$32.50 per hour, has handed out billions in previous years, although Wednesday's budget is not expected to reveal any major initiatives, given the uncertain economic outlook.\n\nThe former British colony's fortunes are closely tied to mainland China, where the economy grew at its slowest pace in 24 years in 2014 as property prices cooled and companies and local governments struggled under heavy debt burdens.\n\nMr Tsang is expected to announce a budget surplus of at least HK$60 billion for the financial year ending March 31, according to accounting firms Deloitte and KPMG, handily beating the government's forecast for a HK$9.1 billion surplus.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM\n\nSouth Korea says framework US trade deal possible by August, farm market access on table\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:55 AM\n\nAI is already showing signs of slashing job openings in the UK\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:30 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM", "images": []}

In Asia, UBS and Credit Suisse were respectively ranked number one and three largest private banks in 2013.\n\nUBS, the largest global wealth manager in Q4, saw its Asia-Pacific AUM rise 51-269 billion Swiss francs (S$73-386 billion), or grow 23.3 per cent, more than double the 11 per cent gain in 2013. Net new money for the Asia-Pacific in Q4 at five billion Swiss francs was a 7.8 per cent growth year-on-year.\n\nAsia-Pacific net new money inflows for full year 2014 at 26.8 billion Swiss francs was the highest from the region since 2007 and represented 78 per cent of the group's 34.4 billion Swiss francs of net new money.\n\nEdmund Koh, head of South-east Asia and APAC Hub, Wealth Management, UBS, said that the bank's success in attracting net new money is due to a number of hallmarks that are difficult to replicate.\n\n\"We have a strong brand and track record in serving Asian clients, with 50 years in the Asia-Pacific,\" he said. \"UBS has one of the most extensive product platforms, which provides our clients with research-based advisory solutions.\"\n\nIt has 900 analysts, strategists and fund managers covering every major geography, sector and asset class around the world. \"We have a network of many tens of thousands of clients, with the experience that comes with servicing these clients,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nUBS is also a top investment bank in the region, particularly in the areas that are crucial for wealth management, such as corporate client solutions and equities, he added.\n\nIn March last year, the bank introduced UBS Advice, which monitors client portfolios against their chosen investment strategy and the UBS house view. Clients are alerted of matching opportunities and risks, but have full control and discretion over their investment decisions, within a simple, flat-fee structure.\n\n\"Demand has been strong. Since its launch in March 2014 in Hong Kong and Singapore, the platform had secured over one billion Swiss francs AUM from Asian clients,\" said Mr Koh. UBS has 1,186 client advisers and more than 2,500 staff in wealth management in the Asia-Pacific, making it the largest team of any private bank in the region, he said. Last year, it added more than 200 front staff.\n\nCredit Suisse private banking's Asia-Pacific business had a record-breaking year in 2014, with net new assets at a historical high of 17.3 billion Swiss francs, up 50 per cent, said its head Francesco de Ferrari.\n\nThe region's AUM rose to 143.5 billion Swiss francs, a gain of 24 per cent, while the number of relationship managers reached 490 compared to 440 at the end of 2013, as the bank continues to attract, in particular, senior bankers, said Mr de Ferrari.\n\nCredit Suiss also has an integrated private banking platform to deliver wealth management and investment banking solutions to clients.\n\n\"The cross-divisional 'collaboration revenues' we generated by providing investment banking solutions to ultra high net worth (UHNW) private banking clients increased by 20 per cent year-on-year in 2014, and more than tripled in the past three years,\" he said.\n\nCiti Private Bank, the third largest in Asia, said that its AUM rose 7 per cent to US$255 billion in 2014.\n\nJessica Poh, Citi Private Bank global markets manager - Asean region, said that last year, the industry faced increased regulatory expectations.\n\n\"However, we view these changes to be positive to the industry overall and necessary to safeguard Singapore as a reputable and safe wealth management centre,\" said Ms Poh. \"Internally, we have undertaken initiatives to further enhance our controls and refine our processes.\"\n\n\"At the macro level, the uneven growth in the global economy and increased market volatility resulted in clients taking a more cautious approach on their investments,\" said Ms Poh. Also growing its AUM in single digit last year was Barclays. The bank did not disclose actual 2014 AUMs as it will only report full year results next month.\n\nStill the UK-based bank is committed to the wealth management business in Asia and over the next five years. It aims to more than double AUMs and will be looking to hire 25 per cent more bankers in 2015 to support its ambitions, said Didier von Daeniken, head of wealth management, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, Barclays.\n\nBarclays's 2013 AUM in Asia was USD$36.5 billion and it currently has about 100 private bankers in Singapore and Hong Kong. Singapore's domestic private banks enjoyed double digit AUM growth in 2014.\n\n2014 was a milestone year for DBS Private Bank, as it completed its first merger with the acquisition of Societe Generale Private Banking Asia (SGPB).\n\nAUM for high net worth clients increased by 34 per cent year-on-year to reach S$91.6 billion, at end 2014, said Tan Su Shan, DBS group head of consumer banking and wealth management.\n\n\"With the acquisition, we transferred about US$10 billion in AUM and the majority of SGPB staff - including more than 80 per cent of front office employees - to DBS,\" said Ms Tan.\n\nAs part of the DBS group - South-east Asia's biggest bank - it meant the private bank often had a front row seat in helping clients access equity and fixed income deals.\n\n\"Our expertise and leadership in the equity and debt capital markets in Singapore has allowed us to provide clients with access to a record number of equity and bond IPOs in 2014,\" said Ms Tan.\n\n\"We were also able to provide more than 20 clients the opportunity to participate as cornerstone or anchor investors in several IPOs, and obtain preferred allocations.\"\n\nOn the trend towards domestic banks, Ms Tan said that for UHNW clients, \"the offshore banking proposition will always hold some appeal, as a way of diversification and access to global markets\".\n\nBank of Singapore, the private bank unit of OCBC Bank, saw its 2014 AUM grow to US$51 billion, up 11 per cent and more than double the AUM recorded when it first started operations in January 2010.\n\nNet new money was US$5 billion as at Dec 31, 2014, said Bahren Shaari, chief executive of Bank of Singapore.\n\n\"We maintained our strong performance in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, further strengthening our position as Asia's global private bank,\" he said. Its discretionary portfolios, a much sought-after core investment among clients, accounted for 7 per cent of total AUM, said Mr Shaari.\n\n\"Overall, our mandates have consistently posted returns of more than 6 per cent annually,\" he said. \"The total AUM of our discretionary portfolios rose 15 per cent from a year ago, having risen more than six-fold since 2010.\"\n\nTotal staff strength increased 11 per cent to almost 1,330, said Mr Shaari.\n\nSingapore's United Overseas Bank (UOB) last year brought in a new management bank for its private bank business.\n\n\"This year, we will be focusing on strengthening two important pillars of our business - people and investment solutions,\" said Ong Yeng Fang, head of private banking, UOB.\n\nShe did not disclose UOB's private bank AUM. UOB's wealth management AUM, which includes that of the private bank business, grew from S$48 billion to S$80 billion between 2010 and 2014.\n\n\"Wealth management's profit contribution to our retail business increased from 24 per cent in 2010 to 47 per cent in 2014,\" she said. As for the investment outlook in 2015, volatility and an uncertain macro environment represents opportunity, said bankers.\n\nABN AMRO Private Bank said that diversification is key as markets face greater volatility this year.\n\n\"This, however, should not be seen as a threat but an opportunity to enter the market,\" Hans Hanegraaf, ABN Amro chief executive private banking Asia & Middle East said.\n\nOverall, the bank is overweight on equities, particularly on the European and Asian emerging markets, as accelerated economic growth, lower energy prices and a strengthening US dollar would support earnings.\n\n\"Within Asia, we are favourable towards the equity markets in China, India and Indonesia,\" he said.\n\nABN Amro is bullish on Asia emerging market currencies, which are better placed for the expected increase in US interest rates this year. Some currencies, such as the Singapore dollar, have emerged as safe haven assets, rising after the conflict between Russia and Ukraine erupted.\n\n\"We see that the drop in energy prices is boosting global growth and reinforcing strong US consumption,\" said Arnaud Tellier, chief executive of BNP Paribas Wealth Management, Singapore.\n\n\"The latter is producing positive second round effects, such as increased demand for Asia's exports. As a consequence, there is now a debate in financial markets about how soon the US will be hiking interest rates - but the key message is that monetary conditions will normalise only very slowly,\" said Mr Tellier.\n\n\"In this environment of increased volatility, we see ample opportunities to generate handsome returns this year, ultimately backstopped by accommodative monetary conditions and low energy prices.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

The fall in consumer confidence over the month of February was fairly broad based, though the outsized fall in the assessment of personal finances over the next 12 months stands out, and continues to point to reticence as the most likely consumer behaviour going forward.\"\n\nAccording to its findings, 27 per cent (down 2 ppts) of respondents said their families are better off financially than a year ago, compared to 11 per cent (up 1 ppt) who said they are worse off.\n\nIn addition, 29 per cent (down 5 ppts) of respondents said they expect their families to be better off financially in a year's time, compared to 8 per cent (up 1 ppt) who expect their families to be worse off.\n\nMr Maguire said these answers are \"sombre\", showing that less than a third of households surveyed believe that their personal financial situation is better now or that it will improve this year.\n\nPolled on economic conditions in Singapore over the next 12 months, 44 per cent of respondents (down 1 ppt) expect Singapore to do well; 12 per cent (down 3 ppt) expect the contrary.\n\nOver the longer term, 45 per cent (up 1 ppt) of respondents expect Singapore to perform well financially during the next five years; 11 per cent (up 1 ppt) expect the opposite.\n\nBoth invariably show that less than half of Singaporeans believe that they will see \"good times\" economically over the next 12 months or five years.\n\nNot surprisingly, the assessment of whether now is a good time to buy a major household item has fallen.\n\nOne in five (down 3 ppts) of respondents said now is a good time to buy, while 19 per cent (unchanged) disagreed.\n\n\"This continues to suggest to us that the overhang of supply-side restructuring is anchoring consumer confidence in a sombre state and it is difficult to turn optimistic on the outlook for consumer spending in Singapore till a larger number of households express confidence on either their own or Singapore's outlook,\" Mr Maguire said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The ratio for Noble was 0.15 per cent on Feb 13, the last trading day before an anonymous group calling itself Iceberg Research\n\nalleged accounting irregularities\n\nat the company and sent shares to the biggest two-day drop since 2011.\n\nNoble, which releases full-year earnings on Thursday, denied Iceberg's allegations and said directors and management are \"comfortable\" with the company's balance sheet. Traders are reticent to add bearish bets against Noble in part because shares are inexpensive, said Maybank Kim Eng Holdings Ltd. The stock is valued at 8.2 times estimated earnings, 34 per cent less than the five-year average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe Iceberg report didn't have \"enough meat to change institutional investors' view on the company,\" said Abhijit Attavar, an analyst at Jefferies Singapore Ltd. \"We continue to maintain our long-term positive stance on the company and any correction is a buying opportunity.\" Noble gained 0.9 per cent to S$1.07 as of 9.47 am in Singapore. The shares have dropped 12 per cent since the Iceberg report was published through Tuesday, reducing the company's market value by S$977 million (S$974 million). The benchmark Straits Times Index added 0.3 per cent in the same span.\n\nShort interest in Noble has held between less than 0.1 per cent and 0.2 per cent of outstanding shares on each trading day this year, according to Markit's data. Noble ranks 20th out of the 30 members.\n\nIceberg doesn't have any short positions in Noble securities and doesn't work in tandem with funds, it said in its report. The researcher's website contains no analyst names, phone numbers or links to research notes, apart from the 17-page report on Noble.\n\nNoble will post full-year net income of US$484.2 million on Thursday, according to the average of 13 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Its profit for the nine months through Sept 30 almost tripled from a year earlier to US$372 million, the company said in November.\n\n\"Investors should always look at the fundamentals and look at audited information,\" said Sam Le Cornu, who oversees about US$3 billion in Asian equities at Macquarie Funds Management in Hong Kong and does not hold any Noble shares. \"Fundamentals in the long run will always prevail. That's where people should focus their attention and not on negative reports.\"\n\nIceberg's report alleged that Noble's balance sheet inflated the value of stakes in other companies, including a 13 per cent interest in Yancoal Australia Ltd.\n\nDirectors and management are \"comfortable\" that the company's balance sheet \"fairly presents its book value\" under International Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong-based Noble said in a statement last week. The Monetary Authority of Singapore, or MAS, is reviewing the report on Noble and said it will take action if securities laws were breached.\n\n\"The market knows there's probably not much grounds to actively short it,\" said Carey Wong, an analyst at OCBC Investment Research in Singapore. \"Some of the issues raised by Iceberg were not new. So far, we haven't seen anything concrete to suggest that there's something very wrong.\" Learning Lessons Nicholas Teo, an analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, said short-sellers have been burned by previous negative reports on Asian companies after \"white knights\" stepped in to put a floor under the shares.\n\nIn 2012, Carson Block's Muddy Waters LLC spurred a tumble in shares of Noble's peer, Olam International Ltd, by questioning the commodity trader's accounts. Short interest in Olam reached an all-time high of 13 per cent of outstanding shares just before the Muddy Waters founder said he was betting against the company, according to Markit.\n\nTwo weeks later, Singapore's state-owned investment company underwrote a sale of bonds and warrants to bolster confidence in Olam, and a unit of Temasek Holdings Pte has since taken a controlling stake in the company. When China Minzhong Food Corp. was targeted by short seller Glaucus Research Group in 2013, PT Indofood Sukses Makmur offered to buy shares of the vegetable processor it didn't already own at more than double the prevailing market price. Both Olam and China Minzhong denied the allegations, saying assertions were motivated to create panic and drive down shares.\n\n\"Opened short positions are not as evident here in Noble as in the Olam case,\" Mr Teo said. \"This time round with Noble, the impact and sensation was perhaps a little more diluted because of history. Traders remembered being hurt.\" For Wei Bin, an analyst at Maybank Kim Eng in Singapore who has a hold rating on Noble, the stock is too cheap to attract much selling pressure as the company takes steps to improve its financial health.\n\n\"Noble is making some progress in terms of improving their cashflow and reducing their gearing,\" Mr Wei said. \"That's why the selling pressure on Noble is more muted.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:51 PM\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM", "images": []}

Many also share very similar characteristics that have made them successful entities in their own right. However, where some do not attain the standard they seek, there are some practical guidelines that can put them on the right path towards achieving more consistent investment outcomes.\n\nSCALE\n\nOne of the most significant mismatches in FO investing is in the allocation of investment resources. Why? FOs are called upon to manage diverse multi-asset portfolios, often with a minimum of staff, research services and technology. Demands are more pronounced when the family head wishes to make direct investments in venture capital, private equity or real estate. Hiring, motivating and retaining top investment talent is a challenge for even the largest global asset management firms. FOs need to field a team that can manage to family expectations or consider scaling back the scope of investing and possibly look at outsourcing.\n\nSELF-AWARENESS\n\nFOs are not immune to behavioural biases in investing, which can be further compounded by the long shadow of one or more influential family members. One fairly common FO behaviour is optimism bias - the mistaken belief that success in one endeavour objectively translates to other areas of life (and investing). FOs serve individuals who have experienced a significant measure of success in life, and such optimism may cloud investment decision-making. The objective is to identify and comprehend the role bias plays in investing. Ideally, such awareness fosters a culture of self-awareness and healthy challenging of ideas by investment staff and key family members.\n\nADVICE\n\nThe complexity of contemporary investing demands the use of both internal and external resources. This is particularly true of FOs that allocate capital to multiple asset classes, diverse geographies, or a large number of managers. In a desire to maintain confidentiality or avoid the onslaught of sales inquiries, FOs may shun all but a few key relationships. Such insular behaviour may unwittingly promote group-think and needlessly limit access to investment ideas, technology or useful advisers. Resources available to FOs come in many forms; private banks can provide access to useful investment research and offer access to powerful portfolio and risk analytics. Some are able to manage assets on a discretionary or advisory basis. A good initial step in opening up access to external resources is to determine where you may have information gaps or limited investment technology. The objective is the judicious use of third-party resources that allows FOs to gather a wide range of investment input, which can better inform investment decision-making, risk management and financial reporting.\n\nOVER-ALLOCATION\n\nFOs often find themselves over-allocated to a range of funds and fund types in an effort to achieve portfolio diversification. It is not uncommon to observe similar dollar investments in multiple managers, each of whom invests in broadly similar vintages, strategies and sectors, and often, have strong, positive correlations. One effect of over-allocation is to increase Beta exposure and diminish the impact that any one manager's Alpha contribution will have on performance. The result is often average or sub-par returns. FOs should aim for a well-researched thesis, backed up by sound manager screening, research and ongoing due diligence.\n\nLIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT\n\nThe first rule of FO investing is to always ensure you have sufficient portfolio liquidity. Unlike the predictable flows of foundations and endowments (which often serve as the model of institutional investing), families can be idiosyncratic and unpredictable when it comes to cash flow. A new home or aircraft, an unforeseen and compelling investment opportunity, or a severe market correction may precipitate the need for sudden, unexpected liquidity. \"Illiquidity risk\" should be discussed with the family in order to explicitly identify their expectations. The objective is to prepare a thoughtful family cash flow budget where possible; and consider having a credit facility in place that can easily (and inexpensively) be accessed if the family office needs to bridge liquidity gaps.\n\nBeing able to recognise many of these challenges within the FO is the foundation for continued improvement in both process, as well as investment, outcomes. In addition, collaboration with those with proven success, be it another FO or an established financial institution, can offer great value in the way of insight and assistance.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In it, he proposed a nuanced American response to a series of threats, ranging from the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East and the assertive Russian policy in Ukraine to climate change.\n\nMr Obama offered in the new document a direct retort to the policies advanced by former president George W Bush after the terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, which stressed the need for \"anticipatory\" military action against states and groups that pose a direct threat to US security. These principles helped justify the invasion of Iraq, a pre-emptive war of \"regime change\" that evolved into a strategic fiasco. The NSS document takes into consideration the changes that have occurred in the international system - the rise of new global powers and the emergence of a multi-polar international system as well as the pressure to reduce the defence budget and isolationist sentiments among Americans.\n\nHence, Mr Obama's call for a more restrained American approach in responding to global threats and in the use of military power abroad. Washington should deal with global crises with a sense of \"strategic patience\" and not rush to over-commit itself since many of the \"security problems we face don't lend themselves to quick and easy fixes\", he says. \"We must always resist the overreach that comes when we make decisions based upon fear.\"\n\nThe use of military power is not \"the only tool at our disposal, and it is not the principal means of US engagement abroad, nor always the most effective for the challenges we face\".\n\nThese arguments sound very reasonable, especially when one considers the high costs and failure of US military interventions and \"nation-building schemes\" pursued under Mr Bush. Indeed, it's time for more nuance and prudence in American foreign policy. But there is always the danger that too much nuance creates a sense of incoherence and that prudence leads to timidity.\n\nIndeed, Mr Obama's somewhat dismissive approach to the use of military force doesn't make much sense at a time when many of the threats confronting the global security system are military in nature: Russia's military aggression in Ukraine; China's growing military assertiveness vis-\u00e0-vis its neighbours; the military dangers posed by the ISIS; and Iran's determination to acquire a nuclear bomb.\n\nYes, the US should use military power only as a last resort after applying diplomacy and other peaceful means in responding to these and other threats. But Washington should also make it clear that it would be ready to use military force against aggressors in order to achieve its objectives. Mr Bush may have gone too far in trying to respond to aggression. But the danger is that Mr Obama's call for \"strategic patience\" would encourage aggressors to conclude that he would not be ready to do what is necessary to confront them.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/digitalising-new-era", "site_title": "Digitalising in the new era", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDigitalising in the new era\n\nTechnology is changing the way people consume financial services, and private banks have to reinvent themselves to capture this unique and lucrative opportunity.\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 24, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\ncredit suisse\n\nFollow\n\nTHE global shift in economic growth towards developing countries has caused a comparatively rapid increase in ultra-high net worth individuals in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America, including record assets managed in these regions.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow twice as fast as the global average in terms of millionaire wealth, and to achieve the highest level of ultra-high net worth wealth by the end of the decade.\n\nAlthough this wealth accumulation attracts private banks from across the world, many are challenged to scale their traditionally run operations and meet the growing demand in a profitable way. According to recent estimates, up to 80 per cent of millionaire wealth in the Asia-Pacific remains unbanked.\n\nClearly, this is a unique and lucrative opportunity for private banks - but we need to re-define ourselves to fit the new era environment, and address the needs of the new era clients in the world's most dynamic regions.\n\nThese needs have been transformed at their very core by the advancement of the Internet, as well as smartphone and tablet-based services and seamless online purchasing. Crucially, mobile devices connected to the Web are being increasingly used to access services and make purchases on the go. Among the most popular for the wealthy segments of the population are tablets, the demand for which grew faster in 2013 than for PCs at any point in history.\n\nSix of the largest market places in the world now belong to this intangible space called the digital market place. By 2016, the Internet economy will reach US$4.2 trillion in G-20 countries alone.\n\nDISRUPTIVE INNOVATION\n\nTechnology is transforming every business and the pace is increasing. The digital world is affecting every aspect of our business landscape - the size of the market, growth potential, profit generation capability, a new way of thinking about everything we do with data.\n\nThere is a shift of power taking place in many industries, where the power is moving from the service provider to the consumer.\n\nThis development has already had a very profound impact on our industry. For wealth management in the Asia-Pacific, the way people consume financial services has been radically influenced by the way that they consume any other service from any other Internet company, with their expectations elevated by their experience outside of the banking industry.\n\nBanking customers are increasingly using digital channels to contact their banks, execute trades and purchase financial products. The digital revolution has enabled numerous disruptive businesses on the periphery of the banking space to develop online-only financial services spanning from retail to wealth management and trading.\n\nNevertheless, there is a fair chance that most of today's start-ups will not be here in a few years' time, as the true winners of the innovation battle will be established players. The reason is simple, and yet powerful: banking is built on trust, which is a fundamental, irreplaceable value especially when it comes to one's wealth and savings. It is trust, along with security, that poses the biggest challenge for financial start-ups, as opposed to established banks with a strong capital basis, a franchise with tradition and history, far-reaching experience in dealing with sensitive data and most importantly, the capability to manage people's assets in a safe, conscious and well-informed way.\n\nPRIVATE BANK OF THE FUTURE\n\nClearly, making innovation a part of how banks go about their business is not a luxury, but a necessity. A recent survey shows that more than 80 per cent of high-net-worth individuals in the Asia-Pacific expect most or all of their wealth management relationship to be conducted through digital channels in five years, compared to around 60 per cent in the rest of the world.\n\nSuccessful banks of the future will focus their efforts on generating growth and while doing so, process, product and service innovation will be a crucial enabler. Banks that succeed in taking advantage of a digitalised business model will save substantial resources by increasing efficiency and enabling their business to focus on revenue generation.\n\nToday's banks are already becoming banks of the future. At Credit Suisse, we are reshaping our client offering by capturing the opportunities of the digital era and significantly improving our operational efficiency and profitability using digital solutions.\n\nClients' unrestricted access to the Internet and consequential commoditisation of basic information doesn't endanger our business - provided, we use it to our benefit.\n\nInstead, we enable and empower our clients to process an overload of data, and invite them to engage with us when it comes to complex decisions - that is the difference between an information provider and a trusted partner and client-centric adviser who can apply judgment and experience.\n\nIn fact, our comprehensive analysis tells us that the majority of our clients in Asia want to understand investment opportunities and trade-offs to validate with their relationship manager. They also think in the medium to long-term, relying on their bank to deliver customised, timely investment recommendations and they appreciate support in understanding global markets and refining their views and ideas. They want a digital service channel from the bank, and yet still value above all that \"human touch\" from the relationship manager.\n\nLooking at the client from the perspective of how they manage their wealth allows the bank to focus resources effectively on the most valued digital functionalities and offerings that generate true appreciation among clients.\n\nBanks capable of capturing the complexity of wealth management in an intelligent Web-based and user friendly way will benefit from a tremendous competitive advantage.\n\nA NEW SERVICE MODEL\n\nTechnology and digitalisation of private banking are critical not only to serve clients better but also enable relationship managers to become more productive.\n\nIt is not just about creating a tool that translates our usual work processes to the online world. It is essentially creating a new service model.\n\nIt curates information in a way that is unprecedented, creating a pull instead of just traditional push. It has far-reaching implications in terms of content management and curation of information for clients, and all these need to be embedded and enabled into the organisation, requiring us to rethink the way we work, our processes and tools.\n\nIn digitalising their services and offerings, private banks have to reinvent themselves and think in vastly different ways in terms of managing clients' onboarding and the whole life cycle of their wealth management needs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's up from as few as four in December.\n\n\"Ships are still arriving, and they need to get the whole machine going again,\" said Mr Louttit, whose nonprofit group provides information on ship traffic and helps guide vessels to berths. \"It's not automatic that congestion is going down just because they have an agreement.\"\n\nIt will take six to eight weeks for US West Coast ports to recover from the cargo backlog, according to the Port of Oakland and the National Retail Federation, which represents stores.\n\nThe Pacific Maritime Association and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union reached a deal on a five-year contract on Feb 20 after US Labor Secretary Tom Perez imposed a deadline to resolve the nine-month dispute. The labour strife had led to backups that left merchandise at sea and retailers and manufacturers sending products by air and diverting to ports on the East and Gulf Coasts.\n\nThe association, representing port management, reported that 2,557 longshore jobs were posted for the first shift on Monday at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, up from 230 during the equivalent shift a week earlier, when cargo operations were suspended for the President's Day holiday.\n\nUS retailers aren't yet seeing West Coast ports as a viable option and will continue to divert shipments elsewhere, said Jonathan Gold, vice-president of supply chain and customs policy at the retail federation, a Washington-based trade group representing stores and wholesalers. Port workers still have to ratify the agreement and the cargo backlog has yet to be cleared, he said. \"The need for a reliable and stable supply chain is priority No 1,\" he said. \"We've heard from a lot of members who were extremely frustrated throughout the entire process and are considering a full move to other ports to avoid the West Coast.\"\n\nRetailers are trying to get merchandise to stores \"so that a consumer doesn't see an empty store shelf\", Mr Gold said. Products including patio sets, barbecue grills, clothing and shoes slotted for spring sales are being affected, he said.\n\nNews of a tentative contract agreement also didn't bring much relief to AJ Khubani, chief executive officer and president of Telebrands Corp, which markets the PedEgg Power, Pocket Hose, Hurricane Spin Mop and other \"As Seen on TV\" products. Mr Khubani said his Fairfield, New Jersey-based company has incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in air freight fees, as well as additional costs for leaving containers at ports too long. Telebrands has lost about US$400,000 a day in sales since backups began in October, he said in a telephone interview.\n\nMeanwhile, work stoppages continued at the Port of Oakland, the fourth-busiest on the US West Coast, where most crane operators, who load and unload vessels, didn't show up on Monday because of a union meeting, said Michael Zampa, a port spokesman. The result was light traffic at most terminals and some cargo being prepared for shipment, with full operations to return in the evening, he said.\n\nWhile work there had resumed on Saturday night, operations were suspended for part of the day shift on Sunday over a break-time dispute between labour and management. A local arbitrator ruled the work stoppage by the longshoremen was illegal, the Pacific Maritime Association said in a statement. They returned to work on Sunday night, Mr Zampa said.

A temporary hire costs infinitely more\".\n\nFiat declined to comment.\n\nFCA said in January it planned to add more than 1,000 new workers at the Melfi plant thanks to strong sales of its new Jeep Renegade and Fiat 500X models. It also ended temporary layoffs at Melfi, allowing 5,418 employees to return to work full-time.\n\nFCA said at the time that these new workers, who would be hired on temporary agreements initially, could be offered the more secure contracts once demand for the models had stabilised, but did not give a specific timeframe.\n\nThe legislative decrees approved by cabinet last week ease firing restrictions for large private sector firms and aim to reduce the use of temporary contracts.\n\nItaly has one of the lowest labour participation rates in the euro zone and young people are hired almost exclusively on temporary contracts with few rights or labour protection.\n\nFCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has already expressed his approval of the measures at a news conference with Mr Renzi in Detroit. Mr Marchionne has been one of the most vocal critics of the laws, which have made it hard to lay off employees.\n\nBesides the Fiat 500X and Jeep Renegade, Melfi also produces the older Fiat Punto model.\n\nUnion sources said they were told by FCA that production of the Punto at Melfi would continue throughout this year, dismissing reports that the manufacturing of this model could either be stopped or moved elsewhere.\n\nThe sources also added that given positive demand for all the Melfi models, new hires at the plant would likely exceed the forecasts given in January.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/eyeing-asian-and-emerging-markets", "site_title": "Eyeing Asian and emerging markets", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEyeing Asian and emerging markets\n\nThey come with both opportunities and risks, but key factors for investors to note are Chinese policy, clarity on US Fed moves and the greenback's strength.\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 24, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nDeutsche Bank\n\nFollow\n\nTHE final quarter of last year witnessed another bout of underperformance in Asian and emerging equity markets versus global markets. Part of this was due to the strength in the US dollar and the impact of the fall in the oil price on oil producing emerging market countries.\n\nAs we expected, Asia ex-Japan outperformed Latin America and Eastern Europe, and Japan unhedged. Although Asia ex-Japan ended up flat in US dollar terms, there were good returns made in a few of our favourite markets, namely India, Indonesia and the Philippines. These returns were offset by negative returns in Japan unhedged, South Korea and Malaysia.\n\nWhat last year highlighted again is that country selection matters in Asian and emerging markets investing. One of the main reasons for this is that those countries who have reform agendas are seeing higher returns than those who don't.\n\nOne of the key questions that Asian and emerging market investors are asking themselves is when is the underperformance going to stop versus global markets. This underperformance started in October 2010 and has been largely a result of a slowdown in GDP growth, which has led to earnings downgrades and a fall in return on equity.\n\nOur view is that it is unlikely that the underperformance is going to be reversed initially this year. The continuing risk of Fed normalisation, further US dollar strength combined with the impact of the fall of oil prices and the medium term headwinds facing China, and lack of an Asian export growth pick up leave the risks too high to upgrade the asset class in the first part of the year.\n\nSo we remain neutral versus global equities. Within the Asian region, we continue to be positive on India, the Philippines and China, and still finding less opportunities in South Korea and Taiwan, and are less positive on Japan, Australia and Singapore. Within emerging markets, our preference is still for Asia over Latin America, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) on stronger fundamentals. Although we do think that at some point, the underperformance in the non-Asian areas will provide an opportunity to increase exposure at some stage later in the year.\n\nThe medium term investment case for India is still reasonably clear. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is laying down the foundations for a broad investment recovery.\n\nThe three key reforms are the land acquisition law, labour reform, and the introduction of a national goods and services tax. Although there is no sign at the moment that a revival is happening, the economy appears to have bottomed and project approvals have increased.\n\nAt the same time, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to continue to cut rates as inflation falls, which should lead to lower lending rates and a pick up in credit growth to help fuel economic growth. This is very positive and makes us constructive on both Indian bonds and equities in the medium term. Although most emerging market and Asian funds are overweight India in their portfolios, there is huge potential for a number of years of double digit gains driven by earnings recovery as the investment recovery takes place.\n\nThe buy case for China is trickier. The economy clearly slowed in 2014, and at certain times showed periods of stress in the property sector which is so crucial to overall growth. However we are more positive that the government will continue to relax policy to slow down the decline in the economy which should be positive for the stock markets. The People's Bank of China's rate cut in November was followed by increased confidence by local investors as witnessed in a sharp A-share rally. Fuelled by a huge increase in margin lending, this is leading to more interest in the H-share market. With a number of rate cuts and the lowering of the reserve-requirement ratio expected to combat weaker growth, we remain constructive on interest rate sensitives on a tactical basis. Medium term, the best Chinese growth story remains in the Internet area. We are still wary of large cap state-owned enterprises.\n\nFinally the Philippines remains, in our view, the best structural investment story in the smaller markets. Strong growth from the business process outsourcing sector and increasing remittances from overseas workers, supported by increased government investment going into a presidential election cycle should lead to another year of positive returns, and justifying its premium valuation.\n\nSo what do we need to upgrade Asia and emerging markets? A numbers of factors are key here. Chinese policy leading to a growth pick up in the second half of the year, more clarity on Fed policy, less US dollar strength, and most importantly a reversal of earnings downgrades across the asset class.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With inflation currently well below its 2 per cent target, divergences have opened on the BOE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) about when tightening should start.\n\n\"Our job as the MPC is to bring inflation back to the 2 per cent inflation target,\" Mr Carney said. \"We will do so within a reasonable horizon.\"\n\nFellow policymaker Martin Weale said that the benchmark rate may need to rise earlier than markets expect.\n\nThe pound strengthened to a seven-year high versus the euro after the comments. Sterling was little changed at 73.33 pence per euro at 11.20am London time after touching 73.17 pence, the strongest level since January 2008. Against the US dollar, the UK currency was down 0.1 per cent at US$1.5437.\n\nThe 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points to 1.81 per cent. Investors are fully pricing in a quarter-point interest rate increase by April 2016, forward Sonia contracts show. That assumes that the current five basis-point spread of daily Sonia fixings below the BOE benchmark rate returns to zero once policy tightening begins.\n\nAt its February meeting, the MPC's nine members voted unanimously to keep the benchmark rate unchanged at a record low 0.5 per cent. For two of its nine members, the decision was \"finely balanced\" and the outlook means that there may be a case to increase borrowing costs later this year.\n\nUK consumer price growth slowed to a record low 0.3 per cent in January. Mr Carney has previously said that it will drop below zero in the coming months, though the negative rate will be short-lived.\n\nFood and energy prices now account for three-quarters of the movement away from target, compared with two-thirds when the BOE published its Inflation Report in mid-February, Mr Carney told the Treasury Committee. It was more likely than not that borrowing costs would be higher at the end of the BOE's three-year forecast horizon, Mr Carney said.\n\nBOE policymaker Kristin Forbes said earlier on Tuesday that underlying inflation pressures are likely to increase, and that the next likely move will be an increase in rates. While keeping the benchmark unchanged is the right policy now, that will change as wages pick up and slack in the economy is eroded, she said in a speech in London.\n\nThat view was echoed by Mr Weale, who said in his annual report to the Treasury Committee on Tuesday that \"it may be appropriate to raise Bank Rate rather earlier than financial markets currently anticipate\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that the BOE should be ready to take further action to rein in riskier mortgage lending if stability risks emerge, including using its new powers to cap loans.\n\nAmong the BOE's options are lowering the percentage of high loan-to-income mortgages that banks can issue or broadening rules to include buy-to-let properties, the Paris-based group said in a report on Tuesday. It also welcomed the central bank's powers over loan-to-value ratios, saying that these \"appear effective\" in reducing mortgage growth and house-price inflation.\n\n\"Housing supply has not risen to meet demand,\" it said. \"In addition, house prices have increased rapidly and may create risks to financial stability in the case of a downward adjustment.\"\n\nThe recommendations were included in a 136-page report on the UK covering everything from the economic outlook to the budget and monetary policy. The OECD said that Britain is growing \"strongly\" and forecasts expansion of 2.6 per cent this year, driven by domestic demand.\n\nOn the financial industry, the OECD said that regulators should consider higher leverage ratios for globally systemic banks, while the BOE should look at extending stress tests to a larger number of financial institutions. In addition, the government should examine extending the BOE's oversight to institutions that have recently been given access to its liquidity facilities, the OECD said.\n\nFiscal policy has contributed to some pick-up in growth and the government should continue to pursue its medium-term budget consolidation, the group said.\n\n\"Fiscal tightening has been less of a headwind since 2012, which is estimated to have supported growth since 2013,\" the OECD said. \"Private consumption growth has been supported by a remarkable pace of job creation, low borrowing costs and stronger confidence.\"\n\nOn the economy, the OECD said that the key external risk to the UK is the euro area. It also said that BOE policymakers led by Mr Carney should \"look through temporary effects on inflation of weaker commodity prices and a stronger exchange rate\".

Weak investment returns, a shrinking workforce and longer life expectancy of retirees have left the pensions industry in Asia-Pacific (APAC) facing a growing funding gap.\n\nThese challenges are driving pension funds to strike a new balance on risk and return. A new State Street survey of 134 pension funds globally, conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit, found that 88 per cent of respondents based in APAC expect their institutions' investment risk appetite to increase over the next three years. This compares with 77 per cent of respondents globally.\n\nPension funds are undertaking a root-and-branch reassessment of their portfolios. They are looking to find the right mix of assets to drive higher returns, while also keeping costs under control and minimising their overall risk exposure. It is a delicate balancing act.\n\nThe big move into alternatives\n\nAlternatives traditionally made up just a small part of pension funds' portfolios compared with equities and fixed income products. Now pension funds intend to increase their exposure to alternatives, which are increasingly seen as an effective investment strategy for enhanced returns. The total global alternative assets under management by institutional investors reached US$5.7 trillion in 2013, according to research produced by Towers Watson.\n\nAccording to our survey, direct loans are the top alternative asset for pension funds in APAC, with three-fifths (60 per cent) of respondents planning to increase existing allocations. One tenth (10 per cent) of respondents intend to invest for the first time into this asset type (see chart).\n\nPension funds are increasingly becoming the alternative source of financing as banks rein in lending because of new capital requirement regulations. Private financing to companies typically provides attractive returns. Direct loans to infrastructure projects and lending to businesses for exports or mergers are increasingly popular among pension funds globally.\n\nAccording to the Fung Global Institute's working paper, pension funds in APAC can significantly contribute to capital market development. They can contribute to long term investments in growth sectors such as infrastructure, green technology, small and medium enterprise financing and social enterprises. This will reduce over-reliance on bank financing that is inherently subject to the risks of maturity mismatch.\n\nThe institute's findings show that the nine Asian countries with fairly developed pension systems had an estimated combined total of US$663 billion in private pension assets. The size of these assets will be growing in the coming years indicating the potential of pension funds to become leading institutional investors, the institute stated.\n\nIn our Asset Owners survey, a significant proportion of pension funds in APAC also intend to invest more in real estate (57 per cent) and single-manager hedge funds (57 per cent). Real estate is popular because as a long-term asset type that delivers returns over its life cycle, it matches well with pension funds' long-term liabilities.\n\nAPAC-based pensions are also targeting single-manager hedge funds for investment even as the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) decided in September 2014 to pull US$4 billion from its hedge fund investment programme - an announcement that sparked speculation that other pension funds might follow suit. But the general trend still looks positive for the hedge fund managers who are able to offer a reliable source of alpha returns.\n\nA new approach to risk management\n\nThe surge in investment into a range of alternatives has significant implications for the region's pension funds in terms of risk, operational efficiency, recruitment and measuring performance.\n\nUnderstanding how different combinations of alternative and traditional asset classes affect total risk exposure remains difficult. Many alternatives also require a different approach to risk modelling. Pension funds will need to factor these complexities into their calculations as they adopt a new risk budgeting model.\n\nThe ability to evaluate risk-weighted performance at multiple levels - from individual asset classes and instruments right up to a total fund perspective - will increasingly distinguish the leaders in the industry. Pension funds need to invest in analytics technology that can provide a coherent view of risk and performance across a multi-asset portfolio.\n\nAt the same time, far greater emphasis will need to be placed on strong data governance and ensuring better quality of data. To fully benefit from these improved tools and data, pension funds will need to bring in specialist skills.\n\nThe shift to alternatives is gathering pace. And pension funds in APAC must respond with new ways of allocating their risk budget if they are to achieve the right balance of risk and return across an increasingly complex mix of asset classes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But history has shown us that this investing principle does not always hold true.\n\nThe 1997 Asian financial crisis was a watershed for investors who believed that pursuing higher risk would lead to greater returns. Following the crisis, equity investors were faced with two decades of poor and volatile returns while fixed income investors generated better returns with lower risk. This has led to the rise of investment solutions that are oriented towards managing risk while generating more stable returns.\n\nIn today's environment where the appetite for risk can be conservative, we will explain three risk-driven investment concepts that investors need to be aware of and the potential pitfalls.\n\nI. VOLATILITY ANOMALY\n\nThe benchmark Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) suggests that expected returns are proportional to market risk. For example, to earn a higher return, one needs to undertake more risk and vice versa. While the theory is intuitive and elegant, empirical data from 1928 to 2003 has consistently pointed to the contrary: less volatile stocks delivered better risk-adjusted returns than more volatile stocks. This phenomenon has been shown by various academic studies to be robust across different time periods and geographies using various definitions of risk.\n\nThis phenomenon has also given rise to various investment products attempting to take advantage of this volatility anomaly, such as exchange traded funds. How does one explain the counterfactual outcome? A credible argument is leverage aversion theory, which argues that investors who are unable to leverage due to various constraints have to buy riskier stocks to raise the risk exposure of their portfolios. As a result, riskier stocks tend to be overvalued and deliver mediocre performance over time. Low volatility also helps in compounding returns over time by reducing impairment to long-term wealth.\n\nHowever, relying on historic data alone to devise an investment strategy is not the most useful. This strategy is similar to driving while only looking in the rear-view mirror. What is past may not manifest in the future. Investors should also note that low risk stocks usually cluster around a few sectors and the resulting portfolio may be poorly diversified. Importantly, investors need to understand the anomaly is still fairly immature. Not all low volatility products are the same and it is important to determine the underlying sources of returns. While a low volatility portfolio has its merits, it should not apply across an investor's entire portfolio.\n\nII. VOLATILITY TARGETING\n\nThe other concept that has gained some popularity is volatility targeting. This approach involves maintaining constant volatility for a portfolio. Take a multi-asset portfolio for instance. If the volatility rises for an asset class within the portfolio such as equities, the exposure to that asset class will be reduced accordingly such that the overall portfolio volatility is brought back to the preset target. One reason why volatility target strategies have done so well is that they exploit the \"leverage effect\" where asset prices have been observed to fall in rising volatility and vice versa. However, investors need to be aware of the specific conditions required for the strategy to be successful. Moreover, risk and correlations between different asset classes don't usually stay constant over time and measuring their changes over time is far from an accurate science so far.\n\nIII. Risk Parity\n\nThe concept of risk parity is to allocate equal risk to every asset class in a multi-asset portfolio. This could involve using borrowed funds to buy bonds to attain the risk quota. Risk parity was developed in response to the criticism that a traditional balanced portfolio has most of its risk coming from equities. This idea has intuitive appeal, especially when major financial crises have been associated with massive draw downs in the equity markets while the relatively safer bonds outperformed. However, investors need to be aware that the bull market in bonds has lasted for over three decades. While risk is an important part of portfolio construction, it is dangerous to leverage razor-thin risk premiums in asset classes just because their past volatility was low.\n\nAs in most data analysis, patterns arose due to specific conditions that prevailed in the past. It would be foolhardy to extrapolate past data without understanding underlying causes and presume they would persist.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Positions are being cut and pay frozen as some projects are delayed or canceled. The North Sea is one of the world's most expensive areas to extract reserves and is suffering from one of the steepest declines in output.\n\nActual job losses, which are \"extraordinarily difficult to estimate,\" depend partly on the signal the government sends to the companies it needs to invest in the region, Mr Wood said.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne will make the case for the UK in his annual budget March 18 after cutting a supplementary tax on the industry by 2 per cent in December.\n\n\"The net effect should be below 40 per cent to change the mind and mood of investment in the North Sea,\" said Mr Wood, whose review of the industry a year ago, including policies to promote development, was accepted in full by the government.\n\nMr Osborne seems certain to introduce basin-wide field allowances to spur investment in his budget, cutting the effective tax rate to 50 per cent from 60 per cent currently, according to Wood, who says he isn't privy to Treasury plans.\n\n\"That's still too high though,\" he said. \"What is needed is a reduction in the headline or supplementary tax.\" The industry's lobby has called for the UK to fast-track a public consultation on the investment allowance so the proposal can take effect from this year's budget. The Treasury declined to comment specifically on its plans but refered to an earlier statement that Osborne had vowed to take further action.\n\nThe supplementary tax, cut to 30 per cent by the Chancellor last year, is paid on top of corporation tax of 30 per cent. Mr Wood, chairman of oil-services provider John Wood Group Plc in the six years to 2012 and chief executive officer from 1982 to 2006, has advised a total tax take of 40 per cent or less.\n\nLittle Fresh UK North Sea investment will drop by more than half as tumbling oil prices and high taxation force energy producers to cut costs, an industry report said Tuesday.

They credited SGX's moves to launch popular derivatives contracts such as China A50 futures and commodities products. But they acknowledged challenges in the stock market, where brokers and remisiers have been struggling with declining trading volumes and a lack of investor interest, along with an increasing tendency to trade through online platforms that offer lower commissions.\n\n\"At the end of it all, you don't have big listings, you look at the top stocks, they are the same as a few years ago in terms of market capitalisation,\" said a senior broker who declined to be named.\n\nBut he wondered if Mr Bocker had also been frustrated by regulators in his efforts to grow SGX's business. He pointed to restrictions on the trading of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by retail investors, as well as the lack of progress over the trading of callable bull/bear contracts, which are financial derivatives popular in Hong Kong but have yet to be launched in Singapore after a public consultation in 2010. \"If you keep on getting your head bumped against certain things, you might get fed up, you might as well give it up rather than try a couple of years, and have people point fingers at you and say you didn't do a good job.\"\n\nOthers said that what SGX needs was a CEO who can connect to local stakeholder needs and restore investor confidence. A wave of corporate governance fiascos in S-chips after the global financial crisis, and more recently the penny stock crash of October 2013, hit investors hard, said Jimmy Ho, president of the Society Of Remisiers Singapore. \"People simply don't have the money to play anymore.\"\n\nAnother unpopular move Mr Bocker pushed through was removing the 90-minute lunch break in 2011 to facilitate all-day trading to boost volume. He also received flak after a couple of recent trading disruptions.\n\nMeanwhile, things came to a head when over\n\n1,000 remisiers and investors wrote a letter\n\non Jan 15 to appeal to Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam to help resolve a range of issues plaguing the industry.\n\nDavid Gerald, CEO and president of investor lobby group Securities Investors Associations of Singapore, said: \"It's only fair to say that he's done his best. It's not fair to blame one man for the woes of the market.\"\n\nHe suggested that a local take over SGX's helm - such as DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta, who had previously also been linked to the top job at Standard Chartered Bank. Mr Gupta was born in India but has become a Singapore citizen. \"I'm sure he'd relate well with retail investors, brokers, remisiers,\" Mr Gerald said.\n\nEsmond Choo, senior executive director of broker UOB Kay Hian, said that the biggest challenge for the new CEO was to bring liquidity back to the stock market, possibly through the Central Provident Fund system. \"Every major market has retirement funds invested in the market in a consistent manner. Singapore doesn't have that. We hope the new CEO can convince the decision-makers.\"\n\nMr Bocker has been CEO of SGX since Dec 1, 2009, taking over from Hsieh Fu Hua. Mr Bocker was previously president of Nasdaq OMX and CEO of OMX before it merged with Nasdaq.\n\nOther than growing SGX's derivatives, commodities and foreign exchange business, and investing S$250 million in a trading system called Reach, Mr Bocker notably tried to take over the Australian bourse ASX in 2010. The deal eventually failed in 2011 after fierce Australian political opposition.\n\nBT understands that after his contract with SGX ends, Mr Bocker will be involved in his family's investments in Asia and will stay on in Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Corporate Eurobonds haven't taken into account \"any of the risks, ranging from an economic crisis in Europe to the difficult talks with Greece\", he said.\n\nBloomberg indices tracking euro-denominated corporate bonds rose to records after ECB president Mario Draghi announced the 1.14 trillion-euro (S$1.76 trillion) bond-buying programme last month, intensifying a global hunt for higher returns. The gauges gained even as euro area officials held talks with Greece over extending its bailout.\n\nGreece-related risks \"will certainly drag on\", Mr Plewinski said, prompting him to continue increasing exposure to zloty-denominated company bonds that \"still offer quite attractive\" yields. Investors should bear in mind the ECB stimulus is aimed at spurring inflation and in the longer term will \"pile pressure\" on bond prices, he said.\n\nInvestment-grade euro-denominated corporate bonds returned 1.2 per cent this year and their high-yield equivalents gave back 2.3 per cent in the period, compared with a 2.4 per cent return for euro area sovereign bonds, according to Bloomberg indices tracking the markets. Poland's zloty corporate bonds are up 14.4 per cent this year, just short of a record reached on Feb 10, an index compiled by MBank SA shows.\n\nThe average yield on non-junk company Eurobonds dropped to 1.23 per cent on Feb 23 from 2.08 per cent a year ago, according to the Bloomberg EUR Investment Grade High Yield Corporate Composite Bond Index. Eurobonds will still account for the majority of assets in Millennium TFI's corporate debt portfolio as the zloty market isn't liquid enough to absorb money flowing to domestic asset managers, Mr Plewinski said.\n\nAssets of mutual funds investing in bonds climbed 28 per cent in the past year to 43 billion zloty at the end of January, according to Analizy.pl fund tracker. Company bond sales in the local currency reached a record 21.8 billion zloty last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

But that is no guarantee rates will be raised at any given point, Ms Yellen said. Rather it will be a signal that the Fed was shifting into a meeting by meeting consideration of a rate increase.\n\n\"If economic conditions continue to improve, as the Committee anticipates, the Committee will at some point begin considering an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate on a meeting-by-meeting basis,\" Ms Yellen said.\n\n\"Before then, the Committee will change its forward guidance. However it is important to emphasise that a modification of the forward guidance should not be read as indicating that the Committee will necessarily increase the target range in a couple of meetings.\"\n\nMs Yellen's discussion of forward guidance was part of a prepared testimony that included a broad overview of a US economy that appeared to be surging forward with strong job growth and a continued post-crisis expansion - conditions largely consistent with a rise in interest rates sometime later this year.\n\nHowever, Alabama Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee, indicated he was interested in what he considered more fundamental issues such as whether Congress should take a more aggressive role in overseeing the Fed. He has scheduled a separate hearing on that issue next week, and challenged Ms Yellen on the issue in his opening statement.\n\nWith a more than US$4 trillion balance sheet from its various crisis fighting efforts, \"many question whether the Fed can rein in inflation and avoid destabilising asset prices\", Mr Shelby said.\n\n\"I am interested to hear whether the current chair . . . believes the Fed should be immune from any reforms.\"\n\nMs Yellen's prepared remarks will be followed by a question and answer session, and a repeat appearance before a House committee on Wednesday.\n\nJust completing her first year as Fed chair, Ms Yellen said that she felt US labour markets and other key economic indicators \"have been increasing at a solid rate\". However, she said that she still feels the job market is not fully repaired, and that the US outlook remains somewhat clouded by a weaker-than-hoped-for global economy, stalled wage growth and falling inflation.\n\nNone of those factors on their own may be enough to keep the Fed from raising interest rates later this year, perhaps as early as June. Rates have been near zero since the financial crisis hit in 2008, part of a record effort by the central bank to repair the damage of the Great Recession.\n\nBut the lack of inflation has made some Fed policymakers hesitant to commit to raising rates until they are more certain the US is not headed down the same path as Europe or Japan, mature industrial economies that are struggling to maintain growth.\n\nThe Fed considers a steady 2 per cent annual inflation rate a sign of overall economic health - consistent with its own ability to return interest rates to a normal level, and not so high or low that it distorts household and business spending and investment decisions. Though the current weak prices are considered likely to be a temporary result of oil's collapse, doubts remain.\n\nMs Yellen's statement could set the stage for the Fed to remove \"patient\" as soon as its next meeting in March: Several policymakers, including some centrists on the committee, have said that they feel an interest rate increase should be on the table by June, after the intervening Fed session in April.\n\nThe discussion of forward guidance in Ms Yellen's testimony is an effort to extricate the Fed from a perhaps unforeseen constraint it created when the word \"patient\" was put in its statement in December.\n\nMs Yellen defined patient as a \"couple\" of meetings, and policymakers soon became concerned, according to the most recent Fed minutes, that investors would view any removal of \"patient\" as a sign interest rates would definitely rise two meetings later.

With the US the only bright spot of growth among its major trading partners, Singapore heads into its Golden Jubilee facing strong headwinds in its quest to transform its economy. While this year calls for celebration, the government has avoided overly generous handouts in the 2015 Budget but presented a very measured response to the global and domestic issues facing the nation.\n\nThis year's Budget continues the government's twin foci on economic restructuring by promoting productivity and innovation, and continuing to strengthen our social security system. To sustain our past economic successes and promote further growth, the most significant measure this year has to be the SkillsFuture development effort. The emphasis on lifelong learning of every Singaporean, starting from formal education and continuing into their working lives, should provide much needed help to fulfil the aspirations of all. The comprehensive approach to SkillsFuture, which ranges from training subsidies to the SkillsFuture Mentoring programmes, aims to cover all bases.\n\nContinuing the relentless pursuit of economic transformation, the finance minister refined the current suite of broadbased support measures for productivity contained in the Transition Support Package and enhanced the various offerings that seek to spur innovation and internationalisation efforts of Singapore businesses.\n\nA deferral of the earlier announced hikes in foreign worker levies should bring welcome, albeit short-lived, relief to businesses in the construction and service sectors as well as SMEs in general. Given the impending additional adjustments to levy rates which will kick in after next year, productivity must continue to be the focus for these important sectors of our economy.\n\nIt is interesting to note the renewed focus on encouraging companies to internationalise, given that it was in the 1990s when the external economy was first touted as a new wing to Singapore's growth. Besides the higher grant levels and tax deductions, the new International Growth Scheme - in conjunction with the enhanced tax allowance scheme for mergers and acquisitions - looks to encourage currently domestic-focused companies to expand into new markets overseas. With almost all of this year's tax measures targeted at domestic businesses, the absence of specific measures targeted at attracting foreign direct investments might be a signal of the government's cautious approach to dealing with the changing global tax environment - notably in the light of the OECD's Action Plans to address Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) issues by international businesses.\n\nThe finance minister rather fittingly reserved the social measures of the Budget for the second half of his speech. To paraphrase the minister, our people are at the heart of Singapore's transformation. The Silver Support Scheme, together with increases to the CPF contribution ceilings and rates for our older workers, will help to provide the most vulnerable in our society with greater support to blunt the harshness of life's hand. The extra interest to be paid on CPF balances of our senior citizens is icing on the cake. With various other measures like MediShield Life and CPF Life, the government looks to tackle potential issues that would come with our ageing population early, rather than pass these on to future generations.\n\nAnother key group which received attention is the family with various top-ups to take care of the costs of education, particularly for lower-income households. Higher payouts under the GST voucher schemes, rebates for service and conservancy charges, and personal tax rebates aim to afford greater relief against the high costs of living in Singapore.\n\nWhile short on specific details, of potentially even greater significance is the government's intention to increase development expenditures to around S$30 billion by 2020. This represents a more than doubling of the level of investment within a 10-year time frame. Important infrastructure developments such as Changi Airport Terminal 5, Tuas Seaport and investment in our public healthcare system will serve as pillars for economic growth in the next decade and beyond. To enable it to fund the expected rise in future spending, the government will raise personal income tax rates for higher-income earners and revise the framework under which it can include the expected investment returns of its three investment entities in its revenue base.\n\nAt the end of the day, Budget 2015 does not contain any significant surprise; it characterises the government's longstanding prudent fiscal policy. While the government has sought to capitalise on our strong fiscal position by sharing the fruits of past economic successes, the nation is also being positioned for future challenges with emphasis on skills development for specific priority industries, measures to encourage value-creation activities and added investment in our economic infrastructure. In laying the foundation for social cohesiveness through improving the social safety nets, the government is aiming to ensure that the economic progress of the past 50 years is preserved by nipping potential social problems in the bud. As the minister repeatedly stated in his speech: \"It is the fair thing to do.\" So while we enjoy the SG50 festivities this year, we can confidently toast to our aspirations for another 50 glorious years.\n\nHappy birthday, Singapore!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has been widely thought that doing so would reduce one's chance of having coronary heart disease. Most of the evidence for that recommendation has come from epidemiologic studies, which can be flawed.\n\nUse of these types of studies happens far more often than many would like, leading to dietary guidelines that may not be based on the best available evidence. But last week, the government started to address that problem, proposing new guidelines that in some cases are more in line with evidence from randomised controlled trials, a more rigorous form of scientific research.\n\nSometimes the public has had to settle for epidemiologic or other less reliable studies because a randomised controlled trial to prove causality cannot be done. There'll never be one for smoking and cancer, for instance, because the evidence from cohort and case-control studies, which are observational and not interventional, is so compelling that telling a random population to smoke \"to see if it's harmful\" would be unethical. But there's no reason why randomly assigning people to diets can't be done.\n\nBut, in fact, randomised controlled trials existed when the previous low-fat guidelines were published. It appears they were ignored.\n\nJust recently, a study was published in the journal Open Heart in which researchers performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the randomised controlled trials that were available when those guidelines were announced. They wanted to explore what evidence those creating the guidelines might have been able to consider at the time.\n\nBefore 1983, six randomised controlled trials involving 2,467 men were conducted. None were explicit studies of the recommended diet (and none involved women), but all explored the relationship between dietary fat, cholesterol and mortality. Five of them were secondary prevention trials - meaning that they involved only men with known problems already. Only one included healthy participants, who would be at lower risk, and therefore would be likely to have less benefit from dietary changes.\n\nThat's a lot of participants. Moreover, many of them were at high risk. And in all of them, there was no significant difference among them in the rate of death from coronary heart disease. There were also no differences in mortality from all causes, which is the metric that matters.\n\nThe study did show that cholesterol levels went down more in the groups that ate low-fat diets. Some have used this as justification for a low-fat diet. But the difference between them was small. Mean cholesterol went down 13 per cent in the intervention groups, but it went down 7 per cent in the control groups. And these groups didn't have different clinical outcomes.\n\nSmall changes in cholesterol levels from dietary changes also aren't surprising to those who follow the research. About 70 per cent of people are thought to be \"hyporesponders\" to dietary cholesterol. This means that after consuming three eggs a day for 30 days, they would see no increase in their plasma cholesterol ratios. Their cholesterol levels have almost no relationship to what they eat.\n\nAgain, there have been randomised controlled trials in this area. In 2013, researchers published a systematic review of all studies from 2003 or after. Twelve met the researchers' criteria for inclusion in the analysis, and seven of them controlled for background diet. Most of the studies that controlled for background diet found that altering cholesterol consumption had no effect on the concentration of blood LDL (or \"bad\") cholesterol. A few studies could detect differences only in small subgroups of people with certain genes or a predisposition to problems.\n\nIn other words, in most studies, all people didn't respond. In the rest, only a minority of patients responded to changes in dietary cholesterol.\n\nDid recommendations change when these studies were published? No, but they got closer to changing on Thursday, when a government committee urged repeal of the guideline that Americans limit their cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams a day, saying, \"Cholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.\" This will come as a surprise to a vast majority of Americans, who for decades have been watching their cholesterol intake religiously. (The change won't be official until it is approved by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture, but they usually closely follow the committee's recommendations.)\n\nHow about epidemiologic data pointing out that low-salt diets might actually be unhealthy? Randomised controlled trials exist there, too. A 2008 study randomly assigned patients with congestive heart failure to either normal or low-sodium diets. Those on the low-sodium diet had significantly more hospital admissions. The \"number needed to treat\" for a normal-sodium diet above a low-sodium diet to prevent a hospital admission in this population was six - meaning that for every six people who are moved from a low-sodium diet to a normal diet, one hospital admission would be prevented. That's a very strong finding.\n\nPeople's frustration at the continuing shifts in nutrition recommendations is understandable. For decades, they've been told what to eat because \"science says so\". Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be true. That's disappointing not only because it reduces people's faith in science as a whole, but also because it may have cost some people better health, or potentially even their lives.

That will allow as many as 1,400 patients who've had ASR hips removed since 2013 to seek about US$300,000 each in compensation under the original 2013 accord.\n\n\"By extending the benefits of the previously announced US Settlement Programme to an additional group of ASR patients, we are again providing fair compensation\" to artificial hip recipients \"without the delay and uncertainty of protracted litigation\", Mindy Tinsley, a DePuy spokeswoman, said in an e-mail Friday.\n\n\"J&J has seen the handwriting on the wall about these hip cases and they've figured it out: It's better to settle all of these suits and get this debacle behind them,\" said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's business and law schools who teaches about class-action settlements.\n\nCoupled with the original accord, the new settlements will resolve more than 90 per cent of current hip-removal suits, plaintiffs' lawyers said. The extension pushes the accord's total cash compensation payments to about US$3 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe total cost of the settlements over the ASR line, which stands for articular surface replacements, will exceed US$4 billion by the time J&J resolves all the implant cases, Carl Tobias, who teaches product-liability law at the University of Richmond in Virginia, said last year.\n\nJ&J and DePuy recalled 93,000 ASR hip implants worldwide in August 2010, saying 12 per cent failed within five years. Internal J&J documents showed 37 per cent of ASR hips failed after 4.6 years. The failure rate in Australia in 2012 was found to be 44 per cent over seven years of use.\n\nJ&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, touted the ASR metal-on-metal implants, first sold in the US in 2005, as a design that would last 20 years and offer greater range of motion, according to court filings.\n\nAs failures rose, patients complained the hips caused dislocations and pain, and forced them to have removal surgeries. They also alleged the chromium-and-cobalt implants were defectively designed, allowing metal ions to build up in the bloodstream.\n\nMs Tinsley said in her statement that the original settlement program has resolved more than 7,500 suits over the devices. Steven Skikos, who led a group of plaintiffs' lawyers that helped negotiate the accords, said only 2 per cent of those eligible for the first round of settlements rejected J&J's offer.\n\n\"We are pleased we were able to put together this agreement\" to bring more ASR patients into the settlement, Mr Skikos said Friday in an e-mail.\n\nJ&J's settlement came after a California jury concluded in 2013 that a retired prison guard deserved US$8.3 million in damages over his failed hip implant. The panel found the device's design was flawed and that DePuy officials failed to properly warn about its risks.\n\nThat same year, J&J persuaded a Chicago jury to reject a nurse's request for at least US$5 million in damages over her failed ASR hip.\n\nEarlier this month, a jury in Tulsa, Oklahoma, ordered J&J to pay US$2.5 million in damages to a woman who alleged her ASR hip was defectively designed. The woman had opted out of the settlement. Jurors in that case, however, rejected her claims that J&J failed to properly warn patients about the hips' risks.\n\nUnder the original settlement plan, J&J officials set an August 2013 deadline for hip recipients who had the devices removed to file compensation claims.\n\nThe company faced more than 12,000 US lawsuits over the devices, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing last year.\n\nSome of the remaining cases involved people who rejected J&J's offer as too low while others included patients who still have ASR implants. J&J has refused to settle those cases and any claims outside the US as part of the original accord.\n\nDick Harpootlian, a South Carolina-based lawyer for a woman who had two ASR hips removed, said his client rebuffed J&J's settlement offer as inadequate. \"The surgical removal of these devices left her in a wheelchair and we're looking forward to having a South Carolina jury decide what would be just compensation for her injuries,\" Mr Harpootlian said Monday.\n\nThe consolidated federal case is In re DePuy Orthopedics Inc, ASR Hip Implant Products Liability Litigation, 10-MD-2197, US District Court, Northern District of Ohio (Toledo).

Its rapid economic rise and the emergence of large industrial and service sectors have created a wide range of investment opportunities and instruments. While the potential returns are attractive, there are challenges and pitfalls to overcome. Two experts and I examine the different ways to invest in Chinese companies.\n\n\"China's growth must be seen in the context of its expanding role in the world economy. This means that investors shouldn't only focus on growth numbers. They need to look closely at the characteristics of each company or opportunity within overall trends,\" says Ayaz Ebrahim, CIO Asia ex-Japan equities and deputy chief executive officer of Amundi Hong Kong.\n\nHe adds: \"Continuation of economic opening and liberalisation is a key trend allowing the entry and expansion of foreign banks. QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor), RQFII (Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) and Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect are policy commitments towards a controlled opening of China.\"\n\nPremier Xi Jinping has executed many reforms, the most prominent being anti-corruption drives. He has also raised civil service pay by 60 per cent. This is an effective way to fight corruption. Interest rate liberalisation (in lending, not deposits) is a big step forward towards a free market economy. In a command economy, controlled lending rates are an inefficient way to allocate capital and price risk.\n\nOlivier Carcy, global head of private equity at Credit Agricole Private Banking, says: \"The opening of the China market is a controlled and long process.\" He manages global private equity portfolios, which represent unlisted investments. He believes that \"private equity is slowly opening up. In the US, private equity represents 2.5 per cent of GDP and in China 0.35 per cent. Privatisation of state owned companies remains a big opportunity\".\n\nMr Ebrahim highlights one of the biggest problems facing investors in Chinese corporations. \"Corporate governance issues continue to be a problem in China. On corporate governance rankings, China is still not on the same level as the US and Europe. One reason is that retail investors, who dominate Chinese markets, have not demanded major regulatory changes. But as more foreign investors participate, this bias will change.\"\n\nRecent data suggests that China's economic growth is slowing down. After years of high growth, investors need to understand the positive and negative outcomes of moderating expansion. Mr Carcy observes: \"For private equity investors, it could be good news. Private equity is a costly and intrusive form of capital. Slower economic growth improves entry valuations for investors. It also encourages companies to venture and expand overseas and improve cost controls. It forces an economic rebalancing by removing excess production capacity. In the past, companies with access to cheap credit created overcapacity, which forced down product prices to irrational levels.\"\n\nSlower GDP growth and China's integration with the international economy might improve management quality. Mr Ebrahim advises: \"If investors focus on companies with the ability to rationally price and operate, they can make superior, long term returns.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Carcy believes \"there is still a long way to go for Chinese corporations to evolve into world class organisations, especially in terms of middle management quality\". However, private equity investors face unique due diligence challenges. Mr Carcy points out: \"Basically, we need full access to all of the company's financial statements. If not, we cannot proceed with an investment.\"\n\nIn listed equities, we favour private sector Chinese companies. For the fixed income class, we seek state owned companies for their stable yield. Diversification is the key to building a fixed income portfolio.\n\nMr Ebrahim recommends investing through H shares rather than A share markets. \"In China, mutual fund flows are driven by retail rather than by pension funds and institutional investors. So they are more volatile.\" He currently favours sectors such as consumer discretionary products, automobile parts, travel, local luxury goods, alcohol, local brands and insurance companies. \"China valuations are below their 10-year average so we are optimistic about their growth prospects.\"\n\nInvestors need to think about other risk factors that are unique to China. The overall political risk of the latest anti-corruption drive could impact the rule of law. Mr Ebrahim cites other challenges such as the inability of the Chinese government to rebalance the economy and prevent widespread unemployment due to closure of the RMB capital account. \"But, there is upside in 2015 as analysts may not have priced the fall in oil prices into the output of mainland companies.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was the lowest-rated show since 2009, which had about 36.3 million viewers for a ceremony hosted by Hugh Jackman, with Slumdog Millionaire in the winner's circle.\n\nGoing into Sunday's show, the headlines were about the dearth of racial diversity among acting nominees. That gave Neil Patrick Harris - the ceremony's eager, if ultimately ineffective, host - his first joke of the night, as he opened what he called a celebration of \"the best and the whitest - sorry, brightest\".\n\nBut the large number of black presenters and performers - including John Legend and Common, who also collected the best song prize for their Selma tour de force, Glory - helped to douse that controversy. The most honoured artist of the evening was notably Alejandro G I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, the Mexican director of Birdman, who accepted the best picture statuette with a plea for immigrant respect. He also was a co-writer and producer of the film, which is formally titled Birdman or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.\n\nThe bigger problem, as the results came in, were indications - visible amid a confusing tangle of awards that went in many different directions - that both the Academy and the echo chamber of Hollywood's awards-system machinery have nearly broken their connection with the movies that many millions of people buy tickets to watch.\n\n\"It's sad, but most people have to finally accept that the Oscars have become, well, elitist and not in step with anything that is actually popular,\" said Philip Hallman, a film studies librarian at the University of Michigan. \"No one really believes anymore that the films they chose are the ones that are going to last over time.\"\n\nThe audience clearly cast its vote for Clint Eastwood's American Sniper, a reality-based Iraq war story that has taken in about US$320 million at the domestic box office from nearly 40 million viewers. Box-office analysts predict that American Sniper will easily take in US$340 million before its run is finished, making it the No 1 film released last year, as measured in domestic ticket sales.\n\nAnother telling statistic: Birdman collected about US$11 million in ticket sales between the time it was nominated and Sunday; American Sniper took in US$317 million over the same period. But American Sniper - one of eight best picture nominees and with six nominations overall - went home with nothing but a sound-editing statuette.\n\nThe Imitation Game - the second-ranked ticket seller among the best picture nominees, with about US$84 million in domestic sales from about 10 million viewers - did no better. After months of intense prize campaigning by the Oscar-savvy Weinstein Co, it lost in seven of its eight nominated categories, winning only for best adapted screenplay.\n\nIn the visual effects category, all five nominees (including the winner, Interstellar) were the sort of grand blockbusters that keep Hollywood working and give it sheen around the world. Not one of them figured in a field of smaller-budget, little-seen best picture contenders that for months had dominated the awards conversation.\n\nEven the In Memoriam sequence gave viewers the cold shoulder. The wildly popular Joan Rivers, a red-carpet fixture and occasional actress, was noticeably not included, while multiple little-known former film professionals did make the cut.\n\nIt was not supposed to be this way: in 2009, Academy officials increased their field of best picture nominees, from five to a maximum of 10, in a bid to embrace large, world-spanning films - The Dark Knight, Inception - that are the pinnacle of populist art. The plan was to shift the Oscars back towards relevancy, \"a history where most of the winning films were also popular with the audience\", as Mr Hallman put it on Monday.\n\nWith the occasional exception of an Avatar or a Gravity among the nominees, however, the larger field of contenders has only brought in more little movies. The trend was particularly noticeable on Sunday, when one of the big winners was Whiplash, which won three Oscars but has been seen by perhaps only 1.4 million ticket buyers since its release more than four months ago.\n\nThe slow drift from the audience, film historians say, is almost certainly rooted in the Academy's admissions process, which leans heavily towards the inclusion of each year's nominees. Those nominated for making small films join the ranks and nominate more small films. A recent move to expand the documentary branch probably added a few more indie-minded voters with an eye for the esoteric. (Academy membership is generally around 6,000; last year, 271 candidates, a relatively high number, were invited to join.) The creation of a casting director branch in 2013 almost certainly added still more voters with a penchant for character and performance, and perhaps not much interest in the colossal visual-effects- driven films by which much of Hollywood makes a living.\n\nFor many in Hollywood, the net result became painfully visible on Sunday, as Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, the Oscar ceremony producers, created a razzmatazz variety show with some movies in tow - almost as an afterthought.\n\nAt least a half-dozen times, Harris, the host, promised that Lady Gaga, the evening's big draw, was just around the corner. She overwhelmed some of those small winners: a surreal moment in the press room found her performing to The Sound of Music, from 50 years ago, while Laura Poitras, the director of the documentary Citzenfour, about the whistleblower Edward Snowden, tried to make her points about the government's devouring of personal privacy.\n\nAnother awkward moment came when Dana Perry - a winner with Ellen Goosenberg Kent for a documentary short about suicide hotlines - dedicated the award to her son, saying: \"We lost him to suicide. We should talk about suicide out loud.\" At that moment, the orchestra began to play her offstage, and Harris arrived to yank the show back towards mirth.\n\n\"I love that dress,\" he told Perry as she was ushered into the wings.\n\nAs the ratings demonstrated, the audience was not impressed.

Hence, we have designed our system such that we have lower overall taxes than most countries, but nevertheless maintain a highly progressive regime,\" he said, adding that the lower-income group gets significantly more benefits than the taxes they pay.\n\nStill, observers told The Business Times that there is room to strengthen Singapore's revenue base - whether by way of higher marginal tax rates for a broader swathe of income earners, or through a rise in the GST rate.\n\nAfter all, they said, calls for greater social spending must come with a new social compact - where a stronger sense of collective responsibility augments the long-held foundation of personal effort. At present, the top 10 per cent of Singapore's taxpayers foot slightly over 80 per cent of personal income taxes.\n\nNanyang Technological University (NTU) associate professor of economics Walter Theseira said: \"I think the main motivation for widening the tax base is, honestly, not the revenue. It's more about the principle of solidarity, which is that everybody contributes something, even if it's not a very large amount. To give the idea that we'll tax you only if you're very rich and the rest of you get redistribution from the rest of these guys - that's not the message to send.\"\n\nIndeed, Mr Tharman had said on Monday that \"it would be naive to think that we can keep raising tax rates without affecting our competitiveness\", and noted that many Singaporean professionals are in fact working abroad, in places like Hong Kong.\n\nStill, Laurence Lien, chairman and chief executive of Asia Philanthropy Circle, said there is still room for top marginal tax rates to increase further: \"Whether it's 22, 24, or 25 per cent - it's still more than bearable for high income earners, who get a lot of value out of being here.\"\n\nEven so, now that steps have been taken to make Singapore's income tax regime more progressive - especially with the introduction of various negative income taxes for lower-income groups in recent years, such as Workfare and the Silver Support Scheme - private-sector economists say a rise in consumption taxes, particularly GST, will be next.\n\nMizuho's Vishnu Varathan, noting that top-end tax rates cannot keep rising without adjustments to consumption tax, said: \"It's like eating a fishball on a stick - you don't keep biting on one side because half your fishball is going to drop off on the other side.\"\n\nHe added: \"There is a bona fide intent to have our tax system be very progressive, but at the same time, Mr Tharman has emphasised that we have to look at the entire suite of measures to see the progressivity of this.\n\n\"So at some point - maybe five or eight years down the road - our GST will have to rise to 10, or maybe even 12 per cent.\"\n\nEven though the GST is a broad-based, regressive tax system, economists do not think that increasing it would undermine recent efforts to make the income tax regime more progressive.\n\nUOB's Francis Tan said: \"As long as the government is efficient and sufficient in identifying the bottom tier who need GST vouchers, they can increase intensity of subsidy to help those suffering from an additional three percentage point GST hike.\"\n\nStill, several observers pointed out that this is unlikely to materialise anytime soon, citing the government's assurance in 2011 that the GST rate would not be increased for at least the next five years.\n\nMr Tharman had also said in his Budget speech that, based on current projections, the revenue measures introduced in Budget 2015 \"will provide sufficiently\" for the increased spending needs planned for until the end of this decade.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This in turn has led to the prices of many commodities and goods rising more rapidly than wages; real incomes have declined as a result, provoking increased challenges to the central bank's monetary policy.\n\nThere have also been increasing calls for what many regard as the BOJ's unreasonable and unreachable inflation target to be scaled back, in order to relieve downward pressure on the yen exchange rate.\n\nBut while this may appear to be only a matter of degree, a former BOJ executive director told The Business Times recently that Mr Kuroda fears for the credibility of the central bank's overall deflation-fighting strategy if the 2 per cent target is diluted.\n\nConsumer price inflation has already slipped to under half the 2 per cent target as a result of falling oil prices and could slip further in coming months. In that case, renewed deflation could become a danger and a self-fulfilling prophecy with the decline of inflation expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Abe and his ministers are exerting strong pressure on Japanese companies to raise wages by a significant margin at the upcoming spring round of annual wage negotiations in Japan. This would have the effect of boosting incomes and consumption while softening criticism of BOJ policies.\n\nThe credibility of Mr Kuroda's repeated assurances - that the BOJ will not hesitate to launch further monetary easing moves if its inflation target appears to be slipping out of reach - is being undermined, some economists say.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His alleged misdemeanour would have been in conflict with his role in negotiations over agricultural tariffs in Trans-Pacific Partnership trade talks.\n\nThe government on Tuesday played down the impact of the third resignation of a cabinet member in less than six months on TPP talks and Mr Abe's drive to reform the agriculture sector. Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday that he wasn't concerned about any adverse effect on farm policy, citing Mr Hayashi's previous experience in the role.\n\nMr Abe is pushing to ease protections for the agriculture industry as part of a broader push for structural reforms to spur economic growth. He's made some progress in efforts to weaken the farm lobby's influence, and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party this month managed to remove the national agricultural cooperative's power to audit local farming groups.\n\nWhile Mr Nishikawa was a long-time member of the LDP's farm policy \"tribe\", his departure will have limited impact on these policies, according to Tobias Harris, an analyst at Teneo Intelligence.\n\n\"Mr Hayashi has continued to play an important role in agricultural policy; as part of an 'inner circle' of LDP agricultural policy experts, he was involved in securing JA- Zenchu's acquiescence to the government's plans for reforming the cooperative system,\" Mr Harris wrote in a research note on Monday, referring to the country's farm lobby group. \"Mr Hayashi should have little difficulty managing farmers' opposition to TPP and reform legislation.\"\n\nMr Hayashi was farm minister when Japan entered TPP negotiations in 2013, a move he said late on Monday was a \"milestone\".\n\n\"We will continue with intense negotiations, although difficult issues remain,\" he told reporters in Tokyo.\n\nEconomy minister Akira Amari said earlier this month that substantial progress had been made in negotiations for the trade pact, and said it would be desirable for the 12 nations involved to hold a ministerial meeting early in spring.\n\nIf completed, the TPP accord would link nations with about US$28 trillion in annual economic output, or about 39 per cent of the global total. Other members include the US, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nMr Nishikawa's resignation comes after two female ministers, Yuko Obuchi and Midori Matsushima, quit in October over allegations of financial impropriety. Mr Abe recovered from that double blow to win by a landslide in December's general election. Still, a series of scandal-linked resignations contributed to the unravelling of his first administration in 2007 after less than a year.\n\n\"Even though Mr Abe is seen as a strong political leader, he's still struggling to make the right appointments,\" said independent political analyst Minoru Morita. \"This serves as a reminder to Mr Abe that his economic policies may not go as smoothly as he hopes.\"\n\nMr Nishikawa said on Feb 17 that he'd returned all one million yen (S$11,400) he received from a company operated by a sugar industry association, according to the Asahi newspaper. Sugar is one of the five key agricultural products that Japan wants to protect in any TPP agreement.\n\nMr Abe's previous spell as prime minister was hampered by his appointments of farm ministers. Toshikatsu Matsuoka killed himself in May 2007 while being questioned in parliament for receiving donations from contractors associated with a developer under investigation for rigging construction bids.\n\nHis replacement, Norihiko Akagi, resigned a few months later over separate impropriety allegations, while his successor, Takehiko Endo, lasted just a week in the job - again over a financial misdemeanour.

At the same time, a surge that outpaces wage growth and consumer price inflation could have undesired effects, like making homes unaffordable to young or first-time buyers and pushing them out of the market.\n\nMeanwhile, the US services sector expanded in February at its fastest pace since October, with businesses reporting customers boosting orders because of improving economic conditions, an industry report showed on Tuesday.\n\nFinancial data firm Markit said its preliminary, or \"flash\", reading of its Purchasing Managers Index for the service sector rose to 57.0 in February from a final reading of 54.2 in January.\n\nThe report far outpaced forecasts, which called for a February reading of 54.0, according to a Reuters survey of economists. A reading over 50 signals expansion in economic activity.\n\nMarkit's reading of new business at service companies in February surged to 56.7 from 51.7 in January, which was the lowest reading in the history of the Markit services sector series dating to October 2009.\n\n\"While parts of the East Coast have struggled in the face of adverse weather, other regions basked in unusually warm temperatures, boosting business above seasonal norms,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, in a statement.\"Activity levels surged higher and inflows of new business boomed as a result.\"\n\nMarkit last week said its flash US Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index rose to 54.3 in February, up from January's final reading of 53.9.\n\n\"Alongside the upturn signalled by the sister 'flash' manufacturing PMI survey, the improved performance of the service sector in February means the economy looks to be enjoying yet another spell of robust growth in the first quarter,\" Mr Williamson said.\n\nThe surveys portray US gross domestic product as growing at 3 per cent or more on an annualized basis, Mr Williamson said.\n\nThe service index's employment component also rose in February and remained above 50, the level which separates expansion from contraction.\n\nMarkit's seasonally-adjusted flash US Composite PMI Output Index rose to 56.8 in February, its best monthly reading since October, from 54.4 in January.

While this ensures a strong commitment to the business, it is just as important to plan for the continuity of the business when it is passed on to subsequent generations.\n\nIn a recent research report (commissioned by the Labuan International Business Finance Centre) from The Economist Intelligence Unit which interviewed family-owned businesses in South-east Asia, 67 per cent of the respondents said that they have made arrangements to ensure continuity after their current leaders step down. However, more than a fifth of the respondents said that they do not have a succession plan in place.\n\nA succession plan is necessary for the smooth transfer of wealth to heirs and the continued success of your business, especially if your children are involved in the business. As the patriarch, you would need to consider who will benefit from the estate, the order in which they will benefit and the amount or percentage of the wealth that your children should receive.

They bought a net 2.44 trillion yen in long-term foreign notes, after selling a net 290 billion yen a year earlier, government data show. A benchmark gauge of hedging costs was at its highest since October 2012.\n\nThe industry's 347.4 trillion yen in assets at the end of November were invested 42.9 per cent in Japanese government bonds and 18.6 per cent in foreign securities, boosting their exposure to swings in the yen, which has weakened 14 per cent in the past year against the dollar. Companies have to adopt flexible strategies, take hedging costs into consideration and examine overseas debt amid low domestic interest rates, said Dai-ichi Life Insurance president Koichiro Watanabe.\n\n\"Insurers' investment in a way is in line with Bank of Japan (BOJ) policy that's aimed at encouraging a shift from domestic to overseas bond investment,\" said Souichi Takeyama, a rates strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc in Tokyo. \"But insurers are also caught between a rock and a hard place as they are the ones who bear the risks.\"\n\nBOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda's efforts to encourage investments in riskier assets are starting to bear fruit as insurers seek higher returns to meet payouts coming due in one of the world's fastest-ageing societies.\n\nJapanese bonds have lost 0.9 per cent this month, heading for their steepest decline since May 2013, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. The benchmark 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield was 0.37 per cent on Tuesday after falling to a record low of 0.195 per cent last month. The 30-year rate was 1.42 per cent.\n\n\"Insurers aren't able to buy at a pace like before due to falling yields on super-long JGBs,\" said Takafumi Yamawaki, the chief rates strategist in Tokyo at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \"Even if they boost foreign bonds, US and euro region yields are falling while dollar funding costs are rising. Bond investors globally are facing a harsh investment environment.\"\n\nThe threat of deflation globally is fuelling demand for fixed-income assets. Ten-year Treasury yields plunged to 1.64 per cent on Jan 30, the least since May 2013, while Germany's slid to a record low of 0.297 per cent on Feb 2.\n\nThe allure of currency-hedged foreign bond investments is declining amid expectations that the Federal Reserve will start raising interest rates later this year, said Masafumi Yamamoto, the president of Praevidentia Strategy, a financial research company in Tokyo.\n\nLondon interbank offered rates for six-month dollar loans rose to their highest since October 2012 relative to those in yen at 24.7 basis points on Feb 20, suggesting that insurance companies' hedging costs are rising.\n\n\"As the longer-term outlook of the dollar-yen is for a higher dollar rather than a higher yen, life insurers could buy dollar bonds on the currency's dips without hedges and reduce the proportion of their current hedging ratio,\" Mr Yamamoto said.\n\nJapan's currency weakened to a seven-year low of 121.85 per dollar in December . The yen will depreciate to 125 per dollar at the end of 2015, going by the median estimate of about 50 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.\n\nThe BOJ's stimulus programme, which involves buying as much as 12 trillion yen of domestic debt a month, has eroded insurers' JGB-dominated investment returns. Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance and Dai-ichi Life withdrew from some fixed-term insurance policies that pay higher interest rates than returns they achieve from their investments.\n\nTakahiro Ootsuka, a market economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co in Tokyo, said that the central bank's policy is having its intended portfolio-rebalancing effect by pushing insurers to risk assets including foreign bonds.\n\nThe spread between 10-year Treasury notes and Japan's debt with similar maturity will widen to 2.2 percentage points by year-end from about 1.7 points on Tuesday in Tokyo, analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\"By default, they would have to boost foreign bonds investment but with US yields set to rise with a Fed rate hike, timing will be crucial for investment,\" Mr Ootsuka said.

Several people briefed on those discussions said those talks would most likely lead to the establishment of such a group by the end of the year, a recognition that hackers are increasingly focusing on big law firms to glean information about their corporate clients.\n\nFederal authorities, including President Barack Obama, are pressing companies to share information about hackings with one another and law enforcement as a way to deter the theft of information about consumers and employees.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies have long been concerned about the vulnerability of US law firms to online attacks because they are seen by hackers and nations bent on corporate espionage as a rich repository of company secrets, business strategies and intellectual property. But attacks on law firms often go unreported because the firms are private and not subject to the same kind of data-breach reporting requirements as public companies that handle sensitive consumer information.\n\nOver the last several months, Mandiant, the security firm that is a division of FireEye, has been advising a half-dozen law firms that were the subject of a breach, said a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mandiant, during a recent presentation at a legal conference, said many of the bigger hackings of law firms had ties to the Chinese government, which was seeking information on patent applications, trade secrets, military weapons systems and contract negotiations.\n\nThe law firm group under consideration would be set up as an organisation to share and analyse information and would permit firms to share anonymously information about hackings and threats on computer networks in much the same way that bank and brokerage firms share similar information with the financial services group. And while the two groups would not necessarily share information with each other, the law firms would have access to some of the resources of the financial centre, which has existed since 1999 and is one of the better-funded industry threat-sharing organisations.\n\n\"The FS-ISAC was designed to facilitate the sharing of threat information with each other, and there is value in involving law firms,\" said Anish Bhimani, the financial group's chairman and a JPMorgan Chase managing director. \"A lot of this started because the banks were individually talking to the law firms about security information and someone said, 'This is ludicrous, let's do it together'.\"\n\nAn executive order signed by Mr Obama on Feb 13 specifically encourages private companies in the same industries to form organisations to better share information about online security and attacks. But the discussions between the banks and law firms began months before the executive order, said the people briefed on the negotiations.\n\nThe conversations between the banks and law firms began with a working group of about a dozen Wall Street banks - including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley - meeting periodically to discuss cybersecurity issues with representatives of big law firms like Sullivan & Cromwell; Cravath, Swaine & Moore; and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. More recently, the talks have included representatives of the International Legal Technology Association, an association of about 2,000 law firms.\n\nThe conversations between the banks and law firms were underway before last summer's attack on JPMorgan that compromised mainly email addresses, phone numbers and mailing addresses for 83 million households and small-business customers.\n\nBill Nelson, the president and chief executive of the financial group, said the plan was for his organisation to anonymously provide the legal group with some of the security threat information that banks have seen on their networks. He said there would be a \"loose affiliation\" with the legal group.\n\nThe law firms might also be able to participate in security conferences sponsored by the financial services group, which takes in more than US$7.5 million a year in grants and membership fees.\n\nThe membership in the legal group would be voluntary, but it is expected that most large law firms and those that do regular business for a financial services firm would join, said the people briefed on the matter.\n\nOver the last year, big banks have required more documentation from law firms about online security measures as a condition for retaining a firm for a job. Some banks, for instance, are increasingly demanding that law firms do no work for a bank on computers that can be reached by a public network.\n\nOfficials with law firms declined to talk publicly about the legal group, but several said privately that it would be a good idea. However, they said the threat of a breach was often overstated by banks, security consulting firms and law enforcement. NYT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some nations did, however, raise questions about how information gathered by UN drones would be stored and shared.\n\nThe panel's recommendation, she said, was that the UN would own the information gathered by it and there would have to be strict rules and procedures covering the use of drones and the imagery received from them. She also denied that the UN would become an intelligence gathering body.\n\n\"The UN needs information to operate safely and securely and with integrity and with effect,\" she said. \"You want basic information when you go out for a drive. Does that make you an intelligence gathering entity? No. You just want to know the environment you're walking into.\"\n\nThe United Nations began using surveillance drones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in December 2013. UN officials and diplomats have said drones have helped peacekeepers track armed groups in the dense landscape of eastern Congo. It is also planning on using drones for its peacekeeping mission in Mali.\n\nSome countries, including Russia, China and Rwanda, have previously expressed reservations about the use of drones by the UN.\n\nWestern diplomats say that UN contracts with Russian firms providing helicopters and airplanes for peacekeeping missions could eventually be in jeopardy if the world body switches to drones for most of its aerial reconnaissance capabilities. Russia's UN mission did not have an immediate response to a query about the panel's recommendation regarding drones.\n\nMs Lute noted that the panel had also recommended heightened cyber security measures at peacekeeping missions, as well as the increased use of \"green\" technology.

But the boost came with the economy of major customer China slowing and demand dropping due to weakness in its property sector.\n\nPetroleum production increased 9 per cent and metallurgical coal output jumped 21 per cent, but copper fell by 2 per cent and aluminium, manganese and nickel were broadly unchanged.\n\nIn August, BHP announced plans to demerge parts of its business, including aluminium, manganese, silver and selected coal and nickel operations, into a company called South32. This will allow it to focus exclusively on its core long-life operations - iron ore, copper, petroleum, coal and potash, with the new entity to be listed in Sydney, London and Johannesburg, with its headquarters in Perth, Australia.\n\nMr Mackenzie reiterated that the spin-off was crucial to simplify the business and cut costs moving forward. \"This push for productivity must continue and our proposed demerger will be a catalyst for further progress,\" he said. \"Simplification will ensure BHP Billiton's organisation, systems and processes are dedicated to its core assets, allowing us to further improve their productivity.\n\n\"Meanwhile, South32 will benefit from a dedicated management team who can tailor their strategy to suit their own distinct portfolio.\"\n\nThe company said that the spin-off remains on track to be completed in the first half of 2015 with a shareholder vote in May.\n\n\"The demerger will allow us to continue the process of building an organisation that is truly unique in our sector, and one that is well positioned for success in the face of ever increasing volatility,\" added Mr Mackenzie.

Weakening public finances and lower oil prices mean Malaysia's rating may be cut by one level in the first half by Fitch Ratings Ltd, according to ING Groep NV, which says corporate governance concerns at 1MDB may have \"some minor influence\". \"The thing about 1MDB is the uncertainty,\" Tim Condon, ING's Singapore-based head of Asia research, said by phone on Feb 18. \"Recent loan servicing difficulties have created stress on Malaysian financial assets and further such news could have the same result.\"\n\nThe Edge newspaper reported on Monday that 1MDB may require a RM3 billion cash injection from the Ministry of Finance, citing people it didn't identify. As 100 per cent owner, the ministry will be involved as required in the interests of maximising shareholder value, 1MDB said in an e-mailed statement, adding that it will issue official announcements relating to its business, implementation of a strategic review and financing arrangements when appropriate.\n\nAny state bailout would prove 1MDB is in \"serious financial distress\", Tony Pua, an opposition lawmaker, said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday.\n\nA default on 1MDB's loan, and subsequent cross default on its other debt, may have proved damaging to Malaysia's sovereign rating, given that 1MDB is owned by the ministry, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a Feb 9 report.\n\n\"1MDB is becoming relevant to fixed income and equity investors alike as they scramble to understand what it is, and what impact it could have on Malaysia's banking system and sovereign rating,\" Stephen Hagger, a Kuala Lumpur-based analyst at the bank, said in the note. \"Former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, along with the opposition, repeatedly question the goings on at 1MDB. As a result, it's becoming highly politically charged.\"\n\nThe 2023 notes have lost 9.8 per cent this year, versus a 0.8 per cent gain for investment-grade quasi-sovereign bonds in Asia and a 1 per cent increase for the region's speculative grade dollar corporate debentures, JPMorgan indexes show.\n\n1MDB Global Investments Ltd, the offshore subsidiary that issued the notes, is rated on a par with Malaysia because of a \"letter of support\" from the government, according to S&P. That support is effectively a state guarantee, said Tan Kim Eng, the rating company's senior director of sovereign ratings.\n\n\"Market prices likely reflect the significant uncertainty surrounding the company right now,\" Singapore-based Mr Tan said by phone on Feb 18.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/towards-asia-style-monetary-framework", "site_title": "Towards an Asia-style monetary framework", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTowards an Asia-style monetary framework\n\nMany methods for shoring up financial and monetary stability now practised by central banks around the world were tried and tested in the region over the past 20 years.\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 24, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nTHE cacophonous aftermath of the global financial crisis has prompted a substantial rethink of international economic policy doctrine. We are moving away from a near-universal belief in the beneficial effects of unfettered capital movements towards a much more managed system of world money. Many of the characteristics of this new framework bear the \"made in Asia\" hallmark.\n\nIn a decidedly imperfect world, this is a fortunate development. It holds out the prospect that the global economy may be better run in the next 20 years than in the last two decades.\n\nMany methods for shoring up financial and monetary stability now practised by finance ministries and central banks around the world were tried and tested in different ways in Asia over the past 20 years. At the time, they attracted criticism, disdain and revilement. Now there is growing recognition that they are the best available means for dealing with multiple sources of uncertainty. These shifts are surfacing at a time when coordination between different monetary authorities remains fractured and impaired, underlined by the different approaches to overcoming the lingering financial crisis in Europe, Asia and the United States.\n\nThe tussle over Greek austerity, the worrying global repercussions of US credit tightening, the discord over Switzerland's abandonment of its currency peg, the complexities of the Bank of Japan's and now the European Central Bank's quantitative easing - all these are signs that international policymakers are marching in different directions.\n\nOne of the biggest U-turns in the international rule book concerns capital controls - once taboo, they are now seen as part of a comprehensive set of tools to maintain stability. During the Asian financial crisis in 1997-98, international policymakers, especially in the US, roundly condemned Malaysia's use of capital controls to restrict outflows. This was widely vilified as contrary to the positive functioning of markets and efficient allocation of resources.\n\nThe complaints were both wounding for those on the receiving end and almost completely misguided, for - far from in some way inhibiting growth by distorting markets - these controls spurred Malaysia's recovery. The reality has now sunk in that such measures, far from producing negative results, could prove advantageous in countering the natural tendency of markets to overshoot with damaging results.\n\nThe wider international community recognised the legitimate use of such measures in a landmark statement by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in December 2012. The IMF's welcome for what it described, with due obfuscation, as \"capital flow management measures\", cannot hide the reality that the IMF is sanctioning, mainly on a temporary basis, control schemes that it previously rejected. It cannot have escaped international policymakers' attention that Cyprus remains part of the euro area only because capital controls were imposed, allegedly on a temporary bas+is, in the banking crisis of spring 2013 - and these are continuing. Some form of capital control could be necessary in Greece, as well, depending on how the stand-off over Greek debt ends.\n\nAnother area where the Western world has swung round to the Asian point of view concerns competitive monetary easing to bring about currency weakness to help stimulate below-par economic performance. This is now a fact of life in jurisdictions like the euro area which previously adhered to the strictest monetary orthodoxy. Clearly not every currency can depreciate against other currencies all the time. But policymakers appear to have accepted that different currencies should go through bouts of depreciation - with the yen and, now, the euro the latest candidates - as a means of raising dangerously low inflation and of bolstering GDP through exports.\n\nFOREIGN RESERVES CUSHION\n\nThis follows a line pioneered with Asian currencies that were floated after the 1997-98 financial crisis. Their central banks set interest rates lower than economic fundamentals warranted, because high rates risked attracting more inflows and pushing domestic currencies up. Japan joined the trend with accelerated quantitative easing in early 2013. If it got out of hand, this could exacerbate so-called \"currency wars\", especially if the euro remains weak and the yuan becomes part of the movement. However, if such depreciation helps overcome economic weakness, it could have a salutary effect and then later be reversed.\n\nLinked to tacit acceptance for such currency fluctuations is another Asian-style phenomenon that has gained a wider following: policies to raise foreign reserves as an instrument of self-insurance against capital outflows. For Asians, the need to build up a cushion of foreign reserves was a major lesson of the Asian crisis. This is a policy that has been followed by a wide range of countries, including industrialised nations as diverse as the UK, Poland and Denmark. Foreign exchange reserves have risen significantly, too, in Switzerland, in the wake of massive Asian-style currency intervention to cope with the Swiss franc's excessive appreciation pressure against the euro. Such policies cannot last forever, and the Swiss had to abandon the peg in January under the influence of continuing large foreign exchange inflows. But the sheer scale, speed and inherent volatility of capital flows, fuelled by much larger trading volumes and numbers of financial market participants, make intervention more necessary than in the past.\n\nPressed by sharp increases in foreign reserves, the Swiss National Bank has joined the move to diversify asset holdings to offset the risks of holding too many dollars or euros. This development was pioneered by Asian central banks, particularly in building up stocks of Asian currencies. This trend has now spread, including the yuan in its scope, with even the Bank of England an adherent of holding the Chinese currency in the UK reserves.\n\nWe see convergence with Asian trends in other areas too. Many countries regard as a necessity drawing monetary policy and financial stability closer together, as seen in a range of central banks including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. During the global crisis, central banks played a critical role in providing liquidity assistance to prevent the collapse of financial institutions for which they had no regulatory responsibilities. In fact, there is considerable logic in combining the prudential regulation of systemically important financial institutions with central banks' lender of last resort function.\n\nThis rethinking of central banks' mandate represented a reversion to a norm traditional in Asia. Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore never followed the Bank of England's post-1997 example of separating prudential oversight. Even those central banks which did spin off supervision in the intervening years (as in the case of the Bank of Korea) now take an ever bigger role in ensuring financial stability.\n\nIn the same way, supplementing monetary policy with macroprudential tools to deal with asset bubbles was seen in many Western countries as a new concept. But Asian countries had used these instruments at a micro level over many years to rein in credit growth, dampen excess leverage and restrain asset bubbles under the old name of \"prudential regulation\".\n\nThe international policy consensus has now shifted to encompass such changes. If such policies gain greater traction and produce results, then this bodes well for a more cooperative and cohesive financial system over the next decade.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He loves how they smell. He loves scribbling in the margins, underlining interesting sentences, folding a page corner to mark his place.\n\nMr Schembari is not a retiree who sips afternoon tea at Politics & Prose or some other bookstore. He is 20, a junior at American University, and paging through a thick history of Israel between classes, he is evidence of a peculiar irony of the Internet Age: Digital natives prefer reading in print.\n\n\"I like the feeling of it,\" Mr Schembari said, reading in a campus atrium, his iPhone next to him. \"I like holding it. It's not going off. It's not making sounds.\"\n\nTextbook makers, bookstore owners and college student surveys all say millennials still strongly prefer print for pleasure and learning, a bias that surprises reading experts given the same group's proclivity to consume most other content digitally. A University of Washington pilot study of digital textbooks found that a quarter of students still bought print versions of e-textbooks that they were given for free.\n\n\"These are people who aren't supposed to remember what it's like to even smell books,\" said Naomi Baron, an American University linguist who studies digital communication. \"It's quite astounding.\"\n\nEarlier this month, she published Words Onscreen: The Fate of Reading in a Digital World, a book (hardcover and electronic) that examines university students' preferences for print and explains the science of why dead-tree versions are often superior to digital: Readers tend to skim on screens, distraction is inevitable and comprehension suffers.\n\nIn years of surveys, Ms Baron asked students what they liked least about reading in print. Her favourite response: \"It takes me longer because I read more carefully.\"\n\nThe preference for print over digital can be found at independent bookstores such as the Curious Iguana in Frederick, Maryland, where owner Marlene England said millennials regularly tell her they prefer print because it's \"easier to follow stories\". Studies by Pew Research Center show that the highest print readership rates are among those aged 18 to 29, and the same age group is still using public libraries in large numbers.\n\nIt can also be seen in the struggle of college textbook makers to shift their businesses to more profitable e-versions. Don Kilburn, North American president for Pearson, the largest publisher in the world and the dominant player in education, said the move to digital \"doesn't look like a revolution right now; it looks like an evolution, and it's lumpy at best\".\n\nAnd it can be seen most prominently on US college campuses, where students still lug backpacks stuffed with books, even as they increasingly take notes (or check Facebook) on laptops during class.\n\nAt American, Cooper Nordquist, a junior studying political science, is even willing to schlep around Alexis de Tocqueville's 900-plus-page Democracy in America. \"I can't imagine reading Tocqueville or understanding him electronically,\" he said in between classes while checking his e-mail. \"That would just be awful.\"\n\nWithout having read Ms Baron's book, he offered reasons for his print preference that squared with her findings. The most important one to him is \"building a physical map in my mind of where things are\".\n\nResearchers say readers remember the location of information simply by page and text layout - that, say, the key piece of dialogue was on that page early in the book with that one long paragraph and a smudge on the corner. Researchers think this plays a key role in comprehension.\n\nBut that is more difficult on screens, primarily because the time we devote to reading online is usually spent scanning and skimming, with few places (or little time) for mental markers. Ms Baron cites research showing that readers spend a little more than one minute on web pages, and only 16 per cent of people read word-by-word. That behaviour can bleed into reading patterns when trying to tackle even lengthier texts on-screen.\n\n\"I don't absorb as much,\" one student told her. Another said: \"It's harder to keep your place online.\"\n\nAnother significant problem, especially for college students, is distraction. The lives of millennials are increasingly lived on screens. In her surveys, Ms Baron writes, she found \"jaw-dropping\" results to the question of whether students were more likely to multitask in hardcopy (one per cent) versus reading on-screen (90 per cent).\n\nEarlier this month, while speaking to sophomores about digital behaviour, Ms Baron brought up the problem of paying close attention while studying on-screen.\n\n\"You just get so distracted,\" one student said. \"It's like if I finish a paragraph, I'll go on Tumblr, and then three hours later you're still not done with reading.\"\n\nThere are quirky, possibly lazy, reasons many college students prefer print, too. They like renting textbooks that are already highlighted and have notes in the margins. While Mr Nordquist called this a crapshoot, Wallis Neff, a sophomore studying journalism, said she was delighted to get a psychology textbook last year that had been \"run through the mill a few times.\" \"It had a bunch of notes and things explaining what this versus that was,\" she said. \"It was very useful.\"\n\nWhen do students say they prefer digital? For science and math classes, whose electronic textbooks often include access to online portals that help walk them through study problems and monitor their learning. Textbook makers are pushing these \"digital learning environments\" to make screen learning more attractive.\n\nThey prefer them for classes in which locating information quickly is key - there is no control-F in a printed book to quickly find key words.\n\nAnd they prefer them for cost - particularly when the price is free. The Book Industry Study Group recently found that about a quarter of 1,600 students polled either downloaded or knew someone who downloaded pirated textbooks. Students, it turns out, are not as noble in their reading habits when they need beer money. They become knowledge thieves.\n\nBut stealing texts probably is more a reflection on the spiralling cost of higher education - and the price of textbooks, up 82 per cent from 2002 to 2012 - than some secret desire of students to read digitally. If price weren't a factor, Ms Baron's research shows that students overwhelmingly prefer print. Other studies show similar results.\n\nThe problem, Ms Baron writes, is that there has been \"pedagogical reboot\" where faculty and textbook makers are increasingly pushing students to digital to help defray costs \"with little thought for educational consequences\".\n\n\"We need to think more carefully about students' mounting rejection of long-form reading,\" Ms Baron writes.\n\nAnd that thinking shouldn't be limited to millennials, she said. Around the US, school systems are buying millions of tablets and laptops for classroom use, promising easier textbook updates, lower costs, less back strain from heavy backpacks, and more interactivity. But the potential downsides aren't being considered, she argued.\n\n\"What's happening in American education today?\" she said. \"That's what I'm concerned about. What's happening to the American mind?\" WP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Moderate growth, subdued inflation and global risks suggest monetary policy should be supporting growth. But Auckland house prices, which rose nearly 16 per cent over the past year, suggest the RBNZ should tighten,\" said Mr Eaqub.\n\nOn balance, the RBNZ could not justify any changes to the official cash rate, sitting on 3.5 per cent this year, \"but they should and will unleash macro-prudential tools to dampen a superheated Auckland housing market\", he said.\n\nThe RBNZ tightened mortgage lending controls in October 2013, saying the runaway Auckland housing market was a threat to the country's financial stability, but price rises have failed to slow significantly.\n\nCritics say immigration and lightly regulated overseas property purchases are fuelling prices.\n\nA separate report published on Tuesday showed New Zealand's near-term inflation expectations eased in the first quarter, retreating further from the midpoint of the central bank's target band, backing expectations that interest rates will be on hold well into next year.\n\nThe quarterly survey of expectations done on behalf of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) showed that business managers forecast annual inflation to average 1.11 per cent over the coming year, from 1.59 per cent in the previous survey in November.\n\nTwo-year inflation expectations - seen as the time frame when RBNZ policy action will filter through to prices - were 1.80 per cent from 2.06 per cent.\n\nThe central bank has halted its policy tightening because of receding inflation pressures, falling commodity prices, and global uncertainty, and is not expected to resume rate rises until the first half of next year.\n\nThe survey also showed that monetary policy was seen as easy and expected to stay so through the year, while growth expectations were steady, while unemployment is expected to fall further.

He added that the growing number of Chinese visitors has \"put pressure on the everyday life of Hong Kong residents\".\n\nResidents from 49 Chinese cities can currently apply for a multi-entry travel permit to visit Hong Kong.\n\nMr Leung said that the scheme would not be expanded and that he would raise the issue at the next meeting of the National People's Congress - China's parliament - at the beginning of March.\n\nHong Kongers have grown increasingly angry at the number of Chinese traders who travel to Hong Kong's border towns to stock up on everything from iPads to milk powder. Protests against the traders have led to violent clashes over recent weekends, with police using pepper spray.\n\nThe semi-autonomous southern city of seven million people is also a favourite shopping destination for wealthy mainland visitors eager to stock up on Western luxury brands.\n\nMass democracy protests at the end of last year also showed building anti-China sentiment, with tens of thousands protesting against Beijing's restrictions on the vote for Hong Kong's next leader.\n\nNegative sentiment has already led to a drop in visitors over Chinese New Year according to Hong Kong's Travel Industry Council (TIC), which said that it was the first decline in 20 years. Numbers fell 1.09 per cent to 842,124 for a six-day period, compared with the same period last year, immigration department figures show.\n\n\"I think the string of protests is one reason . . . The news reports about these kinds of activities certainly upsets their mood for travelling to Hong Kong,\" TIC executive director Joseph Tung told AFP. He called the drop \"alarming\" and said that Chinese visitors were travelling to other destinations which were more welcoming.\n\nBut democratic lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki said that further curbs were needed. He said that an increased number of mainland visitors had \"severely hampered\" the city's transportation system, and it was harder for people to shop for daily necessities as stores focused on the needs of mainland tourists.\n\n\"If Hong Kong is unable to accommodate the requests or to change the policy a bit to alleviate the grievances, this could easily turn into more violent incidents like in the past few weeks,\" Mr Kwok said.

On the one hand you have the likes of A Gary Shilling who, in a recent Bloomberg article, loudly trumpets the prospect of oil at US$10 a barrel, and on the other there is T Boone Pickens, who, at the end of last year was predicting a return to US$100 within 12-18 months. Pickens' prediction has moderated somewhat as WTI and Brent crude have continued to fall, but in January he was still saying that oil would return to US$70 or US$80 per barrel in the near future. So, who is correct?\n\nThe answer is neither one. As with most things in life it is unlikely that the truth lies at either extreme. Mr Pickens, and Mr Shilling and other commentators suggesting that oil will fall to levels not seen since 1998, purport to have sound reasons for saying what they do, but the real reasons for such comments are most likely the two oldest human motivations in the book, greed and hubris.\n\n\"Talking your book\" is nothing new in financial markets and, while Mr Pickens has an insider's knowledge of the oil business, he also has a massive stake in driving oil higher however he can. Mr Shilling is in the business of garnering eyeballs and clicks, hence the competition for the most outrageous prediction among the bears.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/6a730d7d3c07f1dbacaa4815bf875a622403c0f1aa9f7752c8b455b2494f8d2e?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The most likely scenario is that WTI futures will bounce around current levels for a while before gradually recovering to the US$60-70 per barrel level."}]}

Cat E, the open category, stands at S$67,901, while Cat C, for goods vehicles and buses, costs S$53,202. Cat D, the motorcycle category, is at an all-time high of S$5,800.\n\nOn the other hand, motor vehicle taxes refer to the Additional Registration Fee, which is the tax incurred when registering a vehicle and is separate from customs duty. The ARF for cars became a progressive tax in February 2013 from a flat tax of 100 per cent of the OMV or open market value. Under the tiered structure, the ARF for cars with OMVs of up to $20,000 is 100 per cent, with the next $30,000 of the OMV attracting an ARF rate of 140 per cent, while any value beyond $50,000 is levied an ARF rate of 180 per cent.\n\nAfter the tiered ARF structure was introduced, FY13's motor vehicle taxes actually fell 8.5 per cent to S$1.65 billion from FY12's S$1.803 billion, mainly because of a roughly 20 per cent drop in car registrations. But motor vehicle taxes bounced back up to S$1.81 billion in FY14, or 9.8 per cent, with an approximately 30 per cent increase in car registrations.\n\nVehicle quota premiums did not experience the same dip. They have been rising since FY\n\n08.\n\nWith this year's expected spike in the COE quota - seen to be anywhere between 50 and 75 per cent for passenger cars - it is no surprise that the government is projecting a 38.7 per cent increase in vehicle quota premium revenue, and a 17 per cent rise in motor vehicle taxes.\n\n\"The COE quota will double but COE prices won't fall by half, so of course there will be a revenue increase,\" said the managing director of a luxury dealership.\n\n\"And now that the CEVS bands and surcharges will be tightened in July, the rush to buy a new car is sure to push COE premiums up,\"' he said, referring to the Carbon Emission-based Vehicle Scheme (CEVS), which will be extended for another two years from July 1, 2015, but with two refinements. They involve the rebates requiring reduced carbon dioxide limits, and surcharges on gas-guzzling cars increasing for lower emissions.\n\nCorrection:\n\nAn earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that \"Vehicle quota premiums did not experience the same dip. They have been rising since FY06''. The year is in fact FY08. The article above has been revised to reflect this.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And the proposed rules provide a new focus of lobbying efforts.\n\nIf approved as written, the new FAA rules would lift the near-ban on flying drones for commercial purposes, but its restrictions would make many business applications, such as package delivery, unfeasible. Among other constraints, the proposed rules would limit commercial drones to an altitude of 500 feet (about 152 metres), allow flights only during daytime hours and require operators to keep the aircraft in their sights at all times. Drones could not be flown near airports or directly over people. Officials say these precautions are needed for safety.\n\nBut dronemakers and other firms with a stake in unmanned aircraft technology say they are already working on features that would allow drones to \"sense and avoid\" obstacles including other aircraft and prevent link disruptions that could cause a drone to lose contact with ground operations. For example, Amazon.com is developing autonomous drones that would navigate via GPS and use redundant safety mechanisms and sensor arrays to avoid accidents as part of a \"Prime Air\" drone delivery service it hopes to launch.\n\nIndustry representatives say they will use the 60-day comment period to try to convince regulators that breakthrough safety features could make drone flights safe and dependable. \"This is the chance for all the parties who think the FAA got it wrong to come forward and say why,\" said Jack Schenendorf, a former House Transportation Committee staff who now works for law firm Covington & Burling.\n\nThe ban on most commercial drone flights will stay in place until the FAA finalises its proposed rules - which could take anywhere from nine months to three years. During that period, companies can continue to apply for exemptions to use drones under strict rules. But the FAA has so far granted only 28 of more than 325 exemption requests, according to government documents.\n\nAmazon, which applied for an exemption to allow outdoor testing at its own US facilities last summer, says it has not yet received approval from the agency. It has been testing a number of drone configurations at facilities in Washington state, Britain and Israel. But only in Britain has the company been able to conduct outdoor tests that it says are vital to its goal of developing a prototype that can be demonstrated to the FAA.\n\nMeanwhile, a coalition of news media companies including NBC, The New York Times and Thomson Reuters hopes to test news-gathering drones in coming months at an FAA site in Virginia.\n\nSeparate forecasts by government and industry officials expect businesses to invest nearly US$90 billion in drones worldwide over the next 10 years, as the technology takes root in hundreds of markets that now rely on manned flights or ground operations for activities ranging from pipeline inspections to aerial photography.\n\nThe number of companies and groups involved in drone lobbying now exceeds 50. Senate documents show a broad range of parties from high-tech and aerospace manufacturers to electric utilities, realtors, filmmakers, universities, labour unions, state governments and broadcasters.\n\nBusiness interests have a potentially powerful lever in Congress, which must reauthorise the FAA's funding and regulatory direction by the end of September. That process allows lawmakers to direct regulatory agencies to take specific actions. For example, the last reauthorisation in 2012 directed the FAA to pursue rule-making on drones.\n\nSome influential allies in Congress have already begun questioning the proposed rules. US Senator Charles Schumer said last week that the FAA's \"line of sight\" rule appears to be a \"concerning limitation on commercial usage, and this proposed rule should be modified\". Regulators may be difficult to convince, however. \"The FAA is going to be very conservative because they don't want an airliner hitting one of these things,\" said Phil Finnegan, director of corporate analysis at research firm the Teal Group.

Back in 2006/2007, he had stated that the group wanted to be a pure real estate company. \"We don't want to be a hybrid company, a half-breed - half real estate, half financial,\" he had said then. He was alluding to the likes of rivals CapitaLand and Keppel Land that were making bold moves on the asset monetisation and property fund management fronts.\n\nBack then, CDL was sometimes dubbed an old-fashioned, asset-heavy \"brick-and-mortar\" property group, ie, one involved in the traditional business of property development and long-term ownership of investment properties for rental income - unlike its competitors which were going asset-light by spinning property funds that they sponsored and to which they divested some of their properties, while also raising some equity for these funds from third parties.\n\nAt the same time, they had started building up a fee-income base from fund management activities to provide stabilisation to earnings and high returns on equity.\n\nBack then, Mr Kwek had also questioned the need for the group to go overseas when it could make a lot more money in Singapore.\n\nThese days, CDL seems to be taking a route that it had avoided eight years ago.\n\nLast December, it syndicated the cash flow from its completed Quayside Collection project on Sentosa Cove in partnership with Blackstone and CIMB, raising more than S$1 billion which it can deploy for overseas acquisitions.\n\nIn January 2014, CDL appointed Grant Kelley - formerly from Apollo Global Management and Colony Capital Asia - to the newly minted CEO post, and there has been much hype about his arrival expediting the group's move towards fund management.\n\nWhat has brought about this change in strategy at the 52-year-old group?\n\nFor one, CDL probably needs a new story to wow the market. In the past, one of CDL's attractions was being a proxy for the Singapore residential market. That was fine when the market was flying. Successive rounds of property cooling measures topped by the implementation of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) in June 2013 have dampened property demand in Singapore.\n\nDemand for luxury homes here has also been battered by the 15 per cent additional buyer's stamp duty on foreign buyers. Mr Kwek last week said that the high-end residential property market in Singapore \"\n\nshould turn around within a short period of one, two years\n\n; it should blossom three years or four years down the road\". Instead of waiting for this length of time for a price improvement at The Residences at W Singapore - Sentosa Cove, the group decided to unlock present and future cash flow from the Quayside Collection, a hotel, retail and residential mixed development in the upscale waterfront housing locale that includes The Residences at W Singapore. The money raised from the profit participation securities (or PPS) structure will strengthen the group's cash hoard and help it expand in overseas markets, as the Singapore property sector continues to face headwinds.\n\nLast year, the property and hotel group made about S$1.3 billion in overseas acquisitions and the figure could hover around S$1 billion annually; the focus will be on the US, the UK, Japan, China and Australia.\n\nAnother reason CDL needs to embark on a fund management model is that if it does not, it will end up being small relative to those who have embraced this path, such as CapitaLand and Keppel Land. The latter are scaling up their assets under management (AUM) size, and growing their fee-income engine from fund management. And relying on one's own balance sheet to grow the AUM size will be slower than roping in third-party capital as well.\n\nFrom a capital management stance, the argument for growing fee income is that it helps to stabilise earnings - compared with relying purely on property development, where earnings tend to be lumpy, dependent on the vagaries of market conditions and the timeline for a project's development.\n\nMoreover, fee income from fund management also enhances returns on equity since such fee generation does not involve tapping a lot of equity. In contrast, a heavily property development model is highly capital-intensive, taking a few years for a development to be completed and sold before the capital may be recycled.\n\nOne could compliment CDL and Mr Kwek for being nimble in adapting to the new business climate. But to what extent will they succeed in transforming the group's business model?\n\nCDL is not entirely new to fund management, having floated Singapore's first hotel real estate investment trust (Reit) in 2006; but the group has not listed any further Reits. A question on market watchers' minds would be why has CDL not pooled its Singapore office buildings - may be even adding its malls - and spun off a Singapore commercial property Reit?\n\nIf the group is serious about adopting a fund management model, that would be an obvious low-hanging fruit in its own backyard waiting to be plucked. One issue could be that most of its existing office properties - except for the newly completed South Beach Tower - are older assets with Grade B office specifications.\n\nOther factors may also be at play that could affect whether CDL can successfully pull off its new strategy. On the positive side, the group has a strong track record in property development. This could appeal to investors looking to park money in any development-type fund that CDL may set up, for instance. The group also has a few decades of experience in the hotel business; it controls London-listed Millennium & Copthorne Hotels.\n\nMr Kwek has a very hands-on management approach. Such centralised management is natural given that the Kwek family has majority control of CDL. Mr Kwek's style of keeping a firm grip on the company's operations may also give comfort to shareholders who may feel assured that the company is being run well by someone who has a big personal stake in its success. However, to develop the new business model of funds management and overseas expansion, a decentralisation of management may be needed.\n\nCDL will need to build a strong management bench in the new businesses and geographical markets it plans to operate in. Will Mr Kwek be prepared to make a sea change in his management style? This could help the group play catch-up with its peers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some gold traders claim they were harmed by a scheme to manipulate the fix.\n\nThe banks operating the precious metals benchmarks, known as the fixes, said last year they would no longer administer that process.\n\nAn electronic daily silver price benchmark is now administered by Thomson Reuters and CME Group, while the London Metal Exchange provides twice-daily benchmark platinum and palladium prices.\n\nICE Benchmark Administration will run an electronic gold price benchmark from March 20 to replace the London gold fix.\n\nSwitzerland's financial watchdog said in November it had found a \"clear attempt\" to manipulate precious metals price benchmarks. An investigation by German regulator Bafin found no signs of attempted benchmark price manipulation in precious metals, newspaper Handelsblatt reported last month.

He's fallen behind his yardstick, and he's got lots of company. Stock pickers including Donald Yacktman at the AMG Yacktman Fund and the team of O Mason Hawkins and G Staley Cates at the Longleaf Partners Fund trailed their barometers in the same period after dominating in the prior decade.\n\nManagers say they haven't changed, the market has. The easy money climate of near-zero interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve has artificially inflated prices of lower-quality US stocks, they say, punishing those who focus on businesses with the best fundamentals.\n\nAt the same time, the relentless climb of prices across equity markets has left them with few chances to sniff out bargains or show what they can do in more-volatile times. \"In straight-up markets you don't need active managers,\" Mr D'Alelio said. \"If the next five years are the same, there won't be any active managers left.\"\n\nSome 20 per cent of mutual funds that pick US stocks beat their main benchmarks in 2014, and 21 per cent topped the indices in the five years ended Dec 31, according to data from Chicago- based Morningstar Inc. Over 10 and 15 years, the winners rise to 34 per cent and 58 per cent, respectively.\n\nInvestors have expressed their displeasure by moving money to low-cost funds that mimic indices. In 2014, actively run US stock funds suffered US$98 billion in redemptions, while index funds took in US$167 billion. Passive managers represent 38 per cent of the US$8.7 trillion stock fund business, more than twice their share 10 years earlier, Morningstar data show.\n\nThe shift may be ill-timed if the herd mentality comes to an end. Lagging behind the market will motivate managers to change their investment process and common sense will prevail as the economic cycle ages and fundamentals are rewarded, Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in the firm's 2015 outlook published in December.\n\n\"From our lens, this means a prolonged period of active investing is upon us, thereby overtaking the macro or index-biased ways that have engulfed investing the past 15 years,\" Mr Belski wrote.\n\nRoyce Funds, the small-cap stock unit of Baltimore-based Legg Mason Inc, is undeterred after more than US$17 billion in redemptions during the past four years. The US$4.9 billion Royce Premier Fund beat 97 per cent of rivals over 15 years, a number that drops to 7 per cent over five years, Morningstar data show.\n\n\"We have been using the same process to pick stocks for 40 years and we have confidence in it,\" said Frank Gannon, co-chief investment officer for Royce.\n\nIn his view, the Fed keeping interest rates near zero for the past six years has had the \"unintended consequence\" of boosting the stocks of companies with heavy debt and little or no earnings. Typically after a recession, such companies lose out to firms that generate more cash and have better balance sheets. This time, no \"Darwinian\" shake-out happened and low-quality stocks ruled, Mr Gannon said.\n\n\"There has certainly been little reward for owning high-return, superior business models that are conservatively financed,\" Neuberger Berman's small-cap stock team wrote in an October 2013 paper titled \"Is There Hope for Active Managers?\"\n\nStocks have moved in lockstep to an unusual degree since the 2008 financial crisis, a handicap for managers seeking to exploit market inefficiencies.\n\nMonthly dispersion among Standard & Poor's 500 Index members, a measure of how far individual stocks are swinging relative to the market, narrowed for a fifth year in 2014 and in August reached the lowest level since 1979, data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bloomberg show.\n\nAs stocks started moving more on their own this year, 46 per cent of active managers were beating their benchmarks as at Jan 31, according to Morningstar.\n\nRegardless of whether the trend is turning, Jeff Tjornehoj, an analyst with Denver-based fund tracker Lipper, doesn't buy the idea that certain types of markets are tougher on stock pickers. \"It sounds like a team complaining about the rain when everyone has to play under the same weather,\" Mr Tjornehoj said.\n\nJim Rowley, a senior analyst at Vanguard Group Inc, is also dubious of high stock correlation as an explanation. In each of the last eight years, at least 70 per cent of the stocks in the broad Russell 3000 Index either beat or underperformed that benchmark by 10 percentage points or more, according to Mr Rowley, whose firm is known for championing index funds. \"That would suggest there has been ample opportunity to pick winners and losers,\" Mr Rowley said.\n\nStock pickers also complain that markets have essentially gone up for six consecutive years, excepting a flat 2011. \"People speak as if we have gone through a whole cycle,\" said Neuberger's Mr D'Alelio. \"Show me a cycle where stocks go straight up with no corrections.\"\n\nThe lack of market corrections has hurt Mr Yacktman, who in 2009 was a finalist for Morningstar's manager of the decade award.\n\n\"A lot of our outperformance comes in difficult environments,\" said Jason Subotky, a co-manager on the US$13.9 billion AMG Yacktman Fund and the US$10.9 billion AMG Yacktman Focused Fund.\n\nThe Yacktman Fund, after beating competitors in the market sell-offs of 2002 and 2008, has averaged annual returns of more than 13 per cent in the past 15 calendar years, handily beating the S&P 500.\n\nOver the past five years, the fund trails the benchmark. Investors withdrew US$1.7 billion in 2014, according to Morningstar estimates. The market is reminiscent of the late 1990s, say Mr Hawkins and Mr Cates, who have overseen the US$7.5 billion Longleaf Partners Fund for more than two decades and still have a top 15- year record.\n\nThen, as now, stocks marched higher \"while fundamentals mattered little\", the pair told shareholders in a January letter. Once the dotcom bubble burst in 2000, stock pickers eventually regained favour. \"At this moment of relative weak performance with active management in disrepute, our optimism about future relative performance is exceptionally high,\" the two wrote.\n\nOthers who have cooled off say their approach will win the day again, whenever that day comes. \"History shows that sticking to your discipline is a good thing to do,\" said Eric Schoenstein, who is part of the team running the US$5.6 billion Jensen Quality Growth Fund.\n\n\"This is setting up as an ideal environment for stock pickers,\" said Neuberger's Mr D'Alelio.

The measure, known as mandatory buy-in, would prompt dealers to double the gap between the prices at which they will buy or sell the most-liquid government bonds, while corporate bond markets risk drying up completely, according to a study by the International Capital Market Association published on Monday.\n\nRegulators' efforts to rein in banks' risk taking and ensure they hold more capital have boosted the cost to dealers of warehousing bonds, discouraging them from holding large inventories of the assets. The result is that when an investor calls with an order, market makers may not own the securities they are selling, triggering a buy-in if the deal isn't completed quickly.\n\n\"A mandatory buy-in regime, if applied to today's markets, would result in over 1.8 million buy-ins being executed per annum, representing a total transaction value of 2.5 trillion euros (S$3.8 trillion),\" according to the ICMA study, which was led by Andy Hill, London-based director of market practice and regulatory policy at the lobby group.\n\n\"The inevitable increase in cost and decrease in liquidity that mandatory buy-ins will forge will be borne not by the banks and broker-dealers but by investors,\" it said.\n\nEU legislators adopted the buy-in rules, due to be implemented at the start of next year, in 2014 as part of a push to make the bloc's trading systems more resilient to crises. Michel Barnier, the EU's financial services commissioner at that time, said in April 2014 that the legislation would mean that trade settlement \"is carried out in a safer and more efficient manner\".\n\nThe new rule will deter dealers from making markets because they will face \"unpredictable, and so largely unquantifiable\" costs, according to the study. \"Market makers will be forced to add a premium to their market offers, or may simply choose not to show offers in certain securities,\" the report said.\n\nAt present, on most markets buy-ins are a rarely-used option, according to the study. The EU legislation will make them compulsory, with thresholds of as low as four business days before a procedure kicks in.

A common problem new companies often face is fund-raising the traditional way as they have not been established with a track record or collaterals. But many of them show promise, and their lack of a track record and collaterals is a risk that investors will have to take,\" said Isaac Ho, managing partner of private investment firm Singapore Health Tech (SHT).\n\nA challenge, said Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder of Monk's Hill Ventures, will be to see enough bank partners participate in the programme, although he noted that DBS had in early February announced a venture debt programme and Temasek Holdings in January acquired Silicon Valley Bank India's venture debt business.\n\n\"I am looking forward to this gaining traction and burnishing Singapore's reputation as the region's startup and innovation financing capital,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nFor that to happen, banks will need to re-examine their method of determining creditworthiness, said Christopher Quek, director of Angel's Gate Advisory. \"Banks still expect very clear profitable business outcomes and founders to do personal guarantees before they are willing to lend. Despite the risk sharing by the government, it doesn't encourage the banks to loan to high-risk ventures. Considering startups with limited revenues and financially-weak founders, this scheme will have limited application within the ecosystem.\"\n\nIn fact, Mr Quek's view is that Budget 2015 is highly focused on startups that are seeking at least S$1 million in funding, and not so much those in the idea or pre-seed stage that are seeking not more than S$500,000.\n\n\"There is sufficient seed to Series A funding in the Singapore ecosystem; what's lacking is the initial high-risk angel funding. Many VCs and investors I spoke to who have been lamenting the lack of startup deal-flow here have turned to overseas to invest their money,\" he shared.\n\nEven so, Mr Quek applauded the government's move to expand the National Research Fund (NRF) by S$1 billion, saying this will benefit startups in the medtech and hardware engineering sectors, which usually require more capital and time to commercialise their innovations.\n\nICT (information and communications technology) startups, in comparison, will not benefit as much because they do not produce significant intellectual property, he noted.\n\nMeanwhile, increasing the co-investment cap under the Startup Enterprise Development Scheme and Business Angel Scheme (BAS) such that early-stage companies can each receive up to S$4 million in total funding raised, and awarding the BAS an additional S$75 million to partner more angel investors, not only provide startups access to more capital but mentorship from investors - something SHT champions, said Mr Ho. \"With mentorship, startups also gain access to (their investors') networks to help build their profile and expand into high-growth markets like China,\" he added.\n\nLeslie Loh, managing director of Red Dot Ventures, concurred, saying that internationalisation will deliver growth capabilities for startups after they have validated their innovations at home. \"The enhancements to the Capability Development Grant, Partnerships for Capability Transformation and Collaborative Industry Projects programmes will collectively also create a supportive test-bedding environment to foster innovations in Singapore,\" said Mr Loh.\n\nImplementation of the various policies remains key, said NSI Ventures, a Singapore-based firm that invests in South-east Asian startups beyond the seed stage. \"Some early-stage schemes - with their legion of criteria - have put venture capital funds in a corner by narrowing their investment focus and imposing timing delays. This limits the attractiveness of the offering to VCs who just want to invest in the best companies or ideas.\"\n\nThe government's move to simplify the application process for many of these schemes was therefore welcomed by many players.\n\nConstraints notwithstanding, new research published in the Harvard Business Review last week showed that Singapore has demonstrated high levels of digital development and positioned itself to support innovation and entrepreneurship.\n\nSaid Hugh Mason, co-founder of startup accelerator JFDI-Asia: \"The measures announced in Budget 2015 show the government following through to create the right incentives for investors and startups to turn that positioning into action. I personally believe it's only a matter of a few months or a year before we see the first S$1 billion homegrown digital startup exit in South-east Asia.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The three-way merger in Malaysia between CIMB, RHB and MBSB, which collapsed recently, is no exception. Combining two banks is difficult enough. This involved three parties, one of which was a non-bank.\n\nThe stock market reaction to the collapse was quite telling. In the face of declining markets, the stock price of the banks rose, demonstrating the market's relief that the deal was not going through. There is much speculation about the cause of the collapse and it's unlikely if we will ever know which straw broke the camel's back. The more fundamental question is whether mergers within a market, ie, in-market mergers, where there is significant overlap of operations, make sense and can deliver value.\n\nMany reasons are put forward in support of these transactions. Size is often touted as a desired outcome. However, unless one of the banks is very small and subscale, size by itself renders little benefit. The ability to underwrite big deals, for example, on the back of a larger balance sheet comes with added risks. Undoubtedly market shares will increase when you add two businesses.\n\nBut value has to be extracted by skilful management and the benefits, if realised, accrue only over time. Transferring of superior skills in either risk or balance sheet management, or operations from one entity to the other, can help extract value only if one of the entities has vastly superior expertise than the other. If both banks are reasonably well-managed or similarly managed there is little opportunity to improve operations and to create value.\n\nIt may seem counter-intuitive but the pressure on revenues is initially down, not up. Corporate customers who had sought to diversify their banking relationships now find that they have become concentrated. Good clients who have access to bank capital seek to reduce their exposure and move some business away. Risk managers of the newly combined bank become concerned with concentration risk. They put pressure on reducing exposure to individual clients, which reduces revenues. Relationship managers and sales people become nervous about whether they will keep their job. They take their eyes off customers and revenue generation. You don't expect them to run hard if they are going to be out of a job.\n\nAIR OF UNCERTAINTY\n\nAnd with uncertainty swirling many of the best people run for the exits to where they can find security. As systems are merged and products are streamlined service delivery and customer satisfaction typically take a hit. If competitors are smart, and most are, they go after the best customers and best employees. Uncertainty provides opportunities to acquire talent and clients at a low cost. All this puts pressure on revenues of the merged entity. So where is the more certain source of value creation in such in-market bank mergers? It is in eliminating duplication and in reducing costs. Most in-market deals are a cost play, not a revenue play.\n\nValue creation that is predicated on reducing costs is easier said than done. Initially, pressures emerge to increase certain costs. Banks try and ringfence their most valued employees through various means such as guaranteed bonuses, etc, which puts upward pressure on compensation.\n\nSystems integration is notoriously problematic and costly. There are inevitable issues with customer service at a minimum, which increases costs directly and indirectly. Employees have to be let go. There is no getting around this fact. Not only are there costs associated with severance but the cost stemming from damaged morale is greater and more enduring. If employees are unionised, there are costs associated with the unions.\n\nAnd in certain countries there are political implications to making a large number of employees redundant. Often this limits the amount of rationalisation and cost savings that can be achieved. Extracting cost synergies, which appear easy on a spreadsheet, are incredibly hard to achieve in practice.\n\nA new organisation structure has to be unveiled. Managers and employees have got to get used to each other. This is where a host of other issues come up. Based on which individual is selected to run a particular area, it leads to notions of winners and losers. People internally begin jockeying for position. Focus shifts to personal survival at the expense of customers. Sometimes management tries to take the easy way out by nominating co-heads. This is usually a recipe for a bigger disaster. It creates more confusion on the ground and is not a sustainable long-term solution. All this adds to costs in terms of loss of productivity and focus.\n\nExtracting value in an in-market merger or acquisition is poised on a razor's edge. It requires exceptional management skill. Most management teams do not have prior experience in combining and rationalising different businesses. There is considerable expertise required in cutting out the fat without damaging the muscle or mistakenly cutting into the bone. The muted share price reaction to the CIMB/RHB/MBSB merger announcement and subsequent rise in prices to the news that the deal was off suggest that the market viewed the risks to be far greater than the benefits.\n\nIs it possible to walk the value creating tightrope and cross the chasm in in-market mergers or acquisitions? Probably, but with difficulty. The CEO and boards need to be very alert to the considerable execution risks of large transformational in-market deals. The promise of value creation can easily end in value destruction.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There's similarly nothing inherently dubious about living in Hong Kong, having Hong Kong citizenship, and opening a Swiss bank account to store some of your wealth. But when you're the chief executive of a British bank embroiled in a scandal about helping customers dodge taxes by hiding money in the bank's Swiss private wealth unit, it sure looks bad.\n\nHSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver oversees Europe's biggest bank by market value, a global behemoth that's celebrating its 150th birthday this year. There was not much cause for celebration in the bank's results published on Monday, however, or in the various wrongdoings regulators around the world have found it guilty of. And the timing of the latest revelations about Mr Gulliver's personal banking arrangements comes at a tricky time; the bank's chairman Douglas Flint has been summoned by members of the UK Parliament to testify to the Treasury Select Committee on Wednesday about his time as finance director.\n\nOn Monday, the Guardian newspaper reported Mr Gulliver's Panama connection via a company called Worcester Equities, and that in 2007 he had US$7.6 million in a Swiss account he set up in 1998.\n\nHSBC responded by saying the arrangements were for \"reasons of confidentiality\" and \"provided no tax or other advantage\". And while the bank said the Swiss account had been declared to the UK tax authorities for \"a number of years\", it declined to be more specific. So there's no way of knowing whether the account was declared when it was opened, a couple of years ago, or some time in between. It also seems odd to go to the trouble (and presumably expense) of setting up a company in Panama for anything other than tax reasons, but I guess we have to take HSBC's word for the probity of the set-up.\n\nThe disclosures come just weeks after the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists published details of how HSBC's Swiss arm regularly did business with tax evaders, drug dealers and arms traders. Belgian prosecutors have threatened to issue international arrest warrants for the bank's officers if they don't cooperate with a probe into tax dodging.\n\nHSBC's spin is that the Swiss affair is ancient history, and that it's cleaned up its act since then. Except, just last week HSBC's offices in Geneva were raided by Swiss prosecutor Yves Bertossa as part of an investigation into money laundering. No wonder investors have trashed the company's share price, with Monday's decline marking the biggest one-day slump since 2011.\n\nKen Macdonald, a former UK director of public prosecutions, told the Guardian that HSBC should face criminal charges in the UK on conspiracy to defraud, based on the evidence that's in the public domain: \"It seems clear, from the evidence we have seen, that there exists credible evidence that HSBC Swiss and/or its employees have engaged over many years in systematic and profitable collusion in serious criminal activity against the exchequers of a number of countries. It seems equally clear that this criminal activity has taken place within the context of an institutional cynicism that is deeply shocking.\"\n\nThe latest earnings report showed full-year pretax profit fell 17 per cent to US$18.7 billion, below the US$21.5 billion anticipated by analysts. Mr Gulliver abandoned his profitability targets, citing the burden of greater regulation. Operating expenses were 6.1 per cent higher last year than in 2013, with HSBC citing \"increased regulatory and compliance costs\". It's hard, though, to feel any sympathy. Those expenses also came in the form of penalties. HSBC paid US$550 million for \"the settlement agreement with the Federal Housing Finance Authority\". Another US$1.2 billion went for \"settlement and provisions in connection with foreign exchange investigations\". Yet another US$1.3 billion went to \"UK customer redress programmes\".\n\nIf banks could somehow resist the urge to fleece their customers every which way, maybe the heavy hand of regulation wouldn't press quite so firmly on their shoulders and their profitability.\n\nHSBC seems oddly lopsided for a bank that claims in its advertising to be \"the world's local bank\". An astonishing 78 per cent of its profit came from Asia, with Europe contributing just 3.2 per cent. And that's not an aberration; 2013's earnings were similarly skewed. A bank that's mostly UK regulated but makes the bulk of its money on the other side of the world is a bank that's bound to be opaque to its home authorities, no matter how much scrutiny they try to apply.\n\nReading between the lines of Monday's report, it seems clear that what HSBC fears most is being broken up. \"As our industry reshapes in response to public policy and regulatory directives, we now need to demonstrate, through clarity of our business model, the value to society of our scale and diversification,\" chairman Flint said in the earnings statement. Mr Gulliver told analysts on a conference call that breaking up the bank would destroy shareholder value.\n\nBack in 2009, Adair Turner, who was then the chief UK regulator as chairman of the Financial Services Authority, accused banks of growing \"beyond a reasonable size\" and becoming \"socially useless\". The cascade of recent revelations suggests HSBC still hasn't learned its lesson, and is more of a social menace than a social good.\n\nMr Gulliver's personal tax arrangements may not be illegal, but they are surely ill-advised and inappropriate. Unless Mr Flint pulls off an Oscar-worthy performance at Wednesday's parliamentary hearing, HSBC will only have itself to blame if the authorities decide the bank is too big to regulate, and respond by seeking its dismemberment.

With a boom in online shopping now in the nation of 1.2 billion people, Blue Dart Express is expanding.\n\nThe unit of DHL Express is adding a Boeing 757 freighter to its fleet of five in the country and building warehouses for sellers using portals such as Amazon.com and Flipkart.com, Malcolm Monteiro, chief executive officer of DHL eCommerce, said.\n\n\"Up to five years ago, you never had e-commerce figuring in BlueDart's list of top five verticals,\" said Mr Monteiro, who oversees all of Blue Dart's operations. \"Today, it is the largest vertical and demand is far outstripping supply.\"\n\nIndia's online retailing market has grown to about US$6 billion in five years, as free delivery and heavy discounting lure millions to buy everything from lingerie to furniture. Yet, e-commerce is just getting started. Online sales are likely to reach 3 per cent of the entire Indian retail market by 2020 from less than half a per cent now, PriceWaterhouseCoopers said in August.\n\nShares of the nation's major logistics and delivery companies have surged in the past 12 months, partly due to e-commerce demand. Blue Dart has more than doubled to 6,824.40 rupees, while Gati, in which Japan's Kintetsu World Express has a stake, has more than quadrupled to 249.80 rupees, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe demand is also spawning competition as startups take on established shippers with cheaper rates. New entrants Delhivery, Ecom Express and Gojavas have received millions of dollars in funding from venture capital and private equity firms, and are carving out low-cost delivery operations aimed solely at web retailers.\n\nBlue Dart meanwhile is betting customers will pay a premium for its services as its wide network developed over 31 years gives it an edge when flash sales and festival offers cause a surge in orders and expose chinks in its nimbler rivals.\n\nE-commerce sales in India hit an all-time high last year in October, and so did complaints from disgruntled customers on lost, delayed or stolen orders. There just weren't enough planes and employees to deliver the packages.\n\nBlue Dart is the only operator of domestic cargo-only jets in India, with five 757 planes in its fleet.\n\n\"Running an air cargo operation is not something every logistics company can do,\" Pragya Singh, associate vice-president of retail at consultant Technopak Advisors said. \"This is a capability they have and are using that to attract customers.\"\n\nRivals that rely on cargo space on commercial carriers are more susceptible to delays at distribution hubs, Ms Singh said. This bottleneck may get worse during festival seasons, when all seats are occupied, leaving less space for cargo.\n\nBlue Dart's near monopoly on cargo routes may be luring some commercial airliners as well. Jet Airways India, India's second-biggest carrier, plans to enter the air cargo business and may lease three planes from Etihad Airways, the Business Standard newspaper said on Monday.\n\nCourting e-commerce business would provide huge volumes for Blue Dart, but it could also increase the risk of delays for its core clients - premium business customers who are less forgiving.\n\nThe company, 75 per cent owned by Deutsche Post's DHL unit, gets its core profit from business-to-business transactions that place a premium on reliability and speed. Packages are often small and most customers' offices tend to be clustered in key business districts that are easy to access.\n\nE-commerce logistics is all about \"thin margins, low price points, and scattered delivery all over the country\", said Suvir Sujan, co-founder of Nexus Venture Partners, which was an early investor in Delhivery. There are more than 100,000 zipcodes in India, and logistics providers need to be prepared to deliver apparel or a pair of shoes anywhere.\n\nFor its part, Blue Dart keeps some of its business and e-commerce teams separate, so as to serve both sides of its operation, Mr Monteiro said. It also outsources some of the deliveries to keep costs low.\n\nThe company is also opening warehouses where sellers on e-commerce portals can store goods. Each time an order comes in, the product is packed and shipped to the consumer, saving time as the couriers don't have to go to the seller's location to pick up the item.

Among the ETFs named are an industrial metals spot fund, a crude oil spot fund, and a natural gas spot fund.\n\nThe commission approved the rule change last week, with members noting that exchange's proposal to list and trade the funds is consistent with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations applicable to a national securities exchange. The adoption of new listing standards specific to the paired class shares is necessary before the AccuShares funds can start trading.\n\nAt the heart of Ms Stein's concern is the complexity of the funds, which would require investors to be extra vigilant in monitoring their investments, and the potential harm to investors who may not fully understand how the funds operate.\n\nBut her concerns about the approval of new listing standards, which will enable the funds to trade, extend beyond the AccuShares decision alone and call for a more thorough review process for other similarly risky and complex products.\n\n\"We need a more thoughtful, transparent, and fulsome review process for these types of ETFs, even if it means disapproving proposed rules changes until we get comfortable\" with such products, Ms Stein wrote in the statement on Monday.\n\nShe noted that a more rigorous review process is especially necessary because making a rule change clears the path for other \"copycat\" products to enter the market.

The result was an 11 per cent year-on-year drop in adex and a 4 per cent drop quarter on quarter.\n\nAllianceDBS Research, which has a \"hold\" call on media stocks, said: \"This suggests advertisers are starting to scale back spending in the belief that it is unlikely to boost sales in the current weak environment.\"\n\nThe year-on-year decline in the final quarter was broad-based; the two main advertising mediums, free-to-air TV and newspapers, reported double-digit adex falls of 12 and 11 per cent respectively. Adex fell by about a 10th in the magazine and cinema segments.\n\nBut full-year adex figures were more encouraging for Pay-TV, which clocked 10 per cent growth, and the cinemas, where growth was 16 per cent. In the Pay-TV segment, where Astro is the runaway leader with more than 90 per cent market share, advertisers spent RM5.4 billion (S$2 billion) last year. This was followed by newspapers, which pulled in RM4.65 billion in adex last year, though this was only a marginal 1.6 per cent growth.\n\nEven so, AllianceDBS analyst Toh Woo Kim foresees challenges ahead for Astro, because Pay-TV subscriber additions turned negative in the third quarter ended October. Its net churn was 7,000, versus 16,000 net adds in the preceding quarter. \"Given the weak environment, some customers are reducing their spending and have switched to cheaper alternatives such as Astro's own free-to-air satellite TV service,\" he said.\n\nThe company controlled by tycoon Ananda Krishnan is the largest in the segment, with a market capitalisation of some RM16.2 billion. It spent about RM1.5 billion on content, of which about 70 per cent was foreign and transacted in US dollars.\n\nIt has hedged one-year forward on its US dollar exposure and is not expected to be too affected by the ringgit's weakness.\n\nBecause newspaper publishers keep three to nine months of newsprint inventory, stronger dollar costs are also expected to be manageable.\n\nThe industry has started cost cutting. Recently, Astro laid off 52 in-house production employees; Media Prima completed a voluntary separation scheme, which is expected to reduce its annual expenses by between RM30 million and RM35 million in the coming years, versus one-off costs of RM60 million to RM80 million.\n\nMedia Chinese, dominant in the Chinese newspaper segment, has resorted to using lighter newsprint (42 grams per sq m or gsm instead of 45).\n\nFollowing the implementation of the GST in April, consumer sentiments are expected to normalise, at which point AllianceDBS expects media companies to experience \"decent earnings recovery\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The government is not changing direction. Either you innovate and improve productivity or you may be phased out.\"\n\nHe said the changes will have a limited impact on the bigger companies; with the muscle to pay higher salaries to local workers, these companies become eligible to hire more foreign ones. Smaller firms may not be able to do this. \"In the long term, some smaller companies might drop out, simply because they can't compete, or they may be acquired, or they may acquire competitors so they can amalgamate resources and compete for government projects,\" he said.\n\nTan Tay Lek, corporate tax partner, at PwC Singapore, said smaller firms have to carve out niche areas or innovate in their product offerings and processes to survive.\n\n\"They will do well to consider the various budget initiatives targeted at small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are intended to help in growing their businesses,\" he said.\n\nBut Chiu Wu Hong, head of enterprise incentive advisory at KPMG Singapore, said that even if smaller companies are aware of the government schemes available, they may lack the resources to take advantage of them, because they may not have enough support staff to plan for worker training and upgrading.\n\nMarc Sim, business development manager at Sterling Engineering, said the cash flow of such companies may take a hit while they wait to get their workers trained; in the interim - whether because of a lack of training slots or because the workers are not passing the formal examinations - employers have to continue paying the higher levies for their R2 workers.\n\nSterling Engineering, where 21 of the 24 workers have been classified as \"higher skilled\", does not have this problem, he said: \"We are a sub-contractor and we offer a single trade. For us, it is easy to send our workers for upgrading because we are very focused and specialised. For main contractors, they have a harder time because theirs are general workers.\"\n\nMost market watchers agree that the deferral of the planned increase in the foreign worker levy and the lowering of the levy for R1 workers will give the industry a reprieve.\n\nPwC's Mr Tan warned that while these were welcome changes, it is unlikely that the industry will be celebrating just yet: \"Labour is but one of the major component of a company's costs, and, given the recent fall in oil prices, which should lead to lower costs, the sector may have some ability to absorb the planned levy increases in the short term.\n\n\"Nevertheless, given the subdued outlook for the industry for the next few years, industry players would look forward to more incentives from the government next year to help them meet the challenges of higher labour costs amid a tough business environment.\" He cited training subsidies and assistance with worker retention and the adoption of new technologies as examples of incentives.\n\nOn a more positive note, the government's plans to develop infrastructure - Changi Airport's Terminal 5, the Tuas seaport and improvements to public transport - ensure a pipeline of work for construction companies, especially those with a track record in public projects.\n\nKPMG's Mr Chiu had one caveat to offer: \"Though there are encouraging signs of new infrastructure projects for the coming years in the mid- and long-term, some firms may wonder how many are available in Singapore in the short term, which will influence their forward planning.\"\n\nInvestment in infrastructure development will grow to S$30 billion by the end of this decade, 50 per cent higher than the S$20 billion to be spent in the coming fiscal year. The country's development expenditure was S$12 billion five years ago.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue slipped 8 per cent to S$637.9 million from S$692.9 million.\n\nGenting Singapore's core earnings, or adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) fell 24 per cent to S$190.2 million. Earnings per share fell to 0.73 Singapore cent from 1.15 Singapore cents.\n\nGenting Singapore's gaming revenue for the quarter fell 9 per cent to S$461 million while non-gaming revenue slipped 4 per cent to S$176 million.\n\nThe firm said that its attractions business continued to achieve daily average visitation of 20,000 with the hotel segment notching up an occupancy rate of 93 per cent with average daily room rate at S$422.\n\nFor the full year, revenue was flat, rising one per cent to S$2.86 billion while net profit was down 12 per cent to S$517.33 million.\n\nFor the casino giant, whose VIP gaming segment is hit by an economic slowdown in China and Beijing's anti-corruption drive, things may not altogether be as gloomy as they appear; the tables in the mass market slot, where margins are better and less volatile, are turning in its favour.\n\n\"There's a notable shift in the gaming business from the highly-cyclical VIP segment to the mass market which, over the longer term is arguably more sustainable,\" said Tim Craighead, senior gaming analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence (BI).\n\nGenting Singapore pointed out in its results note that its mass and premium mass segments showed respectable growth, but the VIP segment was hit by low win rates and falling rolling volume.\n\nIn fact, Genting Singapore as well as its rival Marina Bay Sands (MBS) have both seen promising growth in the mass market segment here over the quarter from a year ago with revenue clicking higher by some 12 per cent, while in Macau, it fell by some 16 per cent, according to Mr Craighead.\n\n\"The mass market segment is a reasonable, emerging long-term consumer growth story. If one were to take a step back from the stressful gaming environment in Asia, Singapore is doing relatively well,\" said Mr Craighead.\n\nWhile the high rollers are predominantly from China, the mass players are a more diversified crowd comprising Malaysians and Indonesians as well as players from China.\n\nAbout three weeks ago, MBS, run by Las Vegas Sands, reported a stellar set of final-quarter numbers buoyed by a 66 per cent jump in property-adjusted Ebitda and a remarkably high win rate of 3.6 per cent from 1.9 per cent a year ago.\n\nOn those terms, MBS had outdone its competition with Genting Singapore posting a decline in Ebitda with a VIP win rate of only 2.2 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent a year ago.\n\n\"Win rates are important but they are very volatile and can swing all over the place, particularly for MBS.\n\n\"This made it a great quarter for MBS and made Genting look bad, but the rolling chip volume for both firms were down,\" Mr Craighead pointed out.\n\nGenting Singapore shares fell one Singapore cent or nearly one per cent to S$1.045 on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Royal spoke after Areva, one of the world's leading nuclear technology companies, said in a preliminary statement that it expected a 2014 net loss of about 4.9 billion euros (S$7.6 billion), compared with a loss of 500 million euros a year earlier.\n\nThe French government - which has continued to be a proponent of nuclear power when many other big industrial nations have been more equivocal or have come to oppose it outright - owns 87 per cent of Areva and nearly 85 per cent of the other big French nuclear power company, EDF, once known as \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France.\n\nEDF has been facing its own problems, including delays and cost overruns on a flagship plant that it is building at Flamanville, in the northwest of the country. There are also uncertainties about whether a showcase project in Britain will proceed - one in which both EDF and Areva would participate.\n\nThe French nuclear industry's travails underline the gloomy state of the nuclear industry since the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011. Moreover, the French industry, though long a world leader, has in recent years been threatened by its own mistakes. It has also had trouble coping with the emergence of new challengers like China to sell nuclear plants in countries in emerging markets and the West that value the clean-energy possibilities of nuclear power more than they fear the technology's potential dangers.\n\nThe loss that Areva warned of Monday would be substantially larger than its stock-market value of about 3.7 billion euros, suggesting that the troubled company, plagued by cost overruns and write-downs, may need new funds to continue operating. Areva's capabilities are vital to France's ambitions to remain a world provider of nuclear plants and services like supplying fuel.\n\nWith few new nuclear plants being planned to replace the older ones that are being phased out in the West, \"Europe will see a gradual decline in nuclear's share of electricity supply,\" said Antony Froggatt, an analyst at Chatham House, a London-based research organisation.\n\nInstead, the momentum is shifting eastward, with industry growth over the next few decades most likely to centre on companies in China, India, Russia and South Korea.\n\nAlthough the United States is building few new plants, it still leads the world in power generated by nuclear plants, followed by France and Russia, according to the World Nuclear Association, a trade group. But the rising force in the industry is China, the site of about half of the nuclear stations being built or planned. India also has big nuclear plans and like China tends to favour its domestic companies.\n\nFrance, though, currently gets a larger share of its electricity from atomic power than any other country.\n\nAsked if the government was prepared to inject new capital into Areva, Ms Royal responded that it was \"too early\" to discuss the question but that \"all solutions are being looked at\". Areva, which had on Feb 2 said that its sales fell 8 per cent last year to 8.3 billion euros, cited on Monday a variety of reasons for the gap in its finances, including asset write-downs and provisions against losses at its nuclear plant project on the Finnish island of Olkiluoto, which is far behind schedule and way over budget.\n\nThe company said that it was \"working on developing a competitiveness plan and a strategic and financial road map\" that it said it would present on March 4, when it is scheduled to report its financial results for 2014.\n\nKatherine Berezowskyj, an Areva spokeswoman, said on Monday that she could not comment beyond the statement but that the details would be made clear next week.\n\nEDF did not respond to requests for comment.

It also comes days after US investor Daniel Loeb criticised the allocation of capital at robot maker Fanuc Corp.\n\nEfforts to increase the number of outside directors have met opposition over the years. The Keidanren business lobby has long argued that appointing people who may not understand a company's business would not necessarily boost profitability.\n\nThe new rules will apply on a \"comply or explain\" basis, as is common in Europe where companies that fail to follow must disclose reasons to shareholders.\n\nJapanese boards are often dominated by directors who have spent their working lives at the companies. Foreign investors have long blamed that domination - plus factors such as cross-shareholding and docile institutional investors - for return on equity being historically about half that of the US.\n\nAround 38 per cent of firms listed on the main board of the Tokyo Stock Exchange had boards of directors consisting entirely of insiders, showed a survey last year by the Japan Association of Corporate Directors, down from over 68 per cent a decade ago.

As well as collect fees from clients, Aozora will also invest in the funds as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to end deflation spark a property market revival.\n\n\"We'd like to be flexible so that we can offer investment products that meet demand from regional banks,\" Mr Naritomi, 44, said on Feb 20. Aozora approached about 30 regional banks, of which 30 per cent said they want to invest immediately, he said.\n\nThe bank will target annual returns of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, Mr Naritomi said. That compares with the 0.94 per cent average interest rate on new loans in Japan in December, central bank data show. Japan's benchmark 10-year government bond yield fell to an unprecedented 0.195 per cent in January. The new unit, Aozora Real Estate Investment Advisors Co, is scheduled to begin operating on April 1 to create financial products for regional lenders and other investors, the bank said in a statement on Feb 12.\n\nThe funds will consist of portfolios of real estate trust beneficiary rights for office buildings, rental condominiums and business facilities in big cities, according to Mr Naritomi. He expects each fund will total about 1.5 billion yen to three billion yen, with investors contributing 100 million yen to 500 million yen apiece.\n\nProperty demand has picked up in the world's third-largest economy amid monetary easing by the Bank of Japan and ahead of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. A Tokyo Stock Exchange index of real estate investment trusts has surged almost 70 per cent since Mr Abe took office in December 2012.\n\nThe bank, which Cerberus Capital Management sold two years ago, is scheduled to repay a taxpayer bailout by 2022. It forecasts net income will climb 1.6 per cent to 43 billion yen in the year ending March, its sixth straight year of profit.\n\n\"Expanding real estate finance is part of our effort to diversify and improve our business model as we strive to complete the repayment of public funds,\" Mr Naritomi said.

Yet, it is also wary that the longer it keeps rate extremely low, the greater the chance that speculative bubbles will build up and, separately, the conditions build for a burst of inflation.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

Analysts had said that these Reits would find it harder to make accretive acquisitions going forward. Their pace of buying may slow, and yields may dip.\n\nStill, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, for instance, rose 2 per cent to S$2.05, while CapitaMall Trust rose 1.9 per cent to S$2.16. Both are sizeable Reits with only Singapore properties in their portfolio.\n\nUOB Kay Hian analyst Vikrant Pandey said: \"The impact from the removal of the stamp duty waiver is low as it applies to new transactions, which could see a 3 per cent drop in asset values as buyers factor in the increased transaction costs.\n\n\"In the worst case scenario, revaluation of properties for Reits with relatively high proportion of Singapore assets could see a slight negative impact due to lower asset values from new transactions.\"\n\nThe other three tax incentives extended were: tax exemption on qualifying foreign-sourced income; a reduced withholding tax of 10 per cent on distributions to foreign institutional investors; and GST remissions on business expenses for Reits with overseas assets.\n\nMr Pandey had earlier also flagged that the removal of tax exemption on foreign-sourced income would be \"detrimental\" to the government's vision of making Singapore a Reit listing hub. Had it not been extended, Reits with the greatest overseas exposure (Ascott Residence Trust, Mapletree Logistics Trust, Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust, CapitaRetail China Trust, Fortune Reit and Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust) would see their profit after tax and dividend drop 14-17 per cent, he said.\n\nDBS analyst Derek Tan added that while the extensions are a positive, they will not be as much a \"game changer\" as the results of the Monetary Authority of Singapore's consultation paper, which he expects by mid-year.\n\nThe paper was set out to address corporate governance and perceived agency issues between Reit managers and unitholders, and may have huge ramifications on the former if some of the proposals are implemented.\n\nThe Reit sector also continues to face other headwinds, OCBC investment analyst Andy Wong said, citing the challenging operating landscape and uncertainty over interest rate movements as some factors that could bring volatility to the sector.\n\n\"Reit managers in the industrial, hospitality and retail sub-sectors have largely sounded cautious during the analyst briefings. In our view, demand and supply dynamics remain unfavourable for the industrial and hospitality sub-sectors,\" he said.\n\n\"Hospitality Reits have cautioned against expectations of an immediate recovery in the sector despite optimism over Singapore's SG50 celebrations and major sporting events to be held here, such as the 28th SEA Games in June. This is due to continued vagaries in the macro-economy and absence of biennial events such as the Singapore Airshow, coupled with the expected addition of about 3,258 hotel rooms this year.\"\n\nHe also noted that the US 10-year Treasury bond yield has recently seen a spike from 1.81 per cent on Jan 16, 2015 to 2.06 per cent - yet another ominous sign that the Federal Reserve will raise the fed funds target rate this year.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is all about the squeeze on the yen this morning.\"\n\nThe US dollar gained 0.6 per cent to 119.51 yen. Against the euro, it was less than 0.1 per cent stronger at US$1.1325.\n\nThe day's biggest mover on major currency markets was the New Zealand dollar, driven more than one per cent lower against its US counterpart after a drop in domestic inflation expectations.\n\nMonths of dollar strength based on expectations that the Fed will raise interest rates in the middle of this year, allied to falling oil and metals prices, have hammered currencies in commodity producing Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\n\nThe central bank inflation survey added to concerns that New Zealand's economy will struggle to build on a hitherto healthy performance in the face of lower global demand. \"It's the same picture we have seen on the kiwi and the Aussie over the past month,\" said a dealer with one international bank in London. \"There is no chance of them raising interest rates again this year, and we may yet see a turnaround towards cutting them.\"\n\nBy 0834 GMT, the kiwi was down one per cent on the day to US$0.7450. The Australian dollar lost 0.6 per cent against the US dollar, and Canada's 0.45 per cent.\n\nMs Yellen's appearance before the US Senate Banking Committee (1500 GMT) comes after the minutes from the January meeting dented expectations of an early rate rise.\n\nAnalysts are divided on what note she will sound, although few think she is ready to take the sort of clear step towards a first hike that would spur another round of US dollar gains.

The stock closed at S$1.06, down by 2.3 per cent or 21/2 Singapore cents.\n\nIn a Monday note, Morgan Stanley wrote that Noble was currently reviewing its capital structure, and that investors will be looking for insight into future capital allocations.\n\nThe firm believed that there was a potential for Noble to incur a 10 US cents-a-share impairment charge on market-based assessments of Noble's associate carrying values, but noted that consensus is for a net income of US$465 million for 2014 before items.\n\nNoble reports its 2014 results on Thursday.\n\nMorgan Stanley wrote that Noble's shares \"have fallen about S$0.12 in the past week on potential impairment concerns, but this risk looks fully discounted, in our view\".

And you might even see some rate increases, too.\n\nThe countries poised to raise interest rates by the most this year include the US, Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria, according to median estimates in Bloomberg surveys of economists around the world.\n\nAfter keeping rates at a record low of zero to 0.25 per cent since 2008, the Federal Reserve is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate to a range of 0.5 to 0.75 per cent by the end of the year. It will be joined in such an increase by Brazil and Mexico and will be trumped by Nigeria, which will raise rates by one percentage point, based on the surveys conducted this year.\n\nA better economic outlook for this year is helping some central bankers justify a move away from ultra-accommodative monetary policy after years of using low rates and stimulus measures to try and bolster weak growth.\n\nThe US economy will expand 3.1 per cent, on average, this year, according to Bloomberg surveys, and will see its unemployment rate fall to 5.2 per cent by the end of 2015. Nigeria's economy will expand 4.9 per cent and Mexico is set for growth of 3.2 per cent.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Russia will see the biggest projected central bank rate cut this year. Central bankers in Moscow have already proven themselves to be an unusually active bunch.\n\nIn November, the central bank shifted to a free-floating exchange rate ahead of schedule and in December announced a 6.5 percentage point interest rate increase, the largest since 1998, before reversing course with a surprise two-point cut on Jan 30. This U-turn followed worries of recession and warnings from politicians and business leaders that the high borrowing costs were choking banks and companies.\n\nEconomists now expect the Russian central bank to cut the key rate to 11 per cent from 15 per cent by the end of the year, almost entirely offsetting its December tightening.\n\nOther cuts for central banks this year will come in under the one percentage-point mark. India and Turkey are projected to lower rates by a half percentage point, while Canada, Norway, Australia and South Korea should all decrease by a quarter percentage point.\n\nInvestors looking to make some money off the higher interest rates of some of these countries may also look at Brazil, India, South Africa and China. Those are the investment grade countries with the highest projected central bank rates for 2015.\n\nTrading the US dollar for those currencies could potentially reap the benefits of higher interest rates in what the foreign exchange world calls the carry trade.

The pursuers include Pope Francis, National Front leader Marine Le Pen and former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as a black dog representing the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terror group ISIS.\n\nMore than 2.5 million copies of the issue entitled \"C'est Reparti!\" or \"Here We Go Again!\" are slated to be published. The previous edition that came immediately after the Jan 7 attack on the magazine's offices in eastern Paris carried the Prophet Muhammed on its cover. The assault claimed 12 lives, including nine of the magazine's journalists.\n\nThe newest Charlie Hebdo will go on sale amid heightened security across Europe. A series of killings, death threats and tomb desecration on the continent have mobilised police forces and put the threat level at its maximum in cities such as Paris, London and Brussels.\n\nMore than 10,000 police and soldiers continue to be deployed in France to protect sensitive sites, including Jewish schools, tourist landmarks and French media. Heavily armed police and security forces were deployed at shopping malls after a Somalia-based terror group on Saturday threatened to attack such sites in the US, Canada, France and the UK.\n\nFrance has maintained the highest level of protection in front of Charlie Hebdo's temporary offices at the headquarters of Liberation newspaper near Paris's Place de la Republique. Security forces have been deployed both inside and outside the premises.\n\nFive weeks after the Paris bloodbath, two attacks in Denmark left one person dead at a cafe hosting a free-speech debate and another victim at a synagogue. The attacks were similar to those in France, where two brothers fired on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, while a third shooter killed five people, including four at a kosher grocery store, in three days of violence.\n\nDenmark's government said on Feb 19 it will increase spending on security and give police and the country's intelligence service more legal powers to pursue potential terrorists. Copenhagen police also deployed more staff at strategic points in the Danish capital, including officers armed with submachine guns at the central train station.\n\nOn Feb 15, a day after the Danish attacks, French police found that 300 headstones had been desecrated at a Jewish cemetery in eastern Alsace. Meanwhile, Charlie Hebdo contributor Zineb El Rhazoui and her husband, Moroccan writer Jaouad Benaissi, received death threats on Twitter with pictures and details of his home and workplace.\n\nThe Charlie Hebdo shooting killed the magazine's most famous cartoonists, including Charb, Wolinski, Honore, Cabu and Tignous. The Copenhagen free-speech event was attended by Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, known for caricaturing Prophet Muhammad.\n\nCharb, like Vilks, was on the list of Al-Qaeda targets. Their names appear on a hit list of public figures, \"wanted dead or alive for crimes against Islam\" according to a 2013 issue of its online magazine Inspire. Since the January attack, Charlie Hebdo's subscription has soared from a little more than 10,000 subscribers to over 200,000. The magazine resumes its weekly publication from Wednesday.\n\nThe cartoonist Riss, who was injured during the attacks, is now in charge of the newsroom. This week's issue will also have an interview with Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis.\n\nCharlie Hebdo's surviving journalists published the first post-attack issue on Jan 14. About eight million copies were printed and the issue was translated into 16 languages. In its current form since 1992, nothing and no one has been off-limits for Charlie Hebdo. Its irreverent covers have featured religion, sex and death. Cartoonists drew late singer Michael Jackson as a skeleton shortly after his death. Ms Le Pen was shown shaving her pubic hair to represent Hitler's moustache while Pope Francis was shown holding up a pink condom and saying \"this is my body\".

Hong Kong is forecast to outline relief measures for the poor and elderly, take steps to provide more affordable housing, and offer incentives to encourage greater workforce participation, economists said.\n\nHome prices have more than doubled since 2008 in one of the world's most expensive property markets, putting a strain on business costs and worsening income gaps. More than one million of the city's seven million people live below the poverty line.\n\nOne-off measures could include a salary tax rebate, a waiver on property rates, raising the tax allowance for parents to HK$80,000 (S$14,000) from HK$70,000 per child and policies to support industries affected by the protests, according to local media.\n\nMr Tsang is also expected to dish out sweeteners worth more than HK$20 billion in the budget, local media reported. Hong Kong, which has a minimum wage of HK$32.50 per hour, has handed out billions in previous years, although Wednesday's budget is not expected to reveal any major initiatives, given the uncertain economic outlook.\n\nThe former British colony's fortunes are closely tied to mainland China, where the economy grew at its slowest pace in 24 years in 2014 as property prices cooled and companies and local governments struggled under heavy debt burdens.\n\nMr Tsang is expected to announce a budget surplus of at least HK$60 billion for the financial year ending March 31, according to accounting firms Deloitte and KPMG, handily beating the government's forecast for a HK$9.1 billion surplus.

Mr Lewis said the rules would ensure \"an Internet where consumers can go anywhere they want\", without seeing services or applications blocked for competitive or financial reasons.\n\nSenator Patrick Leahy also welcomed the effort, saying it will \"ban pay-to-play deals that could strangle innovation from startups and small businesses, creating an Internet divided between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots'.\"\n\nThe \"open Internet\" rules, which would become final if adopted by the five-member FCC, would bar \"paid prioritisation\", blocking of legal content or \"throttling\" - slowing a rival service which competes with one backed by the Internet provider.\n\nBut critics say the Wheeler plan is heavy-handed, based on a 1934 law aimed at regulating phone companies, and claim it will stifle investment and cost consumers more, because broadband firms would not be able to generate revenue through special deals.\n\nMichael Powell, head of the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, which represents broadband cable operators, said the FCC was moving toward \"onerous regulation and could well depress investment and innovation\".\n\nHe said the move opens the door to rate regulation despite Mr Wheeler's claim to steer clear of this.\n\nFormer FCC commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth said the agency faces a difficult legal path trying to classify broadband as a public utility without imposing other regulations imposed on telecom firms. \"I don't think the commission has thought this through,\" said Mr Furchtgott-Roth, who heads the Hudson Institute's Center for Economics of the Internet. By selectively imposing regulations, he said, the FCC opens itself up to legal challenges.\n\nAnd while FCC officials have not released details of the plan, Mr Furchtgott-Roth said the reclassification will likely mean \"billions of dollars in new fees and taxes\" which would be imposed either at the federal or state level.\n\nThe FCC move also sparked criticism in the Republican-led Congress, which has the authority to nullify the rules or pass legislation to reverse some of the mandates.\n\nRepublican Representative Bob Goodlatte, head of the House Judiciary Committee, said Mr Wheeler \"overestimates the FCC's authority to rewrite our nation's communications laws . . . and ignores the fact that his net neutrality rules almost certainly will be stuck in courts for years over questions of their legality\".\n\nThe FCC action comes three months after President Barack Obama endorsed a strong net neutrality effort, saying no online service should be forced into a \"slow lane\". As a result, some Republicans are denouncing the FCC move as \"the Obama plan\" and questioning whether the president unduly sought to influence the independent rule-making agency.\n\nFCC commission member Ajit Pai said \"the president's plan will lead to less competition and leave Americans with fewer broadband choices\", describing the effort as an \"approach imposed in Europe\" which has led to less private investment.\n\nJosh Stager at the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute said Mr Pai \"seems to prefer the status quo, in which broadband providers have free reign to manipulate consumers and abuse their market power\".\n\nMr Lewis at Public Knowledge said that in the run-up to the vote \"there have been a lot of ugly accusations but we are happy the FCC is moving forward\". He noted that many Internet startups take issue with the notion that neutrality discourages investment - saying online services are as important as infrastructure.\n\nSome 16,000 websites are endorsing the neutrality effort, in a coalition that includes Tumblr, Mozilla, MediaFire and online review site Yelp.\n\nIn a blog post, Yelp said that without FCC enforcement of open access, \"the Internet could fall victim to entrenched, monopolistic ISPs and gatekeeper companies who would control when, how, from whom and at what cost you view content online. This threatens the very core of American freedom and values.\" AFP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those who wait for an agent's tour could lose the chance to even submit an offer.\n\n\"For the buyers, this is very frustrating as the normal sale in Stockholm now takes two or three days, sometimes one,\" said Fredrik Helmstrand, chief executive officer of broker Skandiamaeklarna. \"From an international perspective, that is completely insane. Someone who wants to move here may think it should take a couple of weeks or months until the house is sold. That is not the case.\"\n\nHousing prices in Stockholm have reached a record as demand outstrips the supply of apartments. The central bank's move on Feb 12 - lowering its benchmark rate to minus 0.1 per cent for the first time in its 347-year history - threatens to further stoke demand in the housing market. As the world's oldest central bank fights the spectre of deflation, its unprecedented easing may also boost household debt, which policymakers have repeatedly warned poses a threat to the economy.\n\nHours after taking interest rates below zero, Riksbank governor Stefan Ingves told Bloomberg TV that other policymakers need to tame household debt while the central bank focuses on deflation. Swedish headline consumer prices fell an annual 0.2 per cent in January, dropping for a sixth consecutive month, Statistics Sweden said on Feb 17.\n\n\"There are a number of things that others can do in order to ensure that things don't get out of hand on the mortgage side,\" Mr Ingves said. \"Our households are borrowing too much, and the market is moving up, in my view, too rapidly.\"\n\nThe Riksbank cut its benchmark rate to zero in October, which helped push credit growth to an annual 6.1 per cent in December, the fastest pace since August 2011.\n\nHome prices rose an annual 9 per cent in January, according to Svensk Maeklarstatistik AB, which compiles monthly price data. Values have gained 12.4 per cent in the past 12 months, according to the Nasdaq OMX Valueguard-KTH Housing Index.\n\n\"In the past six months, the Riksbank has changed to a more expansionary course, which has successively influenced the housing market,\" Torbjoern Isaksson, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Stockholm, said. \"There are very strong trends right now in the housing market, with prices that have risen fast for a long time. In addition, credit growth is high and accelerating, it seems.\"\n\nThe Riksbank's latest rate cut is pushing down borrowing costs, which are already at their lowest level in more than four years. Nordea reduced mortgage rates on most of its home loans by between 0.05 and 0.15 percentage points starting on Feb 18 after the central bank's easing lowered the lender's funding costs. The Nordic region's largest lender shaved the three-month mortgage rate to 2.05 per cent from 2.15 per cent.\n\nSvenska Handelsbanken AB, Sweden's second largest mortgage lender, followed suit, as did Danske Bank A/S's Swedish unit and Laensfoersaekringar Bank.\n\n\"It's extreme that interest rates are this low,\" said Bo Soederberg, head of analysis at the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. \"Generally, when interest rates fall, it stimulates borrowing. Cheap mortgages seem to be inflating prices, and even lower mortgage rates will probably contribute to a further rise in house prices.\"\n\nNordea earlier this month also raised its forecast for house prices. They will rise 10 per cent or more in 2015, compared with an earlier estimate of 5 per cent this year.\n\nSweden's Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson has expressed concern about monetary policy easing. She told reporters at Parliament in Stockholm on the day the repo rate went negative that there is \"always a risk\" that such moves \"don't have an effect on the real economy but lead to increases in the prices of various assets\", including housing.\n\nThe government in 2013 handed the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority the main responsibility for monitoring and addressing housing prices and credit growth, and the risk that they pose to the economy. That followed a public clash between the financial regulator and the Riksbank over which authority was best equipped to handle housing risks.\n\nIn addition to capping mortgages at 85 per cent of property values in 2010 and increasing capital requirements for banks, the regulator has also announced plans to force homebuyers to pay down new mortgages to 50 per cent of the purchase price.

The three-month Sibor was 0.389 per cent on Feb 21 last year.\n\nFrom last Wednesday, the three-month Sibor on which most mortgages are priced off is up 7 per cent and the forecast is for more US dollar strength and higher interest rates.\n\n\"It's a function of US dollar strength,\" said Alvin Liew, United Overseas Bank senior economist, adding that it is a broad trend shared by most currencies in the region.\n\nUOB expects the US dollar to reach S$1.40 by the third quarter, up from S$1.36 now, and the three-month Sibor to reach one per cent by the end of this year.\n\nThe US dollar was at S$1.32 at the beginning of 2015.\n\nSaid Selena Ling, OCBC Bank head, treasury research and strategy: \"Our six and 12-month forecasts for three-month Sibor are 0.8 per cent and 0.95 per cent respectively.\n\n\"There are upside risks mainly due to the SGD weakness, coupled with the firmer direction from US short-term interest rates ahead of a potential lift-off by the US Federal Reserve around middle of the year.\"\n\nAnother benchmark interest rate - the three-month SOR or swap offer rate - which is typically used for commercial loans, also rose to a 52-week high of 0.944 per cent, up more than 5 per cent from last Wednesday.\n\nMr Liew said part of Sibor's rise is catching up with the more volatile SOR which is a traded interest rate.\n\nWhile Sibor's upward move is likely to be sustained, there could be a short-term reversal in the direction of SOR, he said.\n\nIt depends on how certain external events such as Greece unfold, or whether the expected hike in US interest rates is delayed, he said.\n\nAnother factor pushing local interest rates higher is the tight liquidity situation here, said Mr Liew.\n\nDeposit growth has lagged loans demand and the loan to deposit ratio is above 100.\n\nIn a note last month, Citi economist Wei Zheng Kit said the weak Singapore dollar and tight liquidity were adding to the pressure on SOR and Sibor.\n\n\"With banks' deposits having lagged credit growth for several quarters - partly reflecting a shift away from SGD deposits onshore (especially to CNH deposits) and possibly capital outflows - the pass through to Sibor has been quicker,\" he said.\n\nSome analysts think the slide of the Singapore dollar may not have much more to go, in terms of weakening further against the US dollar.\n\n\"The worst is probably behind the SGD,\" said Siddharth Mathur, Citi strategist.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The document makes a vote contingent on reform proposals from Greece being accepted by the European Central Bank, European Commission and International Monetary Fund, the daily newspaper said. \"Provided Greece avows its obligations and provided there is an agreement in the eurogroup (of finance ministers), the German government would be in favour of the proposed extension,\" Mr Schaeuble wrote. \"This petition is being made on the condition that Greece submits a list of reform measures and the three institutions give their opinion on whether these measures provide a sufficient basis for a successful conclusion of the programme.\" Greece sent a list of economic reform plans to European institutions and the IMF at around midnight, a source close to the European Commission said on Tuesday.\n\nMr Schaeuble's spokesman Martin Jaeger said on Monday that euro zone finance ministers would discuss the reforms in a telephone conference on Tuesday.

The upper house is expected to approve the government's nomination as early as Wednesday, given the solid majority the ruling coalition holds in both chambers.\n\nMr Miyao swung the board narrowly in favour of October's surprise monetary easing that was decided by a 5-4 vote. The close vote has given greater significance to the board's composition, as it suggested the difficulty Mr Kuroda might face should he want to ease further.\n\nMr Harada, who wrote a book with BOJ deputy governor Kikuo Iwata on how bold monetary easing can beat deflation, may give Mr Kuroda a stronger grip on the divided board, analysts say.\n\nHowever, Mr Harada told Reuters in January that the BOJ does not necessarily need to persist with its 2 percent inflation target, a view that may complicate debate within the board.\n\nThe focus of monetary policy should be on stimulating the economy rather than achieving an inflation target, which should be considered only as a means for reflating growth, Mr Harada said. \"I think it's okay even if the BOJ doesn't achieve 2 per cent inflation in fiscal 2015. It's important, instead, to guide policy so that the economy can continue to grow around 2 per cent.\" For now, Mr Harada's appointment is unlikely to trigger an immediate shift in policy. Last week Mr Kuroda said that he saw no current need to expand monetary stimulus, but that the bank would determinedly ease policy further if his inflation plan was disrupted by risks.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

He declined to give names, but said some of them were major companies.\n\nUnder the transfer pricing method, an Indonesian company sells its goods to a subsidiary in another country below market prices, and the subsidiary in turn sells them to the market. This effectively reduces profits in Indonesia and increases them in that foreign country.\n\n\"There's a lot of potential in this area. We suspect that all along, they have been using the transfer pricing method,\" Mr Pramudito said. \"This year we will chase them.\"\n\nThe tax office has the authority to adjust the tax bill of a company if it suspects that a sale to a related entity is under-priced.\n\nIn the past, it was difficult to prove companies had under-priced their goods as the tax office lacked comparable data on market prices, Mr Pramudito said.\n\nBut now it has collected more comprehensive data and is increasing its number of officers, he said, adding that it could take such companies to a tax court and indeed had won some such cases.\n\nMr Joko plans to add 4,000 taxmen per year to its existing 36,000 to help achieve an ambitious tax revenue target of 1,489.3 trillion rupiah this year, up 30 per cent from last year's collection.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign last year, Mr Joko pledged to increase tax collection to 16 per cent of GDP from about 12 per cent, and the tax office is keen to close any loopholes.\n\nThe tax crackdown on the resources sector comes at a time when the prices of commodities have fallen to multi-year lows due to slowing global economic growth and ample supplies, setting the stage for a showdown with these companies.\n\nEven so, many of them are still making big profits, Mr Pramudito said.\n\n\"The prices of commodities have dropped, but the costs are still cheap. The fact is, their profits are still tremendous, and using that method (transfer pricing) adds to the profits.\"\n\nIndonesia's finance minister has said South-east Asia's largest economy will review its tax treaties with dozens of countries and may suspend those it concludes are being abused for tax avoidance.\n\nWhen asked whether the tax crackdown will hurt the investment climate in Indonesia, Mr Pramudito said the country's hope to boost investment should not come at the expense of tax compliance.\n\n\"How can you build an investment climate on the basis of tax avoidance?\" he said.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/global-trends-influence-asian-financial-assets", "site_title": "Global trends to influence Asian financial assets", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGlobal trends to influence Asian financial assets\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Feb 24, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nPrivate banking\n\nFollow\n\nTHERE are two global phenomena that we believe will influence the behaviour of Asian financial assets: central bank actions and low oil prices. Monetary policy adjustments could create moderate volatility for Asian fixed-income assets and currencies, while low oil prices will support Asian equities. Asian equities are also attractive given the variety of local economic and political conditions, which are constructive for effective diversification.\n\nIn 2015, central banks have regained their power to surprise. This is in contrast to 2014, when central banks' main duty was to provide visibility and guidance on the course of monetary policy. They were keen to avoid surprises, keen to increase the confidence in the financial sphere and be observably constructive for the global recovery that was just underway.\n\nIn terms of unexpected central bank actions, 2015 has already seen the European Central Bank beginning a one trillion euro (S$1.55 trillion) open-ended asset purchase programme designed to counter the deflationary forces in the eurozone that was unimaginable a year ago. A few days earlier, the Swiss National Bank had stunned markets by lifting its floor to allow the Swiss franc to float freely, which is a return to its traditional independence. The next possible surprise might be the US Federal Reserve finally lifting its official rates, currently at 0.25 per cent, an increasingly awkward level as the unemployment rate drifts under the 5 per cent mark. The Federal Reserve may move in the course of the second quarter of 2015, but the timing and pace of its future hikes remain uncertain. The expected negative impact on Asian currencies should be limited, as the US dollar has already rallied, well in advance of any hike. Against conventional wisdom, the volatility of most Asian currencies is much lower than euro volatility. The lower local inflation in Asian countries also gives central banks a margin and the ability to support their economies with accommodative monetary policies. We believe the strong US dollar will only translate into a mild weakness in Asian currencies with no Asia currency crisis expected and that the volatility created by expectations of higher US rates may raise opportunities to buy selected corporate bond names.\n\nA prolonged period of lower energy prices will bring more opportunities than threats, and this should benefit both Asian economies and stock markets. Asian equities are overweight in our global asset allocation for the bank's private clients and our favourite markets are China and India, with diversification in Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan and Singapore.\n\nLower oil prices are more driven by abundant supply than restraint in demand and the most visible positive demand shock will be felt in the US, as consumers (70 per cent of the economy) will be able to spend more, however Asian countries with positive net oil imports will also benefit. External demand stemming from the US and EU will also support exports from Asia. Lower oil prices will also translate into lower export prices for the US, Europe, Thailand and Singapore and, to a lesser extent, Australia and India, as well as allow governments, such as India and Indonesia, to pursue market reforms such as cutting fuel subsidies. This leads us to have higher-than-consensus 2015 growth forecasts and expect that world economic growth will reach 3.8 per cent, and emerging markets ex-Asia to see growth of 6 per cent.\n\nHigher world trade and improved trade regionally in Asia can compensate for the slower pace of growth expected in China, although lower energy prices will also support the transition towards a more domestic Chinese economy, going hand in hand with the goals of policymakers. Increasing trade will also translate into higher earnings growth for regional firms in the consumer, IT and industrial sectors. Investing in Asia, however, requires discipline in diversification, and should include emerging market corporate bonds, such as those of the best Chinese energy companies.\n\nAsia equity valuations, as measured by the price/earnings ratio with expected earnings for 2015 in countries such as China, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand are of a similar magnitude equivalent to Europe (12 times), respectively at 11.1, 12.5, 12.7 and 12.2 and still far below the US (14.5) or Japanese (16.5) markets.\n\nThe world recovery is paved with macroeconomic risks, such as deflation in Europe, as well as more uncomfortable risks, such as renewed geopolitical tension between the West and Russia. If new tensions should occur, Asia will benefit from flows looking for safe havens. Out of necessity, institutional and private investors are progressively moving away from a pure domestic investment base. Investing in Asian assets can be used as insurance for investors looking for international diversification and Asia investors should be advised to diversify across the region to diffuse the volatility that will continue to be the dark side of the strong trends that are underway.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But many centres - despite having been built in the last decade - are struggling to draw shoppers or retailers because of poor design or because they are difficult to manage.\n\nPS Puri, CEO of MGF Mall Management, which runs MGF Metropolitan, knows this all too well. Located in a posh district in the south of New Delhi, security guards and sales staff outnumbered shoppers last Tuesday evening in what was once a bustling mall.\n\nIt has restaurants but lacks popular attractions like a food court and a cinema. The sale of shop ownership piecemeal has made management difficult and now only one quarter of the space is occupied by fashion retailers - about the same amount that is vacant.\n\n\"There is very little we can do because the shops are sold and the owners bring in whomever they want. They lease it to a liquor shop because they get slightly higher rents but then no other retailer wants to be next to a liquor store,\" said Mr Puri.\n\nRecently built malls where shops are leased, not sold, are faring better but there are not yet enough of them to meet a forecast rapid increase in demand as the economy improves. \"There are very few projects coming up in the next one or two years where we can open a store,\" said Rajesh Jain, CEO at French sportswear maker Lacoste's India division. \"This is really restricting our expansion for sure.\"\n\nRevenue from organised bricks-and-mortar retail in India is expected to more than triple to US$150 billion by 2020, according to consulting firm Technopak - spurred by a raft of foreign retailers planning their first foray into the market, heating up competition for mall space.\n\nIn the past six months, Gap Inc has said that it plans 40 stores, The Children's Place is looking at 50 while Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) has plans for an initial 50 shops. Established brands are also expanding, with Marks & Spencer aiming to lift its store numbers to 80 from 45 by 2016/17.\n\nBut India has only 77.6 million square feet of mall space, less than one tenth of US levels, despite having nearly four times the population, with the shortage of attractive malls most acute in New Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nOne in every six stores is empty, according to property consultants Jones Lang LaSalle, while advisory and management firm Beyond Squarefeet estimates that up to 25 malls have been shut or converted to other uses in the past two years. That does not include two of Mumbai's oldest suburban malls, Centre One and Nirmal Lifestyle, which have said that they are shutting down as shoppers stayed away.\n\nMany centres, especially those that went up during the 2006-2007 real estate boom, were built by developers with little mall-building experience. Ownership of shops was often sold off piecemeal while many do not have sufficient parking for shoppers or areas for retailers to bring in their supplies.\n\n\"Many of the malls that grew up did not even think of these things,\" said Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO of the Retailers' Association of India.\n\nUntil new and better malls are built, some retailers are looking at alternatives such as leasing standalone shops that can often be less lucrative or investing big in fast-growing but nascent online services. \"We ... have to look at online spaces in a bigger way much earlier than before, because there is definitely a big shortage (of physical retail space),\" said Govind Shrikhande, managing director at Shoppers Stop.

Despite that, he still needs to dodge puddles of sewage in the neighborhood, battle with an erratic power supply and vie with about 10 other people to use an external bathroom.\n\n\"It's a battle I have to fight daily,\" said Kumar, 38, as he heated water on a portable stove for his bath. \"I share the rent with others, so it's manageable.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's budget on Feb 28 presents an opportunity to provide more details on how he plans to give Kumar and about 170 million Indians who live in urban slums affordable homes by 2022. If done right, the plan could boost economic growth and help him win votes in cities such as Delhi, where his party got trounced in a state election this month.\n\n\"If the poor have a proper house to go back to then it adds to his sense of security, and that individual's productivity goes up,\" said Neeraj Bansal, India head of real estate and construction at accounting firm KPMG. \"If you push this engine, the bogies will pull along.\" Mr Modi's \"Housing for All\" program, first announced days after he took power last May, seeks to build 20 million homes over the next seven years in the world's largest housing program. That should be enough to cover a shortage that forces families to live in overcrowded structures and slums, according to 2012 government estimates.\n\nWhile previous governments focused largely on public-funded programs, Mr Modi is looking to push the private sector into action. It'll take US$2 trillion in financing to meet his targets, according to estimates from KPMG and the National Real Estate Development Council, an policy research group.\n\nMr Modi has already taken some steps, including allowing developers to raise money from overseas to build reasonably priced homes. He also issued a executive order to make it easier to acquire land for certain uses, including low-cost housing, though it still needs parliamentary approval to become a permanent law.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing and Urban Development is looking to ease rules that limit the amount of floor space in slum areas, allowing for higher and wider buildings, said a ministry official who asked not to be named because the plan isn't public. It will also look to reduce the number of municipal clearances needed for construction, the person said.\n\nIn slum rehabilitation projects, most units would be sold to residents of the slum at affordable rates or earmarked for households earning up to 10,000 rupees a month, the official said. The rest would be sold at market prices to recover costs.\n\nMore steps are expected in the budget. To ensure every Indian a home, Mr Modi will need to empower local bodies to allocate land, streamline fees and allow banks to access cheaper funds from the central bank if they give lower interest rates to affordable housing and slum rehabilitation projects, according to KPMG.\n\nThe government may also raise the limit for tax breaks on housing loans to as much as 350,000 rupees per year from 200,000 rupees, CNBC TV-18 reported, without saying where it got the information.\n\nThe proposals were discussed at a cabinet meeting on Feb 19 and inputs were sought from other ministers to finalize a comprehensive plan for rural and urban housing, said a goverment official, who did not want to be identified as the discussions weren't public. Mr Modi instructed senior ministers to fine-tune the plan, the official said.\n\nAs things stand now, building 20 million houses in the next seven years is a \"hugely challenging target,\" said Swastik Harish, a consultant at the Indian Institute for Human Settlements in Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore. \"I don't think there is that kind of ability to produce housing at such a scale,\" he said.\n\nEven if the target is missed, a concerted push would boost the economy.\n\nA rupee spent on building a house adds as much as 2.84 rupees to gross domestic product, according to a 2014 report for the Housing Ministry by the National Council of Applied Economic Research, a policy research group. Every 100,000 rupees invested would create about four jobs, and each home increases the entire household's income, which in turn boosts demand.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Smaller and newer miners with higher costs would also face problems, he said.\n\nLow calorie coal - 3,000 kilocalories per kilogram or less - accounts for around 30 percent of Indonesia's output, which is expected to reach 425 million tonnes this year, Sukhyar added.\n\nThe increase will apply to holders of newer mining licences (IUP), while larger older generation firms with so-called Contracts of Work, like Bumi Resources and Berau Coal Energy, will be unaffected. \"Firms that have just started production and are repaying their costs - this is where problems emerge,\" Sukhyar said, noting that the government would not provide special assistance. Coal prices could take two years to recover, he said.\n\nThe move - expected to increase non-tax revenue from coal and minerals to 52.2 trillion rupiah (US$4.05 billion) in 2015 from 35.4 trillion rupiah in 2014 - is not intended to boost revenues but to promote economic growth, Sukhyar said.\n\nIndonesia hopes by 2019 to reduce coal production to 400 million tonnes a year and increase domestic consumption to around 190 million tonnes from around 90 million tonnes this year, he said.\n\nAccording to the Indonesian Coal Mining Association (ICMA), the royalty hike is part of a broader tightening of central government controls on the sector after 10-15 per cent of miners were found in breach of rules including tax and royalty payments. \"The government wants to follow the KPK's advice and address this problem,\" ICMA Executive Director Supriatna Suhala told Reuters, referring to Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission.\n\nBut the association says the rules could backfire and has asked government to postpone them until coal prices climb above US$80 per tonne from around US$72 at present. \"A lot of our members entered (the market) in 2010 and 2011 when prices were high. They already have debts. These smaller firms are finding this hard to take.\" Any reduction in Indonesia's coal output by smaller firms would likely be balanced with increases from larger firms, Suhala said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

Private consumption climbed 0.8 per cent, capital investment rose 1.2 per cent and exports jumped 1.3 per cent.\n\n\"Powerful trickle-down effects from a lower oil price and a weaker euro exchange rate continued to lift the German economy,\" said Andreas Rees, an economist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. \"It is hard not to be reasonably optimistic in Germany these days.\" Plunging energy costs have been described by Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann as a mini-stimulus that puts more money in consumers' pockets. The decline has also contributed to a negative inflation rate in Germany and the euro area that prompted the European Central Bank to announce quantitative easing, weakening the euro and making German exports more competitive.\n\nPrivate consumption added 0.4 percentage point to GDP last quarter and net trade added 0.2 percentage point. Capital investment added 0.2 percentage point, driven entirely by construction. Inventories subtracted 0.2 percentage point.\n\nThe Bundesbank said last month that the German economy has overcome the \"weak phase\" it hit early last year as lower oil prices and higher salaries bolster consumption. Real wages increased 1.6 per cent in 2014, the most since data collection started in 2008.\n\nGermany's economic resurgence contrasts with France, which barely grew in the three months through December, and Italy, which stagnated after two consecutive quarters of contraction. The Spanish economy, the euro area's fourth-largest, expanded at the fastest pace in seven years in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising 0.7 per cent.\n\nThe euro-area economy expanded 0.3 per cent in the October- December period. While the region is still recovering from its longest-ever recession, growth prospects are clouded by Greece, where a newly elected anti-austerity government is struggling to strike a financing deal with its European counterparts that would prevent a default.\n\nIn addition, ECB President Mario Draghi has warned of the risk of a deflationary spiral of falling consumer prices and households postponing spending in the currency bloc. To avert that scenario, he unveiled a 1.1 trillion-euro (US$1.3 trillion) bond-buying programme last month.\n\nThe risks for the region's economy \"remain on the downside, but should have diminished,\" Mr Draghi said at a Jan 22 press conference after the announcement.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

The corporate sector is clearly slowing down, which is the biggest indicator of economic activity,\" Mr Vaidya said adding that risk-adjusted returns are better in the United States than in India.\n\nThe average forward price to earnings ratio for 920 Indian stocks over the next year was 16.8 times, the second highest in emerging Asia as measured by Thomson Reuters StarMine Smart Estimates, which narrows predictions to top-rated analysts.\n\nForeign investors have poured in US$8.21 billion into Indian stocks and debt since the start of the year. At that pace, they could beat a record US$42.34 billion invested last year.\n\nIn the past 20 years, according to data collated by analysts at UBS, India's index for top companies on the National Stock Exchange (Nifty) has outperformed emerging market peers four out of five times following a government's maiden annual budget.\n\nBut this time, analysts warn markets have already priced in significant reforms.\n\nAnalysts and traders told Reuters equity markets could drop 6-8 per cent if the pro-growth measures in the budget, due to be presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday, fall short of expectations.\n\nThey also warned that bond yields could rise by 25-30 basis points to nearly 8 per cent if the government strays too far from its fiscal consolidation roadmap.\n\nA sell-off in stocks and debt could send the rupee tumbling, with some analysts predicting it could fall as low as 64-65 to the dollar, levels last seen when the currency was recovering from an all-time low of 68.85 struck on Aug 28, 2013.\n\nIndia's rupee currency is up nearly 1.2 per cent this year against the dollar, the strongest appreciation among Asian peers, while bond yields are down more than 2 per cent.\n\nForeign investors quizzed by Reuters said they were focused on a significant increase big ticket spending - as much as double last year's increase of more than 20 per cent - and specific improvements in the ease of doing business in India.\n\nIndia's governments have frequently missed spending targets, but investors are still hoping to see a strong hike - all while India tightens its fiscal belt, cutting back subsidies. \"A steady narrowing for the (fiscal) deficit is the single most important factor in Indian macroeconomics,\" said Jan Dehn, head of research at Emerging Market specialist Ash more Group.\n\nThat will avoid the loose fiscal policy that has in the past forced the central bank to raise rates, choking growth.\n\nOf course, some investors said they saw growth over the long term and could wait. Many more warned they were impatient. \"There is no spare change in people's pockets. So if something interesting happens elsewhere, they will take profit in India,\" said Andrew Graham, head of Asia-Pacific equities at Martin Currier in Edinburgh.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

More evidence of weakness surfaced on Monday when data showed US home resales fell sharply to their lowest level in nine months in January amid a shortage of properties on the market.\n\nMs Yellen will discuss the outlook for the US economy and monetary policy in her semiannual testimony before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and then before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": []}

By contrast, the value of domestic deals has more than halved since 2011, last year hitting a 16-year low of US$36 billion. \"Companies are investing aggressively in places where there's a growing market. And since Japan is not growing, they're placing their bets on companies abroad,\" said Kazuhiro Kaneko, merger and acquisition consultant at Ernst & Young Transaction Advisory Services.\n\nJapan Post's acquisition was designed to reduce its dependence on waning domestic demand. \"The days are over when logistics companies can survive by shutting themselves in Japan,\" said Japan Post president Taizo Nishimuro announcing the purchase of Toll. \"You could say that we bought time we would've spent on growth.\" Earlier this month camera maker Canon Inc and freight carrier Kintetsu World Express Inc announced their largest-ever overseas purchases. And this week brought news of deals by Hitachi Ltd and chemicals company Asahi Kasei Corp that will take Japan Inc's two-week shopping spree to around US$13.3 billion.\n\nAfter two years of stimulus from the central bank to boost inflation, consumption and investment, Japanese companies, excluding financials, have amassed record holdings of cash, reaching 233 trillion yen (S$2.67 trillion), or 24 per cent of their total assets.\n\nSome of that money is now being put to use in overseas acquisitions. \"This trend is set to continue,\" said Kengo Nishiyama, senior strategist at Nomura Securities.\n\nJapan Post Chief Executive Toru Takahashi said the Toll acquisition was just the start of the company's global expansion. \"We want to use the experience and knowledge gained during the acquisition of Toll to create a global management base and expand further into Asia and North America,\" said Mr Takahashi.\n\nJapan Post paid what Macquarie Securities analyst Sam Dobson called a \"generous\" 49 per cent premium over Toll's closing price on the day before the deal became public. \"Typically you would look at a premium of some 25 per cent or so on this type of deal, and here we get double that,\" said Mr Dobson. \"That's a lot.\" Canon's US$2.8 billion for Swedish network video surveillance firm Axis AB was also made at a premium of nearly 50 per cent, and Kintetsu's purchase of Singapore's APL Logistics was about 30 per cent above what sources said APL's parent company Neptune Orient Lines had been looking for.\n\nThe cost of overseas acquisitions funded in US dollars has already risen by more than 25 per cent in the last two years as the yen weakened to 119 against the dollar from 95.\n\nAnalysts expect the Bank of Japan to embark on more stimulus later this year, a Reuters poll showed this month, which is likely to put further pressure on the yen. \"Everyone thinks that the yen is going to get cheaper, so they think it's better to hurry up now,\" Ernst & Young's Mr Kaneko said.\n\nJapan's sensitivity to yen weakness has become particularly heightened since the 2011 Fukushima disaster led to the shutdown of its nuclear reactors, costing the country an estimated US$28 billion in extra fuel imports annually.\n\nAsahi Kasei president Toshio Asano said the company decided to buy Polypore International Inc's energy storage business on Monday mainly because it fitted the company's growth strategy and would generate synergies, but the yen's trajectory was also a factor the company took into account. \"We thought about it. The pressure is growing,\" he said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

This factor is a key support for their sovereign credit rating on Singapore (unsolicited ratings AAA/Stable/A-1+; axAAA/axA-1+).\n\n\"The Singapore budget focuses on longer-term fiscal challenges even as it addresses the immediate capacity constraints in transport and health services, areas that will see significant increases in spending,\" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Yee Farn Phua.\n\nPolicies announced in the Singapore dollar S$68.2 billion budget aim to boost the country's economic growth potential, retrain Singaporean workers, and ensure increased funding to meet the needs of Singapore's aging population. Investments in these areas significantly outsize the S$705 million transfers to households. These measures should help maintain Singapore's credit strengths even as the population ages at one of the fastest rates in Asia.\n\nAfter accounting for revenue not reported as part of the Singapore budget, S&P estimates that the general government account will remain in surplus over the fiscal years ending March 2015 and March 2016. The government projects a budget deficit of S$6.7 billion (1.7 per cent of GDP) in the fiscal year ending March 2016 after a nearly balanced budget in the current fiscal year.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nJubilee Budget sets course for Singapore's future\n\nINFOGRAPHIC:\n\nKey budget numbers\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For those who can afford, it's all right. But what about housewives like us, with no income?\" she was quoted as saying by the Malaysian Insider news portal.\n\nMalaysia's minimum wage is RM900 per month, though critics say it is seldom enforced.\n\nMs Rosmah made the comments at a public event to discuss the introduction of a new consumer tax in April.\n\n\"Is this woman for real? Some families have to live on what she pays to have her hair dyed,\" said one Facebook user, among a flood of social media postings poking fun at her on Tuesday.\n\nSaid a post on Twitter: \"I hope to become a poor housewife of a civil servant just like you Rosmah.\"\n\nSince her husband took office in 2009, Ms Rosmah has faced periodic criticism over reports of luxury overseas shopping sprees.\n\nThe New York Times ran a report earlier this month detailing purchases of high-end US real estate by people close to Mr Najib, and said it also had obtained documents showing millions of dollars in jewellery purchases for Ms Rosmah.\n\nIn a statement to AFP after the New York Times report, the prime minister's office said \"We prefer not to comment on unsourced speculation concerning the private finances and spending of the prime minister and his family.\"\n\nMalaysian police on February 14 seized a shipment of books lampooning Mr Najib and Ms Rosmah by one of the country's best-known political cartoonists.\n\nLast year an opposition lawmaker was charged with sedition for producing a satirical video that included a character widely viewed as representing Ms Rosmah.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

Private consumption climbed 0.8 per cent, capital investment rose 1.2 per cent and exports jumped 1.3 per cent.\n\n\"Powerful trickle-down effects from a lower oil price and a weaker euro exchange rate continued to lift the German economy,\" said Andreas Rees, an economist at UniCredit SpA in Munich. \"It is hard not to be reasonably optimistic in Germany these days.\"\n\nPlunging energy costs have been described by Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann as a mini-stimulus that puts more money in consumers' pockets. The decline has also contributed to a negative inflation rate in Germany and the euro area that prompted the European Central Bank (ECB) to announce quantitative easing, weakening the euro and making German exports more competitive.\n\nPrivate consumption added 0.4 percentage point to GDP last quarter and net trade added 0.2 percentage point. Capital investment added 0.2 percentage point, driven entirely by construction. Inventories subtracted 0.2 percentage point.\n\nThe Bundesbank said last month that the German economy has overcome the \"weak phase\" it hit early last year as lower oil prices and higher salaries bolster consumption. Real wages increased 1.6 per cent in 2014, the most since data collection started in 2008.\n\nGermany's economic resurgence contrasts with France, which barely grew in the three months through December, and Italy, which stagnated after two consecutive quarters of contraction. The Spanish economy, the euro area's fourth-largest, expanded at the fastest pace in seven years in the fourth quarter, with GDP rising 0.7 per cent.\n\nThe euro-area economy expanded 0.3 per cent in the October-December period. While the region is still recovering from its longest-ever recession, growth prospects are clouded by Greece, where a newly elected anti-austerity government is struggling to strike a financing deal with its European counterparts that would prevent a default.\n\nIn addition, ECB president Mario Draghi has warned of the risk of a deflationary spiral of falling consumer prices and households postponing spending in the currency bloc. To avert that scenario, he unveiled a 1.1 trillion-euro (S$1.7 trillion) bond-buying programme last month.\n\nThe risks for the region's economy \"remain on the downside, but should have diminished\", Mr Draghi said at a Jan 22 press conference after the announcement.\n\nSeparately, an inflation-busting wage deal for Germany's biggest labour union agreed on Tuesday looks set to boost household spending this year.\n\nGermany is under pressure to increase wages and invest more to help reduce economic imbalances and boost the flagging eurozone economy. Fourth-quarter GDP data suggested that this is starting to happen.\n\nConsumer morale is at its highest in more than 13 years and after trade union IG Metall agreed on Tuesday to a 3.4 per cent wage increase for one year from April for the southwest region, plus a one-off payment of 150 euros, there is no sign of that abating. IG Metall said that the deal would help boost consumption.\n\nAgreements in this pilot region traditionally serve as a template for the 3.7 million workers whom the union represents nationwide. The increase is much higher than Germany's 2014 inflation rate of 0.9 per cent.

We all want to see numbers now.\"\n\nFinancial markets surged even before confirmation of the extension of the 240 billion- euro (S$370 billion) EU/IMF bailout, saving Greece for now from an imminent banking collapse, state bankruptcy and a possible disorderly exit from the eurozone.\n\nThe country's longer-term financial future remains uncertain with Mr Dijsselbloem telling the European Parliament that the eurozone's most heavily indebted member is likely to need further assistance after two bailouts since 2010.\n\nThe Greek letter pledged not to reverse ongoing or completed privatisations, and to ensure that the fight against what the government calls the humanitarian crisis caused by austerity \"has no negative fiscal effects\".\n\nThe six-page document, seen by Reuters, contained few figures but promised to improve tax enforcement, fight corruption and \"review and control spending in every area of government spending\".\n\nGreek financial markets, which reopened for the first time since Friday's outline deal between Varoufakis and eurozone finance ministers, rallied strongly on relief that a meltdown had been averted for now.\n\nGovernment bond yields dropped by three percentage points and stocks hit a 2 1/2-month high due even though the country's longer-term survival in the single currency remains uncertain.\n\nMr Dijsselbloem, who is also Dutch finance minister, told the European Parliament that Athens was likely to need a further aid programme when the four months expire, saying: \"I think we need to consider further support for Greece.\"\n\nThe eurozone could consider further debt relief measures if Athens met all the criteria specified in its November 2012 second bailout, \"which hasn't happened yet\", he said.\n\nMr Dijsselbloem insisted a Greek exit from the eurozone had not been discussed and was not on the table, adding that the only government to have held a meeting to prepare for a possible \"Grexit\" was in non-euro Britain.\n\nIn EU paymaster Germany, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who took the toughest line in the Greek negotiations, wrote to the Speaker of the Lower House of Parliament requesting a vote this week on extending the bailout.\n\nGermany's rejection of an initial Greek request for a six-month loan extension forced Athens into a string of politically sensitive concessions, postponing or backing away from campaign promises to reverse austerity, scrap the bailout and end cooperation with the \"troika\" of EU, ECB and IMF inspectors. The letter said Greece would phase in collective bargaining with a view to raising minimum wages \"over time\" but promised that any changes would be agreed with its partners.\n\nWhile Mr Tsipras has won broad support in his coalition for the deal clinched in Brussels, some hardline leftists have criticised it and the conservative opposition has charged that his illusions have been punctured. In a televised address on Saturday, Mr Tsipras called the tentative accord a victory for Greece, but participants said Athens was isolated in the talks and forced to make humiliating concessions because its banks were running out of cash.\n\nLatvia's central bank governor, a member of the ECB's policymaking governing council, cast doubt on elements of the Greek reform plan, such as tackling tax evasion and smuggling, questioning how much extra revenue they would raise.\n\n\"Those are soft measures, which may partly fill the budget gaps in the short term, but (in the case of Latvia) nobody planned or budgeted it as permanent revenues,\" Ilmars Rimsevics told state broadcaster LTV. Commenting on ongoing negotiations with Greece, he said: \"For Europe, in a certain way, fatigue has set in, and this nursing and instructing all the time is also very burdensome.\" REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/62ec5df0b0f248a2b336083653080d80cc2936a743adbf575ad64bd70ea79f8e?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "EU and Greek flags flutter atop the Greek Ministry of Finance in central Athens on Tuesday.

That clause was intended to make merchants treat all credit card holders similarly without favouring one card company over another.\n\nBecause American Express charges merchants a higher percentage of each sale than its competitors - broadly speaking, about 3 per cent, compared with 2 per cent by Visa and MasterCard - the court determined the practice led retailers to pass the higher cost onto all customers.\n\nAs a result, the judge contended, \"a lower-income shopper who pays for his or her groceries with cash\" or a debit card \"is subsidising, for example, the cost of the premium rewards conferred by American Express on its relatively small, affluent cardholder base in the form of higher retail prices.\" The judge, Nicholas G Garaufis of US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, declared that the result of his decision would be increased competition that would benefit the consumer: \"The court expects that merchants will pass along some amount of the savings associated with declining swipe fees to their customers in the form of lower retail prices.\" Judge Garaufis' heart may be in the right place. We all want more competition and lower prices. But if history is any guide, his ruling will lead to the opposite outcome.\n\nThe result, at best, will be that fees will come down for retailers but they will pocket the difference and simply end up with bigger profits.\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing if you're a retailer, but it's clearly not the virtuous outcome for consumers that the judge seems to think his ruling will create.\n\nNot only are retail prices likely to remain at current levels, but card companies like American Express, Visa and MasterCard may also end up raising their annual fees and lending rates because they will need to make up revenue lost from the merchant fees in order to pay for the myriad rewards programs they have created.\n\nThe evidence for such a pattern is well established: In 2010, Senator Richard J Durbin, D-Ill, introduced the Durbin Amendment as part of the Dodd-Frank overhaul of the financial system. The amendment was meant to lower merchant fees for processing debit cards; retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot argued that the banks were gouging them, pushing prices up for consumers.\n\nSo what happened after the legislation was put into effect?\n\n\"Most large retailers have seen significant cost reductions as a result of the Durbin Amendment, yet to date there is no evidence that those cost savings have been passed through to consumers,\" a study by the George Mason University School of Law said. Other academic research has come to the same conclusion.\n\nIt shouldn't be a surprise. Somewhat similar rules aimed at lowering fees were put in place in Spain and Australia, and the outcome was the same. \"In Spain and Australia, the regulation of interchange fees (IFs) resulted in a transfer of costs from retailers to consumers,\" according to Europe Economics, a consulting firm. \"Retailers' costs fell as they paid lower merchant service charges (MSCs), but this cost reduction was not passed on to consumers in the form of lower retail prices.\"\n\nEven Judge Garaufis seems to recognise the possibility that his ruling won't have the intended effect. Buried in his thoughtful 150-page decision, he acknowledges that at the about 3 million retailers that don't accept American Express, prices haven't come down, nor have the stores tried to create competition among the card companies - for instance, by encouraging customers to use one card instead of another with higher costs, a practice called \"steering\".\n\n\"Amex correctly notes there is little evidence of widespread steering at these merchant locations,\" the judge wrote, \"or that price competition among the networks has increased in the four years since Visa and MasterCard agreed to abandon their anti-steering rules for the merchants operating these locations.\" (Visa and MasterCard used to have similar nondiscrimination provisions but got rid of them as part of a different settlement with regulators in 2012.)\n\nAmerican Express, of course, took issue with the judge's decision, saying it \"would harm competition by further entrenching the two dominant payment networks, Visa and MasterCard\". \"Only a small percentage of Visa and MasterCard holders carry American Express cards. By contrast, most American Express card members carry a competing card in their wallet,\" the company said in a statement last week.\n\nThere are other, perhaps more basic, questions about the ruling.\n\nFirst, it is worth noting that retailers aren't required to accept American Express. When a retailer chooses to accept the card, it also accepts the terms of use, which outline that the merchant cannot engage in steering.\n\nThat makes sense. It would seem odd for a merchant to accept one brand of credit card and then encourage its customers to use a different one because the fees are cheaper - unless it was trying to piggyback on the brand of the first card to get customers in the door in the first place. And, of course, if the retailer wants to drop the card, it is free to do so.\n\nJudge Garaufis takes issue with that idea. He seems to think that American Express has such a strong position in the marketplace that virtually all retailers need to accept American Express. He cites a situation in 2004 in which Walgreen considered dropping American Express but ultimately chose to keep it, as well as another instance when Murphy Oil dropped American Express only to return to it later.\n\nThose examples are real. But here's another: Just last week, a day before the judge's decision was published, the discount-retail behemoth Costco dropped its American Express co-branded card. The retailer won't accept regular American Express cards at its stores either. The card company lost its partnership with JetBlue last week, too. So much for the theory that merchants can't leave American Express.\n\nFinally, Judge Garaufis assumes that if merchants who voluntarily accept American Express and its non-discrimination policy were allowed to steer customers to lower-priced cards, those merchants would create special deals for consumers. The judge posits the possibility of \"offering a 10 per cent discount off the posted purchase price, free shipping, free checked bags, gift cards or any other monetary incentive for using their Discover card\" over American Express.\n\nThat sounds great in theory, but if you think about it a little longer, you will realise quite quickly that no retailer is going to be offering 10 per cent off to use a credit card with lower merchant costs. That's because the difference in fees is less than 1 per cent.\n\nAmerican Express, as you might expect, is appealing the decision.

This pool of monies will be used to meet the CPF member's chosen retirement sum amount, which will be used to pay for the CPF Life annuity scheme.\n\nFrom next year, the government will pay an additional one per cent of interest on the first S$30,000 of CPF savings belonging to CPF members aged 55 and up. This is on top of the one per cent extra interest currently paid out for the first S$60,000 of combined CPF savings, and on top of the current 4 per cent floor rate earned by Special, Medisave and Retirement account monies.\n\nOther than the interest rate increase, other significant CPF-related changes introduced in the Budget include higher contribution rates for workers aged 50 to 65 and a rise in the CPF salary ceiling from S$5,000 to S$6,000 from next year. The annual contribution cap for the SRS, a scheme that results in tax savings, will go up to S$15,300 from S$12,750 currently.\n\nThe higher salary ceiling will mean higher contributions from employers. However, some Singaporeans said their disposable income has been reduced, because more of their ordinary wages as well as bonuses will attract CPF contributions.\n\nVincent Ee, president of the Association of Financial Advisers (Singapore), said that from a financial planning perspective, the higher salary ceiling is good news for Singaporeans because they will have more retirement savings.\n\n\"Compulsory savings schemes such as CPF are always superior to voluntary schemes when it comes to accumulating funds for future use,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If reform doesn't come in, we're going to need money from somebody or we're going to need to reduce services.\"\n\nPostal services around the world are facing dramatic declines in their core letter-delivery business as customers turn to the internet for all forms of correspondence from billing to greeting cards.\n\nWhile some like the United Kingdom's Royal Mail Plc and Germany's Deutsche Post AG have been deregulated and privatised, enabling them to slash costs and set their own prices, Australia has resisted calls to sell its postal service.\n\nThat has left Australia Post relying on a pickup in retail freight linked to the online shopping explosion, the service Australia Post expects Japan Post will target if its A$6.5 billion (US$5.05 billion) takeover of Australian freight firm Toll Holdings succeeds, as expected.\n\nMr Fahour said Toll would become a \"commercial player ... who does not care about community services\" if it came under the control of Japan Post, one of the world's largest companies.\n\nIt would \"try and use the balance sheet of Japan Post Holdings to increase the level of competition\", he added.\n\nA day earlier, Australia Post warned that in 2015 it would post its first annual loss since being established as a registered company in 1989, after an 8.2 per cent decline in letter volumes led to a 56 per cent slump in net profit for the six months to Dec 31.\n\nThe slide in letter volumes - the result mainly of competition from email and other electronic messaging services - was double the rate of decline in the same period a year earlier, Mr Fahour said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2ff5a1598681f14aa460714ab8bd452475ad44f06105bf8124d9ba5e65fc68e9?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Australia Post on Tuesday warned that Japan Post Holdings will \"cherry-pick\"profitable services if it entered the country, and said it may have to cut services for the first time in 30 years due to intensifying competition."}]}

Later she was hired by a financial services company - bigger salary, bigger office. Then, in 2012, she was recruited by Yodle, a smaller, newer company that sells online marketing tools for small businesses.\n\n\"I had heard about these tech startups that had these open office environments,\" Ms Sarnoff said. \"I wondered if I was going to get an office.\"\n\nShe did not, and on her first day on the job, she all but panicked. \"I remember being led to my new desk and thinking, 'Oh my God, this is going to take some getting used to.'\"\n\nSoon, she will have even less space. Yodle is scheduled to move in the next few weeks and is cutting the amount of space allotted to each employee to 122 square feet or 11 square metre, from 137 sq ft in its current quarters.\n\nWith rents surging as the Manhattan office market rebounds, many companies are looking to cut costs, and one way to do that is by trimming personal space. The shrinking is happening beyond New York. The average amount of space per office worker in North America dropped to 176 sq ft in 2012, from 225 sq ft in 2010, according to CoreNet Global, a commercial property association. Though more recent figures are not available, property specialists say there is no doubt that workers are being shoehorned into even less space.\n\nThis means that everyone will get to hear those loud calls about how long your mother-in-law will be staying or why the US$1,500 medical bill the collection agency insists you owe should really be covered by insurance.\n\nBryan Langlands knows all about this. He works for NBBJ, an architecture firm that designs open offices - and has one. Consider the conversation in which he told the assistant to a partner, who sits directly behind him, that he was postponing their later-in-the-week lunch. He explained why, too: He was having a colonoscopy. \"About six people around me know - they heard,\" Mr Langlands, a principal at the firm, said.\n\nSome property brokers make the pitch that companies can avoid a rent increase by moving to new quarters that are 20 or 25 per cent smaller than what they had, even if it means increasing workplace density and jamming people into less space.\n\n\"Every client we talk to, they're using less space per person,\" said Kenneth McCarthy, the chief economist for Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial property broker. He said that 50,000 more people work in \"office-using industries\" in New York now than before the recession. But with the vacancy rate at 9.5 per cent in Manhattan at the end of 2014, he said, \"more people are taking up less space\".\n\nBosses - and the designers and architects they hire - are betting that most employees will not notice the difference. \"The balance between individual spaces and community spaces has changed drastically,\" said David Bright, a senior vice-president of Knoll, the office furnishing manufacturer, \"with shared and community spaces taking up a greater proportion of space than they once did.\"\n\nThe result, nationally as well as in Manhattan, is offices with less space for desks and more square footage for conference rooms or other activity space areas, as some designers call them. Also popular with architects and designers are \"refuge rooms\" to which employees can retreat when the buzz around them proves distracting - the open-office equivalent of the low-decibel \"quiet car\" on many trains.\n\nThe argument for more communal space is that open offices foster communication and accidental creativity - that serendipity is a plus, if serendipity is defined as bumping into co-workers and chatting about projects they may not necessarily be assigned to.\n\nThe comic strip Dilbert, which has long lampooned office culture, anticipated the personal space squeeze in 2013. The character identified as the Boss was trying to justify declines in productivity to the chief executive. He explained that the engineers had first moved from private offices to cubicles. Then they had been assigned to an open-plan area. The chief executive asked: \"Have we tried putting all of them in one clown car?\" The Boss replied: \"No, but I don't see why that wouldn't work.\"\n\nScott Adams, the cartoonist who created Dilbert, said that it was no surprise that individual breathing room in the workplace was being reduced. \"But computers have gotten smaller and the need for storage of paper has disappeared,\" Mr Adams said. \"If you've got a place to hang a coat and a place to sit with a laptop, you've got everything you need.\"\n\nWhile space is getting tight in many places, there is every indication that offices are even tighter in the New York area. Justin Mardex, a member of CoreNet's New York City chapter, surveyed 10 recent projects and found that the average came to 120 sq ft per employee. The most generous amount set aside was 178 sq ft per person. The smallest was 93 sq ft per worker.\n\nIt is not just underlings who are losing the office space race. \"There's a unilateral flattening,\" said Tom Krizmanic, a principal of Studios, an architecture and design firm. \"Even the CEO, the CFO used to have more.\"\n\nBut Louis D'Avanzo, the chairman of CoreNet's New York City chapter and a vice-chairman of Cushman & Wakefield, cautioned that if individual space dwindled to less than 100 sq ft per person, \"it can be a very dense environment\". And, some cubicle dwellers add, too noisy for sustained concentration. Suzanne Carlson, a partner at Mr Langlands' firm, recalled a recent conversation in which she found herself saying that the private office needed to make a comeback, but with one important qualification. \"It does not need to be owned,\" she said - meaning that no one person's name is on the door. \"This is about the existence of a private space you can go to for refuge,\" she said.\n\nYodle's move to West 34th Street near Ninth Avenue is being overseen by Arnold Madisson, who was deputy executive director of facilities, construction management and operations for the last two years of Michael Bloomberg's time as mayor. \"The idea was to go around to the last of the offices and tear them down,\" Mr Madisson said. \"One million square feet. I believe in openness.\"\n\nYodle's chief executive, Court Cunningham, so values being close to other employees that he does not want a private office. He even dictated that the desks in Yodle's new quarters be relatively small: no more than 1.5 metre wide and 0.7 metre deep.\n\n\"We believe a lot of individuals don't need their own space,\" Mr Madisson said, adding: \"We talked about what if we eliminated desks.\"\n\nLong tables would have given each person even less space, he said - about 0.6 metre wide by 0.4 metre deep.\n\nMs Sarnoff, Yodle's head of consumer marketing, spent that first night agonising. \"I remember telling my husband about it,\" she recalled. \"He said, 'Would you not take the job if you didn't have an office?' He actually said that to me, and I said, 'Would that be a bad reason not to take this job?'\" She became a convert. \"It's fun,\" she said. \"That's the reason I wouldn't want an office. It's fun - if you like the people you work with.\" NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/when-things-cant-get-any-worse-they-turn-negative", "site_title": "When things can't get any worse, they turn negative", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWhen things can't get any worse, they turn negative\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Feb 23, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nInterest rates\n\nFollow\n\nTO THE long list of economic mysteries can now be added interest rates. They have been at rock bottom, as everyone knows. But now we have encountered something novel: negative interest rates. Lenders are actually paying for the privilege of allowing someone to borrow their money. It is occurring outside the United States, and the Federal Reserve's next move is expected to be raising rates. Still, there is no ironclad reason that it could not happen here.\n\nLow rates are old hat. Here is what Bloomberg showed on a recent day: Deposit rates for US savers averaged 0.72 per cent for one-year certificates of deposit (CDs) and 1.5 per cent for five-year CDs. On a 10-year US Treasury bond, the yield was 2 per cent. Abroad, some rates were lower. German 10-year bonds were 0.37 per cent. British and Spanish 10-year bonds were about 1.6 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, borrowers benefit. Rates on five-year car loans were 3 per cent; on 30-year fixed rate home mortgages, rates were 3.9 per cent. But negative rates? How can that be?\n\nIn practice, here is what happens. Bonds are traded on markets, just like stocks. Their prices can rise or fall depending on economic conditions or political events. When the price of a bond rises, its interest rate falls. Consider a US$1,000 bond that was initially issued with a 3 per cent interest rate. If the bond's market prices subsequently rises to US$1,500, the bond's effective interest rate drops to 2 per cent.\n\nThis is how bond interest rates can turn negative. If a bond's price rises high enough, its original interest payments will not cover the bond's full market cost. \"I buy a bond for US$1,000 and get back US$950 - that's a negative interest rate,\" says Moody's Analytics economist Mark Zandi. In January, as much as US$3.6 trillion worth of government bonds - mostly European and Japanese - had developed negative interest rates, estimate London-based analysts for JPMorgan.\n\nTWO EXPLANATIONS\n\nBroadly speaking, there were two explanations for this, though they are not mutually exclusive. The first is that negative interest rates, though unexpected, result from the easy-money policies of government central banks. Their bond buying (known as quantitative easing or QE) has poured money into financial markets, driving down rates. Although the Federal Reserve has halted new bond-buying, the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank (ECB) continue their programmes. The ECB has pledged to buy US$1.3 trillion of bonds by September 2016.\n\nEarlier in 2012, the ECB promised to stand behind the bonds of eurozone countries. This helped bring down their rates sharply. (Greece remains an exception, because its new government declines to endorse a rescue plan accepted by the previous government.) But hardly anyone anticipated that these measures would produce negative interest rates.\n\nThe second explanation is that the weak world economy has quashed inflation and the demand for credit. Businesses do not want to expand; consumers fear too much debt. Weak global demand could produce a broadbased fall in prices (deflation), oil being a harbinger. Depending on deflation's severity, negative interest rates could then be profitable because investors would be repaid in more valuable money.\n\nThe evidence for this theory is mixed. True, the sluggish world economy has suppressed price pressures. In the eurozone, consumer prices (minus energy) are up a mere 0.4 per cent in the past year. But credit demand, while not robust, has not collapsed. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute finds that worldwide credit grew 40 per cent from the end of 2007 to mid-2014.\n\nJust because bonds are traded at negative interest rates does not mean that there is much buying at those rates. \"I don't understand why anyone would put up with negative interest rates,\" says Richard Sylla, a financial historian at New York University and co-author of A History of Interest Rates. \"You could do better by holding cash.\" Some European banks now charge for holding cash deposits; in those cases, buying negative-interest bonds instead might make sense, says Mr Sylla.\n\nCapital flight by wealthy investors explains some demand for government bonds, says Mr Zandi. \"Every time there's a hotspot, you can see the cash flows into US Treasury bonds - the safest assets,\" he asserts. US Treasuries are not yet in negative territory, but some other government bonds that play the same role are, Mr Zandi says. Investors want to protect their principal and may regard slightly negative rates as an insurance premium against larger losses.\n\nFor the moment, negative interest rates are a market-driven curiosity. But what happens if governments or corporations begin selling bonds that start with negative rates? Then we are in completely unchartered waters.

But with falling oil prices, Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said pump prices will still be lower than the levels seen in the last two-and-a-half years.\n\n\"To encourage less car usage and reduce carbon emissions, I will raise petrol duty rates which have remained unchanged since 2003,\" he told Parliament.\n\nThe duty rate for premium grade petrol, or RON 97 and above, rises by 20 cents per litre to 64 cents per litre, while intermediate grade petrol, or RON 92 and 95, goes up 15 cents per litre to 56 cents per litre.\n\nBefore the increase, pump prices for, say, Shell 98 unleaded were S$2.03 per litre while Shell 95 was S$1.86 per litre, both before discounts.\n\n\"To ease the transition to the higher petrol duties, I will provide a one-year road tax rebate of 20 per cent for cars, 60 per cent for motorcycles, and 100 per cent for the small number of commercial vehicles using petrol,'' said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe one-year road tax rebate will cost the government S$144 million, with the rebate offsetting about two-thirds of the impact of the petrol duty change on intermediate grade petrol for a typical car.\n\nAt the same time, Mr Tharman announced that the Carbon Emissions-based Vehicle Scheme or CEVS will be extended for two years, from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017, but with two refinements to encourage a further shift to greener cars. The first is the update of the surcharge and rebate bands to reflect improvements in vehicle engine technology, while the second increases the highest rebate and surcharge quantum from S$20,000 to S$30,000.\n\nCEVS was introduced in 2013 to encourage the take-up of carbon-efficient vehicles and the minister said he is encouraged by the results after two years - over 65 per cent of the cars registered in 2014 qualified for CEVS rebates while about 5 per cent paid the surcharge.\n\n\"Related to this, we will enhance the Early Turnover Scheme (ETS) to further encourage the replacement of older commercial vehicles with greener vehicles to meet higher emissions standards from August 2015.\"\n\nMr Tharman said the changes to these indirect taxes will support the objective of further reducing vehicular carbon emissions and promoting a greener living environment.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The record profit was on the back of an 8.1 per cent rise in revenue to S$4.05 billion, which breached the S$4 billion mark for the first time.\n\nOCBC, in a report, said it believes ComfortDelGro will continue to see strong growth, as its management has guided for revenue from its bus, rail and taxi segments to increase going forward.\n\n\"ComfortDelGro has been our top pick since Dec 2014 with a buy rating, which had been spot on thus far. While we still like ComfortDelGro for its diversified revenue base and growth prospects, we think the recent bullish run in its share price is overdone,\" it said, downgrading it to hold, at a higher fair value of S$3.07.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the 2013 attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in which more than 60 people were killed.\n\nIn the documentary-style video, a masked person wearing a chequered head scarf and a camouflage jacket declares: \"Westgate was just the beginning,\" according to SITE, a website that monitors communications from extremist organisations.\n\nThe video mentions the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, one of the US' largest shopping centres; Oxford Street, a popular London shopping area; and the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, which is the largest mall in North America.\n\n\"Mall of America is aware of a video that was recently released, which included a mention and images of the mall,\" a statement from mall officials said, adding that it had \"implemented extra security precautions\" and that \"some may be noticeable to guests, and others won't be.\"\n\nA law enforcement official said the threat to the mall was not specific. But he said it was still cause for concern, since the video message could prompt extreme action from people living nearby. Minneapolis, with a large Somali population, is viewed as a fertile recruiting ground for groups like Al-Shabab.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Homeland Security Department and the FBI said: \"We are aware of the reported call from Al-Shabab for 'Westgate-style' attacks against shopping centres around the world to include in the United States.\"\n\nLater, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, said in statement: \"We are not aware of any specific, credible plot against the Mall of America or any other domestic commercial shopping centre.\"\n\nMr Johnson, speaking on Sunday on the ABC News programme This Week, put less emphasis on specific threats than on the need to counter the narratives of groups like Al-Shabab and the Islamic State, which use the Internet to broadcast messages far beyond their geographic areas of operation. The White House held a three-day conference last week to advance that effort.\n\n\"The video that was released by Al-Shabab reflects what I believe is the new phase we've evolved in terms of the global terrorist threat, and what we need to do in terms of counter-terrorism,\" Mr Johnson said.\n\nLater on Sunday, Homeland Security officials clarified that Mr Johnson was not warning people to avoid the Mall of America. \"Secretary Johnson didn't say that they should not go to the mall,\" Tanya Bradsher, the department's assistant secretary for public affairs, said. \"He told shoppers to be extra vigilant and that security was increased.\"\n\nMr Johnson appeared on several Sunday television programmes to call attention to the fact that the Homeland Security Department's funding is set to expire in a few days; Congress remains deadlocked over a Bill to continue funding it. Republicans insist that new funding is contingent on rolling back President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.

It tied up a lot of time and working capital,\" Shaw Kwei's managing director Kyle Shaw told The Business Times in an interview at Beyonics' headquarters in Marsiling.\n\nMr Shaw said that going forward, Beyonics will focus on its higher-margin businesses of making components for the medical and automotive sectors, where operating profit margins can be 8-12 per cent.\n\nThe Seagate business was so big it contributed over half of Beyonics' revenues through the years, but operating profit margins were just at one to 2 per cent, he said.\n\n\"Had you been publicly listed, it might have been shocking that you're getting rid of all this revenue,\" Mr Shaw said. He noted that the firm now has more leeway to buy new equipment, reward staff, invest in research and development, and pay higher returns to shareholders.\n\nBeyonics is also consolidating its 12 manufacturing sites across the region to just four, which it is upgrading. Other than Singapore, the sites comprise two in Johor and one in Changshu city in China.\n\nAfter the Seagate exit, Beyonics has 25 Fortune 500 customers, which are the largest US companies by revenue. The largest customer contributes less than 9 per cent of sales, and the remainder contribute one to 5 per cent, Mr Shaw said.\n\nWith cash in the bank, Beyonics is also looking at other investment opportunities in the precision engineering sector, he said.\n\nBeyonics was acquired by Shaw Kwei's special purpose vehicle Channelview Investments at the end of 2011 for around S$140 million. At that time, Beyonics reported a S$17.5 million loss on S$1.3 billion of revenue for its financial year ended July 31, 2011.\n\nMr Shaw said it could be three to five years from now before he exits the Beyonics investment. While a re-listing is possible, markets are volatile, he said.\n\nMr Shaw, 54, was born in North Carolina in the US. He lived in Singapore in the 1970s as his father worked in the US Coast Guard.\n\nHe began his Asia private equity career in 1989 and was involved in a management-led buyout of contract manufacturer Flextronics International. He set up Shaw Kwei in 1999, and roped in former Flextronics International CEO S L Tsui.\n\nToday, Shaw Kwei has US$450 million in assets under management, with half the money invested. It plays in the mid-market space, targeting manufacturing companies.\n\nIt is currently looking to make four to six investments, especially in precision engineering manufacturers targeting auto and medical customers, he said. The firm, which has a team of 16 in Hong Kong and Singapore, looks at around 300 deals a year. A typical investment size is between US$20 million and US$100 million.\n\nRecent investments are Singapore shipping service provider Amos International, German capital goods equipment maker Schmid, and former Singapore-listed adhesive tape maker CHT.\n\nThe pipeline of companies is looking good, Mr Shaw said. \"A lot of companies realise they need to improve, upgrade, scale up.\"\n\nThe days of low-margin businesses are over. Singapore's future will be in making higher-value products, he said. \"What Singapore has is education, a world-class infrastructure, a pretty stable government and rule of law.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These falls outweighed gains in other blue chips such as DBS, which rose S$0.20 to S$19.65.\n\nAs Hong Kong closed in the black and with Europe opening firm across the board, speculation was that the selling was in anticipation of Wall Street sliding on Monday.\n\nAmong other index gainers was commodities group Noble, which last week saw its shares plunge 13 per cent over two days following the release of a \"sell\" report from Iceberg Research.\n\nElsewhere, pressure on offshore and marine stocks has eased in recent weeks in line with some stability in the oil market. In Monday's session, stocks in the segment were mainly lower - Keppel Corp dropped S$0.10 to S$8.67 and Sembcorp Industries (SCI) ended S$0.02 weaker at S$4.22 on volume of 4.7 million.\n\nIn a Feb 17 \"neutral\" report on SCI, Goldman Sachs said it has raised its 2015-16 earnings per share estimates by 2-3 per cent mainly because of higher earnings from Sembcorp Marine, and has now upped its 12-month target price for SCI to S$4.10 from S$4 previously.\n\nSome brokers speculated that traders might have spent most of the morning and afternoon waiting for the government's Budget to be unveiled, but most rejected this since Budgets have proven in the past to be non-market-moving events.\n\n\"The index jumped for no reason on Wednesday before Chinese New Year, so it's now giving back those gains,\" said a dealer.\n\nAnother likely factor at work was worries about Greece - even though its government on Friday managed to secure a four-month extension to its bailout terms, it still had until Monday to submit a list of reforms acceptable to the \"troika\" which comprises the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nAs Rabobank noted in its daily notes, the only substantive victory that Greece's ruling Syriza party has won so far is in renaming the troika as \"the institutions\".\n\n\"Greek pleas that austerity has been ruinous for both them and most of periphery Europe have been effectively ignored by The Institutions, and (on Monday) we will see if Syriza is really willing to swallow that truth,\" said the bank.\n\nAs for US interest rates, Macquarie Equities Research (MER) said since the dovish Jan 28 Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes were released, several developments have transpired that argue in favour of rates being raised earlier rather than later.\n\n\"First, January's employment report (released in early February) was the strongest in several years. Not only did it involve robust job gains, but there were substantial upward revisions to previous months ... \" said MER.\n\n\"Second, the Jobs and Labor Turnover survey released last week showed the private sector job openings rate, hires rate, and quits rate all at cycle highs. Increased turnover has typically been a leading indicator of wage inflation. Finally, the price of crude oil has increased by more than 15 per cent since 28 January.\"\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The technology needs to catch up so that more food can be farmed in a safe way.\"\n\nSeven years of research later, the company is able to farm with man-made seawater, which allows it to set up a farm where there is demand, as evidenced in its US$130 million project to farm shrimp in Oman, which is undertaken with other shareholders.\n\n\"We are starting with shrimp first, and then moving to higher value products,\" says Mr Poh. \"In Oman, we are blessed with no severe winters. In China, one of the biggest challenges for us is, how do you farm in minus 20 degrees? So we want our concept to be able to be replicated in any part of China.\n\n\"Our farming concept is pretty high value - multi-storey, and all-weather. That is a business I'm still developing.\"\n\nMr Poh's partner, Lim Shrimp Organisation has extensive experience in this area, having built a farm 2.5 times the size of Singapore in Indonesia. The farm is the world's largest single-location shrimp farm. \"So it's not a theory,\" he says.\n\nIt may seem like a diversion from Poh Group's two key areas of focus - resources and engineering - but Mr Poh rationalises that aquaculture is, ultimately, about resources.\n\nIndeed, Poh Group is perhaps better known for its portfolio of mineral resource projects, most of which are in Mongolia. It is one of a handful of Singaporean companies to invest in the mineral resource industry in Mongolia.\n\nIts listed entity, Tian Poh Resources (listed on the Australian Stock Exchange) earlier this month announced that it has secured an exclusive option to acquire 51 per cent of the Zuun Mod Molybdenum-Copper deposits with the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement with ASX-listed Erdene Resource Development Corp.\n\n\"We are very happy and excited to have this opportunity to acquire such a world-class asset so near our coal asset and the China border. This is very strategic and will add significant cost competitive advantages if we go into production,\" notes Mr Poh, who is also chief executive officer of Tian Poh Resources.\n\n\"Mongolia is the most resource-rich country in the world. I want to develop that part of the business. Besides being an owner of resources, of course, my ultimate aim is to have an engineering element introduced,\" he says.\n\nWhen Mr Poh started his own business back in 2010, he relied on his background - engineering.\n\n\"There is know-how in engineering; it's not something everyone on the street can do. In today's world, you cannot just compete on brute force and capital. You must have know-how. This is one area we can always go into higher and higher value-add.\n\n\"I have since moved into an area that is very specialised. A distinct difference is I go into very high value-add, which means very high value projects, in the hundreds of millions, even billions. In this kind of business, you really have to have a very strong stomach to do it and you have to have a strong foundation, as well as you have to have a strong partnership and strong execution.\"\n\nResources on the other hand, are an inflation hedge, says Mr Poh, although he acknowledges that commodity prices have been hit badly in recent years.\n\n\"I believe we are near the bottom of this cycle because some of the commodities are already below production cost. So that will make the market adjust and consolidate, which means the lower cost producers will survive and the higher cost producers won't. That's why I listed my company on the ASX. I believe now is the right time to go to the public market, get my structure ready, and tap opportunities.\"\n\nHe concludes: \"For resources, I have two main geographical areas - Mongolia and an emerging market, Cambodia. In Cambodia, I might have something interesting coming up. The Mongolia interests are listed on ASX and we have several major deals under way.\n\n\"Today, a lot of commodity companies are struggling, so it's a very good chance for us, as the new kid on the block, to take up some good assets through mergers and acquisitions. We may have a good chance to pick up some good, undervalued assets.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But there are also long-running rumours of a darker side - an \"Oscar curse\" - that winning a golden statue can bring unintended negative consequences such as divorce and a dip in one's career.\n\nA new research paper co-authored by Heeyon Kim of the National University of Singapore Business School has taken a scientific look at the reality behind these rumours and raises some interesting insights for more everyday workplaces, far from the glitz of Hollywood - in particular, the status change that occurs when actors win or receive nominations for an Academy Award.\n\nIts findings suggest that there can be a negative impact as a result of sudden positive shifts of status, with implications for a range of workplace situations.\n\nDr Kim, an assistant professor of strategy and policy, who co-authored the study with Michael Jensen of the University Of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said that these negative consequences can come about when individuals are suddenly elevated to high-ranking posts or go through a series of rapid promotions.\n\nShe said: \"The individual might not be ready to cope with the new-found status, or people around that person would feel he or she is not ready for the new role.\"\n\nFocusing their study on Oscar winners and nominees, Dr Kim and Dr Jensen researched data on more than 800 actors and actresses from 1930 and 2005, and found out that there was indeed some statistical evidence of a \"curse\" on the personal lives of actors who win an Oscar.\n\nFor instance, research indicates that the divorce rate for male Oscar winners is 205 per cent higher than that of their non-nominees in the first year after their award wins.\n\nAs the Academy Awards is a social event, winners find themselves elevated quickly to a higher status, leading to more opportunities, including spousal alternatives and, subsequently, to divorces, the paper's authors said.\n\nBut while divorce rates were statistically higher for men, the study showed that the divorce rate for female Oscar winners was 85 per cent lower than for female non-nominees.\n\nAccording to the authors, the finding debunks a common myth that female stars are more likely to file for divorce after clinching an award.\n\nWHAT IT MEANS FOR THE CORPORATE WORLD\n\nAnother finding from the research is that the divorce rate for male award nominees who do not go on to receive an award is 96 per cent higher than those who do not receive an Oscar nomination at all. The study's authors suggest that the disappointment of losing out on an Oscar win increases the likelihood of a divorce.\n\nDr Kim said that, similarly, in the corporate world, negative consequences await executives who are expecting to move up the hierarchy but fail to do so. They could be end up being discouraged and withdrawn, both personally and professionally, she said, adding that business leaders should be mindful of the psychological impact experienced by employees in such situations.\n\nOn the flipside, CEOs who attain \"superstar\" status due to award wins might gain access to activities such as greater media exposure, but this can result in their becoming distracted from effectively running their organisations.\n\n\"Instead of individual publicity, they need to take a long-term approach of using the overall exposure for the good of the company,\" suggested Dr Kim.\n\nFor example, the recent high-profile case dubbed \"nut rage\" at Korean Air could be seen as an incident of an individual's inability to deal with an elevated status. The incident cast the spotlight on the perceived high-handedness of members of South Korea's powerful business families, or chaebol.\n\nThe Oscar curse study has also proved that another common Oscar myth - of actors' careers going downhill after winning their awards - is false.\n\nThe data showed that male Oscar winners do an average of 6.05 movies in the five years after winning, compared to 5.45 for male non-nominees.\n\nAmong actresses, winners do 4.26 movies after winning, against 3.52 for female non-nominees.\n\n\"The Oscars actually improved their acting careers,\" said Dr Kim.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The goal is quality growth and sharing the fruits of that growth more evenly. Most Singaporeans have something to gain from this year's budget. Examples include enhanced subsidies for school-going children, greater contributions for workers, and subsidies for low and middle-income workers.\n\nBut the key plank in this year's budget has to be the SkillsFuture initiative. It is a significant undertaking indeed, with the government setting aside S$1 billion per year for the next five years, aimed at helping Singaporeans acquire deeper skillsets valued by industry.\n\nSkillsFuture complements the ongoing productivity drive. While the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) and other productivity initiatives aim at boosting capital productivity, SkillsFuture raises labour productivity by building capacity in our workforce in a way that is more closely matched to employer requirements. This investment in skills upgrading is what will sustain real wage growth, as global competition intensifies and technological advances challenge a growing range of jobs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The higher ceiling, which was last raised in 2011 from S$4,500, is expected to affect at least 544,000 CPF members.\n\nThe move, said Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister in his Budget 2015 speech on Monday, will mean that a 45-year-old worker who earns S$6,000 or more now, will save an additional S$60,000 by age 65.\n\nConcurrently, the contribution cap of the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) will go up to S$15,300 from S$12,750 for citizens and permanent residents, and to S$35,700 from S$29,750 for foreigners. Limits on tax reliefs for CPF and SRS contributions will be adjusted accordingly.\n\nWu Soo Mee, EY human capital partner, said that raising the CPF ceiling now could help defray medical costs, among other things.\n\nThe higher ceiling will help the lower and middle-income groups attain the full retirement sum of S$161,000, said Marcus Kok, a principal pension consultant at PwC Singapore.\n\nTo encourage Singaporeans to retain savings in their CPF accounts, the government will pay from next year one percentage point more in interest on the first S$30,000 CPF savings from the age of 55 - on top of the one point extra interest for the first S$60,000. It would mean that the first S$30,000 in the Special, Retirement or Medisave accounts can earn up to 6 per cent interest. The existing basic interest rate for the Special, Retirement and Medisave accounts is 4 per cent, while the rate for the Ordinary Account is 2.5 per cent.\n\nFrom January 2016, those above 50 to 55 will have their contribution rates raised by two points - which will match the level of the younger workers at 37 per cent - with employers and employees sharing the increase equally. Employers will have to contribute one point more for workers aged above 55 to 60, and half a point more for those aged above 60 to 65.\n\nWhile these initiatives were generally welcomed by analysts and the labour movement, higher contribution rates is an area that has been met with resistance by employers in the past. Daniel Ho, director of taxes at Deloitte Singapore, said that while employers appear to have suffered another whammy in trying to cope with rising business costs, the extension of the enhanced Temporary Employment Credit scheme should help offset the impact for the next three years.\n\nTo get companies to re-hire older workers beyond the stipulated age of 65, the government will be spending S$50 million to provide employers with an additional Special Employment Credit (SEC) of up to 3 per cent of wages for those who are 65 and above in 2015. This is on top of the 8.5 per cent wage offset that employers would receive in 2015. The government will also provide a S$500 million top-up to the SEC fund to meet the needs of the scheme until it expires in 2016. More details will be provided at the Ministry of Manpower's Committee of Supply debate.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nFrom Jan 1, 2016:\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are often so busy running the day-to-day operations that they may not have the time for succession planning.\n\nThis is particularly so for SMEs headed by sole owners or several business partners. What happens when the owner or one of the partners is no longer able to lead the company due to a sudden death, illness or disability? The unfortunate answer is that without a proper succession plan in place, the business often folds and ceases to exist.\n\nSuccession planning refers to the process of identifying and grooming internal employees with the potential to fill key business leadership positions within the company. As you can imagine, however, implementing an effective succession planning programme takes considerable time and resources, which many SMEs may not possess.\n\nAcknowledging the very real limitations of an extremely competitive business environment, this article will not expound the importance of succession planning but instead discuss some of the plans business owners should put in place to keep their families financially secure or protect the partnership equity in the event of a sudden passing.\n\nIn one example, several years ago, I handled the case of a managing director of a construction firm who died suddenly in a car accident. He was one of three co-founders of the company and his abrupt departure left the business without a leader and an uncertain future.\n\nThe banks and other creditors got jittery and began calling back the outstanding business loans (even though the MD was not a personal guarantor for the loans) and asked to review their credit terms with the company.\n\nThe MD's wife considered her options to either take over the shares left behind by her husband or request that the partners buy over the shares, as she was unfamiliar with the business.\n\nAt that juncture, there were just too many possibilities and the two surviving partners were forced to evaluate their options and decide whether to:\n\nOption 1: Liquidate the Business\n\nLiquidate the business and each partner claims his/her appropriate share with the deceased partner's share passing on to his/her estate. However, the business may not command the same value as the key person - the MD in this case - is no longer around to run the business. It may be deemed a fire sale by potential buyers/investors, thus depressing the valuation of the company.\n\nOption 2: Sell Out\n\nThe two surviving partners sell their shares to the deceased partner's heir/s or estate. The heir/s or estate will have to decide whether they have the capacity and expertise to continue running the business.\n\nIf they choose to sell, how will they come to an agreement with the heir/s or estate on the valuation of the business? Both parties will have to address many questions, leading to a tedious and tiresome process that is certain to cause much pain and heartache.\n\nOption 3: Reorganise the business\n\nThe deceased partner's heir/s or estate takes over the deceased's share. The two surviving partners go into business with the deceased partner's heir/s or executor/s and trustee of the estate. Problem is, the new partner/s may not share the same goals or vision as the original partners, and complications and disagreements may also arise.\n\nOption 4: Buy Over\n\nThe surviving partners may buy over the shares from the deceased partner's heir/s or estate. With this option, however, the two original partners will have to find the funds to buy over the share, cover running costs, and stabilise the company again. They will also face the same questions on the valuation of the company and how much the deceased's shares are worth.\n\nEven if they are able to agree on the valuation of the company, how will they fund the buy-over? There are a few options they can consider to raise funds but most come with drawbacks:\n\nWhat's the best solution then?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution but there are various measures business owners can take to prevent such a scenario and preserve their business and personal assets:\n\nBuilding a successful business is tough and leaving a successful and profitable business requires even more effort.\n\nThrough proper estate planning, you can establish such contingencies and minimise any complications, granting peace of mind for yourself and the ones you leave behind. You have spent much time and effort building your business - so why not take some time to plan for its continuity and leave a legacy that is worth keeping?\n\nThe writer is the founder and managing director of Family Legacy Pte Ltd\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nSMEs\n\nSpecialist centre Royal Healthcare to open in Tokyo or Osaka, after Japan\u2019s Sojitz takes control\n\nJul 09, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nNUS researchers\u2019 startup aims to halve the price of sustainable marine fuel\n\nJul 09, 2025 09:00 AM\n\n\u2018Not making enough to survive long\u2019: Tenants lament poor footfall, vacant units at Hao Mart\u2019s Taste Orchard\n\nJul 08, 2025 03:51 PM\n\nOCBC targets S$5 billion in loans to serial entrepreneurs by 2028\n\nJul 07, 2025 05:04 PM\n\nShatec shuts Orchard campus and training restaurant, cuts 42 staff, puts building up for sale\n\nJul 04, 2025 12:10 PM\n\nHow this otah business is rebranding heritage for the younger generation\n\nJul 02, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nMunchi Pancakes modernises traditional min jiang kueh as a \u2018national snack\u2019\n\nJul 02, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nChinatown Business Association seeks S$77,700 from Nanyang Old Coffee over use of outdoor area\n\nJun 26, 2025 10:23 AM", "images": []}

It will develop the skills and mastery needed to take our economy to the next level,\" he said. \"More fundamentally, it aims to empower Singaporeans to chart their own journey in life and gain fulfilment at work, even in their senior years.\"\n\nThe plan is to reach out to people starting from the time they are in secondary school, to help point them in the right direction in life.\n\nEvery Singaporean will be given an online Individual Learning Portfolio, a one-stop education, training and career-guidance resource to enable them to plan their learning, starting from their time in secondary school.\n\nBut Mr Tharman said that SkillsFuture was not about telling people that they have to zero in on a particular career at a given stage of their lives. Rather, it is about allowing them to discover their strengths and interests in order to make informed choices about their future course of study and the possible career opportunities that come with it.\n\nOn that note, the government will develop a professional core of education and career counsellors at schools and institutes of higher learning to provide better guidance for students.\n\nInternships in two-thirds of polytechnic courses and half the courses at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) will be enhanced over the next two years. More details will be announced at the upcoming Committee of Supply debate in parliament next month.\n\nAn Earn-and-Learn programme will be rolled out this year for fresh graduates from the polytechnics and ITE. Under this, they will be matched with suitable companies, where they will receive a salary and undergo on-the-job training that eventually leads to an industry-recognised qualification.\n\nBoth trainees and employers who sign up will receive \"substantial support\" from the government, said Mr Tharman, adding that the Earn-and-Learn programme would eventually be scaled up to cover a third of all polytechnic and ITE graduates.\n\nTo drive home the message that learning should never stop, he announced that education and training subsidies for Singaporeans aged 40 and above would be enhanced to a minimum of 90 per cent of training costs for government-funded courses.\n\nMeanwhile, the Education Ministry will provide multiple subsidies for modular courses at all levels, regardless of a person's age. Mr Tharman said that this flexible approach would cater to workers who need to balance their families, careers and learning.\n\nAnother major plank of SkillsFuture is study awards, with about 2,000 of these to be given out each year to those who want to develop specialist skills needed for Singapore's future growth clusters.\n\nAnd from 2016, there will also be about 100 SkillsFuture fellowships awarded every year to enable people to master the skills in their respective fields.\n\nThe government also intends to work with companies under a new Leadership Development Initiative, to develop a pipeline of Singaporeans to take on corporate leadership roles and responsibilities in the future.\n\n\"No one can honestly tell what they will be doing a decade or two after leaving school. We must each develop through life, adapting to changes in the job market and the new opportunities that will come up,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\n\"But whichever the field we are in or the job that we do, we must, as Singaporeans, aim to gain expertise and achieve mastery.\"\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is also an emphasis that our labour policy will continue to be tight. So I think in the larger scheme of things, we're not looking at business costs coming down.\"\n\nBut market watchers agree that the lowering of the income tax rebate cap to S$20,000 while maintaining it at 30 per cent is a clear indicator that the government wants to focus the benefits of the rebate mainly on the SME sector. This is opposed to the previous scheme, which benefits a wider spectrum of corporate taxpayers, noted Alan Lau, tax partner at KPMG in Singapore.\n\nIn Budget 2013, a 30 per cent corporate tax rebate capped at S$30,000 per year was granted to companies for three years. In the Budget announced on Monday, the cap was reduced to S$20,000, and extended for another two years.\n\nChai Wai Fook, partner, tax services, at Ernst & Young Solutions said: \"(This) is welcomed for all companies, especially for cash-strapped SMEs which can reinvest the tax savings to upgrade their capabilities and drive innovation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Wage Credit Scheme - designed to encourage wage increases of Singaporean employees who earn a gross monthly wage of below S$4,000 - will see the government's co-funding levels drop to 20 per cent from 40 per cent.\n\nDespite the drop, the extension of the scheme is a \"welcome move\" said Tan Boon Ngee, tax partner at KPMG in Singapore. \"The gradual phase out will push businesses to restructure in the tight labour market,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, a host of enhancements have been made to the Temporary Employment Credit (TEC) and Special Employment Credit (SEC) schemes.\n\nThere were two main enhancements to the TEC - bumping the TEC from 0.5 per cent (as announced last year) to 1 per cent of wages in 2015, and extending the TEC by two years. The TEC will be 1 per cent of wages in 2016 before dropping to 0.5 per cent of wages in 2017.\n\nDespite the enhancements, it is worth remembering that the TEC was announced in 2014 as a support scheme to help employers cope with higher wage costs arising from the 1 percentage point increase in the CPF employer contribution rate, noted ASME's Mr Wee. The enhancements announced are also balanced by the higher salary ceiling and increased CPF contribution for older workers.\n\nIn terms of SEC enhancements, employers who hire Singaporean workers aged 65 years and above earning up to S$4,000 a month in 2015 stand to receive an additional offset of up to 3 per cent of wages, bumping the maximum offset achievable to 11.5 per cent (capped at S$345 per month).\n\nFor Singaporean employees, the SEC payout is 11.5 per cent of wages for salaries up to S$3,000 per month. For those with salaries between S$3,000 and S$4,000, the SEC payout reduces linearly from 11.5 per cent of wages (or S$345) to S$0.\n\nSeparately, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam also announced a one-year road tax rebate for commercial vehicles that use petrol, to ease the transition to higher petrol duties. The higher duty rates - an increase of S$0.20 per litre for premium grade petrol and S$0.15 per litre for intermediate grade petrol - kicked in on Monday.\n\n\"The ground sentiment has always been that when oil prices go up, petrol prices goes up quite quickly but when oil prices come down, petrol prices come down at a slower pace. If petrol prices come down, technically, that was going to translate into business cost savings. Now, businesses cannot capture that,\" said Mr Wee.\n\nSMEs need to take advantage of the temporary support schemes and measures to innovate and \"shape up\" now, said Mr Wee. \"If you don't increase your level of innovation and productivity and level up more, I suspect that in 18 to 24 months, you'll be left in the wind. It's a very focused and targeted Budget, and I think DPM is very clear on what he wants to achieve, how he wants to mold the landscape. There are no more low hanging fruits for businesses in this budget. This is the last bus.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This software could track customers' every online move, intercept secure Web sessions and render their computers vulnerable to hackers.\n\nThe company buried its software in the lowest level of a PC's operating system, precisely where customers and anti-virus products would never detect it, and had been siphoning data back to servers belonging to Superfish, an Israeli software company with headquarters in Silicon Valley that markets itself as a visual search company.\n\nThe discoveries are the latest in a string of such revelations. As traditional security defences have begun fully to surround the outer layers of our devices, criminals, nation-states' hackers and apparently advertisers have turned their focus inwards, to the very heart of the machine, where their code is easily concealed.\n\nBefore last week's discoveries, there have been only two known cases of malicious code attacking the lowest level of a machine. The first was a 1998 computer virus, called CIH, for the initials of its author, Chen Ing-Hau, then a 24-year-old college student in Taiwan.\n\nThe virus was nicknamed Chernobyl because it was timed to strike on April 26, 1999, the 13th anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. Though it was intended to prove that a concept would work in the real world, it quickly spread beyond Taipei's Tatung Institute of Technology to millions of computers around the world.\n\nThe episode was an alarm for experts, who for years had been developing anti-virus products for the outer layers of a computer's operating system, but not the lowest levels of a machine. Security experts started to talk about there being \"a race to the bare metal\" of a machine.\n\nTheir fears were realised in September 2011, after security researchers discovered Mebromi, a second virus. The virus modified the first software that runs on a machine - the basic-input-output-system, or BIOS - in such a way that any attempt to clean it from the computer would be futile because the BIOS would just continue to re-infect it. But Mebromi affected only a small set of Chinese users.\n\nWhat makes the latest discoveries so disconcerting is that if a government or company can plant spyware in the lowest level of a machine, it can steal your passwords, serve up any Web page, steal your encryption keys and control your entire digital experience, undetected.\n\n\"If they can do that, they can do anything,\" said Peter Horne, the technology expert who first discovered the spyware in Lenovo's products.\n\nMr Horne, a 25-year veteran of the financial services technology industry, spotted Superfish early last month in a new Lenovo Yoga 2 Notepad that he bought in Australia.\n\nEven though the PC came with McAfee anti-virus software, Mr Horne said, he installed anti-virus software made by Trend Micro. Neither virus scanner picked up adware on the machine. But Mr Horne noted that traffic from the PC was being redirected to a website called best-deals-products.\n\ncom. When he dug further, he found that website's server was making calls to Superfish adware.\n\nSuperfish's \"visual discovery\" adware, Mr Horne and others now say, is far more intrusive than typical adware. It not only drops ads into a user's Web browser sessions, it hijacks a secure browsing session and scoops up data as users enter it into secure websites. In the process, it makes it easy for hackers to intercept communications.\n\nMr Horne returned his PC and went on to test Lenovo's demonstration machines at Best Buy stores in New York and Boston and at other retailers in Sydney and Perth, Australia. He found Superfish adware on other Lenovo Yoga 2 models and the Lenovo Edge 15.\n\nSuperfish's co-founder, Adi Pinhas, did not return requests for comment.\n\nIn a statement issued last Thursday, Lenovo said that it had included Superfish in some consumer notebooks shipped between September and December \"to help customers potentially discover interesting products while shopping\". Citing bad user reviews, the company said that it had stopped including the adware in January, the same month that Mr Horne brought the issue to the company's attention (and never received a response). By teaming with Superfish, \"Lenovo is either extraordinarily stupid or covering up\", Mr Horne said. \"Either is an offence to me.\"\n\nAs news of the Lenovo issue began circulating on Thursday, security researchers developed online tools for users to figure out whether Superfish was installed on their machines, and Microsoft began rooting out Superfish with its Windows Defender anti-virus software.

Instead of discharging its cargo within days and heading off for the next port, the ship idled offshore for nearly 11 weeks, discharging the oil at an unaccountably slow rate, according to shipping sources as well as vessel tracking data on ThomsonReuters Eikon.\n\nThat vessel finally set sail two weeks ago - but by then it had already been joined by five more idling tankers, an unusual and costly congregation that has puzzled experts and traders. All the vessels arrived by mid-January, and four of them are expected to stay in the waterway for up to five more weeks.\n\nThe cause of the tanker jam - which at its peak involved more than 3.5 million barrels of crude, worth an estimated US$175 million even at currently low prices - is not at all clear. The extended stays have even raised concerns about the welfare of sailors aboard the vessels.\n\nAll six of the tankers appear to have been destined for Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES), the 335,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery co-owned by The Carlyle Group and a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners, LP. Five of the cargoes were imported by the company itself or banks that finance their supplies, according to customs data. The sixth discharged at a Delaware River terminal used by PES, tracking data show.\n\nOne person familiar with the tankers said they are \"drip feeding\" crude into the plant, a rare set-up that may be caused by a lack of onshore storage space for these particular varieties of crude, or limitations on the rate at which the infrastructure can receive supplies, the person said.\n\nOthers say that might explain a prolonged stopover, but doesn't explain a months-long pause. PES, or other charterers, are paying a daily rate to keep the vessels idle. \"Crude ships queue and un-queue all the time. Just normal business cycles,\" Philadelphia Energy Solutions spokeswoman Cherice Corley said in an email when asked about the tankers. She declined any further comment on the issue.\n\nRepeated attempts to contact the owners or managers of the ships, most based in Greece, were unsuccessful.\n\nSome sources speculated that the tankers might be related to the revival of the \"floating storage\" trade, in which traders can make money by buying deeply discounted immediate-delivery crude oil and waiting to sell it months later when prices rally.\n\nYet while some two dozen supertankers have recently been chartered across the world for such a purpose, the tankers off Delaware are generally too small - and arrived too early - to capitalise on the trade, traders say.\n\nBig Stone anchorage, a stretch of water a few miles off the coast of Delaware and New Jersey, is usually used for lightering ships - using barges to siphon off crude so that the tankers are light enough to enter the ports. Typically, this takes less than a week, local shipping sources said.\n\nThe Value, an Aframax tanker from Canada, arrived on Dec 15 and has yet to depart. It loitered so long that it ran out of fuel in early January, according to the US Coast Guard.\n\nThe Toska, which left Nigeria with an estimated one million barrels of Qua Iboe crude in late November, has been there since Dec 13, but has discharged only about one-third of its cargo, according to customs data from Piers available on Eikon.\n\nThe Minerva Helen, carrying 710,000 barrels of Canadian White Rose crude, arrived on Nov 27, the same day that Opec's decision to preserve production levels sent crude markets into a tailspin. It is not scheduled to depart until March 3, according to the Seaman's Church Institute of Philadelphia, a non-profit that monitors activity at the port.\n\nThe importers of record include two banks: JPMorgan Chase & Co, which had a contract supplying and financing crude to PES; and Bank of America unit Merrill Lynch Commodities, which took over that contract late last year. Two cargoes were received directly by PES, and the last one by ExxonMobil, according to customs data collected by Piers and available via Eikon's Trade Flows database.\n\nThere are no fees for staying at the Big Stone anchorage, and no restrictions on how long ships can stay there, according to the Coast Guard. \"We are concerned.

At S$0.13 billion, the deficit was about 0.03 per cent of GDP.\n\nMeanwhile, the actual surplus for FY13 was revised upwards to S$5 billion from S$3.92 billion previously.\n\n\"Our Budget for FY2014 is expected to record a slightly smaller deficit than what we estimated a year ago,\" said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in his annual Budget speech on Monday. \"We now expect a very small deficit of S$0.1 billion, close to a balanced position.\"\n\nFor FY14, operating revenue is now expected to come to S$61.35 billion, up 3.1 per cent from the S$59.51 billion estimated previously, with corporate income tax, motor vehicle taxes and vehicle quota premiums as the main drivers behind the increase.\n\nRevenue from corporate income tax is now estimated at S$13.46 billion - vis-a-vis an anticipated S$13.03 billion previously - while vehicle quota premiums should work out to S$3.67 billion, up from an estimated S$2.95 billion. Motor vehicle taxes are also expected to be higher at S$1.81 billion, up nearly 34 per cent.\n\nAt S$57.2 billion, expenditure was nearly one per cent higher than expected due to increased spending for ministries such as Education, Home Affairs, Trade and Industry as well as National Development. This translated into a primary balance of S$4.15 billion, up sharply from an expected S$2.85 billion.\n\nSpecial transfers - excluding top-ups to endowment and trust funds - are also projected to be higher at S$4.33 billion, up from S$3.61 billion, owing to greater spending on productivity and innovation credit (PIC), PIC bonus and the Pioneer Generation Package.\n\nSpending on PIC, for instance, was nearly double the S$0.74 billion budgeted and the revised PIC bonus spending totalled some S$0.67 billion, higher than the S$0.32 billion estimate.\n\nMeanwhile, top-ups to endowment and trust funds came to S$8.5 billion, in line with expectations.\n\nNIRC totalled S$8.55 billion, up from a projected S$8.1 billion.\n\nSeparately, actual figures for FY13 also showed that operating revenue came in at S$57.02 billion, while total expenditure was lower than expected at S$51.73 billion.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By comparison, those who have been focused on the local turf registered productivity growth of less than one per cent.\n\n\"Budget 2015 will sharpen support to businesses that are making significant effort to raise productivity, especially by innovating and internationalising,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nTo nudge more companies to explore overseas markets, the government will offer a new 10 per cent concessionary tax rate on certain income of larger companies that are expanding abroad. Details have not been announced, but Mr Tharman said that such companies must continue to anchor their key business activities and headquarters in Singapore.\n\nOn top of this, the government will raise its support under its internationalisation grants to 70 per cent for all forms of overseas activities for three years. As it is, 700 projects are expected to qualify for the revised scheme.\n\nThe government will also broaden a tax incentive - which now offers a 200 per cent tax deduction against qualifying market expansion activities - to cover manpower expenses. This effectively means the scheme could cover salaries incurred for Singaporeans posted overseas, said Mr Tharman.\n\nThese incentives to push companies beyond Singapore are expected to cost S$240 million, he added.\n\nTo ensure that homegrown firms will be able to compete effectively overseas, the government will boost incentives for companies scaling up through acquisitions. One move is to raise the tax allowance for acquisition costs from the current 5 per cent to 25 per cent of the acquisition value.\n\nBesides this, companies will be able to claim benefits for acquisitions that translate to a 20 per cent shareholding in the target firm, down from the 50 per cent threshold now. \"This will be especially helpful for SMEs, who may not be able to acquire large stakes in their expansion strategies,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nTo boost innovation, Mr Tharman tweaked existing grants for SMEs, and ramped up financing for new firms.\n\nSMEs that apply for the Capability Development Grants will go through a simpler process if their projects are valued below S$30,000. Funding support of up to 70 per cent of project costs will also be extended till 2018.\n\nMr Tharman introduced a venture debt risk-sharing programme, under which the government will provide 50 per cent risk-sharing with selected financial institutions offering venture debt over an initial two years. He expects to \"catalyse\" some 100 venture debt loans, totalling about S$500 million, during this time.\n\nEric Tham, head of group commercial banking at UOB said that this risk-sharing programme is a \"forward-thinking move\", as Singapore becomes an international hub for high-tech ventures.\n\nLikewise, Anuj Kagalwala, financial services tax leader at PwC Singapore, supported the move, as it speeds up the search for \"Singapore's very own Alibaba and Facebook\".\n\nMr Tharman also increased the co-investment cap for both the Startup Enterprise Development Scheme and Business Angel Scheme.\n\nAnd with this emphasis on innovation, the government will boost R&D funding, and for this, the National Research Fund will be topped up by S$1 billion this year, said Mr Tharman.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In a client note, AffinHwang said it was positive on the purchase, even though it could boost Sime's gearing to almost 0.5x; it said Sime had the ability to deal with higher borrowings, having raised RM1.3 billion (S$485.6 million) through the issue of new shares under its second dividend re-investment plan recently.\n\nMoreover, the state-owned company can reduce its average annual group capital expenditure of some RM4 billion to under RM3 billion.\n\nLast Oct 9, Sime Darby launched a \u00a31.07 billion (S$3.56 billion) offer for NBPOL.\n\nAmResearch had viewed the \u00a37.15-a-share offer to be pricey, as valuations were at the upper range of 22x PE FY15(F) and value dilutive for the group.\n\nEven then, the ringgit has since slipped 7.27 per cent to RM5.60 against the British pound from RM5.221 last Oct 9, on investor concerns that Malaysia's relative dependency on petroleum income would hurt the country's prospects, with oil prices now halved.\n\nAgainst the greenback, the ringgit has fallen by an even more pronounced 12.5 per cent.\n\nStill, Sime remains confident that the acquisition of NBPOL would pay off in the longer term, in that it would provide the conglomerate a rare opportunity to acquire a business that could pave the way for its geographical expansion, as well as present a chance to move up the value chain upstream.\n\nBecause of the large outflow of funds in recent months, in a January revision of the national budget prompted by the plunge in oil prices, the Malaysian government directed state-owned companies to focus on domestic investments and to defer overseas acquisitions.\n\nAs at Dec 3, Sime had received acceptances amounting to nearly 59 per cent of NBPOL's total voting shares, including some 49 per cent owned by Kulim (Malaysia).\n\nAffinHwang said that, assuming a 70:30 debt-equity financing structure, additional borrowings of about RM2.7 billion would be needed to buy NBPOL. This would raise Sime's group borrowings to RM14.34 billion from RM11.66 billion as at end September 2014, and increase its debt-equity ratio to 0.48x from 0.39x.\n\nAccording to its projections, the NBPOL buy would enhance Sime's earnings per share by between 1.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent over the next three years.\n\nAn initial public offering of Sime's automotive assets could raise additional funds, but could be dicey amid weak market sentiments.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a complaint on behalf of Ms Elauf against Abercrombie & Fitch, which is known for sales associates often dressed in racy attire, and attorneys said that she is protected by the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Under the act, no one can be refused employment based on their religion, unless the employer cannot accommodate the person's religious beliefs without adversely affecting business.\n\nThe closely watched case could have deep ramifications for how businesses hire their employees because it would place the burden on employers to warn job applicants of any characteristics that could hurt their candidacy, experts said.\n\nA federal district court sided with Ms Elauf and her lawyers in the case, but she lost on appeal when the Denver, Colorado-based 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Abercrombie. The appeals court ruled that the 1964 act only protects employees who provide \"explicit notice of the need for a religious accommodation\".\n\nThe US Supreme Court, which usually sides with those who claim that their religious freedoms have been violated, sharply criticised the appeals court decision, warning that it \"will lead to irrational results in other cases as well\".\n\n\"Who bears the burden of initiating a dialogue as to any potential religious conflict?\" asked Rachel Paulose, a former US attorney, in explaining the key question at the heart of the case. \"The EEOC argues the burden should be on the employer if it suspects a possible (religious) conflict, while Abercrombie argues . . . the initial responsibility (is placed) squarely upon the employee or applicant in every situation.\"\n\nThe case has received support from religious rights groups and US President Barack Obama's administration, which appealed the Colorado court's decision. The EEOC said that its cases involving complaints of religious discrimination have more than doubled in the past 15 years. A decision by the high court is expected in June.

Sales of bottled flat water in supermarkets grew 11 per cent in 2014, while sales of sparkling waters without any sweetener grew 20 per cent.\n\nStill, even Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have struggled in the water business, where there are so many competitors selling bottled water, flat and sparkling, at cheap prices. And SodaStream's canisters for carbonation are prohibitively expensive for many families and often cumbersome to recycle.\n\nMr Birnbaum is trying to restore his company's sales in the United States, which have declined since reaching a peak in 2013. In a conference call with investment analysts last October, he also warned of a similar pattern starting to infect SodaStream's European business.\n\nSales fell roughly 13 per cent to US$125.9 million for the quarter that ended on Sept 30, and sales of soda makers in the United States plunged 60 per cent to just 160,000. Flavourings sales dropped 28 per cent, and sales of the gas canisters used to aerate water were level.\n\nProfits peaked in 2012 at US$43.9 million, and sales crested in the quarter that ended Sept 30, 2013.\n\nSodaStream machines have been far more popular in Europe, particularly in Germany and Scandinavia, where soft drinks are expensive and consumers are much more attuned to the impact of packaging on the environment.\n\nIn the US, soft drinks are still cheap - and even so, are losing sales as a category as consumers here work to reduce sugar in their diets and have increasing concerns about aspartame and other artificial sweeteners used in low-calorie soft drinks. Investment and industry analysts say it is now clear that SodaStream will never go head-to-head with Coca-Cola and Pepsi.\n\n\"I have never believed that SodaStream was going to be a soda company in the US,\" said John Faucher, an investment analyst at JPMorgan Chase.\n\nAt a conference in December sponsored by Beverage Digest, Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo, was asked whether she thought home dispensers such as SodaStream would become a major source of beverage consumption. PepsiCo is doing a test in Florida that allows SodaStream users to make homemade versions of Pepsi and Sierra Mist.\n\n\"When you go to 'make your own', it's very hard to replicate the taste of the original product,\" Mrs Nooyi said. \"And so what happens is people taste the products they make at home and say, 'Hmmm, it doesn't taste as good as Pepsi.'\" Moreover, she added, \"if it takes 45 seconds to make a Pepsi at home as opposed to three seconds to pop open a can, they think that's 42 seconds wasted.\"\n\nSo much for the rumours that Pepsi is going to buy SodaStream. And so in June, the gadget company will begin selling its own fruit flavours, although it had paired with Crystal Light flavourings before. (It will continue to have a relationship with Crystal Light.) Some of the new offerings will be low in calories, others will have added vitamins, fiber and protein. Some will be sweetened with a combination of fructose and stevia, a natural low-calorie sweetener, while others will have no calories.\n\n\"I don't think we have it all figured out yet,\" Mr Birnbaum said. \"We're not perfect, but we're on the right path.\" He said, for instance, that the company had not yet settled on how to tell its new story - despite its knack for generating free publicity.\n\nIt spent handsomely on a commercial to air during the 2013 Super Bowl, only to have CBS ban it, perhaps because the ad poked too much fun at Coke and Pepsi, which are major sponsors. CBS never commented.\n\nThe same thing happened the following year, when SodaStream came up with a Super Bowl ad featuring its new spokeswoman, actress Scarlett Johansson. Fox, which broadcast the game, banned the ad, never commenting on its reasons for doing so.\n\nThen Johansson was forced to resign from the board of Oxfam, an international aid organisation, because SodaStream had a factory in an industrial zone in the West Bank. The factory had long been the target of protesters who contended that it legitimised Israeli settlements in the disputed territory. Last fall, the company said it would close that plant and one other as part of a consolidation effort.\n\n\"No more Super Bowl,\" Mr Birnbaum said. \"We don't belong there - or need one scandal after another.\" He said the company had no plans for a major advertising campaign around its reintroduction as a sparkling water business and instead would rely on social media such as Instagram and Facebook in hopes of reaching \"influencers\".\n\nThe real challenge for SodaStream, analysts say, is selling more of its machines - and in turn, more of the canisters of carbon dioxide gas used to aerate water, where the real profits lie.\n\n\"The broader issue for them is that our numbers show machines in about 2 per cent of households in the US - and that penetration has been stagnant for the last year and a half,\" said Bill Schmitz, an investment analyst at Deutsche Bank.

In the end, it looked like a total triumph for the Germans, who forced Alexis Tsipras, Greece's new leftist prime minister, to swallow virtually all of their demands.\n\nBut it was not a feel-good victory, nor one that bodes well for a single currency bloc struggling to emerge from a half-decade of financial and economic crisis, and increasingly threatened by populist political forces. Mr Tsipras and his finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, a charismatic economist with a passion for Karl Marx and flair for rhetoric, clearly overplayed their hands. Their pledge to roll back German-ordered austerity and keep Greece in the euro always looked unrealistic.\n\nOne of those promises would have to go, and with a solid majority of Greeks keen to stay in the currency bloc, it should have been clear which would crumble. Still, it is hard to avoid the sense that Germany also may have gone too far.\n\nFinance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble's public rejection of a Greek proposal surprised eurozone partners as well as Cabinet colleagues in Berlin, including Chancellor Angela Merkel. It was not Mr Schaeuble's objections to the draft which were problematic, but his decision to go public at such a sensitive point rather than do so behind closed doors. That meant the Greeks could not climb down without a near-total loss of face. On Friday, once they had buckled, Mr Schaeuble rubbed it in again, saying: \"The Greeks will certainly have a difficult time explaining this deal to their voters.\"\n\nMr Tsipras tried to spin the deal as a victory, describing it to Greeks in an address to the nation as a step towards leaving behind austerity, the bailouts and the dreaded troika - the European and IMF officials who monitor Greek reform progress. \"We won a battle, not the war,\" Mr Tsipras said. In truth, like the Brazilian soccer team last summer, the Greeks emerged beaten and bewildered from their tussle with Germany.\n\nMarcel Fratzscher, a leading German economist, said that this was neither a good outcome for Greece nor for Germany and Europe. In soccer terms, a 3-1 victory would have been better for all involved. \"The Greek government will only be able to tackle difficult reforms in the coming months if it saves face and its credibility,\" wrote Mr Fratzscher in German weekly Die Zeit.\n\nSyriza's far-left radical wing has so far been silent on the concessions Mr Tsipras swallowed to reach a deal. But that could change, threatening the cohesion of an unwieldy coalition government. \"What will be crucial in the next four months is whether Greeks develop the sense that it's their government that has the upper hand in policymaking or whether it is the foreign institutions that are ordering it around,\" said Costas Panagopoulos, of Greek polling group Alco.\n\nMr Tsipras was right that the deal was just one of the many battles his government must fight in the months ahead. On Monday, it must submit a list of planned reforms, which require approval by the troika before national parliaments can vote on new loans to Athens.\n\nAt the end of April, the troika will rule on whether the government has implemented the reforms and whether Athens receives the last of its aid tranche. In June, the extended second bailout programme expires, giving Greece and Mr Tsipras a chance to go it alone. But with billions of euros in bond repayments due this summer, a third bailout programme, with new budget and reform conditions, cannot be ruled out.\n\nDeeply strained ties between Athens and Berlin will not make these negotiations easy. According to some officials in Brussels, the relationship between Mr Schaeuble and Mr Varoufakis may be beyond repair after the Greek minister's suggestion at a joint news conference this month that German austerity policies were leading to the rise of Nazis in Greece.\n\nOfficials in Berlin deny Mr Schaeuble was bothered by those comments or by a Nazi caricature of him that appeared in a newspaper close to the ruling Syriza party. But they acknowledge a complete breakdown in trust. \"It will be difficult to build this up again,\" said one official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. \"Schaeuble believes if a country doesn't respect the rules we are better off without them,\" the official added. \"We can't have a situation where we are constantly having to spend our time on a country that makes up 2 per cent of the bloc's GDP.\"\n\nMr Schaeuble's stance was praised in conservative German media. \"Finally someone has said no to the bankrupt Greeks\", read a headline in Germany's top-selling Bild newspaper on Friday.\"Germany says thank you, Wolfgang Schaeuble!\"\n\nBut it is likely to add to fears of what sociologist Ulrich Beck has called a \"German Europe\", in which a reluctant Berlin wields an economic rule book to assert its influence over its partners.

He served as defence minister and foreign minister under former prime minister John Major.\n\nAccording to the report, Mr Straw told reporters he worked \"under the radar\" to change European Union rules to help a commodity firm that paid him \u00a360,000 a year.\n\nMr Straw also claimed to have used \"charm and menace\" to convince a former Ukrainian prime minister to change laws on behalf of the same company, according to the report.\n\nThe Telegraph said journalists had contacted 12 lawmakers in the investigation, six of whom did not respond and one who said his contacts were not \"for sale\".

It would be a record for a residential listing, topping a US$130 million offering planned at Zeckendorf Development Co's 520 Park Ave.\n\nAs luxury apartments proliferate in Manhattan, builders are offering their premier units at ever-higher prices as a way of standing out from the crowd, said Jonathan Miller, president of New York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. So far, the highest price ever paid for a condominium in the city is US$100.5 million, a deal completed in December for a duplex penthouse at the One57 tower.\n\n\"The penthouse seems to be a strategy to train focus on the development,\" said Mr Miller. \"Buyers in the super-luxury market are obsessed with having an asset that's unique and not cookie-cutter.\"\n\nChetrit Group, led by Joseph Chetrit, is converting the former offices of Sony Corp's US headquarters at 550 Madison Ave into luxury residences. The US$150 million triplex, on the 33rd through 35th floors, will have eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a spa and a wine room, according to the attorney general's office, which oversees condo development plans.\n\nPhone messages left at Chetrit Group's Manhattan office weren't returned. Kathleen Cudahy, a spokeswoman for the developer, said that Chetrit wasn't immediately available to comment. The Real Deal reported the record US$150 million price last Tuesday.\n\nThis year, 2,386 newly built luxury condos will be listed for sale in Manhattan, the most on record, according to data compiled by Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. The brokerage defines luxury as units priced at more than US$2,300 a square foot.\n\nManhattan developers are testing the upper limits of what investors are willing to pay as they seek a haven for their cash, said Nancy Packes, a marketing and design consultant to New York residential builders. \"No one knows where the ceiling is and they're trying to find it,\" she added. \"The amount of global wealth being created is still great.\"\n\nAt Zeckendorf's 520 Park, the 12,394-square-foot penthouse spans the top three floors of the building near 60th Street. The developer is also listing a US$100 million penthouse at its 50 United Nations Plaza tower on First Avenue across the street from the UN Secretariat headquarters.\n\nDevelopers of condos at lower Manhattan's landmark Woolworth Building said that they would seek US$110 million for the penthouse atop the 58-story tower, according to filings last year with the attorney general's office.\n\nThere's no guarantee these prices will be reached. At Extell Development Co's One 57, the last asking price for the US$100.5 million condo was US$115 million, a price list filed with the attorney general's office shows.

There is no draw on past reserves.\"\n\nOperating revenue for FY15 is expected to climb 4.8 per cent to S$64.27 billion, driven by motor vehicle-related revenues such as motor vehicle taxes and vehicle quota premiums. On the other hand, stamp duty collections for FY15 are estimated at S$2.6 billion, or 7 per cent less than the revised estimate for FY14.\n\nMeanwhile, budgeted expenditure for FY15 will rise sharply from S$57.2 billion to S$68.22 billion in one of the biggest increases over the last decade.\n\n\"Overall, the budget presents long-term plans by the state to invest heavily in infrastructure,\" noted Desmond Sim, head of CBRE Research (Singapore & South East Asia). \"These plans will reinforce Singapore's position as a leading seaport and airport and it bodes well for both the hospitality and the logistics markets for the future.\"\n\nFor instance, the Ministry of Transport is expected to see expenditure of around S$10.9 billion for FY15, rising 80.6 per cent from FY14, as funds are channelled towards expanding Changi Airport and boosting rail infrastructure such as the Thomson-East Coast Line and the Tuas West extension.\n\nPlans are underway to start developing Changi Airport's Terminal 5 to ensure the airport maintains its edge as a competitive air hub in the region. The new terminal, which is expected to come onstream in the mid-2020s, will boost Changi's handling capacity to 135 million passengers per annum.\n\nAside from transport, investments are also being made towards improving health care as well as towards developing Singapore's heartlands.\n\nFor health care, significant efforts are being made towards beefing up Singapore's healthcare infrastructure - such as by expanding capacity in public and community hospitals as well as nursing homes by 2020. Thus, expenditure for health for FY15 is expected to rise by nearly 30 per cent to S$9.3 billion.\n\nBeyond FY15, government expenditure is also expected to rise over the medium to long term, highlighted Mr Tharman in his speech. The government's overall spending is expected to hit 19 per cent to 19.5 per cent of GDP on average over the next five years.\n\nMeanwhile, net investment returns contribution for FY15 is expected to grow to S$8.94 billion from S$8.55 billion for FY14.\n\nBudget 2015 will also see S$11.67 billion set aside for special transfers as well as top-ups to endowment funds and trust funds. Of the S$11.67 billion, S$5.67 billion are in special transfers - up from S$4.33 billion for FY14 - which include GST Voucher Special Payments, Temporary Employment Credit, Productivity and Innovation Credit and the Wage Credit Scheme.

Mr Ito, 61, will be replaced by managing officer Takahiro Hachigo, 55, with the changes occurring in June, according to the company, which was planning to hold a briefing later to discuss the changes.\n\nThe management overhaul comes weeks after Honda cut its profit forecasts for the second time in as many quarters after recalls tied to flawed Takata Corp air bags and the new hybrid systems in its best-selling Fit compact car and Vezel SUV.\n\nThe carmaker's worst quality issues in decades have derailed plans to introduce new models and led Honda to project its first profit drop in three years.\n\nMr Hachigo, who began his career at Tokyo-based Honda in 1982 as an engineer in the area of chassis design, was responsible for developing the US-built Odyssey minivans that were launched in 1999, as well as the CR-V sport utility vehicle in 2001. His career led him to executive roles across the US, Europe, China and Japan before he was promoted to managing officer last year.\n\nNSX chief Mr Ito, who has been president since 2009, joined Honda in 1978, also as a chassis design engineer. Mr Ito is credited with being in charge of developing the all-aluminium frame structure for the NSX sports car that went on sale in 1990.\n\nMore recently, beset by the biggest quality problems under his stewardship, Mr Ito pledged to bring the company back to basics and scrapped Honda's target of selling six million vehicles annually by 2017 because the pressure to reach the objective contributed to quality lapses.\n\nHonda has called back 14 million vehicles worldwide since 2008 to replace air bags made by Takata, in which it has a 1.2 per cent ownership stake. The defective air bags, which can rupture during deployment and propel metal shards at passengers, have been linked to five fatalities in the US and the deaths of a pregnant woman and her unborn child in Malaysia.\n\nWhile the Takata recalls affected at least nine other carmakers, scrutiny of how Honda responded to the flaws led to the US government slapping the company with a record US$70 million fine for failing to report more than 1,700 death and injury incidents to regulators over 11 years.\n\nHonda's quality problems go beyond air bags. The carmaker has called back the Fit - its top-selling model in Japan - five times since its introduction in late 2013, and recalled its Vezel crossover three times. Those fixes delayed the roll-out of other new vehicles by as long as six months.\n\nAfter the fifth Fit recall, Honda created a new position of executive officer in charge of auto quality and appointed Koichi Fukuo to take charge.\n\nAmong other executives, Takashi Yamamoto, currently in charge of production, and Yoshiharu Yamamoto, head of Honda R&D, will step down, the company said.\n\nHonda fell 0.9 per cent to close at 3,928.50 yen (S$44.90) in Tokyo. The company made the announcement as the market closed at 3pm.

Initial deposits for the construction of the first MPP have been paid, and another one will begin construction within 30 days.\n\nMagnum Modular is focusing on rolling out 150 MPPs within 36 months in the South Korean and Japanese markets as it eyes their attractive tariffs and a liberalised market for power generation. It expects the turnkey operation of the first MPP to begin by April 10 this year, which is dependent on approval from the city of Pohang and the Korea Power Exchange.\n\nSino Construction's executive director Drew Madacsi said in a press statement that there is a growing global trend of developed countries implementing preferential tariff rates for renewable fuel sources used in power generation to reduce carbon emissions. \"This has resulted in immense market opportunities for entrants like Magnum Modular to build a long-term, stable margin business,\" he said.\n\nMagnum Modular's MPPs allow multiple fuels as feedstock, including biofuels, and have the ability to supply on grid or be standalone, offering flexibility to national utilities and power consumers. Constructing MPPs with renewable feedstocks will be one of the leading growth drivers for Magnum Modular in the near future, Sino Construction said.\n\nSino Construction's counter closed unchanged on Monday at S$0.275.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All of this has nothing to do with Islam, the US President contends.\n\nPresident Obama's decision not to go to France alongside other world leaders during their unity rally after the horrendous terrorist attacks there - and not to even send someone with a higher profile than the American ambassador to the event - also raised quite a few highbrows in Washington and in Europe. So did his labelling of the Jewish individuals who were brutally killed by the terrorists in Paris as \"a bunch of folks\" who were randomly shot by \"zealots\", as though the terrorists were not Muslims who had targeted a group of Jews.\n\nAnd then a few days after Islamic State (IS) militants shocked the world by releasing a video showing a captured Jordanian pilot being burned to death, Mr Obama told a mostly Christian audience gathered for the annual National Prayer Breakfast (NPB) in Washington, DC, to get off their proverbial moral \"high horse\" and stop thinking that the brutality committed by IS and other Islamist terrorist groups was unique, recalling that \"during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ\". Those comments in turn ignited criticism, especially among conservatives, that Mr Obama was drawing a moral equivalency between radical Islamists and Christians.\n\nMoreover, Mr Obama and other officials in his administration have gone out of their way to stress that the United States was not fighting \"radical Islamists\" or \"Muslim terrorists\" or \"jihadists\" but instead have been referring to the generic \"violent extremists\". There is no war between Islam and the West, and forget about a \"Clash of Civilisations\", they insist.\n\nIn fact, as Mr Obama argued during his NPB address that the terrorists in Paris, the IS in Syria and Iraq, the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, have nothing to do with Islam and actually \"distort\" and \"pervert\" through their \"nihilistic acts\" what is in essence a tolerant \"religion of peace\", in the same way the Crusaders and the Inquisition had supposedly nothing to do with the message of Christianity.\n\nSome would argue that Mr Obama's remarks may have been an attempt to avoid alienating Muslims by blaming their religion for groups like IS. After all, the US has a growing and vibrant Muslim population and Washington has major allies in the Muslim world, including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, that are cooperating with the Americans in the fight against IS and other Middle Eastern terrorist groups.\n\nAt the same time, bashers of President Barack Hussein Obama on the political right would explain his comments about Muslims and Islam by \"accusing\" the current White House occupant of being a Kenyan-born \"Muslim\" who is an ally of the Muslim Brotherhood and other Muslim causes.\n\nIn reality, Mr Obama may be following a more long-term realpolitik strategy. He seems to be trying to distance the US from the historical legacy of European imperialism, including the era of British and French imperialism when large parts of the Middle East and South Asia came under the control of the European powers.\n\nIn a way, it was the bloody anti-colonial struggles and eventually the immigration of hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the Middle East and South Asia into Europe which helped create the conditions for the current friction between Muslims and non-Muslims there.\n\nThe message of Mr Obama is that the US was not part of that historical narrative. As he pointed out on numerous occasions, unlike the problems Muslim immigrants face in Europe, most of the Muslims who have settled in the US have been successfully integrated into American society and have done well in all walks of life.\n\nIt is therefore the responsibility of the Europeans to absorb their growing Muslim population, and there is no reason why the US should be drawn into the current mess there. If anything, the Europeans could learn a lesson from America's immigration policies and its struggle for civil rights.\n\nIn any case, Mr Obama remains committed to the long-term strategy of ending US military interventions in the Middle East, starting with the steps taken to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has emphasised that the US is not going to deploy troops to battle IS in Iraq and Syria and that the main responsibility for the fight should be placed on the Iraqi government, the Kurds and other regional powers.\n\nMoreover, his efforts to reach a diplomatic deal with Iran go beyond the issue of its nuclear military programme. He wants to end the long-time enmity between the US and Iran and co-opt it as a major player in the evolving regional balance of power, in the same way that former US president Richard Nixon launched his opening towards China in order to re-arrange the strategic chessboard.\n\nAnd as America becomes a major energy producer and reduces its dependency on Middle Eastern oil it could start gradually disengaging from the region and pivoting to the Pacific. The demographic changes taking place in America where the white majority is expected to become a minority in a nation that would become more Latin, Asian, and African, will only help transform the European identity and detach it from an ageing and ailing Europe and from the adjunct Middle East. Let the Europeans spend more resources in dealing with that region and its problems, including the Israeli-Palestinian dispute that remains central to their strategic interests.\n\nFrom that perspective, Mr Obama's efforts to refrain from alienating the Muslim world and reaching some sort of a modus vivendi with it makes a lot of sense. But then whether Mr Obama likes it or not, the US remains stuck in the Middle East and is seen by many Arabs and Muslims as the global hegemon that is responsible for their problems as the protector of the monarchs and the dictators they hate as well as Israel's main patron.\n\nMr Obama may want to convince the world's Muslims that America isn't their enemy. The problem is that his power of persuasion could prove to be quite limited.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The proceeds from the oil exports will go to the central bank which has sought to stay out of the conflict.\n\nOil exports have fallen to less than 200,000 barrels a day with the closure of the eastern Hariga port due to a pipeline blast a week ago, a fraction of the up to 1.3 million barrels it exported daily prior to the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.\n\nMost Libyan oilfields have stopped working due to the power struggle.\n\nThe first tanker in almost a year loaded crude from the eastern port of Zueitina on Sunday, an oil official said.\n\nThe oilfield named 103 and Harouge Oil Co feeding into the port have resumed work. A Greek-registered tanker left for Italy on Sunday after loading 750,000 barrels of oil, the official said.\n\nIt was not clear how much of the lifting came from tanks which had been full when a protest started in summer 2013. An industry source said field 103 had resumed work with an output of 15,000 bpd, while Harouge was pumping 14,000 bpd from its Amer field.\n\nThe port, the smallest of four eastern terminals, reopened in April last year after a former rebel group wanting autonomy for eastern Libya lifted its blockade, but since then strikes and technical delays had prevented the resumption of exports.\n\nFurther in the east, engineers at the Sarir field, the country's biggest, started testing the pipeline to Hariga that had been damaged by a blast a week ago. \"We have started a test pumping to assess the maintenance. Most likely the final result of the test will be clearer (on Monday),\" said Omran Al-Zwie, spokesman for the port and oil field operator Arabian Gulf Oil Co.\n\nAn industry source said the pumping rate was 40,000 barrels on Sunday. Hariga used to export from the Sarir and nearby Messla fields a total of 120,000 bpd.\n\nBut another oil official said it would take up to 10 days to resume exports from Hariga to allow finishing of the pipeline repair. Officials often given contradictory accounts in Libya.\n\nThere have been some exports from Hariga since the blast closed the pipeline using oil in storage at the port but the oil official said the 500,000 barrels remaining there would be used for domestic refinery use.\n\nHariga is also home to a 20,000 bpd refinery. A second refinery in Zawiya west of Tripoli, which has a capacity of 120,000 bpd, is mainly fed from Brega port.

Together, both constitute the fourth pillar of social security. They will help mitigate life's inequalities,\" he said.\n\nHome ownership, the Central Provident Fund and healthcare assurance are the other three pillars.\n\nThe idea for Silver Support was first mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech last year.\n\nThe programme targets the bottom 20 per cent of Singaporeans aged 65 and above; a smaller quantum of support will be extended to cover up to 30 per cent of seniors, similar to the structure of Workfare's support for wage-earners.\n\nSilver Support payouts will range from S$300 to S$750 every quarter, with those living in smaller HDB flats likely to receive more.\n\nExpected to benefit 150,000 of today's elderly, the programme will cost the government S$350 million in its first full year.\n\nSim Guan Seng, managing partner at accounting firm Baker Tilly TFW, said: \"A measure like the Silver Support Scheme to help needy elderly Singaporeans requires precious budgetary resources and reveals a heart of gold.\"\n\nMr Tharman said the majority of seniors living in one and two-room flats will receive payouts under the scheme, with a smaller proportion of those living in larger HDB flats also qualifying.\n\nHe added, however, that flat size would not be the only qualifying criterion; senior citizens' wages over their lifetime and the level of household support they get will be criteria assessed along with flat size. \"We cannot look at one of these factors on its own. Some seniors who live in larger flats had low wages for most of their lives and hence limited savings, and may be living with children who themselves do not earn much.\"\n\nHe also cautioned against seeing Silver Support as a substitute for other sources of income. \"What it aims to do is to supplement incomes in a modest but meaningful way.\"\n\nMr Tharman said Silver Support reflects the values Singapore must preserve as an inclusive society. \"It is the fair thing to do - to help fellow citizens who end up with much less than others in their retirement years.\"\n\nLike Workfare, Silver Support is part of a system of progressive social support.

In a profession where success depends on gaining strangers' trust and winning word-of-mouth referrals, older agents are scared they won't be able to relate. \"There's a huge disconnect,\" said Mr Reyes, president of Manchester, Conneticut-based Silent Partner Marketing, a company that has advised real estate brokerages on appealing to millennials. \"I'm seeing a slow generational shift towards younger agents.\"\n\nHis blog post, which was about modern modes of communication in general, not just the conversational skills of young homebuyers, struck a chord. \"Tweets, short cryptic emails, texts, etc don't convey deep communication when it is needed,\" Leslie Campos, a Safford (Arizona)-based real estate agent, complained in the comments.\n\n\"With the millennial, they don't speak, they don't smile,\" wrote Lenn Harley, a broker serving Northern Virginia and Maryland, in a follow-up post.\n\nBy now, the hand-wringing over entitled, independent, Internet-addled millennials has played out in most corners of the US economy. But millennials - usually defined as people born after 1980 - have a particularly strong hold on the real estate industry's collective psyche. That's partly because in recent years, first-time homebuyers have been notably slow to join the housing recovery. The recession and student debt loads made it hard for young Americans to save money, and a tendency to start families later in life has reduced the urgency to buy homes. Nonetheless, agents know it's crucial to learn to do business with young people: A 30-year-old is likely to buy and sell more homes in the decades to come than a woman twice her age.\n\nThat's a potential problem for the average agent, who is 56 years old, according to the National Association of Realtors. \"Everyone wants to be treated as valuable,\" says Jason Dorsey, 36, chief strategy officer at the Center for Generational Kinetics, a research and consulting firm. \"For my dad, that would mean leaving him a detailed voice message. For me, it's knowing not to leave a voice message, but to send a text message instead.\"\n\nMr Dorsey has been travelling the real estate conference circuit for years, counselling agents on how to make themselves accessible to younger buyers. He's not the only one doling out advice. NAR publishes a Field Guide to Millennial Home Buyers on its website, where it compiles articles and research on the mythical beasts. Earlier this month, the industry publication Inman News posted a blog post promising to divulge the secrets of the millennial soul. Most of the advice seems pretty obvious. Agents should answer e-mails quickly and post photos of themselves with young buyers on their websites; also, they should demonstrate that a real, live agent knows things that websites such as Zillow and Trulia can't know.\n\nSteve Goddard, 68, manager of Re/Max Estate Properties in Manhattan Beach, California, says the fear of being replaced by younger models and new technology is constant. \"We think about them all the time.\" To keep up, he answers e-mails around the clock and tries to get buyers invested in a personal relationship. Beyond that, it helps to keep a sunny attitude. \"You're only as young as you think you are.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump over 5% after confirmation of its student and worker accommodation Reit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Judge Laster interrupted to demand a focused response.\n\nWhile stockholders approved the Dole deal by a razor-thin margin, union pension funds filed a class action on behalf of shareholders in 2013, claiming the sale process was unfair.\n\nSeveral hedge funds sought to have their Dole shares appraised, which allows the Delaware court to determine a fair value for the stock. The trial will provide evidence for both lawsuits and Murdock could be on the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars if it is proven he manipulated the sale process to scoop up Dole for a discount.\n\nMurdock dropped out of high school and rode his investing acumen to one of America's biggest fortunes. He has insisted he overpaid for Dole, and that the sale process was fair.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Grant tried to show Murdock had planned the buyout by driving down the stock price while simultaneously raising personal cash for the deal by selling Lanai, a Hawaiian island he owned, for US$300 million.\n\nGrant wanted to know if he forced company director Denny Weinberg to quit because he threatened Murdock's plans. Mr Weinberg retired on his own, Murdock replied, but said Mr Weinberg irked him by suggesting Dole needed a younger chief executive. \"I don't like people talking about my age,\" Murdock said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/623021344def4aa1ef8175c5d8c0c712b6ae527a191f7227d217ecd218772784?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Dole Food Co owner David Murdock began a trial on Monday defending his 2013 buyout of the world's largest fruit and vegetable producer with often unfocused testimony about his unusual memory, passion for nutrition and dislike of people talking about his age."}]}

Annual consumer price inflation eased to just 0.3 per cent in January.\n\n\"The continued recovery, and in particular the impressive growth in employment of the low paid, should this year allow a further increase in the real and relative value of the minimum wage,\" said the commission's chairman, David Norgrove.\n\nAbout 5 per cent of Britain's workforce is paid at or very close to the minimum wage, and almost a third of workplaces use it as a guide for setting wages, especially in the retail and hospitality sectors.\n\nThe 3 per cent rise is almost double the 1.7 per cent annual rise in average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, reported for the fourth quarter of 2014.\n\nBut it is less than the 3.5 per cent growth which the Bank of England has forecast for the fourth quarter of this year, when the annual rise in the minimum wage will take effect.\n\nEmployers at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said companies' productivity remained low, limiting the scope to pay higher wages, and warned against \"any artificial increase due to political expediency\".\n\nThe Trades Union Congress, which like the CBI is represented on the Low Pay Commission, said the increase should have been\"bolder\".\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/6c4e60359cae659282f52ce9d4a19937872746e815c7ecd7f5273c85ef84aea5?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A British government body recommended a 3 per cent rise in the minimum wage on Monday, which would take it to 6.70 pounds (US$10) an hour, the biggest real-terms increase since 2007."}]}

The adoption of new listing standards specific to the Paired Class Shares is necessary before the AccuShares funds can start trading.\n\nAt the heart of Ms Stein's concern is the complexity of the funds, which would require investors to be extra vigilant in monitoring their investments, and the potential harm to investors who may not fully understand how the funds operate.\n\nBut her concerns about the approval of new listing standards, which will enable the funds to trade, extend beyond the AccuShares decision alone and call for a more thorough review process for other similarly risky and complex products.\n\n\"We need a more thoughtful, transparent, and fulsome review process for these types of ETFs, even if it means disapproving proposed rules changes until we get comfortable,\" with such products, Ms Stein wrote in the statement dated Monday.\n\nShe noted that a more rigorous review process is especially necessary because making a rule change clears the path for other\"copycat\" products to enter the market.\n\nMs Stein also called for gathering more public input during the review process to better take into account broader market and systemic impacts of new ETFs. \"The Commission should be taking more affirmative steps to obtain public comment and academic analysis in this space,\" she wrote.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/e75ccb7f2ec5093acb6d03e519e46942724c9319579680b01ad78f01a3a9e61b?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A top member of a US securities regulator on Monday called for a more transparent and rigorous review process before approving rule changes to list riskier exchange-traded funds that she believes could harm retail investors."}]}

The data raised worries that US crude inventories, already at record highs, could swell further.\n\nThe largest US refinery strike in 35 years has also been a negative for crude prices.\n\nHeating oil futures rallied for a second straight day, reaching above US$2.24 a gallon, the highest in nearly three months, as some of the biggest US East Coast refineries struggled to restore operations after severe cold weather triggered outages.\n\nSub-zero temperatures were expected to sweep through the region late on Monday, raising concerns about adequate heating supplies. \"It's a worry of high supplies with crude and tight supplies with heating oil,\" said Gene McGillian, senior analyst at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nBenchmark Brent crude settled down US$1.32 at US$58.82 a barrel.\n\nBrent briefly rose, hitting a session high of US$60.67, after the comments by the Nigerian minister, Alison-Madueke, who is also Opec's president. Analysts said the gambit will likely fail without Saudi Arabia's support.\n\nUS crude futures, also known as West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, settled down US$1.36, or 2.7 per cent, at US$49.81.\n\nWhile high supply was pressuring crude prices, the market also was seeing quick \"buying on dips,\" evidence that bulls were in more control than a few months ago, traders said.

Mr Ito, the motorcycle-racing engineer who's led Honda since 2009, said he handpicked Mr Hachigo for his experiences running Honda's various overseas businesses.\n\nThe CEO is ceding his job after leading the company through a tumultuous era that began with a global recession, followed by natural disasters and unfavorable exchange rates. Mr Ito's successor will face the challenge of navigating Honda past the latest crises, record recalls involving deadly Takata Corp. air bags and flaws with the popular Fit compact car, which have tarnished the company's reputation for quality.\n\n\"Honda just got through its worst-ever period of quality problems,\" said Takeshi Miyao, a Tokyo-based auto analyst at researcher Carnorama. \"They're getting a fresh start.\"\n\nHonda made the announcement at the 3pm close of trading in Tokyo on Monday, after the carmaker's stock fell 0.9 per cent to 3,928.50 yen, paring this year's gain to 11 per cent.\n\nWhile Mr Ito will give up his roles as CEO and president, Honda said he will remain on the company's board and serve as an adviser. Takashi Yamamoto, currently in charge of production, and Yoshiharu Yamamoto, head of Honda R&D, will also step down, according to the company.\n\nMr Ito's departure contrasts with General Motors Co.'s decision to stand by CEO Mary Barra while the Detroit-based automaker navigated through the costly recall of 2.59 million small cars with a defective ignition-switch design blamed for at least 57 deaths.\n\n\"With Barra, the ignition-switch recall situation blew up shortly after she got\" the top job, said Karl Brauer, an analyst with Kelley Blue Book. For Ito, Honda's air-bag problems have been \"a long ongoing issue, and the issues were getting more serious since he's been at the top of the organizational chart,\" Brauer said.\n\nThe management overhaul comes weeks after Honda cut its profit forecasts for the second time in as many quarters because of recalls tied to Takata and new hybrid systems installed in the company's Fit cars and Vezel SUVs. The quality missteps derailed Honda's plans to introduce new models and led the carmaker to project its first profit drop in three years.\n\nMr Ito this month also said the company will scrap its target of selling 6 million vehicles by 2017, which he said will ease a burden on engineers so they can focus on quality.\n\n\"It does a big favour to his successor,\" said Christopher Richter, a Tokyo-based analyst at CLSA Ltd.\n\n\"That was a sales programme that Ito put in place. It's very appropriate that he was the one then to say that we're going to step back from that, rather than to have somebody new come in and then say 'oh, we're not going to do this' and create an image of discord.\"\n\nCHASSIS ROOTS\n\nIn choosing Mr Hachigo, Mr Ito turned to someone with similar roots. Both started their careers at Honda more than three decades ago as engineers designing chassis, the frame underneath that holds the key parts of a car together.\n\nAs an engineer, Mr Hachigo was responsible for high-profile projects such as the US-built Odyssey minivans that were launched in 1999 and the second-generation CR-V SUV that debuted in 2001.\n\nHe then rose through the ranks with executive roles across the US, Europe and China before he was promoted to managing officer last year. Mr Hachigo said he was in China soon after the new year when he learned of his next role. \"I was surprised when I received a call from Ito,\" Mr Hachigo said in Tokyo on Monday. \"I understand this is a major responsibility.\"\n\nMr Hachigo pledged Honda's past efforts will bear fruit in 2015 and said that the company needs to step up development of products and technologies. He also said he plans to build on Honda's six regional operations - an organisational structure his predecessor set up to shift Honda away from a US-centric business mindset.\n\nERA OF DISASTERS\n\nWhile Mr Hachigo will follow the footsteps of a CEO who returned Honda to Formula One in 2015 and brought back the NSX supercar, he'll also seek to avoid his predecessor's misfortunes.\n\nUnder Mr Ito, Honda was roiled by the 2011 tsunami in Japan and mass floods in Thailand the following year. More recently, Mr Ito has been plagued by recalls.\n\nHonda has called back 14 million vehicles worldwide since 2008 to replace air bags made by Takata, in which it has a 1.2 per cent ownership stake. Takata's defective air bags, which can rupture during deployment and propel metal shards at passengers, have been linked to five fatalities in the US and the deaths of a pregnant woman and her unborn child in Malaysia.\n\nWhile at least nine other carmakers have been hit with air- bag-related recalls, Honda is Takata's biggest customer.\n\nScrutiny of how Honda responded to the flaws led to the US government slapping the company with a record US$70 million fine for failing to report more than 1,700 death and injury incidents to regulators over 11 years.\n\nAIR BAGS\n\nHonda's quality problems go beyond air bags. The carmaker has called back the Fit - its top-selling model in Japan - five times since its introduction in late 2013, and recalled its Vezel crossover three times. Those fixes delayed the roll-out of other new vehicles by as long as six months.\n\nAs Honda takes steps to address quality shortfalls, Honda's shares have begun rebounding. This month, the stock has climbed 10 per cent through Monday, double the Nikkei 225 Stock Average's gain.\n\n\"We knew this was coming sometime, although it was probably a little bit sooner than we expected,\" said CLSA's Mr Richter. \"Maybe this is a good time for a fresh face.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/1ac2d7af8070329a81ce7006b509dae0ea12e34f2bea2c8aee572e3bb08315d9?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Honda Motor Co's chief executive officer will step aside later this year as Japan's third-largest carmaker reels from one of the biggest setbacks over quality in its history."}]}

Greece has said it was working closely with its euro zone partners in drawing up the list.\n\nGermany, the biggest contributor to Greece's two bailouts totalling 240 billion euros, insisted earlier that any extra spending on Athens's list of reforms had to be offset by savings or higher taxes.\n\nThe government of radical leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras staged a climbdown on Friday to win the four-month extension of Greece's bailout, which had been due to expire on Feb 28. Mr Tsipras had promised to scrap the programme when he won election last month.\n\nEarlier in the day, government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis had said the list of reforms would go to the Eurogroup by the end of Monday, meeting the deadline set under Friday's deal in Brussels.\n\nAthens has stressed the reforms would at least be decided by Greeks, in contrast to the austerity policies dictated by foreign creditors since they bailed out the country in 2010.\n\nThe official later said: \"The list of reforms will be sent to the finance ministers of the Eurogroup on Tuesday morning, while a teleconference will take place in the afternoon.\"\n\nHUMANITARIAN CRISIS\n\nThe measures will include tackling what Mr Tsipras calls Greece's \"humanitarian crisis\" - hardship created during years of economic depression - while dealing with tax arrears and bad loans, and ending the foreclosure of primary homes, the official said. They will also crack down on tax evasion, smuggling and corruption, restructure the public sector and cut red tape.\n\nThe list will also include parts of the government's\"Thessaloniki programme\" which in total envisages spending of 1.8 billion euros over a full year on relief measures such as free electricity and meals for the poor, while raising 3 billion from steps such as collecting tax arrears.\n\nMr Tsipras has declared victory in Friday's deal. But veteran leftist Manolis Glezos, a Syriza member of the European Parliament, accused him of failing to fulfil Syriza's campaign promises and said simply avoiding inflammatory wording would not soothe the public.\n\nThe deal renamed the \"troika\" - despised inspectors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund who monitored Greek compliance with bailout commitments - as \"the three institutions\".\n\n\"Renaming the troika as 'institutions', the bailout as an 'agreement' and creditors as 'partners' ... does not change the previous situation,\" Mr Glezos wrote in a weekend blog. \"I apologise to the Greek people because I took part in this illusion,\" he said. \"Let's react before it is too late.\"\n\nA PAUSE FOR BREATH\n\nAthens negotiated in Brussels under intense pressure. A senior banker told Reuters that one billion euros flooded out of Greek bank accounts last Friday alone. JP Morgan estimated last week's outflow at 3 billion, taking the total so far this year to 25 billion, and meaning the banks were on track to run out of collateral for new ECB loans in eight weeks.\n\nFollowing a series of testy Eurogroup meetings, the international creditors will scrutinise the reforms to ensure they comply with another of Greece's concessions - that nothing it does during the four months will burden the state budget.\n\n\"The ball is in the Greek government's court,\" said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. \"If Athens wants to see changes in individual points, then that is okay. But if these changes lead to further spending, then they need to save elsewhere or look to gather more revenue.\" Steinmeier noted the Eurogroup deal extended the bailout programme only until the early summer. \"Europe has a chance to pause for breath - that's all - this is not a solution,\" he told Bild newspaper.\n\nLITTLE GAINED\n\nWith Greece unable to fund itself commercially, the opposition, and fellow euro zone member Ireland, say Tsipras will have to negotiate a third bailout when the extension expires.\n\nThe Brussels deal opens the possibility of lowering a target for the Greek primary budget surplus, which excludes debt repayments, freeing up some funds to help ease the effects of unemployment at 25 per cent.\n\nBut otherwise, Athens gained little.\n\nMr Tsipras now has to sell the Brussels deal and an eventual long-term agreement with the euro zone not only to voters but to Syriza's left wing and his junior coalition partner, the right-wing Independent Greeks There have been no signs of open dissent within Mr Tsipras's party apart from the criticism from Glezos, who is not a party heavyweight but does command moral authority. As a young man under the World War Two occupation, he scaled the Acropolis under the noses of German guards to rip down a Nazi flag and hoist the Greek flag, making him a national hero.\n\nHis decision to break ranks drew an abrupt response from the government. \"Manolis Glezos is someone whom we will never cease to honour,\" said Mr Sakellaridis. \"But ... I believe that yesterday's statement in particular was misguided and wrong.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/eb8a8d9eadc4d76a2940239421b642246cfbd4124d99b48e582290923e63153d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Greece will present its economic reform plans to the euro zone on Tuesday, a government official said, missing a Monday deadline for the list which is a condition for extending the country's financial lifeline."}]}

These changes will apply starting with income earned in 2016 and on taxes to be paid in 2017. The move is expected to raise additional revenue of S$400 million a year when it comes into effect.\n\n\"This tax increase for high-income earners will enhance progressivity and strengthen future revenues. This is a calibrated move. We have assessed that it should not significantly dent Singapore's competitiveness,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nTax rates are not the only way Singapore stays competitive, he said, noting that the country's other key strengths include a culturally diverse and cohesive society, a family friendly environment, clean air especially compared to other Asian cities, and a world-class healthcare system.\n\nSingapore's tax philosophy is to keep the tax burden on the middle-income low, so that they get to keep what they earn, as much as possible.\n\n\"In several advanced countries, taxes on the middle-income are much higher than in Singapore, in order to fund higher social benefits: not just for the lower-income but often for everyone else including the upper-middle income and the rich.\n\n\"Our philosophy is to keep the burden on the middle-income low, and target benefits at the most important needs of the poor and middle-income groups. Taken overall, this is a better deal for middle-income households,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\n\"We have designed our system such that we have lower overall taxes than most countries, but nevertheless maintain a highly progressive regime,\" he said.\n\n\"The higher-income group makes a significant net contribution into the system, which enables the lower-income group in turn to get significantly more benefits than the taxes they pay.\"\n\nIn other words, when all the taxes - GST, income, property and other taxes - are added up and compared to benefits received, the low income group gets more benefits than the taxes they pay, while the high income tax pays more taxes than benefits received, he said.\n\nStill, the higher income tax rate is far from punitive. And when the increase in CPF salary ceiling from the S$5,000 to S$6,000 is factored in, the net effect is an increase in total income for someone earning S$250,000.\n\nAccording to Wu Soo Mee, EY tax partner, human capital, advisory services, for someone earning S$250,000 there is an increase of tax of S$145 under the new tax rate table, after reliefs. \"The increase in tax would have been higher had it not been for the higher CPF relief due to the increase in CPF contributions (arising from the increase in CPF salary ceiling),\" said Ms Wu.\n\nAs the annual employer's CPF contribution is S$2,040 higher, overall the employee has an increase of total income (net of tax salary plus employer's CPF) of S$1,895, she said.\n\nMs Wu calculated that the increase in CPF contributions is neutralised when income rises to S$400,000.\n\n\"The level of income at which the increase in employer's contributions will be wiped out by the increase in tax liability is S$403,136,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Two years ago, her son Will, an army employee who studied cybersecurity in college, told her about ActivTrak, a new software that would allow her to monitor her employees' desktops, and she thought it would be a nice way to manage the office when she was away.\n\nMs Currer has told her four full-time employees that she monitors their computers, and they don't seem to mind - she says she has not received pushback and mainly considers her use of the software a precaution to ensure that her workers, many of whom interact with children in their daily routines, stay off inappropriate websites. \"We're a family-oriented business, so we want to make sure our employees are on family-oriented websites,\" she said.\n\nCheap monitoring tools such as ActivTrak, Spector 360 and\n\nWorkexaminer.com\n\nhave made snooping possible for even the tiniest enterprises, allowing managers to track employees' desktop activity - covertly, if they choose.\n\nThe danger is that managers might rely too heavily on the technology, jump to conclusions and use it to avoid more meaningful conversations with their staff. \"With any kind of performance management technology, in the absence of good managerial skill it can be really dangerous,\" said Ken Oehler, global engagement practice leader at Aon Hewitt, a human capital consulting firm.\n\nDeveloped by Dallas-based Birch Grove Software, ActivTrak gives managers up-to-the-minute screen shots of what employees are doing on their computers, displaying the images on a dashboard resembling a security guard's camera display. Managers can send pop-up boxes that appear in the corner of an unwitting slacker's screen, admonishing him or her to get back to work.\n\nSpector 360, a monitoring service offered by Florida-based Spectorsoft, allows employers to detect specific keystrokes, alerting an IT manager and capturing rapid-fire screen shots as \"evidence\" when an offending keyword is added to a text document or an e-mail.\n\nEmployers can get regular productivity reports showing what employees are doing with their time: breakdowns of which websites they spend the most time on and whether their browsers are open. And monitoring doesn't have to stop when an employee leaves the office. Employers who want to track those working remotely can use ActivTrak's \"invisible remote installer\" to install the service on any computer on the company network. As long as managers have a network connection and administrator rights to a given computer, they can access the machine without an employee's knowledge.\n\nThis sort of employee monitoring is nothing new in the Internet age. A 2007 survey of 304 small and large businesses by the American Management Association and the ePolicy Institute found 45 per cent of employers tracking content, keystrokes and time spent at the keyboard.\n\n\"Even if your boss says you're not being monitored, everybody should just assume you're being monitored,\" said Nancy Flynn, founder and executive director of the ePolicy Institute, a consulting firm that trains businesses on electronic compliance issues.\n\nThe emergence of new technology means that employee monitoring is not just the purview of government agencies and large corporations - small businesses can monitor their employees at little or no cost. ActivTrak comes free for those who need only three \"agents\", the company's lingo for a monitor placed on a single desktop. It costs US$34 a month to monitor five employees, and larger companies can pay US$199 a month to monitor 50 workers. Most of the employers that use the service don't pay for it: Of 31,203 companies around the world that use Activtrak, only 7 per cent use one of the paid models.\n\nBut the way the software is used - whether to tell employees that they're being watched and what to do with the data that ActivTrak generates - is up to the manager. ActivTrak encourages its users to tell their employees that they are being monitored, but the company says it is aware of clients who do not do so. For others, just the spectre of being watched is enough to scare their employees off Facebook. WP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The vote was 47-46 with 60 required.\n\nDemocrats blocked the measure because Republicans insist on using it to reverse President Barack Obama's decision to ease deportation for about 5 million undocumented immigrants in the US.\n\nMr Obama told the nation's governors Monday that a shutdown of the agency will affect the economy and the nation's security.\n\n\"These are folks who, if they don't have a paycheck, are not going to be able to spend that money in your states,\" Mr Obama told members of the National Governors Association at the White House. \"It will have a direct impact on your economy, and it will have a direct impact on America's national security, because their hard work helps to keep us safe.\"\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said a shutdown would require 75 per cent to 80 per cent of his employees, including border patrol agents and members of the Coast Guard, to work without pay.\n\nThe department would have to furlough 30,000 employees, including much of the headquarters staff.\n\nONE STEP\n\n\"Every day I press the staff at my headquarters to stay one step ahead of groups like ISIL and threats to our aviation security,\" Mr Johnson said in a news conference Monday, referring to the terror group Islamic State. \"If we shut down, that staff is cut back to a skeleton.\"\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner, asked in a Fox News Sunday interview aired Feb. 15 whether he was prepared to let the department's funding lapse, said, \"Certainly. The House has acted. We've done our job.\"\n\nWhile Republican leaders are trying to pin the blame on Democrats, some Republicans warn that their party will shoulder the responsibility for any disruptions.\n\n\"For God's sakes, don't shut down the premier homeland security defence line called the Department of Homeland Security,\" Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Monday on the Fox & Friends programme. \"If we do, as Republicans, we'll get blamed.\"\n\nBLAMING REPUBLICANS\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll showed that 53 per cent of Americans would blame Republicans in Congress for a shutdown, while 30 per cent would blame Obama. A majority said a shutdown, even for only a few days, would be a crisis or a major problem.\n\nThe Obama administration Monday asked a Texas judge to suspend an order that forced the White House to delay carrying out its immigration plans during a court challenge by Texas and 25 other states.\n\nThe administration gave US District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas, until the close of business Wednesday to act on his own before it goes directly to an appeals court in a bid to temporarily set aside his order.\n\nThe first part of Obama's action, an expansion of the 2012 programme protecting children from deportation, had been set to go into effect on Feb 18.\n\nThe stalemate in Congress comes amid heightened terrorism worries in the US On CNN's State Of The Union programme on Sunday, Johnson warned visitors to the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, to be \"particularly careful.\" Terrorist Group A day earlier, a terrorist group in Somalia released a video calling for attacks in Canada, the US and the UK, according to the news network.\n\nMr McConnell would need support from at least six Democrats to get the 60 votes to advance the US$39.7 billion Homeland Security funding bill, H.R. 240. It was previously passed by the House.\n\nIf the bill doesn't move forward, Republican leaders must decide whether to give up the fight, something that would spark intense criticism from conservative lawmakers in Congress and from those attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington on Feb 25-28.\n\nMuch of the pressure is on McConnell after Boehner made clear that the House won't take up another bill. After Republicans won control of the Senate in November's election, Mr McConnell told reporters, \"Let me make it clear, there will be no government shutdowns.\"\n\nMembers' Critics\n\nIf Mr Boehner agreed to pass a bill without the immigration language, he would face criticism from party members after repeatedly saying he would use the funding bill to confront Obama's orders.\n\nAnother option could temporarily take pressure off Mr McConnell of Kentucky and Mr Boehner of Ohio. Lawmakers may vote on 30-day funding for the agency, said a congressional aide who didn't want to be identified because talks were continuing.\n\nMr Johnson told reporters that such stopgap funding would make it impossible to pay for improvements to border security or issue grants to state or local governments.\n\n\"We are restricted to last year's funding levels and operate in a state of uncertainty as to when the next infusion of funds will be,\" he said.\n\nR. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, said a shutdown would cut pay for 60,000 employees and disrupt training for new border patrol officers.\n\nCraig Fugate, director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said a continuing resolution or a shutdown would halt grant programs and hamper the way the agency responds to crises. FEMA would have to cancel training for first-responders, he said.\n\nESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES\n\nDuring a 16-day partial government shutdown in October 2013, many Homeland Security employees remained on the job because they are considered essential. That includes active Coast Guard members, customs officers, immigration law enforcement officers and airport-screening officials.\n\nThe department estimates that at the Transportation Security Administration, furloughs would affect about 5,500, or 10 per cent, of workers, mainly in management and administrative jobs. Law-enforcement officers in the Federal Air Marshal Service would be exempt.\n\nDuring the October 2013 shutdown, 86 per cent of FEMA's permanent workforce - about 4,000 employees - were furloughed.\n\nOther Homeland Security programs are funded by fees instead of congressional appropriations and wouldn't be affected by a shutdown.\n\nThe federal government is required to pay anyone who works. During the last shutdown, about one-third of the government's 3 million workers who reported for duty weren't paid until after the shutdown ended.\n\nBACK PAY\n\nEven those placed on furlough are often paid. Congress voted to retroactively provide back pay to workers furloughed during the 2013 shutdown.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that airport screening agents wouldn't be paid on time during a partial shutdown.\n\nMarsha Catron, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said in an e-mailed statement that withholding paychecks would \"erode employee morale and cause unnecessary anxiety for front-line personnel and their families.\" -With assistance from Toluse Olorunnipa in Washington.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/feaf1ef91b8539de59f8439bb04241cd89825828deda5b4712872cdd29fd78d0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson speaks as employees of the Homeland Security Department look on during a news conference on Feb 23, 2015"}]}

In just the past year, comedian Chris Tucker, supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, the lead singer of Creed, and at least one of the Real Housewives have had reported run-ins with the IRS. What's going on?\n\nSingers, actors, and professional athletes get ensnared in complicated money situations that confuse even advisers with CPAs and law degrees. Here's why: Just as Uber drivers can deduct the cost of gas from their taxes, celebrities can deduct their necessary expenses.\n\nBut there's a fine line between show-business expenses and the perks of a celebrity lifestyle. Hiring a stylist or personal assistant might be deductible-as long as her pay is well-documented-but an expensive car or a poolside massage probably isn't.\n\nDave Lopez, a Philadelphia-based CPA financial planner, works with hip-hop artists for whom it's crucial to network with other producers and musicians around the country.\n\nThat can mean a hotel or airfare is deductible, but not drinking in the back of the city's priciest club.\n\nAnyway, it can be impossible to get entertainers to keep track of their expenses. \"Everybody's doing everything in cash,\" Mr Lopez says. \"The record-keeping is not that great.\"\n\nSTARS' INCOME CAN BE AS FICKLE AS THEIR FANS\n\nThe IRS charges a penalty if taxpayers don't pay enough in estimated taxes throughout the year. But many entertainers have no way to estimate how much they'll make by Dec 31. In the film business, \"you can have one job a year. You can have four jobs a year. You can have three years without a job,\" says CPA financial planner Mitchell Freedman.\n\nAnd a lot of their income arrives in strange ways, which makes it tempting to cheat the IRS.\n\nProfessional athletes get paid for autograph signings, reality TV stars for appearing at clubs. Those checks can't just be cashed; they must be reported on tax returns.\n\nTHEY'RE BIG IN JAPAN, MILWAUKEE, AND EVERYWHERE ELSE\n\nWhen you're an actor shooting on location or a tennis player going from tournament to tournament, you can end up owing taxes to dozens of jurisdictions. States, the IRS, and foreign countries all want a piece of you.\n\nThe complications multiply on concert tours, says Victor Wlodinguer of Citrin Cooperman. Backup musicians and roadies need the right W-2s and worker's compensation insurance for each jurisdiction.\n\nManagers must keep track of not just expenses and income but where they occur. States such as California and Massachusetts will otherwise demand concert promoters withhold a big chunk of revenue for taxes, Mr Wlodinguer says.\n\nForeign artists visiting the US get the same treatment from the IRS.\n\nSUDDEN WEALTH SYNDROME\n\nSome stars are good with money.\n\nBut it's hard to expect financial savvy from people known primarily for their jokes, their three-pointers, or their ability to cry on cue.\n\n\"They're on set for 12 to 14 hours a day,\" Jeff Fishman of Los Angeles- based JSF Financial says of his clients. \"They don't have time to focus on the financial world.\"\n\nWhen they hit it big, many don't know what to do with all the money.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has become the main spender on getting their name on football shirts.\n\nThe Repucom sports data firm said income from jersey sponsorship rose more than 20 per cent last year to 687 million euros (S$1.05 billion) for the leagues in England, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands.\n\n\"With investment in 2014/15 growing 20 per cent over last season, the investment in shirt sponsorship has increased faster than at any time in the last 15 years,\" said Glenn Lovett, Repucom's head of global strategy.\n\nThe 20 Premier League clubs saw shirt revenue increase 36 per cent to 213 million euros. Manchester United last year made a shirt deal with US carmaker Chevrolet worth \u00a347 million (S$98.7 million) a year, up \u00a320 million on their previous deal.\n\nLa Liga's income rose 30 per cent to 113 million euros, Barcelona's deal with Qatar Airways, reportedly worth about 40 million euros, being the most expensive.\n\nThe Bundesliga earned 139 million euros, up nine per cent, while France's Ligue 1 got 13 per cent more, with 96 million euros and Italy's Serie A got 21 per cent more with 84 million euros.\n\nHowever, the Dutch first division saw its jersey sponsorship income fall by five per cent to 42 million euros, according to Repucom.\n\nThe Netherlands has now been overtaken by Major League Soccer in the United States, which reaped approximately 45 million euros.\n\nWith the Middle East now the main source of the new sponsorship revenue, about 120 million euros came from the UAE alone.\n\nEmirates airline pays to put its name on the shirts of Real Madrid, Arsenal, AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain, accounting for much of that sum.\n\nBehind the UAE, German firms are the next biggest sponsors on 112 million euros and, increasingly, US companies on 82 million euros.\n\nClubs are increasingly looking to spread advertising across outfits, though the Premier League and Bundesliga limit advertising space.\n\nIn Europe's other top football leagues, however, there has been a significant increase in deals which include branding on socks, shorts and the back of shirts.\n\nA Repucom spokesman said the number of deals involving socks and other new areas had doubled over the past decade.\n\nSpanish champions Atletico Madrid last year became the first of 14 La Liga clubs to wear advertising on ties around their socks.\n\nManchester United last year reportedly pressed for sponsor names on the back of shirts, but other Premier League clubs refused.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/37d85a882f2c954990cf581cafbcb558dc86dc76998cab0417a4bbe81fec31b6?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The English Premier League and Spain's La Liga led a US$130 million rise in shirt sponsorship deals for Europe's top championships last year, according to a report released Tuesday."}]}

This will take effect from Jan 1, 2016, and builds on top of the existing one point Extra Interest for the first S$60,000 of balances.\n\nIn addition, with the permanent Silver Support Scheme, more targeted help will be given to seniors in need, who have insufficient savings for retirement. Quarterly cash payouts of between S$300 and S$750 will be given to the elderly poor, depending on the senior's lifetime wages, household support, and housing type. About 150,000 of today's elderly are expected to benefit.\n\nAnother major thrust of Budget 2015 had to do with the SkillsFuture push, which sees a major new phase of investment in Singaporeans - beginning in the schooling years, and progressing throughout one's career.\n\nFor one, a SkillsFuture Credit will be created for all Singaporeans, which can be used for a broad range of courses supported by government agencies. Every citizen 25 years old and up will receive an initial credit of S$500 in 2016, with further top-ups made at regular intervals in the future.\n\nOn a broader level, the government will also be working with employers to chart future skills needed in each industry. Mr Tharman said that the government would collaborate with stakeholders to develop and implement these comprehensive sectoral manpower plans in all key sectors by 2020.\n\nEven though expectations ran high for hefty SG50 or pre-election goodies - similar to Budget 2011's S$3.2 billion Grow and Share package and Budget 2006's S$2.6 billion Progress Package - Budget 2015 did not follow the script.\n\nSeveral observers noted the greater weight placed on longer-term, more fundamental changes to Singapore's economic and social culture, than on shorter-term goodies.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse economist Michael Wan: \"It seems to us that Budget 2015 focuses much more on long-term measures to boost the supply-side capacity of the economy, but is lacking in some of the short-term 'consumption' boosting measures that we, together with other analysts, have been expecting . . . There were no significant cash handouts given out in this budget.\"\n\nStill, in addition to Service & Conservancy Charges rebates and a personal income tax rebate of 50 per cent capped at S$1,000, Goods and Services Tax Voucher (GSTV) cash will also be given to all Singaporeans, with an additional GSTV for seniors.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Below are some of the key measures that were introduced to achieve the objectives.\n\nIncreasing CPF retirement savings\n\nMuch debate has centred on whether our Central Provident Fund (CPF) is sufficient to ensure retirement adequacy, especially as many Singaporeans are asset-rich by the homes that they own (largely funded by their CPF monies), but may not have enough cash on hand to see through their retirement.\n\nIn a bid to strengthen Singapore's social security system and also to help Singaporeans save more for their retirement, the 2015 Budget announced that the monthly CPF salary ceiling will be raised from S$5,000 to S$6,000 with effect from Jan 1, 2016. This will help those whose monthly salaries are already above the monthly CPF salary ceiling of S$5,000 to further build up their CPF nest.\n\nSeparately, the restoration of CPF contribution rates for workers who are 50 to 55 years old to the same level as those for younger workers meets a two-pronged objective. Firstly, it addresses the issue of retirement fund adequacy for older workers who are already nearing retirement age and who may not have enough working years left to benefit from the proposed CPF salary ceiling increase. Secondly, it recognises that older workers can still contribute as much to the workforce as younger workers and encourages them to seek employment beyond 50 years old.\n\nIn addition, to make the CPF system more progressive, it was announced that an additional one per cent of extra interest would be payable on the first S$30,000 of the CPF balances, on top of the current interest rate of 5 per cent for CPF members aged 55 and above. This also facilitates the build-up of the CPF nest for older Singaporeans with smaller CPF balances, so that they can have more funds for retirement. However, employers appear to have suffered another blow in trying to cope with rising business costs, with the proposed increase in CPF rates for older workers and also the proposed increase in the CPF salary ceiling. However, the proposed extension of the Temporary Employment Credit (TEC) should provide some relief to employers - at least for the coming three years.\n\nTax rebate\n\nTo help middle-income taxpayers, a one-off tax rebate of 50 per cent (capped at S$1,000) for the Year of Assessment (YA) 2015 (income year 2014) will be given.\n\nWhile the government has announced tax rebates previously to share the country's good growth in prior years, it is interesting to note that the S$1,000 cap on the tax rebate is the lowest ever that has been announced. This appears to be in line with the government's aim to help the middle to upper middle-income groups with the rising cost of living in Singapore, and they will be the biggest beneficiaries of the proposed tax rebate.\n\nIncrease in top marginal tax rate\n\nTo address the growing income inequality between the low and high-income earners, one of the approaches that was previously adopted was to make our individual income tax regime more progressive. This was seen in the 2011 Budget with the changes in our individual tax rates and the introduction of more income tax bands to reduce the taxes paid by middle-income earners.\n\nIn a surprising move by the government, it was proposed that there will be an increase in the income tax rates for high-income earners with effect from YA 2017 (income year 2016). While mindful of the need to keep our tax rates competitive, the government has also recognised the need to keep our individual tax regime more progressive to reduce the widening gap in income inequality.\n\nIn addition, with the introduction of a number of upcoming programmes such as the Silver Support Scheme to enhance our social safety net, funding will be required to ensure their sustainability. It therefore appears that one of the ways the government hopes to achieve this is to have the high-income group assist those who may not be as well-off as them.\n\nGoing by the government's commentsin the build-up to the announcement, the 2015 Budget was, in many ways, in line with what was expected. With a focus on providing support to the middle-income class and also addressing issues of retirement fund adequacy, the Budget met many anticipated needs, but it still managed to have its fair share of surprises.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The unexpected move exposed the SNB to considerable criticism, partly on the decidedly risible grounds that the central bank had given the markets no warning of the impending change.\n\nIn fact, the bank's decision was correct, if not overdue. Thomas Jordan, the SNB president, deserves plaudits, not brickbats, for bringing to an end an exchange rate distortion that was exacerbating further large-scale economic imbalances in Europe.\n\nDefending the peg, forcing the SNB to take in massive quantities of the European single currency, was a fight the SNB could not win. A balance sheet burdened by too many depreciating euros, at a time of general European uncertainty and impending quantitative easing by the European Central Bank, would have stretched the SNB too far.\n\nThe unpegging sparked a 20 per cent one-day Swiss franc rise against the euro - an indication of what would happen if the German currency ever suffered its own demerger from the euro. Once again, repeating the circumstances which led to the peg, Switzerland is seen as a safe haven.\n\nIn the 2011 bid to protect Swiss exporters, the SNB bought swathes of euros with newly created francs. Its total assets swelled from 40 per cent of GDP in 2011 to 85 per cent of GDP in 2012, a level at which it has remained. Total assets were just 20 per cent of GDP in 2008. By comparison, the Federal Reserve, Bank of England and ECB have balance sheets of around 25 per cent of GDP. During the last few years of balance sheet expansion, none of their ratios exceeded 30 per cent of GDP. The Bank of Japan's balance sheet, following prolonged QE, stands at just over 50 per cent of GDP.\n\nIn OMFIF's 2014 ranking of Global Public Investors, the SNB ranks No 10 in the world - an astonishing position for an institution widely regarded as one of the most conservative central banks.\n\nA 30 per cent drop in the gold price impaired the value of the SNB's reserves in 2013, causing the SNB to cancel its dividend for the year. For 2014, with the franc falling against the dollar and stable against the euro, the SNB expects to record a profit of 38 billion francs (S$54.45 billion), of which 34 billion francs is due to foreign currency positions. SNB's gold holdings recorded a gain of 4 billion francs, resulting from gold rising 10 per cent in Swiss franc terms.\n\nBy mid-January, the SNB had renewed cause for concern, leading to the currency decision on Jan 15. The subsequent fall of the euro has hurt the SNB's balance sheet. With substantial holdings of euros (46 per cent of foreign currency investments) and dollars (29 per cent), as well as yen (8 per cent), pounds (7 per cent) and Canadian dollars (4 per cent), the sudden appreciation left the SNB with the need for substantial valuation write-downs.\n\nIf the peg had continued, the SNB would have maintained its buying spree. In the fourth quarter of 2014 it purchased over 20 billion euros (S$30.8 billion) in euro-denominated assets, bringing the total to 197 billion euros at year-end. Further buying would probably have brought the bank's assets to more than 100 per cent of GDP, clearly detrimental to financial stability.\n\nNow, the SNB faces fresh problems. The franc's appreciation coupled with low oil prices is intensifying deflationary pressures. Expectations of inflation were already zero before the peg abandonment. Economic growth will fall, with exporters harmed (around half of their exports go to the euro area) and business confidence hit. The stock market has dived and not recovered.\n\nWith a current account surplus of 13 per cent of GDP and specialisation in high value-added manufacturing exports with moderate price sensitivity, Switzerland is in a good position to weather the shocks. Separation from the euro bloc was the best way of riding out the storm.

Boldness is needed to achieve sustained innovation and productivity improvement and this is a bold step. It encourages and incentivises a mindset change among employers and employees alike. SkillsFuture recognises that a continuing process of acquiring and polishing skills is the only way to achieve mastery in any field. The chamber's European MNC members have much experience with this model. They and other members are ready to support the Pact (Partnerships for Capability Transformation) initiative to help SMEs in their supply chain.

For businesses, SCCCI is heartened that the government has introduced measures to promote skills-based, life-long learning for our people relevant for businesses. The government is also promoting industry collaboration, sector-level productivity and developing sectoral manpower plans - areas where SCCCI and its trade association members can play an active role and contribute.

We're not cutting levy although we're deferring it, and we're increasing Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions. There is also an emphasis that our labour policy will continue to be tight. So I think, in the larger scheme of things, we're not looking at business costs coming down.\"\n\n- Kurt Wee, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises\n\n\"THE announcement of deferment of the foreign worker levies has charted new ground in that the government assesses the current business landscape and defers a scheduled policy, rather than sticks to it rigidly.\"\n\n- Victor Tay, chief operating officer of the Singapore Business Federation\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/changing-manufacturing-game", "site_title": "Changing the manufacturing game", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nChanging the manufacturing game\n\nManufacturers are urged to adopt \"Informed Manufacturing\" - that is, use social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies to respond to global market pressures.\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Feb 23, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nManufacturing\n\nFollow\n\nALTHOUGH still in its infancy, the explosion of social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC) technologies is making an impact in the manufacturing industry. For instance, analytics can be leveraged to simulate and model different manufacturing processes to create more adaptable and flexible production lines. Social platforms on cloud have enabled stakeholders across the manufacturing organisation - from plant managers to senior leaders - to share information and access analytics to improve operational efficiencies.\n\n\"Informed Manufacturing\" is an envisioned state of operations in which all relevant and synthesised information is made available when, where and in the form in which it is needed across the manufacturing supply chain, to all stakeholders including people, process, products and infrastructure. This state is characterised by the interconnection of highly intelligent cyber-physical systems to create what is known as the Internet of Things.\n\nThe four essential elements of manufacturing are converging like never before, creating a gateway to the world of Informed Manufacturing. They comprise :\n\nProducts:\n\nAdvanced sensors, controls and software applications work together to obtain and share real-time information as finished goods make their way down the production line. \"Informed Products\" will ultimately enable machines to take autonomous actions.\n\nPeople:\n\nBy connecting people across all business functions and geographies, and providing them with relevant information real-time, \"Informed People\" will provide intelligent design, operations and maintenance, as well as higher quality service and safety.\n\nFor instance, Avery Dennison, a manufacturer of labels and office supplies, launched \"ELS Nation\", a community for employees to post topics or questions, find answers and share files. The community grew to more than 1,000 members in a year from early 2010 and has become the company's leading example of peer-to-peer, cross-boundary collaboration.\n\nProcesses:\n\nEmphasising bi-directional information-sharing across the global manufacturing value chain from supplier to customer, \"Informed Processes\" lead to a flexible and adaptable supply chain.\n\nFor example, General Motors, an automotive company, uses information from climate sensors to indicate whether it is too humid for painting a car. When necessary, cars are automatically sent to another area of the manufacturing process, for instance wheel-fitting, before being redirected back to the painting process when conditions become favourable. This enables the car manufacturer to reduce repainting procedures and maximise plant uptime while increasing cost-savings.\n\nInfrastructure:\n\nUsing smart infrastructure components that interface with mobile devices, products and people, \"Informed Infrastructure\" will better manage complexities and enable more efficient manufacturing of goods.\n\nBARRIERS TO ENTRY\n\nWhile most companies acknowledge that \"Informed Manufacturing\" will be vital and strategic to their success, they are proceeding cautiously. Supporting this prudent approach is the fact that investment decisions are largely driven by ROI considerations; it is typically difficult to find a quantified business case for fundamentally new concepts such as \"Informed Manufacturing\". Other priorities that are likely to yield immediate benefits also compete for investment.\n\nAnother challenge is the significant publicity and media noise surrounding new technologies, which makes it difficult for senior management to make informed choices on investment directions and decisions. Data security concerns and lack of comprehensive regulations in areas such as data transparency also dampen the motivation to invest in these technologies.\n\nClearly, managing conflicting priorities is an imperative. Yet, it also presents a dilemma. To deal with this, manufacturers should develop a distinct information-management strategy and business plan for long-term capability-building, backed by a separate budget and performance measures. This will help ensure that short-term goals do not override areas that are critical to survival and growth.\n\nDepending on their priority and focus, companies can choose to embark on the \"Informed Manufacturing\" journey from any of the four pillars, and expand to other areas when the required capabilities are built. For businesses wishing to progress with \"Informed Manufacturing\", there are a few key considerations:\n\n\"Informed Manufacturing\" is a critical weapon in responding to global market pressures with agility and effectiveness, and remaining ahead of competition. Manufacturers are encouraged to consider it to obtain superior value through a data-driven business model. All in all, companies need to consider building new competencies from understanding and applying informed products, people, processes and infrastructure.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it also costs a bundle.\n\nFrom Time Warner and its HBO unit to streaming video group Netflix and online giant Amazon, money is pouring in to produce new shows like \"Game of Thrones\", \"Transparent\" and \"Marco Polo\". With TV viewing habits becoming fragmented as more people go online for new outlets, the pressure is on to attract audiences with fresh, original programmes.\n\nNetflix is planning to spend US$3 billion on content this year as it pushes to grow globally, expanding its offerings after successes with the political drama \"House of Cards\" and comedy-drama \"Orange is The New Black\".\n\nNot to be outdone, Amazon has stepped up its original production efforts with the transgender series \"Transparent\", winner of a Golden Globe, and others, with famed director Woody Allen hired by the online giant.\n\nAmazon invested some US$1.3 billion in television programming last year, according to founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n\"Working with Woody Allen is not cheap,\" said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research who follows disruptive technologies.\n\nMr McQuivey said more studios and outlets are bidding for these programmes, pushing up costs. \"Suddenly, instead of only having four or five studios to sell your TV shows to, you now have 12 or 16, and some of them are very motivated because they're looking for the next big hit,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Nielsen data compiled by the FX cable channel, there are 352 original scripted dramas and comedies produced for US cable, broadcast and online television this year.\n\nThe number of original cable programmes has doubled in the past five years. For online, the sector has grown from non-existent to 24 original programmes, the research showed. That includes new efforts from Internet players such as Yahoo, AOL and Hulu.\n\nTraditional cable and broadcast operators are not sitting still. Time Warner spent US$14.5 billion on HBO programming, production and marketing in 2014, and chief executive Jeff Bewkes sees that figure growing to US$19 billion in the next few years.\n\nViacom - which owns Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central - said programming costs were up 15 per cent in the past quarter.\n\nAt 21st Century Fox, controlled by mogul Rupert Murdoch, investment is a priority as well, with the broadcast Fox network having rolled out new blockbusters like \"Gotham\" and \"Empire\".\n\n\"The next year will be a period of investments with priority focused on building hit shows, not maximising profits. The profits will follow,\" said president and chief operating officer Chase Carey. \"Our competitors have already shown what difference a couple of hits can make.\"\n\nThese TV operators are looking for the next hit in the manner of HBO's \"Sopranos\", or the AMC programmes \"Mad Men\" and \"Breaking Bad\".\n\nJames Murdoch, the co-chief operating officer at 21st Century Fox, said finding the next big success is not easy. \"There's just an absolutely enormous amount of original production going on right now,\" he said. \"The total volume isn't really the question. The right question is what are you making? How do you make it great? How do you stand out? And can you be a place that can attract the great show runners, the great writers, the great talent to come and do incredible work?\"\n\nIt's not clear if the television companies can maintain the pace of investment, or whether consumers will turn away when faced with higher subscription costs.\n\nMr McQuivey said there is now \"an oversupply of funding\" because the old model companies are still flush with cash from their more profitable years. \"That's a very temporary phase,\" he said, noting that companies will have to tighten up as profits are squeezed.\n\n\"For now, people are making their last bets because they know the time is coming when some of them are going to be gone. They don't want to be the ones that don't make it across that transition,\" he added.

The consensus estimate of economists polled by Bloomberg was a 0.3 per cent year-on-year fall in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\nPrivate road transport costs fell by 5 per cent in January compared with 5.3 per cent the previous month, owing to a smaller correction in car prices. Accommodation costs fell by 1.9 per cent due to a soft housing rental market, extending the 1.7 per cent decline in the previous month.\n\nEconomists cited lower oil prices, a cooling property market and medical subsidies due to the Pioneer Generation Package as key agents holding down inflation figures.\n\n\"The passthrough from labour costs has also been more benign than expected, and COE prices have fallen,\" said DBS economist Irvin Seah.\n\nFood inflation moderated to 2.2 per cent from 2.7 per cent in December 2014, as a result of the high base in January 2014 when food prices rose significantly during the Chinese New Year festive period.\n\nGiven cuts in petrol pump prices and electricity tariffs following the correction in global oil prices, prices of direct oil-related items were down 13.6 per cent in January 2015 following a 7.4 per cent fall in December.\n\nOverall services inflation also slowed to 1.2 per cent from 1.7 per cent in December due to enhanced subsidies for medication in polyclinics and Specialist Outpatient Clinics. Core inflation - which strips away the costs of accommodation and private road transport - was one per cent in January. This was down from 1.5 per cent in December, due to the cut in electricity tariffs as well as the fall in food and services inflation.\n\nEconomists are expecting inflation to remain muted for the first half of this year.\n\nANZ economists Daniel Wilson and Glenn Maguire, for example, say that headline inflation would \"trend in negative territory over the first half of the year\".\n\nMeanwhile, OCBC economist Selena Ling notes that \"this marks a very benign start to the inflation outlook for 2015\", with core inflation not an exception.\n\nHowever, Mr Seah was more optimistic. \"It'll rebound back to positive level by mid-2015 due to the base effect as well as recovery in oil prices.\"\n\nThis year's report also saw the rebasing of the CPI series from 2009 to 2014 and updated weights of the series, although these are not projected to alter MAS forecasts for headline and core inflation, according to Barclays economists.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Boyhood, favoured to at least win Best Director for Linklater, earned just one Oscar: Patricia Arquette for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBirdman's sweep - as well as an exceptionally strong showing for Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel and Damien Chazelle's Whiplash, qualified as the biggest surprise on a night that otherwise transpired largely as expected.\n\nJK Simmons won Best Supporting Actor for his role as an abusive drum teacher in Whiplash, Eddie Redmayne won Best Actor for his portrayal of the physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything, and Julianne Moore - who had been nominated four times before - finally won for her turn as a woman suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's disease in Still Alice.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Moore expressed hope that the film would bring more public attention to the affliction, joining other winners who took advantage of their time at the podium to talk about the causes their films highlighted.\n\nUpon winning the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay, Graham Moore, who wrote The Imitation Game about the gay World War II cryptographer Alan Turing, disclosed that he had attempted suicide as a teenager, urging teenagers in the audience to \"stay weird\".\n\nWhen Glory composers John Legend and Common took the stage to accept the award for Best Song, Legend used his speech to expand on the political message behind Selma.\n\n\"We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that took place 50 years ago. But we say Selma is now because the struggle for justice is right now. . . We know that, right now, the struggle for freedom and justice is real. We live in the most incarcerated country in the world. There are more black men under correctional control today than were under slavery in 1850. When people are marching with our song, we want to tell you, we are with you.\" The Best Song award was the only Oscar won by the civil-rights drama, which was nominated for Best Picture, along with seven other movies. When Selma director Ava DuVernay was overlooked in the best director race, many observers saw the snub as symptomatic of persistent racism and sexism in an industry - and motion picture academy - that is dominated by white male film-makers and white male stories.\n\nOscars host Neil Patrick Harris acknowledged those criticisms right off the bat in his opening number, when he called the Oscars a chance to recognise \"the best and the whitest - er, brightest\" in Hollywood. Later, the evening's most galvanizing moment occurred when Arquette accepted her award and ended her speech with a call to end wage discrimination against women, at which point Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lopez stood up and whooped their approval from the audience.\n\nArquette's speech crystallised strong feelings that emerged this year regarding diversity in race and gender in the movie industry. When Kathryn Bigelow became the first woman to win an Oscar for best director in 2010, many observers thought the victory signalled progress in employing more women behind the camera. But Martha Lauzen of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University has noted that women made up only 17 per cent of all directors, writers, producers, executive producers, editors and cinematographers in 2014 - the same percentage as in 1998.\n\nThis 2015 Oscar ceremony punctuated a year of anxiety and even anguish in the movie industry, which was bedevilled by weak box-office returns and a punishing computer hacking scandal at Sony Pictures Entertainment. The jittery state of affairs was also acknowledged in Harris's opening number, when actor Jack Black took the stage with a litany of technological and demographic threats to old-fashioned movie-going (summed up in the phrase \"screens in our jeans\").\n\nIn many ways, the Oscar ceremony does not just celebrate theatrical movies; it creates an economy for them: Awards season has become an increasingly important business model for films which cannot afford splashy TV ad campaigns, but which benefit from the \"earned awareness\" of stars walking red carpets from Toronto and Venice to the Golden Globes. Birdman exemplifies just the kind of small, experimental movie that the Academy Awards help keep alive, despite threats from the special-effects spectacles and comic-book movies that the movie itself harshly critiques.\n\nBy voting for Birdman, Academy members seemed to be sending a signal that they are painfully aware of the business model that keeps them afloat, and their own contradictory worship of visionary creativity on one hand and box-office profits on the other. As Harris noted at the outset of the programme, the eight best picture nominees earned US$600 million between them, and the surprise hit American Sniper has earned more than all the rest put together. (It won one Oscar, for best sound editing.)\n\nStill, even if this year's crop of nominees was among the lowest-grossing group in recent memory, each managed to double its production budget - often with the help of its Oscar campaign. As Moore observed after winning her Oscar: \"You never know. At the end of the day, Hollywood is still a business. I think it depends on how many people buy tickets.\" WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/3984ee516f1cab83d5fab33369f7a4c2324824834bd1c7ed3c819276bfd0e758?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "An Oscar statue is seen outside the Dolby Theater during preparations ahead of the 87th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California on Feb 20, 2015."}]}

At the mid-point of the range, DFS will be valued at \u00a3585 million, according to the statement. Final pricing is expected on or around March 6, DFS said, with listing on March 11.\n\nDFS said earlier this month it planned to file for an initial public offering (IPO) to reduce its indebtedness. Berenberg and HSBC are co-lead managers.\n\nDFS is the latest retailer seeking to sell shares in the UK, on the heels of a year when companies raised about US$6 billion from London IPOs, the most in over a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Smaller competitor ScS Group Plc returned to the stock market in January with a listing that valued the company at \u00a370 million.\n\nDFS's IPO will raise about \u00a398 million for the company, which will be used to reduce debt and provide access to cheaper financing. Funds managed by Advent will also sell some shares. Including a possible over-allotment option, the maximum size of the offer is \u00a3296 million, DFS said.\n\nDFS says it is leader of the \u00a33 billion UK upholstery market with a 26 per cent share. Founded by Graham Kirkham in 1969, the retailer was acquired by Advent in 2010. Prior to that, it spent more than 10 years as a listed company before being taken private by Mr Kirkham in a 2004 deal that valued the company at \u00a3507 million.\n\nIt posted revenues of \u00a3674.6 million for the 12 months to Nov 1 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of \u00a385.2 million, at a margin of 12.6 per cent. \"Our vision is to take DFS from being a great British business to a world-class business,\" CEO Ian Filby said in the statement.

The median forecast of 74 economists in a Bloomberg survey called for a fall to 4.95 million.\n\nThe number of houses on the market dropped in January for a second straight month compared with last year and price increases were broad-based, making it difficult for first-time and younger buyers to get into the market.\n\nGains in employment and historically low mortgage rates will probably sustain demand, while rising household formation and a shortage in rental supply should also provide a boost this year over last.\n\n\"There is an ongoing housing recovery, but a disappointing one,\" Mike Englund, a Boulder, Colorado-based chief economist for Action Economics LLC, said before the report's release. \"We clearly have seen a pullback in transactions.\"\n\nEconomist estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from a 4.76 million to 5.2 million sales pace, from a previously reported 5.04 million a month earlier.\n\nWith the report, the Realtors' group issued annual revisions covering the monthly data for the past three years to reflect changes in seasonal adjustments. The annual totals were unaffected.\n\nExisting home sales, which are tallied only when purchase contracts close, account for more than 90 per cent of the residential market.\n\nA timelier barometer is new-home purchases, because they are tabulated earlier in the process, when contracts are signed. They constitute about 7 per cent of the market. Those figures come out on Feb 25.\n\nThe median price of an existing home climbed 6.2 per cent in January from the same period a year earlier, to US$199,600, the report showed.\n\nIncreases of this size clearly outpace income gains and general inflation and is probably caused by a lack of supply, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said on Monday as the figures were released. This is not a \"healthy\" sign, he added.\n\nThe number of previously owned homes on the market dropped 0.5 per cent to 1.87 million. At the current sales pace, it would take 4.7 months to sell those houses compared with 4.4 months at the end of the prior month. Less than a five months' supply is considered a tight market, the Realtors group has said.\n\nHome sales will benefit from the improving labour market, which bounded forward in January. Payrolls advanced by 257,000 month-over-month, according to Labour Department figures, capping the biggest three-month gain in 17 years. The unemployment rate rose to 5.7 per cent from 5.6 per cent as more than a million Americans streamed into the labour force seeking work.\n\nLow borrowing costs help, too. The average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.76 per cent in the week ended Feb 19, according to data from Freddie Mac in McLean, Virginia. That's still close to the record-low of 3.31 per cent reached in November 2012.

When it is your own, you build from scratch, versus taking over from somebody - there is a difference,\" says Mr Poh. \"I find that if there's opportunity in this world in my lifetime, I should try and seize the opportunity.\"\n\nHe credits this gung-ho attitude to his years in the United States. After getting a diploma in Engineering from Singapore Polytechnic, Mr Poh went on to Nanyang Technological University. In his second year, he decided to go overseas to finish his degree in Engineering Physics.\n\n\"That widened my vision and gave me the exposure. The world is much bigger than Singapore,\" says Mr Poh.\n\n\"Since America, I became a very open-minded person. When I was in poly, I was still an ordinary Singaporean - very reserved, not wanting to talk much, and trying not to say things people perceive as hao lian (Hokkien for \"proud\"). Singaporean students are more reserved, more humble. American students always over-sell themselves. They raise their hands; they argue with their professors.\n\nThis exposure made him more outgoing and always looking to make connections with people, explains Mr Poh. It also gave him a strong sense of direction and independent thinking which wasn't clouded by societal norms.\n\n\"That is an attribute that is needed for entrepreneurs. You cannot just follow. You have to be very good in crisis management. Business is always about facing crises, whether it's in growing the business or in funding and manpower. There are all kinds of challenges. So as an entrepreneur you really have to adjust.\"\n\nHe adds: \"The market is never perfect. The market always has discrepancies. And it's entrepreneurs that are able to tap these opportunities and make a difference. The Internet has changed the way businesses behave. In this era, things are rapidly changing, which creates a lot of opportunities - information flows faster, footprint becomes smaller, transport becomes easier. . . All this opens up more opportunities for entrepreneurs.\n\n\"Increasingly, you're not just competing in the local market. Increasingly, you have to compete in the global market.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the same time, the government will extend for another three years the 250 per cent deduction for donations due to expire at end-2015\n\n\"Taken together with Care & Share matching grant support, our measures effectively multiply every dollar that the community is giving,\" Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said. \"For every dollar that you donate in 2015, the government is more than doubling it.\"\n\nIndividual donations hit an all-time high of S$1.25 billion last year, thanks in part to enhanced tax incentives, said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe government recently announced an extension of its matching grant support for the Care & Share Movement till March 31, 2016. It's also providing S$250 million more in grant. \"This doubles the total matching grant for Care & Share to S$500 million,\" Mr Tharman noted.\n\nOn its part, the government is also giving more cash under the GST Voucher scheme, introduced in 2012 to ensure lower income households are not burdened by the GST.\n\n\"We will be increasing the quantum for GSTV-Cash by S$50 across the board from 2015 onwards,\" Mr Tharman said. \"This will benefit 1.4 million Singaporeans.\" Senior citizens aged 55 and above will get up to S$600 - double what they usually get. For those aged 65 and above and living in HDB flats, there's an additional S$300, for a total of S$900 this year. Altogether, these increases will cost the government S$385 million more in 2015.\n\nThe government will also hand out S$80 million in the form of one to three months of HDB Service & Conservancy Charges rebates.\n\nThe concessionary levy for foreign domestic workers will be reduced from S$120 to S$60 per month, compared to the normal levy for foreign maids of S$265. This can save a household an additional S$720 in levy a year. The qualifying criteria for the concession will also be expanded to include households with a Singaporean child aged below 16 years, up from below 12.\n\nThese changes will take effect from May 1 this year and benefit 144,500 households, according to Mr Tharman. They will cost the government about S$125 million yearly.\n\nKEY POINTS\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A disappointing interim budget in July, coupled with the failure to pass key legislation in parliament, have only raised the stakes.\n\n\"This government has been given the benefit of the doubt for a long time and investors have begun questioning whether anything has been happening on the ground,\" said Rakesh Arora, head of research at Macquarie Capital Securities India. \"The government will have to go the extra mile in the budget.\"\n\nUsing a tradition passed down from the British, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Feb 28 will stand and read the budget for the fiscal year starting on April 1.\n\nIt's only the second time in India's history that it's been unveiled on a Saturday, when local stock, bond and currency markets are normally shut. Stock markets will be open during the budget speech.\n\nBesides investors, central bank governor Raghuram Rajan will be paying close attention. He's linked further reductions in India's benchmark interest rate to \"high-quality fiscal consolidation\" in addition to softer inflation. Undoubtedly, India has a lot going for it at the moment. The country's stocks and currency are among the world's best performers in the past year; its economy is poised to become the fastest growing among major emerging markets as China slows; and oil's slide has improved its public finances.\n\nStill, the investment community wants more. While praising Mr Modi's pro-business approach since the election, it's looking for concrete details on his plans to boost local manufacturing, improve infrastructure and cut back on food and fuel subsidies.\n\n\"The budget now matters more than ever,\" Citigroup Inc's Rohini Malkani wrote in a Feb 22 note. \"The market will look for something to excite, differentiate.\"\n\nHere are eight numbers that will indicate whether Mr Modi impresses or disappoints.\n\nBudget deficit projection:\n\nIndia's biggest money managers have said they'll forgive Mr Jaitley if he projects a wider shortfall than the 3.6 per cent of gross domestic product targeted by the previous administration for the next fiscal year - as long as the cash is used to fund roads and power plants rather than food and fuel subsidies. The government is aiming to hit a target of 4.1 per cent of GDP in the year through March, which would be the lowest in seven years.\n\nCapital expenditure:\n\nMore funds for roads, bridges, highways and ports are crucial to spur an economy where private investment as a share of GDP is at the lowest in at least a decade.\n\nEconomists including Andrew Tilton at Goldman Sachs Group and Samiran Chakraborty at Standard Chartered predict Mr Modi will boost capital expenditure to at least 2 per cent of GDP, up from about 1.8 per cent in the previous budget. That would signal a rise to 2.8 trillion rupees (S$61 billion) from 2.3 trillion in the previous budget.\n\nMr Jaitley might also increase import taxes on crude oil to pay for more infrastructure spending, Mr Chakraborty wrote in a Feb 19 report.\n\nSubsidies:\n\nFood, fuel and fertiliser subsidies have risen to about 15 per cent of total spending from 10 per cent a decade ago.\n\nSpending on subsidies will drop to about 2.49 trillion rupees, or 1.7 per cent of GDP, from 2.61 trillion, or 2 per cent budgeted the previous year, UBS Group's Ed Teather predicts. This is largely due to the 45 per cent drop in Brent crude prices over the past year and the expansion of Mr Modi's programme to reduce waste in the sale of subsidised goods through direct cash transfers to beneficiaries.\n\nAlthough fuel and fertiliser spending is falling, those gains could be offset by increased food subsidy spending that is mandatory under a 2013 food security law, Mr Teather said.\n\nRevenue projection:\n\nEconomists questioned Mr Jaitley's revenue projections in the interim budget in July, saying they looked unrealistic. And indeed, tax revenues grew just 7 per cent by the end of December compared with the budgeted 20 per cent increase, leaving the government 44 per cent short of its full-year goal of 9.8 trillion rupees.\n\nWith the economy now recovering and lower oil prices allowing the government to raise taxes on fuel without stoking inflation, net collection from levies will increase in the coming fiscal year to 10.6 trillion rupees, Goldman Sachs predicts.\n\nRevenue deficit:\n\nAnother number being looked at is the revenue deficit, which is the difference between collections and expenditure minus any debt. The shortfall is estimated at 3.78 trillion rupees for the year through March, with revenue expenditure at 1.57 trillion rupees.\n\nMr Modi will probably cut this spending to 1.52 trillion rupees for the next 12 months, according to HSBC Holdings' Pranjul Bhandari.\n\nMarket borrowing:\n\nYes Bank's Vivek Kumar sees net borrowing rising slightly to 4.7 trillion rupees from last year's 4.6 trillion rupees, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley predict it will drop to 4.4 trillion rupees.\n\nGross borrowing will rise to 6.23 trillion rupees from 6 trillion rupees, according to Morgan Stanley. It predicts the government will also look to buy back debt or swap bonds maturing in the coming months with longer term maturities to rein in interest costs that now make up 24 per cent of total spending.\n\nBanking:\n\nMr Modi needs to inject at least 200 billion rupees of capital into Indian banks to prevent their credit profiles from deteriorating, according to the local unit of Fitch Ratings. That compares with the 112 billion rupees Mr Modi budgeted for the current year to prop up a sector battling the highest levels of stressed assets since at least 2001.\n\nDivestment:\n\nUnrealistic revenue projections have prompted governments into last-minute stake sales to meet deficit targets. Divestment forecasts for the next fiscal year vary from Morgan Stanley's 375 billion rupees, Standard Chartered's 430 billion rupees and Yes Bank's 500 billion.\n\nFor the year through March 31, Mr Jaitley had budgeted 584 billion, of which so far he's raised about 243 billion.

The price of iron ore has halved in the past year while the price of oil has halved in six months. Fortescue last week posted an interim net profit of US$331 million, down from US$1.72 billion a year ago. \"Everybody's struggling,\" said a mining services analyst who asked not to be named. \"At the beginning of FY15 everyone thought (FY)16 would be better, but it's almost been pushed out by the struggles in the economy.\"\n\nBoart Longyear Ltd, the world's biggest supplier of mine drilling services warned on Monday that analysts' forecasts for 2015 should be cut to reflect an intensely competitive market which is unlikely to improve soon.\n\nSalt Lake City-based Boart posted an underlying loss of US$142 million for 2014, 51 per cent worse than a year earlier and weaker than the US$122 million loss expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters IBES.\n\nBut the company's shares rebounded by up to 7.5 per cent, after trading near record lows for months as the company had to be bailed out from near bankruptcy last year by private equity firm Centerbridge.\n\n\"The company's financial results, especially margins, will continue to be challenged by extremely competitive industry pricing for drilling services and by other factors,\" Boart said in its results announcement.

Rex funded this from the proceeds of the share placement deal in September last year. The acquisition brings its total indirect interest in the onshore block to 83.8 per cent.\n\nThe asset, which covers 7,422 acres, had 15 wells drilled in the 1950s. Another well drilled in 2010 had encountered hydrocarbon-bearing zones, Rex said. Work on this discovery well was suspended due to operational issues, and will be reactivated.\n\nWhen production resumes, Rex's subsidiary in Trinidad and Tobago can book more revenue with the increased stake, said Rex's CEO Mans Lidgren, explaining that the block is located close to existing prolific fields. \"Analyses using our proprietary Rex Virtual Drilling (RVD) technology on seismic data covering the Cory Moruga Block have been positive and we are optimistic about several prospects in the asset,\" he said.\n\n\"Onshore production levels are typically lower than offshore wells, but drilling of onshore wells costs substantially less than that of offshore wells. At current oil prices, there is potentially still a good mar-gin for produced oil in Trinidad.\"\n\nThis follows closely after another acquisition last week of an additional 20 per cent stake in three licences in the Halten area of the Norwegian Sea through Lime Petroleum Norway, an entity Rex jointly controls with Hibiscus Petroleum.\n\nRex had earlier said that it plans to take advantage of the lower cost of drilling services and participate in drilling eight wells this year: three in Norway, two in Oman, two in Trinidad and one in Germany. It also plans to prove there is more oil in its own assets to validate its technology.\n\nRex's counter closed trading unchanged at S$0.365 on Monday, before the announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The first, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), brings together 12 members spanning the Pacific Ocean - Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. The second, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), links up Asean members with dialogue partners Japan, South Korea, China, India, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn the run up to the TPP finish line, it is worth pausing to recall why officials pursue trade agreements in the first place.\n\nFirst, agreements open markets for trade between member countries with better terms and conditions than non-members receive. In Singapore, the market for goods is already extremely open. But for companies attempting to export goods or services into some TPP member countries, barriers can still be high. These include formal blocks or impediments to trade as well as issues such as regulations or standards that make it tough for companies to move products across borders.\n\nSecond, trade deals can unleash significant opportunities for inward and outbound investment. As an example, consider the rapid expansion of foreign direct investment into Vietnam from Singapore. Most Singaporean investment can be found in industrial parks - with five parks attracting S$506 million in investment in the first six months of this year. Singapore is the third largest investor in Vietnam overall, with cumulative investments of over S$30 billion.\n\nWhile the Vietnam-Singapore Industrial Parks can provide an easy entry platform for Singaporean companies, they do not allow firms as much flexibility and access to local markets as market forces might demand. This is where deeper, high-quality integration in trade agreements can make a substantial difference.\n\nOf course, Singapore and Vietnam are already connected through Asean, with the prospect of improvements in business conditions as the Asean Economic Community (AEC) provisions are steadily implemented. But the AEC provides benefits mostly for companies doing business with other Asean member countries.\n\nCREATING OPPORTUNITIES\n\nIn a world of value chains or complex supply chains, inputs and final products are increasingly needed for different, non-Asean markets. The mega-regional agreements are recognition of the need to create larger trade agreements that include more options for location, investment, and sales than smaller FTAs.\n\nFor Vietnam, the prospect of joining the TPP has already resulted in increased investment flows. Much of the new, inward investment is in the textile sector as mostly South Korean and Chinese companies are starting to build capital-intensive weaving and dyeing plants in Vietnam. But, as the TPP agenda comes into clearer focus, the opportunities for firms to expand into one of the fastest growing, lowest cost markets will grow.\n\nThird, additional provisions in the TPP can reinforce the incentives to invest. For instance, as a member, Vietnam will be changing a range of intellectual property laws to better protect the ideas, words, designs and trademarks of companies. Many standards in areas such as food regulations and labelling requirements may also come into closer alignment with Singapore.\n\nThese additional, deeper integration provisions are a key feature of the TPP. They distinguish it from other FTAs that generally skip over such elements or treat them very lightly. But for firms looking to invest and expand, the promise of improved trade facilitation measures, competition rules, transparency and harmonisation of rules, procedures and standards are often just as critical as the decision to open markets in the first place.\n\nIn short, as officials race to conclude the TPP and make progress in the RCEP negotiations, businesses in Singapore and in other member countries ought to be applauding their efforts. The payoffs from a successful conclusion of both mega-regional agreements will be beneficial for economic growth in countries as diverse as Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Middle-class customers' purchasing power is strong in these countries, allowing Thai firms to diversify revenue sources and offset weak consumer spending at home.\n\n\"We may spend up to 40 billion baht this year. About 80 per cent will be for opening new shopping mall and acquisitions, while the rest 20 per cent will be for improvement,\" executive chairman and chief executive officer Tos Chirathivat told reporters.\n\nCentral Group was founded in 1927 by Tiang Chirathivat. Now the leader in Thai retail, the family business has interests in several businesses, including Thai shopping mall developer Central Pattana pcl and Central Hotel Plaza pcl, a hotel and fast-food chain operator. The group planned to open six new shopping malls this year, mostly in border provinces which connects Thailand to neighbours like Laos, Myanmar and Malaysia to tap strong demand for cross-border trade, Mr Tos said.\n\nCentral aims to open 300 new food stores at home, as well as nine new hotels with more than 1,800 rooms combined in Thailand as well as in Turkey, Vietnam and Bali.\n\nCentral recently completed the purchase of a 49 per cent stake in Vietnam electrical appliance chain Nguyen Kim, having opened its first department store, Grand Indonesia Mall, in Jakarta, last year.

Yet banks such as Bank of America Corp keep ploughing their burgeoning deposits into US government and related debt - pushing the industry's holdings past US$2 trillion - instead of lending it all out.\n\nPart of the buildup has to do with rules that require banks to hold more high-quality assets in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. But it also reflects that borrowers, particularly among Americans scarred by the housing bust, are still repairing their finances rather than going into debt to splurge on big-ticket items. And that may mean the US recovery isn't quite as robust as all the upbeat data would suggest.\n\n\"Banks have so much cash,\" said Peter Tchir, the New York-based head of macro strategy at Brean Capital. \"Lending has loosened, but it is still just simpler for banks to own Treasuries.\"\n\nWhile the buying may help to contain any jump in Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve moves towards raising interest rates, what it says about loan demand also has implications for how soon benchmark borrowing costs will rise this year. Minutes from the Fed's January meeting released last week said that many policy makers were in favour of keeping rates lower for longer to avoid jeopardising the recovery.\n\nYields on five-year US notes, which dropped as low as 1.15 per cent last month, have since climbed as job and wage gains boosted the outlook for US growth. They ended at 1.59 per cent last week.\n\nInvesting in government bonds is proving to be a profitable move for banks. They are making over a 100 basis-point spread by purchasing five-year Treasuries as opposed to leaving idle cash parked at the Fed where they earn only 25 basis points. US commercial banks held US$2.83 trillion in cash as at Feb 11, up from US$2.57 trillion at the end of last year.\n\nHaving cash invested in five-year Treasuries is also netting banks an attractive spread over what they are paying depositors. The gap between the spread of the government yield over the average deposit rate for the four largest US banks is above its norm over the past decade. For Bank of America that gap is about 1.44 percentage points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nUS commercial banks have increased their stakes in Treasuries and debt from federal agencies for 16 straight months, the longest stretch since 2003, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Together, they hold US$2.1 trillion, the most according to Fed data going back to 1973. The four biggest US banks more than doubled holdings of Treasuries to US$251.8 billion last year, according to\n\nCompleteBankData.com\n\n, which analyses data compiled from the Fed and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\n\nBank of America, the second-biggest US lender, boosted investments almost 10-fold to US$67.25 billion. Citigroup Inc's holdings rose by 60 per cent to US$110.38 billion,\n\nCompleteBankData.com\n\nfigures show.\n\nAt the same time, lending hasn't kept pace. One of the biggest reasons is a lack of consumer demand for borrowing. While loans to businesses at US commercial banks have risen 13 per cent to US$1.81 trillion, consumer loans increased just 5 per cent to US$1.2 trillion.\n\nAt Bank of America, consumer lending has contracted for four straight years, the longest slump since at least the mid-1990s, data compiled by Bloomberg show. JPMorgan Chase & Co has seen its consumer loans decrease in four of the past six years, while Wells Fargo & Co reported an increase of less than 1 per cent last year.\n\n\"Deposit growth has been very strong at Wells Fargo, and has outpaced loan growth and loan demand,\" said Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman. \"This has resulted in a great deal of liquidity on our balance sheet.\" Spokesmen from Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan had no comment on the level of the banks' debt or lending.\n\nSenior loan officers in a Fed survey last month said demand for a broad range of consumer lending, from mortgages to vehicle loans, weakened even as credit standards eased.\n\nInstead, US households have been stockpiling cash. Since falling to a record low in 2005, savings as a percentage of income has more than doubled to 4.9 per cent as at December.\n\nFed officials are counting on the extraordinary measures taken since the financial crisis to revive growth and consumer demand. Record low borrowing costs have helped to spur job growth and the economy has added about 250,000 jobs per month over the past year.\n\n\"You're going to have more consumer demand for borrowing,\" said David Coard, head of fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, an institutional brokerage. \"It's just a matter of time before banks become more relaxed in their policies and their willingness to lend.\"\n\nHelping to keep a lid on yields has been guidelines requiring financial institutions to own the highest-quality assets while trimming risk-taking activities. Basel III rules and requirements approved by the Fed, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and FDIC, require banks to hold enough high-quality liquid assets to survive a 30-day credit seizure, in order to minimise a sudden shock to the global financial system.

But Uber, which allows drivers to connect with passengers through a smartphone app, still has far to go to convince wary French lawmakers that Uber should be allowed to operate in their cities.\n\nUnder new French transport rules known as the Th\u00e9venoud Law, the police in Paris have been issuing fines since the start of the year to drivers who pick up fares through UberPop, the company's low-cost service.\n\nThe new regulations require all drivers who chauffeur paying passengers to have a licence and the appropriate insurance: French legislators say UberPop, which is similar to the budget UberX in the US, does not meet these requirements.\n\n\"The law against illegal taxis has always existed, but things have taken on new proportions since UberPop was created,\" said Pierre-\u00c9tienne Hourlier, who heads an 80-person police unit that patrols Paris looking for illegal taxi operators.\n\nMore than 100 illegal taxi drivers, including those who use Uber and other smartphone apps, have been pulled over in Paris since Jan 1, according to the police. Penalties can include a one-year prison sentence and fines of up to US$17,000. Uber says the fines actually imposed in Paris have been very small, however - in the hundreds of euros.\n\n\"Most of the people we stop are first-time offenders, which means it is the first time they have been stopped in a police operation,\" Mr Hourlier said. \"They are very surprised, especially because of the fuzzy information they were given by Uber.\"\n\nThibaud Simphal, Uber's general manager for France, contends that the company's low-cost service remains legal and that the recent crackdown is merely aimed at helping traditional taxi associations. Barriers to entering the sector remain high: one-time fees for a French taxi driving licence can run as high as US$300,000.\n\n\"By limiting the supply of taxis, this isn't serving the general public,\" Mr Simphal said. \"If a judge tomorrow says UberPop should stop, we would stop. But we don't see there's a reason to stop now.\" Uber says it supports drivers, who are independent contractors and are not directly employed by the company, when they face legal difficulties.\n\nThe confusion about UberPop's legal status in France stems from a court ruling in December, when a judge said the service could operate in Paris but that Uber could not advertise some of its services to the general public. That ruling was then contradicted days later by Pierre-Henry Brandet, the French Interior Ministry spokesman, who said the new transport law - which requires higher levels of insurance for chauffeurs than for regular drivers in France - made Uber's low-cost service illegal.

Particularly, the measures targeted at helping Singapore companies internationalise send a clear message that local businesses need to look beyond the domestic market in order to achieve breakthroughs in growth.\n\nForeign revenue generated by the top 1,000 companies in Singapore by revenue (Singapore 1000) has increased steadily from S$149.9 billion in 2011 to S$223.9 billion in 2014. This upward trend is similarly seen in the SMEs. The top 50 SMEs ranked as having the highest overseas turnover derived revenue of S$1.78 billion in 2014, a 29 per cent increase from S$1.38 billion in 2011.\n\nWith the expected formation of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) by the end of 2015, it will not be a surprise that international revenues will continue along the upward trend.\n\nTo further encourage internationalisation by Singapore companies big and small, three measures, costing the government S$240 million in total, were introduced.\n\nFirstly, there would be an increase in support to 70 per cent of grants awarded by IE Singapore. Secondly, double tax deductions will be enhanced to cover salaries paid to Singaporeans working overseas. Lastly, a new tax incentive, the International Growth Scheme with concessionary tax rates on incremental income, will be accorded to qualifying companies that embark on a journey to internationalise.\n\nIt remains to be seen the conditions that need to be met by companies to enjoy these benefits. There was also no sunset clause announced by the finance minister on the International Growth Scheme. As with all other tax incentives, we expect that there will be a sunset clause, which we hope will take into consideration that the internationalisation of a company is not a short-term effort that reaps rewards immediately, but one that will likely yield results and returns only after a period of time.\n\nRecognising that mergers and acquisitions are possibly a faster strategy by companies to acquire scale and forge alliances both locally and internationally, the current Mergers and Acquisition (M&A) allowance will be extended for another five years and will be enhanced to 25 per cent of the value of a qualifying investment, up from the 5 per cent threshold previously allowed.\n\nThe maximum tax deduction of S$5 million is unchanged though. The 50 per cent shareholding condition will also be relaxed to allow for the M&A allowance to be accorded so long as there is an acquisition of at least 20 per cent shareholding.\n\nThe reduction in the shareholding threshold is a welcomed enhancement on two fronts. It makes the now increased M&A allowance more accessible to companies where a less than 50 per cent stake is acquired. The enhancement also makes the M&A allowance more accessible to SMEs in particular, making the adoption of M&A as a strategy to internationalise more attractive.\n\nThe changes to the M&A Scheme are aligned with the clear theme in this year's Budget on assisting SMEs and making their access to fiscal assistance for expansion easier.\n\nBut this year's Budget is not just about focusing on companies - in fact, it is one of the most holistic, touching on every aspect of the economy and life, from overseas growth to continued education through the years to social support for various segments of the society. It is a special SG50 Budget indeed.\n\nAs Education Minister Heng Swee Keat, who is also chairman of the SG50 Steering Committee, said: \"SG50 is about celebrating the enduring values that we share as Singaporeans, values that undergird the Singapore Spirit . . . reflecting on how far we've come as a nation in the last 50 years, celebrating where we are now, and committing to an even better next 50 years.\"\n\nIn the same light, as much as Budget 2015 is about reflecting on our achievements to date as a nation and redistributing the fruits of our nation's labour back to our people, it is also about propelling this little red dot to greater heights and further beyond the shores of Singapore.\n\nIt is a truly a progress plan that underpins Singapore's readiness for her next 50 years of successful nation-building.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We must reach our next frontier as an economy, with firms driven by innovation, and higher incomes coming from deep skills and expertise in every job.\n\n\"We must ensure a society that is fair and just, where everyone has a chance to move up and do well regardless of where they start. And we must complement a culture of personal effort and responsibility with stronger collective responsibility, especially for our elderly.\"\n\n\"It will take time to develop a new economic and social culture . . . But we can only get to where we want in the long term by taking steps now, moving ahead relentlessly, and never thinking that the status quo will get us to a better place,\" added Mr Tharman in his close to 21/2-hour-long speech.\n\nWith an inevitable rise in government expenditure over the long term - Mr Tharman projects overall spending to reach about 19.5 per cent of GDP on average over the next five years, about one per cent of GDP higher than the revenues today - steps have also been taken to strengthen future revenues.\n\nWith effect from 2016, the expected returns of Temasek Holdings will be included in the government's net investment returns framework, which is already applied to GIC and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nTo further bolster fiscal resources, the government will also raise the personal income tax rates of top income earners from Year of Assessment (YA) 2017. The change will affect those in the top 5 per cent who earn at least S$160,000 a year, but the increases are largest for the highest income earners - for those with a chargeable income of over S$320,000, the top marginal tax rate will increase by two percentage points to 22 per cent.\n\nAccording to the government's assessment, the tax increase for high-income earners should not significantly dent Singapore's competitiveness. Still, Mr Tharman stressed that \"we cannot take tax competitiveness lightly\".\n\nThe hike in top personal income tax rates is expected to raise S$400 million of extra revenue a year. Taken together with Temasek's inclusion in the net investment returns framework, it would provide additional revenues of about one per cent of GDP annually for the budget over the next five years.\n\nSingapore's economic restructuring journey will also be fine-tuned, with a notable deferment of this year's round of announced levy increases for S Pass and work permit holders in every sector. This, Mr Tharman said, will give companies more time to adapt to \"the new normal of a permanently tight labour market\".\n\n\"However, to avoid any misunderstanding, let me affirm unequivocally that while we are adjusting the pace of our foreign worker measures, we are not changing direction. It remains crucial for Singapore that we restructure towards reducing our reliance on manpower, and find new and more innovative ways of doing business,\" stressed Mr Tharman.\n\nThe popular Wage Credit Scheme has also been extended for 2016 and 2017, although the co-funding of wage increases will be lowered from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.\n\nBut apart from helping companies cope with rising business costs, the government also delivered on calls to look at firms' topline growth. To that end, it will offer more support for innovation and internationalisation activities - particularly for those undertaken by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nBudget 2015 also introduced further measures to strengthen savings and income in retirement for all Singaporeans - first, through enhancements to the CPF system, and second, by introducing the Silver Support Scheme.\n\nTo enhance CPF savings, the CPF salary ceiling will be increased to S$6,000 from S$5,000 from Jan 1, 2016. CPF contribution rates will also be increased for older workers - for example, those aged above 50 to 55 will see a two percentage point increase in contribution rates to 37 per cent - the same level as that of younger workers.\n\nThe government will also make the CPF system more progressive by paying an additional one percentage point of Extra Interest on the first S$30,000 of CPF balances from the age of 55. This will take effect from Jan 1, 2016, and builds on top of the existing one point Extra Interest for the first S$60,000 of balances.\n\nIn addition, with the permanent Silver Support Scheme, more targeted help will be given to seniors in need, who have insufficient savings for retirement. Quarterly cash payouts of between S$300 and S$750 will be given to the elderly poor, depending on the senior's lifetime wages, household support, and housing type. About 150,000 of today's elderly are expected to benefit.\n\nAnother major thrust of Budget 2015 had to do with the SkillsFuture push, which sees a major new phase of investment in Singaporeans - beginning in the schooling years, and progressing throughout one's career.\n\nFor one, a SkillsFuture Credit will be created for all Singaporeans, which can be used for a broad range of courses supported by government agencies. Every citizen 25 years old and up will receive an initial credit of S$500 in 2016, with further top-ups made at regular intervals in the future.\n\nOn a broader level, the government will also be working with employers to chart future skills needed in each industry. Mr Tharman said that the government would collaborate with stakeholders to develop and implement these comprehensive sectoral manpower plans in all key sectors by 2020.\n\nEven though expectations ran high for hefty SG50 or pre-election goodies - similar to Budget 2011's S$3.2 billion Grow and Share package and Budget 2006's S$2.6 billion Progress Package - Budget 2015 did not follow the script.\n\nSeveral observers noted the greater weight placed on longer-term, more fundamental changes to Singapore's economic and social culture, than on shorter-term goodies.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse economist Michael Wan: \"It seems to us that Budget 2015 focuses much more on long-term measures to boost the supply-side capacity of the economy, but is lacking in some of the short-term 'consumption' boosting measures that we, together with other analysts, have been expecting . . . There were no significant cash handouts given out in this budget.\"\n\nStill, in addition to Service & Conservancy Charges rebates and a personal income tax rebate of 50 per cent capped at S$1,000, Goods and Services Tax Voucher (GSTV) cash will also be given to 1.4 million Singaporeans, with an additional GSTV for seniors.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/adequacy-and-adaptability", "site_title": "Of adequacy and adaptability", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nOf adequacy and adaptability\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Feb 23, 2015 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nIN sharp contrast to most developed economies, financial adequacy, or rather the lack thereof, neither daunts nor defines Singapore's Budget. The fact is, an enviable surplus cushion in the ballpark of S$11 billion-12 billion accumulated since 2011 comfortably offsets a S$6.7 billion budgeted deficit for an exceptionally generous \"SG50 Budget\". Crucially, this does not flout the constitutional requirement for a balanced budget for the government's elected term.\n\nAdmittedly, the suite of cash disbursements, expansive social redistribution and business relief may be mistaken for welfare or a populist slant. But willingness to fund with past surpluses is a necessary and evolving response to demographic, productivity and income gap realities.\n\nAnd to be clear, there is no tectonic shift from a fundamentally sustainable fiscal trajectory. Emphasis on judicious spending and pre-emptive measures to ensure revenue adequacy in anticipation of rising expenditures underscore an unwavering commitment to fiscal prudence.\n\nTo this end, calibrated hikes to top income tax rates are in the offing. The delicate balance between progressivity and a strategic consideration of competitiveness is notable. In addition, net investment revenues (NIR) recognised from the Monetary Authority of Singapore and GIC being expanded to include Temasek is a deliberated deviation too. These contentious revenue boosting measures speak volumes of adaptability to evolving fiscal calculus.\n\nAt the same time, core 2015 Budget measures do not deviate from tackling structural adequacy issues. And productivity adequacy is understandably a centrepiece. Tellingly, the relevance of the Productivity & Innovation Credit (PIC) Scheme is undiminished despite the PIC bonus rolling off. Instead, targeted inducements for innovation and internationalisation sharpen long-haul efforts to raise productivity. What's more, detailing and adequately funding the \"SkillsFuture\" drive significantly ups the ante on boosting productivity. The big picture idea is that continually upgrading Singapore's human capital is a necessary and sensible means to leverage strong capital investments. Moreover, by empowering employees, unnecessary turnover is mitigated, and consequent knowledge and expertise accumulation reduces \"productivity leakage\".\n\nAnd phasing out the Wage Credit Scheme - the government's co-funding of wage increments - is not a tragedy either. From inception, this was meant to be transitory pain relief rather than a permanent crutch that distorts incentives. This is justifiably displaced by temporary relief from deferred hikes in foreign worker levies and a hard-headed approach to productivity-driven wage increments.\n\nSocial safety net adequacy is another prominent aspect of the Budget. This spans a wide spectrum from seniors to the middle-income \"sandwich class\" to low-income households.\n\nFocusing on \"seniors\", inter-connected issues of retirement adequacy, healthcare and housing were categorically addressed. Thus, the last Budget's Pioneer Generation medical subsidies being complemented by Medishield Life - a universal and comprehensive medical insurance coverage - is not only desirable in mitigating erosion, but serves as a sensible hedge against future strains on public finances too.\n\nAs for overall pension adequacy, equity locked in homes, longer life expectancy and wealth-augmenting effects of inflation come into play. So while pension inadequacy sometimes simply reflect liquidity mismatch (for example wealth tied up in property), this is not always the case. So unlocking home values is not a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nIn this context, the \"Silver Support\" scheme constitutes a significant shift in the DNA of elder-welfare by addressing the most dire pension shortfalls (the most vulnerable 20 per cent). Together with an ecosystem of de-centralised medical and social care, meaningful eldercare adequacy is substantially attained.\n\nFor the wider retiree cohort, higher interest rates on the first S$30,000 in the retirement account better preserves retirement fund value, with an appropriately progressive tilt. What's more, restoring CPF contribution rates for workers in the 50-55 age group, alongside a measured increase to CPF contribution rates for older workers, buffers retirement adequacy at the margin.\n\nAnd lifting the income ceiling eligible for CPF from S$5,000 to S$6,000 across the board is a pre-emptive strike at the potential future pension inadequacy risks of today's middle class, though a rethink of age and risk-appropriate pension returns is admittedly some way off.\n\nAdequacy of affordable housing for low and middle-income groups was admittedly alleviated by past Budget measures so it received little attention this time. For one thing, accentuating property tax progressivity in past budgets has \"re-priced\" home-ownership. But ongoing supply-demand adjustments fall short of counteracting the legacy of public housing price surge, and is exacerbated by the drain on future pension funds (given the use in mortgage financing).\n\nArguably, this leaves scope to augment the misalignment of existing gauges of subsidy eligibility. For instance, an increase in income ceilings to qualify for subsidies. More importantly, subsidy quantum based on a means-based sliding scale, rather than the current binary cut-off, may also assuage the \"sandwich effect\".\n\nAll said, the inherent adaptability of the SG50 Budget is sound, as is the approach to augur adequacy.

One reason was that there were no established methodologies for projecting the long-term expected real return on its portfolio. This is in light of Temasek's investment approach of taking concentrated stakes and making direct investments.\n\n\"Temasek's investment strategy was still evolving, having begun to invest in more geographies and sectors since 2002,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nGovt spending to hit 5-yr average of 19% of GDP\n\n;\n\nS$3b injection into new Changi Airport Development Fund\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The crowd roars. \"And how many came to give Shu Yoshida a hug?\" The roar gets even louder.\n\nThe man in question is an unlikely celebrity. Short and bespectacled, the 50-year-old Shuhei Yoshida is president of Sony's worldwide game studios. What he's done to draw such affection is champion some of the biggest hits in the business and prove people will pay US$70 for top-notch titles even in a world with thousands of free smartphone games.\n\nIn the process, he's helped chief executive officer Kazuo Hirai steer Sony toward a surprising turnaround. The company's games business has not only survived, it's had the best console launch ever with the PlayStation 4. The division is one reason Sony's headed for the highest profit since 1998, when it made MiniDisc players and Men in Black. (Yes, the first one.)\n\n\"Yoshida and his team are on a roll right now,\" said James Mielke, an executive at the cloud-gaming startup Shinra Technologies. \"He's certainly a star. But it's a humble star quality.\"\n\nSuccess for games has helped fuel a surge in Sony's shares. They rose 0.4 per cent to 3,215 yen on Monday morning in Tokyo, extending an 81 per cent rise in the past 12 months.\n\nIt's little exaggeration to say Mr Yoshida's life is computer games. He grew up playing arcade games and titles from Nintendo Co, based in his hometown of Kyoto. He joined Sony's games group more than two decades ago as it developed the first PlayStation. He uses five consoles today, to make sure he can play games from any region, using a Wii U at home with his nine-year-old twins and saving more adult fare for the office.\n\nAs studio head, he's taken an exceptionally inclusive approach. He works with Sony's own developers to come up with games like Uncharted and also supports independents, opening his checkbook to help produce hits like Journey. The studios that Mr Yoshida manages are part of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc, led by Andrew House.\n\nMr Yoshida says spending the time and money to foster upstarts pays off because it leads to great games and a vibrant industry. It's necessary, he says, because the biggest developers have trimmed output to concentrate on well-known franchises, such as Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty. \"The industry's focus has narrowed too much,\" Mr Yoshida said. \"Can we continue producing interesting new products? That's become a real concern.\"\n\nMr Yoshida takes to Twitter to applaud indie hits, crack jokes about the competition and talk with gamers. His following has swelled to 153,000, in the same range as Facebook Inc's Sheryl Sandberg. He's even been made into a playable character by the independent studio Capybara Games Inc.\n\nMr Yoshida has been in charge of Sony's game development since 2008, but his rise to fame is closely linked to the PlayStation 4. The console has sold 19 million units since its release in November 2013, compared with 11 million for Microsoft Corp's Xbox One, according to data from VGChartz. It's a reversal of fortunes, after Sony's over-engineered predecessor lost market share to less expensive machines from Microsoft and Nintendo.\n\nHis support for indies has proven fortuitous. The latest consoles from Sony and Microsoft have similar technical capabilities so buyers often make decisions based on which one has their favourite software. Quirky PlayStation exclusives like The Tomorrow Children, a Soviet-themed sandbox title described by creator Q-Games as a Marxism simulator, can sway a potential customer away from Xbox One.\n\n\"Because the machines are so similar now, it all comes down to content,\" said Alexander de Giorgio, chief operating officer at Inflexion Point Capital, a fund that invests in independent mobile game developers.\n\nSony's indie strategy came into focus around 2010, Mr Yoshida said. As major publishers focused on their franchise titles, the rising popularity of smartphone games played on Apple iPhones and devices using Google Inc's Android threatened the future of consoles. Hits like Rovio Entertainment Oy's Angry Birds, which has amassed more than two billion downloads, almost immediately threatened Sony's portable players.\n\nMr Yoshida's answer has been to court indie developers with money and production support in return for some degree of exclusivity. Sony works with creators in the US, Europe and Japan.\n\nYohei Kataoka came across Sony's developer programme in 2006, when he was a design school student making real estate and car advertisement websites part time. Even earning US$8,500 a month, he was bored and dreamed of creating video games.\n\nThe programme's main requirement was to pitch ideas unlike any existing game. Mr Kataoka quit school to develop a proposal, and a few months later, Sony's stipend was paying rent for his startup Crispy's and covering the salaries of four friends.\n\nTokyo Jungle, which went on sale in 2012, was set in a futuristic version of the Japanese capital abandoned by humans. The photo-realistic city is run by feral animals, which battle for survival and the chance to procreate. It became a critical and commercial success, selling more than 231,000 copies. \"If it wasn't for Sony, there is no way I would be doing this now,\" Mr Kataoka said. \"It was like an angel investment, something unheard of in the games industry.\"\n\nSony is a regular presence on the independent developer scene, sponsoring events from New York's IndieCade to BitSummit in Kyoto and Tokyo Indie Fest. The involvement helps ensure a steady stream of content for PlayStation owners, including breakout hits such as Journey. The minimalist desert-voyage game from thatgamecompany won British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards in 2013, including for artistic achievement and game design.\n\nIf the PlayStation 4's features and Mr Yoshida's tactics are any guide, the future will probably be very different from the solitary experience most people associate with gaming now. PS4 users can broadcast their gameplay live on Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com Inc. They can also share recorded footage on Facebook and Twitter, taking games beyond the confines of the living room. Sony is also working on a virtual reality headset codenamed Morpheus, a project Mr Yoshida is part of.\n\n\"It's all about ecosystems competing,\" Mr Yoshida said. \"This goes for Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. The platform encompasses content and services that run on your hardware, but also various partnerships. It's an interesting time, because your rivals can also be your partners.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The dollar was 1.25 per cent higher against the franc at 0.9515 francs while the euro was up 0.5 per cent at 1.07395 francs, not far from a five-week high of 1.08115 struck late on Friday. \"The move in the Swiss franc is broadly in line with the overall pick up in risk appetite,\" said Peter Kinsella, currency strategist at Commerzbank.\n\n\"Clearly, they want to keep Greece in the eurozone and as a consequence some of the safe-haven plays are being unwound.\"\n\nEurozone ministers late on Friday agreed to extend Greece's financial rescue package by four months after weeks of difficult and often confusing negotiations that captivated markets.\n\nThe agreement removed the immediate threat of Greece's exit from the single currency bloc, but questions remained over whether the short-term extension will lead to a deal over how to keep Athens solvent.\n\nThe euro fell 0.7 per cent to US$1.1300 after rising to US$1.1430 on Friday in response to the Greek loan agreement. The euro shed 0.7 per cent against the yen to 134.65 yen, after a German IFO survey fell short of expectations.\n\nThe slightly disappointing German data, along with the uncertainty over Greece, kept investors wary about the euro.\n\nGreece has to submit to the Eurogroup on Monday a list of reforms that it plans to implement during the remainder of the bailout period, which needs the approval from the troika comprised of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF. \"There is still ambiguity as to what exactly this list is . . . So this deal is by no means done,\" said Adam Cole, head of G10 FX strategy at RBC Capital Markets, adding that the euro was weak as investors await the list.\n\nThe dollar rose against the yen to 119.20 yen after bouncing from a low of 118.30 on Friday, helped by a rise in US debt yields.

Net profit is expected to rise 9.8 per cent to US$1 billion, boosted by a 59 per cent rise in container shipping but hit by a 50 per cent drop in its oil business.\n\nAnalysts say some sort of impairment charge on Maersk's oil assets is likely, after the oil industry was forced to write down billions due to a slump in the oil price in the second half of last year. \"Divestments are likely to finance growth and cash distribution,\" analyst Stig Frederiksen from Nordea Markets wrote in a note, adding he expected a US$1 billion share buyback to be announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe company announced the first such scheme in its history to the tune of US$1 billion last August, sending its shares soaring to peak at a record high in mid September at 15,220 crowns each. They have fallen around 7 per cent since.\n\nAs Maersk laid out a strategy in recent years of focusing on four to five core business units, it has sold off businesses such as a stake in Netto supermarkets and its one-third share in fellow Danish shipping company DFDS.\n\nIt has also sold off its fleets of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) vessels, Floating Production Storage Offloading (FPSOs) vessels and crude oil tanker vessels.\n\nAnalysts said up next on the block could be Hoegh Autoliners, operator of a fleet of 60 vessels that transport vehicles, and airliner Star Air.\n\nLogistics company Damco, tugboat operator Svitzer and Maersk Supply Service, providing offshore oil services, have also been mentioned as disposal candidates. \"They will continue to divest companies in the coming years. One example is Damco, where there is no synergies related to owing the company but I think a turnaround is needed before a divestment can take place,\" analyst Jacob Pedersen from Sydbank said.\n\nThe global logistics industry is recognised as fragmented and consolidation is expected by many. Singapore-based Neptune Orient Lines announced a sale of its APL Logistic unit to Kintetsu World Express last week.\n\nAP Moller-Maersk has booked accounting gains of more than US$4 billion and a positive cash flow of around US$10 billion since 2009 when management initiated a strategy to lift profit.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/bbbce136df28c3f124aaacd0aacb32a1a22b3e0aff4544b3f60c5179a9e1f4d6?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Danish conglomerate AP Moller-Maersk may announce a second share buyback scheme in its 110-year history as early as Wednesday, analysts said, allowing it to reward shareholders as its oil unit takes a battering from a slump in prices."}]}

He paid Hong Kong taxes on the bonuses there, and since moving to the UK in 2003, he has paid UK taxes on his earnings globally, it said.\n\n\"Mr Gulliver voluntarily declared his Swiss account to UK tax authorities for a number of years,\" HSBC said, without specifying when that began. A company spokesman declined to elaborate. The bank on Monday said that pre-tax profit for 2014 fell to US$18.7 billion from US$22.6 billion a year earlier. Operating costs climbed 6.1 per cent to US$37.9 billion.\n\nHSBC has come under political fire after the publication of a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists this month showed details of how its Swiss unit handled accounts for tax evaders and criminals in past years. Mr Gulliver, 55, offered the company's \"sincerest apologies\" in full-page ads in British newspapers last week. He said that Europe's largest lender has since toughened internal controls and cut some clients at the Swiss private bank.\n\nMr Gulliver was listed as the beneficial owner of an account at HSBC Suisse in the name of Worcester Equities Inc, a company registered in Panama, The Guardian reported on Sunday. His bonuses were paid through that entity until 2003, and the account had a balance of US$7.6 million in 2007, the newspaper said. While the publication detailed the account and his continuing use of Hong Kong as a residence, it didn't accuse him of breaking laws.\n\n\"The Swiss account was set up in 1998 in the name of a Panamanian company for reasons of confidentiality, and this had no other purpose and provided no tax or other advantage,\" HSBC said. \"Full tax was paid in Hong Kong on the bonus payments.\"\n\nHSBC is among a handful of banks to face probes in recent years for their roles in a Swiss banking system that let depositors conceal identities, and in many cases dodge taxes or launder ill-gotten cash. In 2013, HSBC reached a US$1.9 billion deferred-prosecution deal with the US Justice Department to resolve claims it enabled Latin American drug cartels to launder money.\n\nThe firm's most recent woes stem from seven-year-old data stolen by Herve Falciani, a self-described whistle-blower. The information-technology worker pilfered client account details from HSBC's Geneva office in 2008 and passed them to the French government. More detail about the data was released this month, prompting local authorities to search HSBC's Geneva private-banking office last week.\n\nChairman Douglas Flint is set to face questions on Wednesday at a UK Parliament hearing over his role as finance director when the bank was found helping customers avoid taxes. The company has multiplied its compliance workforce to more than 7,000 from 1,500 four years ago and is spending as much as US$1 billion each year to boost internal controls, Mr Flint has estimated. Staff were hired to ferret out wrongdoing and introduce automated systems to detect suspicious transactions.\n\nHSBC, which traces its roots to the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, was required by British regulators to move to London from Hong Kong more than two decades ago following its acquisition of Midland Bank plc as part of a push westward. Mr Gulliver had moved to Hong Kong in 1980, becoming a permanent legal resident along with his wife, an Australian.

The tentative agreement boosted global markets as fears eased of a \"Grexit\" or eurozone exit - which could have highly damaging wider ramifications - and stocks mostly rose in Asia and Europe.\n\nThe deal however came with the proviso that Athens provide by Monday a list of measures to quash concerns, not least in powerhouse Germany, that Greece might backtrack on its commitments to cut spending and pass reforms.\n\n\"Europe has some breathing space, nothing more, and certainly not a resolution,\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier told the Bild daily on Monday. \"The fundamentals - namely assistance in exchange for reform - must remain the same.\" In Berlin, a finance ministry spokesman said the list needed to be \"coherent and plausible\".\n\nMr Tsipras, 40, has vowed to end the \"humiliation\" and \"vicious circle\" of the spending cuts demanded by Greece's creditors in return for two massive bailouts since 2010.\n\nHe wants to use the next four months to draw up a new reform package that puts the country - where one in four people is out of work - on a fairer road to recovery after years of recession, spending cuts and state job losses.\n\nBut the tough negotiating stance of Germany and other eurozone countries has obliged him and his finance minister Mr Varoufakis, 53, to give ground. Athens pledged to refrain from one-sided measures that could compromise fiscal targets and had to abandon plans to tap some 11 billion euros in leftover European bank support funds.\n\nThe source in Brussels said the list received on Monday was \"not definitive\". Others said that Brussels and Athens were in regular communication and seeking to finalise the document by a midnight (2300 GMT) deadline.\n\nOnce the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF - the \"troika\" of Greece's creditors - approve the list, the extension can go ahead. Certain European parliaments also need to give the green light. But if the proposals are not approved, it will be back to the drawing board and yet more drama for Greece, which is struggling under a 320-billion-euro debt mountain.

They also take the total amount raised by the government so far from selling down its stake in Lloyds to just under \u00a38 billion.\n\nLloyds shares traded 0.8 per cent higher at 78.60p at 0815 GMT on Monday.\n\nLloyds is expected to announce its first dividend since its rescue on Friday, increasing the bank's appeal to investors and making it easier for the government to offload its remaining shares. Prior to its bailout, Lloyds had a record of being one of the highest dividend paying stocks in Britain, handing over half its profit to shareholders in 2005 and 2006.\n\nUKFI had previously raised \u00a37.4 billion through two separate sales to financial institutions such as pension funds and insurers. Those sales were made using an 'accelerated bookbuild' with the shares sold overnight while the stock market was closed.\n\nIn contrast, Morgan Stanley is seller smaller amounts of shares on the open market and has been mandated to continue to do so until the end of June.\n\nAfter that, industry sources said UKFI could look to make another larger sale to institutions or offer shares to private retail investors.\n\nA sale of shares in Britain's other bailed-out bank Royal Bank of Scotland is unlikely in the next two years, the sources said.\n\nShares in RBS are trading well below the price the government bought them at, leaving taxpayers sitting on a loss of nearly \u00a310 billion.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

In recent years, several major measures - such as the WIS Scheme, CPF Life, and the GST Voucher scheme - have steadily provided greater support for low-income Singaporeans at different stages of life. The Silver Support Scheme further enhances social protection for low-income Singaporeans by sharing the burden of retirement with the rest of society.\n\nWhile many Singaporeans welcome these measures, others may be concerned at the apparent weakening of the principle of personal responsibility. Can Singapore avoid the worst excesses of the \"welfare state\", characterised by high taxes and a low incentive for work? Although there are real trade-offs between social protection and personal incentives, greater provision of social welfare does not contradict personal responsibility. Rather, social welfare systems can be designed to strengthen society by protecting individuals against risks that are difficult to address using market systems alone.\n\nAdhering strictly to an ethos of personal responsibility leaves individuals poorly equipped to protect themselves against many basic risks of life. For example, we can, and should, aim to save adequately for our retirement. But most Singaporeans would not have enough for their retirement if they lived much longer than expected, or if standards (and costs) of living were to rise significantly after their retirement. Likewise, we can lead a healthy lifestyle, but the healthiest person can still be a victim of a catastrophic accident, or be diagnosed with a serious disease.\n\nPrivate investment and insurance markets address these risks imperfectly. One problem is that of access: lower-income Singaporeans are less likely to be covered by private solutions because they either lack the disposable income or knowledge necessary to buy the appropriate protection. But the larger problem is that certain risks are difficult to insure privately, because of adverse selection. A private annuity, for example, will be priced higher because individuals who expect to live longer have a much stronger incentive to purchase life-long retirement payments. Although private markets provide an important supplement, particularly for those with higher incomes, the government is best positioned to pool risks across all Singaporeans to provide a basic level of social protection. Some might argue the Silver Support Scheme is not a significant improvement over the existing means-tested public assistance schemes available in Singapore. However, one major difference is that needy seniors need not apply - they will be entitled to payments, which will be made automatically based on administrative records. This reduces the likelihood that needy seniors will fall through the cracks simply because they fail to apply properly. Requiring formal applications for welfare support can hinder access for the truly needy. For example, in the US, in some years, barely half of those eligible for the national food voucher programme actually enrolled for benefits. Providing the Silver Support Scheme automatically to needy seniors is an important policy innovation over our existing public assistance schemes, and represents the first formal step towards a minimum pension guarantee in Singapore.\n\nThe problem of requirement adequacy among our pioneers is linked to our rapid growth as a nation. Singapore's GDP per capita at independence was around S$1,600. Today, it is close to S$70,000. Even after adjusting for inflation, Singaporeans today enjoy incomes and a standard of living many times better than our pioneers did at independence. But retirement savings and investments have simply not grown at the same rate as the rest of the economy. Nor have earnings risen at the same rate for all groups. As a result, many pioneers have insufficient savings to afford an adequate retirement in Singapore today. The Silver Support Scheme will directly address the problem of retirement adequacy by providing additional cash support. While the debate will now shift to whether the amount of support is sufficient, the Silver Support Scheme has the potential to improve retirement adequacy among our pioneers substantially.\n\nIn the coming years, it will be important to improve the future retirement adequacy of working Singaporeans by encouraging greater individual savings for retirement. Our present retirement policy incentivises voluntary savings through tax deductions for top-ups to CPF and the Supplementary Retirement Scheme. However, a tax deduction-based incentive is inherently regressive and provides the greatest benefit to those who need the additional retirement savings the least. Re-examining our retirement policy system to provide greater incentives for the middle and lower-income to set aside savings for their retirement will do much to address this shortcoming.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He has enhanced the CPF system, by increasing mandated contributions during working years, including for older workers. He has also raised interest rates for smaller CPF balances such that some 80 per cent of CPF members will earn at least 5 per cent on their retirement savings, which is remarkable at a time of near-zero interest rates for all major currencies - and the Singapore dollar.

In total, the TSP is estimated to disburse S$7.5 billion over three years, higher than the original estimate of S$5.3 billion, said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe WCS will be extended for 2016 and 2017 to give employers more time to adjust to the tight labour market. This extension will cost about S$1.8 billion in total.\n\nOver the next two years, the government will co-fund 20 per cent of wage increases given to Singaporean workers earning a gross monthly wage of S$4,000 and below. This co-funding will apply to wage increases given in 2016 and 2017.\n\nMr Tharman added that if wage increases given in 2015 were sustained in 2016 and 2017, employers would continue to receive co-funding at the new rate of 20 per cent.\n\nThe CIT rebate, meanwhile, will be extended for Years of Assessment (YA) 2016 and 2017 at the same rate of 30 per cent of tax payable, but up to a lower cap of S$20,000 per YA. This extension is expected to cost about S$800 million in total.\n\nMr Tharman also said that the\n\nPIC\n\nbonus, which offers substantial enhanced tax deductions or cash payouts on qualifying activities, will expire in YA 2015.\n\n\"The\n\nPIC\n\nbonus was intended as a transitional measure and has been successful in spreading the culture of productivity among SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises),\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nSpending on continuing education to push average spending to S$1bn per year\n\n;\n\nCitizens aged 25 and above to get S$500 in SkillsFuture Credit from 2016\n\nINFOGRAPHIC:\n\nSnapshot of the Singapore economy\n\n;\n\nWhat Budget 2015 may bring\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While this gives the policy makers more policy headroom and flexibility to spend more (estimated at about 1% of GDP annually over the next five years), which is understandable in light of the ageing population and the economic restructuring pressures, but some clarity and maybe considered conservatism on the methodology of estimating unrealised capital gains may be wise,'' Ms Ling said.\n\nShe noted that there were some goodies for companies, but not all items in their wish list had been granted.\n\n\"But a sufficiently lighter touch with more carrots and less sticks approach. Enough to reflect that ground feedback has been factored in, but pushing on with certain \"tough\" measures aligned with economic restructuring and refinement of certain schemes to better target SMEs,'' she said.

This is because the stamp duty concessions \"were intended to enable the industry to acquire a critical mass of local assets as a base from which the Reits can expand abroad, (and) this has been achieved\", he said in his Budget speech.\n\nWith the extensions, Reits will continue to enjoy tax exemption on qualifying foreign-sourced income, a reduced withholding tax of 10 per cent (from 17 per cent) on distributions to foreign institutional investors, and GST remissions on business expenses for Reits with overseas assets. (The latter also applies to listed registered business trusts in the infrastructure, ship leasing and aircraft leasing sectors.)\n\nThe finance ministry further announced changes to facilitate fund-raising by these Reits and business trusts through their special purpose vehicles (SPVs). From this April until March 2020, they will be allowed to claim GST on business expenses incurred to set up SPVs that are used solely to raise funds, as well as GST on the business expenses of such SPVs. This is especially relevant since Hong Kong, a close competitor for similar listings, does not have a GST regime, said Teo Wee Hwee, real estate tax leader at PwC Singapore.\n\nAll these moves are aimed at promoting Reit and business trust listings in Singapore amid intensifying competition in Asia as various countries develop and improve their own Reit and business trust frameworks.\n\nAsia Pacific Real Estate Association chief executive Peter Verwer noted that many Asian governments, including those of China and India, are looking to chase down Singapore's lead in financial services. \"Today's statement by the Singapore government keeps it ahead of the pack,\" he said.\n\nThe industry welcomed the extensions and said the removal of stamp duty concessions for local acquisitions will have limited impact on S-Reits, since most are already acquiring abroad for better returns on investments. Many have also braced themselves for the possible removal in the run-up to the Budget, they said.\n\nDBS analyst Derek Tan said removing the stamp duty concession will add about 3 per cent to the cost of acquiring local assets. \"Industrial Reits tend to have more domestic-oriented portfolios, so their pace of acquisitions may slow and yields may dip. They will have to negotiate harder,\" he said, citing Ascendas Reit, Mapletree Industrial Trust, Viva Industrial Trust, Mapletree Commercial Trust, Frasers Centrepoint Trust, CapitaMall Trust and CapitaCommercial Trust as some examples of Reits with wholly local assets.\n\nAccording to Christine Li, director of research at Cushman & Wakefield, of the top 10 investment deals last year, six involved Reits buying properties locally - translating to about S$4 billion in transaction value, or two-thirds of the total investment value of the top 10 leasing deals.\n\nPwC's Mr Teo noted that there are other ways to acquire local properties without paying substantial stamp duties. \"If you can't buy the asset, you may have the option of buying the company that owns the asset, since most real estate is held using special purpose vehicles. By doing that, you should end up paying a substantially lower stamp duty of 0.2 per cent based on the net asset value of the company.\"\n\nSuch share deals are common in Singapore, particularly for sophisticated and institutional investors, but less so for Reits since they enjoy stamp duty remissions.\n\nHowever, unlike Reits which enjoy tax transparency, these companies will have to pay tax on their rental income. Even so, there are ways to achieve tax transparency - by converting these companies to Limited Liability Partnerships, which are tax transparent in Singapore, for example. Such conversions may also qualify for stamp duty relief. \"Then it's as good as the Reit owning the property directly,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Money managers cut their net-long wagers by the most in 15 weeks, US government data show.\n\nThe strengthening dollar and record valuations for global equities are diminishing bullion's appeal as a store of wealth.\n\nAs the combined market capitalisation of stocks thundered through US$67 trillion last week and the dollar traded at its highest level in at least a decade, this month's losses in exchange-traded products (ETP) backed by gold reached US$4 billion.\n\n\"Longer-term, we're still negative on gold,\" Jack Ablin, the Chicago-based chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, which oversees about US$66 billion, said on Feb 19. \"I view it as insurance. If nothing happens, you should expect to lose money on it. Most of the time, nothing happens. As a risk asset, I think equities are more attractive.\"\n\nThe net-long position in gold tumbled 18 per cent to 110,164 futures and options contracts in the week ended Feb 17, according to US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. It was the third consecutive decline, the longest streak since November. Short holdings surged 44 per cent, the most since August.\n\nFutures lost 1.8 per cent last week to US$1,204.90 an ounce on the Comex in New York, while the Bloomberg Commodity Index declined 1.7 per cent. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index climbed 0.4 per cent. The S&P 500 Index of US equities rose 0.6 per cent and reached a record on Feb 20.\n\nEmergency talks by euro-area finance ministers on Friday led to a provisional deal intended to keep aid flowing to Greece. Even before then, gold had failed to attract much buying, with holdings in global ETPs little changed last week at 1,671.8 tonnes, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.\n\nJohn Paulson, the billionaire hedge fund manager, also is showing less enthusiasm for the metal these days. The investor kept his stake in the world's biggest ETP backed by bullion unchanged for a sixth straight quarter. As at Dec 31, Paulson & Co owned 10.23 million shares in the SPDR Gold Trust, a government filing showed last week. Each share represents about 0.096 of an ounce.\n\nGold slumped 29 per cent in the two years through 2014, the first consecutive annual declines since 1998, as equities surged and the US economy gained traction. Futures fell 5.8 per cent in February, heading for the first monthly drop since October.\n\nMinutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting showed some policy makers argued for keeping interest rates near record lows for longer. The policy makers cited a strengthening dollar, international flash points from Greece to Ukraine and slow wage growth among reasons for delaying the first rate increase since 2006, according to the record released on Feb 18. Higher borrowing costs cut gold's allure because the metal generally offers returns only through price gains.\n\n\"Given the big drop we've had in the last month, I would certainly be bullish on gold,\" Adrian Day, the president of Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis, Maryland, which oversees about US$145 million, said on Feb 19.\n\n\"The Fed minutes were extremely positive. The longer the Fed goes on, the more difficult it is for them to raise interest rates, because increasingly, they're waiting for perfect conditions.\"\n\nNet wagers across 18 US traded commodities rose 15 per cent to 584,669 contracts as at Feb 17, the first gain this year, CFTC data shows. Crude holdings increased for the first time in five weeks before prices capped a weekly loss on expanding US inventories.\n\nA measure of net-long positions across 11 agricultural commodities jumped 45 per cent to 279,963 contracts, the government data shows. The Bloomberg Agriculture Index of eight farm products fell 1.5 per cent last week.\n\nInvestors trimmed the hog net-long position for the first time in four weeks, with wagers sliding 8.3 per cent to 33,570 contracts. Futures in Chicago touched a five-year low on Feb 18. US pork output in 2015 will reach an all-time high, the government forecasts.\n\nSpeculators got more bearish on wheat, holding a net-short bet of 26,249 contracts. Egypt, the world's largest importer, said it cancelled a tender for US grain on Wednesday. The dollar climbed 14 per cent against a basket of 10 currencies in the past year.\n\n\"With the strength of the US dollar, as that continues, it's going to put some pressure on the export markets,\" Susan Dambekaln, a portfolio manager at Capital Innovations LLC in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, which oversees about US$1 billion, said in a Feb 20 interview.\n\n\"For hogs, production levels have exceeded expectations, so we're still seeing that affecting the market.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/8ea06ee5ff94bead3e0158569d372c7c950060f3fa5dbf492dad6aaa26131842?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Judging by the barometer of hedge-fund interest, there's less to get excited about in gold these days."}]}

This will be of significant help for SMEs and businesses which are seeking for inorganic growth and consolidation.\"\n\nToh Boon Ngee\n\n, Tax Partner at KPMG in Singapore:\n\n\"Increasing the tax allowance from 5% to 25% and relaxing of the 50% shareholding requirement to 20% will allow more flexibility in restructuring and M&A for SMEs. This will enable SMEs to merge and grow, especially needed in the tougher global and regional business environment.\"\n\n\"Minister Tharman responded to calls from SMEs to provide support for internationalisation especially in areas of double tax deduction for salary costs. However the effectiveness of this initiative will be in the details.\"\n\nTay Hong Beng\n\n, Head of Tax at KPMG in Singapore:\n\n\"The enhanced M&A tax incentive has now made it even more compelling for businesses to come together and consolidate. This should inject a much needed interest and enthusiasm in the SMEs segment where consolidation would result in a much competitive business venture especially when venturing abroad.\"\n\nHarvey Koenig\n\n, Tax Partner at KPMG in Singapore\n\n\"Encouraging innovation in SMEs through the Capability Development Grant is a top-down approach which could have limited reach. Instead, a broad-based market-driven incentive may be a better tool to encourage different forms of innovation.''\n\nAlan Lau\n\n, Tax Partner at KPMG in Singapore:\n\n\"The government clearly recognises that one of the main stumbling blocks that hampers the development of local entrepreneurial spirit is the the challenging funding gap currently faced by many start-ups and SMEs. More importantly, under the new scheme, the government steps in to co-share the funding risk together with private sector financial institutions. Such co-sharing of risk is not only an innovative feature, but also lowers the commercial risk faced by banks involved in such early-stage funding business.''\n\nChai Wai Fook\n\n, Partner, Tax Services, Ernst & Young Solutions LLP:\n\n\"The extension of the corporate tax rebate by another two years, albeit with a reduced cap of S$20,000 is welcomed for all companies, especially for cash-strapped SMEs which can reinvest the tax savings to upgrade their capabilities and drive innovation.\"\n\nChia Seng Chye\n\n, Partner, Tax Services, Ernst & Young Solutions LLP:\n\n\"The extension of the Wage Credit Scheme to 2017 will help SMEs to attract and retain their workforce - a key factor to grow and compete overseas.\"\n\nTan Bin Eng\n\n, Partner, Business Incentives Advisory, Ernst & Young Solutions LLP:\n\n\"The introduction of the new tax incentive scheme for companies targeted at internationalisation efforts will be greatly welcomed by many SME, which have been challenged to meet the requirements of current tax incentives that apply more generally to large companies.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Oman will produce 980,000 barrels a day this year, he said in an interview in Muscat on Sunday. That would be 4 per cent higher than in 2013, according to BP Plc data. Oman will provide 2014 production figures in April.\n\n\"It's crucial that we continue executing the future projects,\" Mr Al Aufi said. \"It's crucial that we continue the seismic activities and the exploration activities because when the market turns around, we need to have these opportunities identified and ready to go.\" Rising supply from the US to Russia is contributing to a worldwide crude surplus that Oman estimates at one million barrels a day. Brent crude futures have climbed 5.3 per cent this year and added 14 US cents to US$60.36 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at 1137 am Singapore time. The contract fell 48 per cent last year.\n\nGovernments in the region have had to reduce subsidies on diesel, natural gas and utilities while companies cut billions from capital budgets because of low oil prices.

With a projected deficit of 2.5 billion rials (S$8.84 billion), Oman's 2015 budget assumes an oil price of US$75 a barrel. A balanced budget would need oil to be over US$100, he said.

Close to 90 per cent of all bonds and sukuk are rated AA or AAA.\n\nSet up in 2009 to help develop the domestic debt market, Danajamin has provided guarantees for over 7 billion ringgit (US$1.92 billion) of issuance, 45 per cent of that amount in the form of sukuk.\n\nThe firm is one of a small but growing number of guarantors worldwide which support sukuk deals.\n\nDanajamin, owned by the finance ministry and Credit Guarantee Corp Malaysia Bhd, now plans to expand its use of partial as well as temporary credit guarantees, chief executive Mohamed Nazri Omar said in an interview. \"If we guarantee every single issuance they'll all be rated triple A and there will be no diversity. From a developmental angle, we want to deepen and stretch the market with new products.\" The move comes as Malaysia plans to remove mandatory credit ratings from 2017, in an effort to reduce issuance costs and boost market volumes.\n\nDanajamin only guarantees ringgit-denominated deals. It has begun co-guaranteeing deals with banks to spread risks; in December, it co-guaranteed a project by Berjaya Land Bhd with OCBC Bank, and another transaction by a unit of developer Malaysian Resources Corp Bhd with CIMB Islamic and RHB Islamic.\n\nIn September, it partnered with the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF), a trust fund of the Asian Development Bank, to support regional transactions including sukuk. \"If we have a client who wants to do part in ringgit and part rupiah, we'll bring in CGIF,\" said Mr Nazri.\n\nCurrent economic conditions in Malaysia have put pressure on some issuers, but demand for guarantees is strong as many companies have projects that need long-term financing, he added. \"Irrespective of the domestic demand slowing or not, they need to get started. They need to start building. Those kinds of projects need to go ahead.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

Their large suppliers ie the large farms are still increasing production . . . so they will continue to source milk domestically.\"\n\nThe sharp decline in prices coincides with plans by some EU farmers to expand production in the run-up to the abolition of milk quotas in April. A food embargo by Russia has also cut off the EU's biggest outlet for cheese, worth almost one billion euros (S$1.5 billion) in 2013, and accelerated a decline in EU milk prices from a record high at the end of 2013.\n\n\"We were very dependent on Russia for cheese exports, hence the current turbulence on the market - but you have to separate micro-trends from big, long-term ones,\" said Pierre Begoc, international director at French consultancy Agritel. \"Northern Europe is the zone with the biggest potential worldwide to raise production,\" he added, noting that New Zealand had less capacity to boost output.\n\nCurrency swings help some producers in countries such as the United States where the main focus is to meet domestic demand were initially shielded to some extent from the fall in international prices but the impact is now beginning to be felt, analysts said. \"Global market forces driving the lower milk prices have flowed through to virtually every dairy farmer in the world, whereas six months ago it was only New Zealand farmers who were in that situation,\" Ms Kilsby said.\n\nJerry Dryer of US-based Dairy and Food Market Analyst said that there had been a sharp drop in US prices from previous record levels but buyers were now beginning to replenish inventories. This is now providing some support for prices in the US cash market although exports were challenging, he said. \"Our prices have been a little higher than New Zealand recently, which makes it difficult to export,\" he said.\n\nWeak local currencies have, however, provided some protection for producers in Australia, the world's fourth largest exporter, and in the European Union. \"While the global price of milk is down 50 per cent, our price to our consumers is down only 12 per cent,\" said Garry Helou, managing director of Murray Goulburn, Australia's largest dairy producer.

We have to stay the course in reducing reliance on labour and especially unskilled foreign workers,\" Mr Tharman said in Parliament on Monday.\n\nBusiness groupings, from the Singapore Business Federation to the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC) and the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, all voiced appreciation for the temporary reprieve from additional levies. Five years of levy hikes and quota cuts have meant mounting wage pressures on many companies, and costs continue to rise. Singapore's overall unit labour cost rose 3.5 per cent in 2014, up from a 2.4 per cent jump in 2013.\n\nAnd while the message that Singapore needs to press on with restructuring was unambiguous, hitting the pause button on this key driver in Singapore's restructuring push - now in its sixth year - was still significant enough for some to read it as a change in approach.\n\n\"Beyond the impact on the surface, which is that it will provide breathing room for companies amid the restructuring, surely this has signalled a subtle shift in terms of approach in restructuring the Singapore economy - that continued tightening of manpower policies will not be the focus of restructuring going forward,\" said DBS economist Irvin Seah.\n\nRather, he sees measures geared towards promoting innovation and internationalisation - also announced on Monday - as characterising the next phase of restructuring, boosting quality topline growth of companies.\n\nSingapore Business Federation chief operating officer Victor Tay also described the move as one that \"charted new grounds\", with the government assessing the current business landscape to defer a scheduled policy rather than sticking to it rigidly.\n\nMr Tharman had explained the decision as one firmly based on evidence of a significant slowdown in foreign workforce growth. Excluding the particularly foreign workers-needy construction sector, the net inflow of foreign workers has slowed from 60,000 in 2011 to just over 16,000 in 2014. These figures exclude foreign domestic workers. Even the construction sector added 10,000 workers in 2014, \"far below\" that recorded in 2013 and 2012, he said.\n\nThis has given the government space to defer the announced levy increases. \"This will give companies, especially our SMEs, more time to adapt to the new normal of a permanently tight labour market, where it is both difficult to find Singaporean employees, and foreign workers are no longer an easy solution,\" he said. Further tweaks to levies for manufacturing and construction sector work permit holders, took into account each sector's performance.\n\nFor manufacturing, which has had no increase in work permit holders over the past year and saw a 2.5 per cent jump in productivity in 2014, levies will be frozen at 2014 rates for another two years.\n\nConstruction, on the other hand, needs encouragement to \"hire and retain more productive, higher skilled R1 workers\". Its productivity fell 2.3 per cent in 2014, a second consecutive year of decline.\n\nHence, levies for the sector's basic skilled R2 workers will be raised in July 2016, and again in July 2017, while the man-year entitlement waiver levy for the more skilled R1 workers will be cut from S$750 to S$600 this July.\n\nMr Tharman said: \"We will continue to calibrate our foreign worker policies as informed by evidence on the pace of inflows, the quality of workers being employed, and the progress being made in raising productivity.\"\n\nThe government will also gradually phase out the three-year transition support package introduced in Budget 2013 to help businesses defray rising costs, instead of allowing it to expire altogether this year.\n\nThe PIC Bonus - a dollar-for-dollar matching cash bonus for qualifying PIC investments, up to a cap of S$15,000 over YA2013 to YA2015 - will be allowed to lapse. After all, it was intended as a transitional measure and has already helped to spur stronger take-up of the PIC scheme, which was extended to YA2018 last year, Mr Tharman said. Companies will also still be able to benefit from the PIC+ scheme, a higher level of support to benefit SMEs, introduced at Budget 2014.\n\nBut the other two elements of the transition Support Package - the Wage Credit Scheme and the corporate income tax rebate - will be extended till 2017, albeit at lower support levels, to give businesses more time to restructure and adjust to higher business costs.\n\nThe incentives and grants provided to businesses to help them upgrade and innovate exceed the additional foreign worker levies collected from them since tightening began in 2010, Mr Tharman said.\n\n\"Most of this support is targeted at our SMEs. This year alone, the amount that we will flow back to our SMEs is expected to be more than 11/2 times the additional foreign worker levies that they will pay,\" he said.\n\nVictor Mills, chief executive of SICC, who expected a review of the foreign manpower curbs only after the previously announced ones were rolled out in July, said: \"Looks like they've done it early and said that they'll hold back but not change direction, which is a consistent position that we respect. And this restructuring is to wean businesses off a 30-year addiction to cheap foreign labour; force businesses to focus on innovation and do more with less.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We must ensure a society that is fair and just, where everyone has a chance to move up and do well regardless of where they start. And we must complement a culture of personal effort and responsibility with stronger collective responsibility, especially for our elderly,\" he said.\n\nHere are the key initiatives Mr Tharman announced, under four major areas of change:\n\n1. Continued economic restructuring, and promoting the innovation and internationalisation of businesses\n\na) Slower pace of foreign worker tightening: This year's round of announced\n\nlevy hikes for S-pass and work permit holders\n\nin every sector will be deferred.

Investing in \"skills of the future\" and empowering every individual to learn and develop throughout life. \"We must become a meritocracy of skills, not a hierarchy of grades earned early in life\", said Mr Tharman.\n\na)\n\nSkillsFuture Credit account for Singaporeans\n\nto tap on for work-skills related courses. This will have an\n\ninitial credit of S$500\n\n, for all Singaporeans those aged 25 and above, with regular top-ups expected in future.\n\nb) SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme to match polytechnic and ITE graduates with employers for on-the-job training and mentorship, and provide funding support for both trainees and employers.\n\nc) For mid-career Singaporeans, higher education and training subsidies of at least 90 per cent for MOE and WDA courses, for those aged 40 and above.\n\nd) Deepening skills and encouraging mastery with SkillsFuture Study Awards, SkillsFuture Fellowships and the SkillsFuture Leadership Development Initiative.\n\ne) Stronger industry collaboration that will involve training institutions, unions, trade associations and employers.

It is a deal with many conditions attached, so it hasn't been all bids for the euro,\" said Shinichiro Kadota, chief Japan forex strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\n\nAt the end of April, the troika will decide if Athens has followed through with the reforms and will determine if it gets its last aid tranche.\n\nHeadlines from Greece's debt struggles may continue to keep the currency market wary, but investors will also be attempting to gauge dollar-centric factors this week.\n\nMarket players will be watching Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's testimony before the US Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday for any hints about when the US central bank may begin raising rates.\n\nMs Yellen's comments will draw extra attention after minutes from the Fed's January meeting released last week were seen as more dovish than expected and dampened expectations for an early interest rate hike.\n\nThe dollar was steady at 119.07 yen after bouncing from a low of 118.30 on Friday, helped by a rise in US debt yields after the Greek bailout agreement.\n\nThe dollar index edged up 0.1 per cent to 94.324.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

It did not say whether this would be with immediate effect.\n\nHigh termination fees benefit the larger network operators, which have a bigger market share and fewer calls going \"off-net\"to other providers.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia the former monopoly Saudi Telecom Co (STC) and Etihad Etisalat (Mobily) between them have 83 per cent of the kingom's mobile subscribers, according to Zain, owner of 37 per cent of Zain Saudi. \"This decision is a huge win for Zain Saudi and should pose a catalyst for the shares,\" Riyad Capital said in a note. \"In practical terms, this means STC cannot charge Zain Saudi more than 15 halalas per minute when a Zain KSA mobile customer calls (an) STC mobile number. The idea is that cost savings from lower network charges will be passed onto the end customer.\" Smaller operators spend relatively more on termination fees, a situation that has contributed to loss-making Zain Saudi's struggles since launching operations in 2008.\n\nZain Saudi, which did not respond immediately to requests for comment, has been lobbying the CITC to have the charges reduced, arguing it is unfairly penalised with higher network charges due to its smaller customer base. \"The likelihood of a Zain Saudi customer making an off-net call is substantially higher than both Mobily and STC - this limits Zain Saudi's pricing power for its customer base, while the competitors can enjoy greater flexibility,\" Riyad Capital added. \"Zain Saudi's voice proposition will now look more appealing as customers can expect lower cost.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

But if oil prices remain low, more policy makers could start to openly question the central bank's policy framework.\n\nThe BOJ kept monetary policy steady at the January meeting and expanded a programme aimed at encouraging banks to boost lending.\n\nIn a quarterly review of its long-term forecasts in January, the BOJ cut its core consumer inflation projection to 1.0 per cent for fiscal 2015 from an estimate 1.7 per cent issued three months ago, largely due to the global oil price slump.\n\nThe BOJ is buying government debt and risk assets to push inflation to 2 per cent as it aims to vanquish years of grinding deflation and spark sustainable growth.\n\nMany economists view the BOJ's fiscal 2015 timeline for hitting its inflation goal as too ambitious.\n\nMembers of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet have said they are willing to tolerate a short-term slowdown in inflation because oil prices have collapsed by about half since the middle of last year.\n\nIn December consumer prices excluding food, energy and the impact of a sales tax hike last year rose an annual 0.1 per cent, a worrying sign that underlying demand is not strong.\n\nWhen the BOJ updated its economic forecasts last month it said it expects oil prices to rise to around US$70 per barrel by the end of fiscal 2016, but some economists say this may be overly optimistic.\n\nAt a subsequent meeting last week, the BOJ remained steadfast in its view that the economy will continue to recover moderately and indicated it does not see the need to ease further in the near future.\n\nHowever, if inflation fails to accelerate the central bank could be forced to reconsider its policy options later this year.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nEU official says bloc to explore Asia pacts as US tariffs loom\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:02 PM", "images": []}

During our annual survey for Singapore-based clients in January, businesses were mildly optimistic but cautious about business prospects this year. Concerns about the domestic economy also rose significantly this year compared to previous years. The majority were focused on sustaining business revenue growth this year.\"\n\n\"There are some changes from prior Budgets to tailor to current trends. SkillsFuture is intended to deepen and build more skills to accommodate a changing economy. The freeze in foreign workers' levy is meant to assist with business costs in the short-term. The changes to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) are meant to ensure retirement adequacy for Singaporean workers. The Silver Support is aimed at a more inclusive society.\"\n\n\"For individuals, the enhancement to GST vouchers also aim for more inclusive growth and the high cost of living. There are also measures to help the middle class through indirect taxes.\"\n\n\"To address the need for higher development and operating expenditure and along the themes of inclusive growth, the government has proposed an increase of income taxes for top earners.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nSingapore Budget 2015: Key policy measures\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
