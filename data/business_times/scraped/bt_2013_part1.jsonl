Individuals sold a net 3.1 trillion won of shares last month, the most in nine months, while trading of Kospi index stocks fell to a six-year low, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe retreat by those investors, who accounted for about 45 per cent of the nation's equity trading last month, threatens to limit gains in the Kospi, which has rallied 8 per cent since the end of June, according to Barclays plc and Hanwha Investment & Securities Co. Consumer confidence sank to a five-month low last month, even after a rebound in exports fuelled the fastest economic growth in two years last quarter.\n\n\"Local participation is quite low,\" Chanik Park, the Seoul-based head of Korea equity research at Barclays, said last Tuesday. \"Consumer sentiment and investor sentiment at this moment is not that positive.\"\n\nThe Kospi has climbed 4.4 per cent last month to 2,011.80, bringing its gain this year to 0.7 per cent. The won strengthened 3.4 per cent to 1,073.65 last month, while the cost of protecting the nation's sovereign debt against non-payment using credit default swaps fell 10 basis points to 76, according to CMA. The yield on the nation's five-year government bonds fell five basis points to 3.06 per cent last week.\n\nForeign investors have fuelled the Kospi's rally as data showed the economy expanded 1.1 per cent in the three months through June and exports jumped at a quicker-than-estimated 7.7 per cent rate in August.\n\nInternational money managers ploughed a net US$7 billion into South Korean shares last month, the most on record, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. The Kospi is valued at 1.06 times net assets, a 47 per cent discount to the MSCI All-Country World Index.\n\n\"Local retail investors are likely to return to the equity market by the end of this year when the economic uncertainties are cleared and this year's corporate profit figures are released,\" Cho Seong Joon, a Seoul-based strategist at NH Investment & Securities Co, said last Friday.\n\nFor now, sales by individual investors are accelerating. Outflows last month were more than twice as large as the 1.4 trillion won of withdrawals during the first eight months of the year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The 100-day average value traded of Kospi shares declined to 4.03 trillion won last Friday, the lowest level since June 2007.\n\n\"Individual investors will be the group that could drive up trading volumes but this won't be easy,\" Kang Hyun Cheol, a strategist at Woori Investment & Securities Co, said in Seoul last Wednesday.\n\nIndividuals have low confidence and are also reluctant to buy as Kospi has struggled to pass a resistance level at 2,050, Mr Kang said. The benchmark gauge has approached that level at least six times during the past two years before resuming declines, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nFinance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said last Wednesday that household spending is weak due to high levels of debt. Consumer confidence fell to the lowest level since April this month, according to the Bank of Korea. Home loans and credit extended to households increased 1.8 per cent in the second quarter to a record 980 trillion won, the monetary authority said on Aug 22.\n\nLee Won Tae plans to start selling his 40 million won of equity investments to repay debt before interest rates rise. The 42-year-old senior manager at CJ Systems Co, an information technology service provider, took out a 200 million won mortgage four years ago to buy a three-room apartment in Mokdong, an eastern Seoul neighbourhood known for its cram schools.\n\nSouth Korea's central bank, which kept its benchmark interest rate at 2.5 per cent for a fourth straight month on Sept 12, will probably increase it to 3 per cent by the end of 2014, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\n\"I'm eyeing a good time to exit,\" said Mr Lee, who earns about 100 million won a year and has two elementary school children. \"I can barely support my family as I want my wife to take care of kids at home. Our budget will become much tighter as the kids grow.\"\n\nYounger professionals are also exiting the stock market as rental costs rise. Kookmin Bank's index of lump-sum deposits used to pay rent in in Seoul, known as Jeonse, climbed to a record 102.5 in August, the highest level since the lender began tracking the data in 1986.\n\nThe average Jeonse rent for Seoul apartments has increased for 12 straight months to 280 million won as at August, according to the Korea Appraisal Board. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

Traditional banks are now playing the role of arrangers.\"\n\nFrench banks BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, Natixis and other European lenders said last year they would cut exposure to risky and dollar-denominated assets such as shipping and aircraft financing to meet tougher capital rules and shore up reserves.\n\nThey have given way to Asian banks such as Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc, South Korean and Chinese banks, as well as Middle Eastern lenders such as National Bank of Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\n\"We see South-east Asian banks developing expertise and there's lot of interest from Japan and South Korea gaining an interest in the sector,\" said Mr Collet. \"They clearly want to grow outside of their region.\"\n\nAsian giants such as Singapore Airlines, AirAsia, All Nippon Airways and Lion Air are among companies that have ordered planes worth billion of dollars to support growing passenger numbers.\n\nAirbus has recently raised its 20-year jet demand forecast, saying the world needed to double its fleet to meet demand. The planemaker says Middle East plane orders account for 8 per cent of its total backlog as at end-August.\n\nEmirates, which has the world's largest fleet of the A380 superjumbos, used a mixed bag of funding including bonds, operating leases, US export credit facilities and financing leases to raise US$5.5 billion in the current financial year.\n\n\"The challenge for airlines would be to diversify funding sources as growth comes back to the aviation industry,\" said Mr Collet.\n\nCapital markets will also have a bigger role to play in aircraft financing - it will account for about 14 per cent of total jet financing in 2013, up from 10 per cent last year, Boeing said in an annual forecast in December.\n\nPension funds and insurance companies, which have traditionally stayed clear of aircraft finance, are also looking at the sector, attracted by reasonable stability and the long-term nature of the financing, said Mr Collet. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

DTZ's research showed that average gross rents for first and upper-storey conventional industrial space stayed at $2.15 per square foot per month (psf pm) and $1.75 psf pm respectively.\n\nFor hi-tech and business park developments, rents remained at $3.10 psf pm and $4.70 psf pm.\n\nAs for capital values, average resale prices for first-storey and upper-storey freehold conventional industrial space in Q3 were unchanged from the previous quarter, at $627 psf and $470 psf respectively.\n\nMs Lee said that the various government measures mean industrial property prices should \"stabilise going forward\", which will benefit genuine end-users who want to buy their own property to avoid rental fluctuations.\n\nMany industrialists tend to prefer larger, single-user facilities that are more flexible for production layout, DTZ said. URA data shows that the net supply of single-user factories in the first half of 2013, at 4.3 million sq ft, is already 23 per cent higher than the entire supply last year.\n\nThere is also a trend of tie-ups between specialised firms and property players for purpose-built industrial space, DTZ said.\n\nBut the bulk of private industrial space to be completed next year will be warehouses and multiple-user factories, with a large proportion being strata-titled developments.\n\nBetween the second half of this year and 2014, some 64 per cent of a huge pipeline of 46 million sq ft of private industrial space expected to be ready by 2016 will come on stream.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The airline demanded Boeing fix the state-of-the-art jet, saying it needs repairs after less than 30 days in service.\n\nInvestment analysts say the glitch involving a hydraulic pump is minor and isolated, and it is unlikely to affect Boeing's stock price, which is towering at record levels. But Norwegian Air's vocal airing of its complaints is another black eye for the troubled Dreamliner. It follows a string of electrical and other safety problems that included battery meltdowns so severe they prompted regulators to ban the long-haul jetliner from flight for more than three months this year.\n\nOn Sunday, Polish airline LOT 787 flying from Toronto to Warsaw was forced to land at Iceland's Keflavik airport after problems with its air system.\n\nNorwegian Air's formal request on Saturday for Boeing to take charge of fixing the plane throws a spotlight on an often overlooked facet of the 787's performance: reliability. And it shows how quickly a plane that cannot fly can hit a carrier's bottom line.\n\nLike other airlines with small long-haul fleets, Norwegian Air does not have a spare plane it can use if a jet breaks down. The carrier said it had to rent planes and cancel tickets when it could not use its 787s, and the company's stock has fallen 6 per cent since a peak earlier this month, hit by a string of 787 problems and concerns about its broader business.\n\n\"Reliability is a big deal, especially for low-cost carriers such as Norwegian,\" said Russell Solomon, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service in New York.\n\nBut since the problem appeared to be a \"one-off\" and part of the normal growing pains for a new plane, he added, it probably would not unsettle Boeing investors.\n\nWhen Norwegian Air began long-haul operations this year, it aimed to capitalise on the Dreamliner's lower operating cost and the jet's promised 20 per cent savings on fuel burn.\n\nBut the first two Dreamliners, delivered recently and part of a planned fleet of eight, broke down more than half a dozen times in September, forcing Norwegian Air to lease back-up planes on short notice or cancel flights.\n\nNorwegian Air grounded its 787s several times, citing problems with brakes, hydraulic pumps and power. On Sept 23, the carrier said one Dreamliner was beset with problems in the oxygen supply to the cockpit. A problem with a valve on the airline's second 787 was repaired around the same time, but only after delaying a flight from Oslo to New York.\n\nBoeing said the repairs of the latest problem, to be carried out in Stockholm where the aircraft is parked, would take a matter of days. That is much better than with the 787's volatile battery system, which grounded the worldwide fleet of Dreamliners from January to April.\n\n\"Boeing has identified a number of specific improvements to address component reliability,\" the planemaker said.\n\nThe grounded planes have prompted Norwegian Air to voice its dissatisfaction with the aircraft. \"The aircraft's reliability is simply not acceptable,\" the airline said on Saturday. \"Our passengers cannot live with this kind of performance.\"\n\nSaturday's announcement capped a tough week for Boeing in which Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner flew to Oslo to face Norwegian Air bosses over the earlier 787 mishaps.\n\nLike Norwegian Air, state-owned LOT has had a list of problems with its Dreamliners, including last week delaying flights after check-ups showed two planes lacked gas filters.\n\nLOT also said last week Boeing had until the end of the year to agree on compensation for the three-month grounding of the 787 because of the battery issues, or it would take the matter to court. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The Land Transport Authority, which has many frontline enforcement officers in its ranks, is just one example.\n\nSeveral other agencies have also imposed block leave as a fraud prevention and deterrence measure, said PSD.\n\nPSD also announced that, from today onwards, all public officers will need to declare within seven days whenever they visit the two local casinos - at Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and Resorts World Sentosa - more than four times a month, or if they purchase the $2,000 annual entry levy.\n\nFor certain groups of officers, the PSD said that even tighter rules will apply to them.\n\nThose who are in more vulnerable positions where they could be suborned or exploited, or whose misconduct will have \"significant reputational risk\" to the public service, will have to declare every visit within seven calendar days.\n\nOfficers who enforce operations in the two casinos, or regulate the activities of or negotiate business arrangements with the casino operators will also be banned from visiting the casinos, unless they are doing so as part of their official duties.\n\nPSD said it is now working with the various agencies on which officers need to be designated for the stricter casino visit rules.\n\nIn July this year, Head of Civil Service Peter Ong announced in a letter to all public servants that PSD would review the rules regarding visits to casinos here.\n\nThe review followed a slew of high-profile cases of misconduct by several senior public servants, such as the one involving a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau officer who was charged for misappropriating $1.7 million and gambling a large sum of that away at the MBS casino.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

House Republicans want to delay US President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare restructuring laws for a year and make other changes to the health laws. The president and the Democrats, meanwhile, have promised not to let that happen.\n\nThe consequences for failing to agree will invariably hit Americans hard. As things stand, if lawmakers blow the Monday midnight deadline in Washington (Tuesday noon, Singapore time), as many as 800,000 federal workers will be forced off their jobs without pay. Crucially, though, essential services such as border patrols, meat inspectors and air traffic control will continue, as well as Social Security and Medicare benefits.\n\nMr Obama hit the nail right on the head when he warned that a shutdown of the US government would risk destabilising the world economy. His message to Congress was a simple one: \"Do not shut down the government. Do not shut down the economy. Pass a budget on time. Pay our bills on time.\"\n\nSome economists have predicted that a shutdown could reduce fourth-quarter economic growth by up to 1.4 percentage points depending on how long it lasts. The biggest effect would come from the output lost from furloughed workers. The mounting concern over the fiscal negotiations sent the dollar to a seven-and-a-half month low last week, while the cost of insuring against a US debt default has soared to its highest levels since May this year.\n\nMore worryingly, the gridlock over the budget could be just a prelude to an even more serious showdown expected later this month over the government debt ceiling. Republicans have said that they will refuse to lift the ceiling unless the healthcare law - known as Obamacare - is reigned back, which could mean the US Treasury would be forced to default on its mounting debt payments.\n\nYet, it's difficult to see which side - Republican or Democrat - will blink first at this point, with neither wanting to be the one to cast the final vote that would lead to a shutdown. Some recent surveys show that the American public is already deeply unhappy with its leaders in Congress, and rightly so. The man on the street is tired of such political one-upmanship and opposed to a prolonged shutdown that would impact their daily lives.\n\nThe truth is, even if lawmakers somehow wriggle their way out of a shutdown or a default, some damage has already been done. With so much uncertainty about the US economy, there's little hope that businesses, both local and foreign, will want to invest and hire there anytime soon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If the policy is painful but necessary, such as the tightening of foreign worker inflows for businesses, find ways to mitigate the downsides, communicate our intent and hold our ground on the core of the policies,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nThe key to getting things right is to implement policies well and translate them into specific programmes. Public-service leaders have to monitor results and trends in order to know when a change to the government's approach is necessary, he added.\n\nAlso important is for the public service to put forth a \"seamless and coherent organisation\" to the people. Mr Lee acknowledged that some members of the public have found it frustrating to have to deal with multiple agencies and conflicting policies; instances such as these would erode their trust in the public service over time.\n\nAnother way to maintain public trust is to uphold a high standard of integrity, which he said has been been \"painstakingly\" built up over many years.\n\nThat Singapore has a public service of integrity means businesses compete fairly instead of relying on improper influence, and public officers have the discretion and authority to exercise their judgment and knowledge when managing multi-million-dollar projects.\n\nSingaporeans also know that the doors are open for them in life if they work hard, regardless of their family background or personal connections, said the prime minister.\n\nHe noted that there has been a string of high-profile corruption cases involving public officers, including those at senior levels, in the past year, and that the public sector accounts for about a fifth of all corruption cases here.\n\nThe public sector must strengthen its systems to uphold its reputation for integrity and incorruptibility, and dispel any doubts that standards have dropped, he said.\n\nHe added that every officer, and the public service as a whole, should take pride in being clean and incorrupt. He called on all public-sector leaders to take the lead in putting in place the right systems, enforce rules fairly and firmly and deal with mistakes decisively - tasks they should not delegate or leave to their subordinates.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such an outcome will suck money out of the economy and spread anxiety among consumers and businesses in a way that is likely to hold back economic activity.\n\nAnd a default on the federal debt, which may occur within 30 days without congressional action, would be much worse, economists say. Failing to raise the debt ceiling would require the government to cut spending by about a third, potentially forcing delays in Social Security cheques, military pay and payments to doctors.\n\nThere are other risks, too. On Oct 17, the Treasury is scheduled to ask investors for US$120 billion in loans. But if investors grow nervous about whether the United States will be able to pay them back, they are likely to demand higher interest rates, which would cause rates to spike throughout the financial system, leading to more expensive mortgages, auto loans and credit card bills. Doubt could grow about the safety of parking money in US bonds.\n\n\"It's corrosive on the economy,\" said Mark Zandi at Moody's Analytics. A lengthy shutdown followed by a default would be \"the nightmare of the recession all over again\". Even if lawmakers find a way out of a shutdown or a default, this crisis is likely to have negative effects on the economy. With so much uncertainty in Washington, economists say that businesses, flush with cash, have been reluctant to invest and hire.\n\nBusiness interest groups, usually aligned with the Republicans, have urged the party to abandon their demand for policy concessions, such as delaying President Barack Obama's healthcare law, in exchange for funding the government and raising the debt limit.\n\nMuch of the government will close today without action by Congress. If the shutdown lasts more than a few days, it would affect the economy in numerous ways.\n\nFor example, the closure of national parks and museums may hurt hotels, restaurants and the people who work for them. The process of getting approval for a home loan could take much more time, slowing the housing recovery.\n\nEconomists estimate that the cumulative effect of a prolonged shutdown could trim economic growth in the final three months of the year by up to 1.4 percentage points. Under that scenario, the economy would hardly expand at all.\n\nBut economists are far more concerned about a potential default on the federal debt. The Treasury has warned that it will have only about US$30 billion in cash on hand by the middle of this month, and estimates are that it will run out of money by the end of the month. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Such was the case with the last missive that appeared in print \"Scrutinise financial investment seminars too\" on Sept 24 where reader Vincent Khoo makes a strong case for some form of regulation to be introduced to govern the dozens of \"free\" and paid investment seminars that are regularly advertised in the print and Internet media, particularly those that claim massive (sometimes guaranteed) profits in a short space of time.\n\nThe reasoning is that if financial advisers have to be licensed under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA) and are strictly limited in what they can say or sell to their clients, then so should those who conduct these \"get rich quick\" courses and seminars on trading commodities, property, stocks, currencies etc.\n\nGranted, speakers at these events do not have a lasting relationship with the audience, at least not of the form that could be construed as being fiduciary, but as Mr Khoo correctly pointed out, a gullible public which pays thousands to attend and then stand to lose thousands after attendance because they think that can surely get rich should still be protected.\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The development, which was launched the previous weekend, saw 410 of the 505 units released for sale snapped up on the first day. The most popular units were the one-bedroom and two-bedroom units; the average price of a one-bedroom unit was $750,000, while a two-bedroom unit averaged $933,000.\n\nThe TDSR framework, along with the other property cooling measures, has also shifted interest to the non-central region, given the lower price quantum, said Nicholas Mak, executive director, research and consultancy at SLP International.\n\nThe SPRI for Non-Central Region (excluding small units) rose one per cent, following a 0.4 per cent gain in July.\n\nConversely, the SPRI for Central Region (excluding small units) slipped 1.1 per cent, reversing a 0.4 per cent gain in July. Central Region is defined as districts 1-4 (including the financial district and Sentosa Cove) and the traditional prime districts 9,10 and 11.\n\nThe Overall SRPI was up 0.1 per cent in August, after gaining 0.4 per cent in July.\n\nIt is worth noting that overall prices have stayed relatively flat despite a sharp reduction in transaction volumes, said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore Research at DTZ.\n\nBased on URA caveats, resale transactions of non-landed private homes fell 27 per cent month-on-month to 388 units in August from 529 units in July. This was the second-lowest monthly resale transaction volume since the beginning of the year; the lowest was in February, after the higher Additional Buyer's Stamp Duties (ABSD) and tighter financing restrictions were introduced.\n\n\"Despite the lower transaction volume, resale prices have generally held up as individual sellers in the secondary market have limited incentive to sell their properties unless they receive a premium as their replacement cost is now higher in lieu of the higher ABSD, especially if they are multiple property owners,\" said Ms Lee.\n\nMoving forward, Chesterton Singapore's Mr Han said he expects prices in the Central area to ease further, although this will likely be compensated by a slight increase in prices in the suburban areas.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They came up with the solar-powered family car.\n\nUntil then, solar-powered vehicles were mostly built for speed rather than comfort, with a solar panelled wing atop a small and cramped cabin. So the Solar Team Eindhoven came up with Stella. It has a carbon fibre body and a long sloping roof of solar panels. In the low cabin, there are four individual seats and a tunnel running through the centre filled with 65 kg of lithium-ion battery cells.\n\n\"The Netherlands is not famous for sunshine but rain and wind,\" said the Dutch ambassador to Singapore, Jacques Werner, at an event at the Nanyang Polytechnic yesterday to introduce Stella.\n\nYet Stella was able to soak up enough sunlight to travel 70 km, or nearly twice as much as the Dutch person's average daily commute of 38 km.\n\nThat is because it works in cloudy conditions too. The solar panels do not need to catch direct sunlight; all it requires is enough diffused light.\n\nStella can also be fully recharged by plugging it into a household socket for six to eight hours.\n\nOn a full charge, it has a range of 450 km. If it is travelling in bright sunshine, it can go almost twice as far. Two in-wheel motors power the front wheels and the 380 kg car can carry four people weighing 80 kg each.\n\nDuring the six-day, 3,000 km race across the Australian outback last month, Stella clocked an average speed of 67 kilometres an hour with three people on board.\n\nStella was built by 22 students over one year with the help of various sponsors, one of which is NXP Semiconductors. NXP also provided car-to-car communications to transfer data from Stella to the mission control car in order to optimise car performance and ensure smooth running under all road conditions.\n\n\"Stella's performance during the World Solar Challenge 2013 demonstrated the feasibility and appeal of solar-powered cars, and can help the automotive industry define a new category of cars for the near future,\" said Karsten Penno, NXP's regional sales and marketing director.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Compared with a year earlier, however, total market cap was up 7 per cent.\n\nSmaller companies bore the brunt of any decline. The FTSE ST Small Cap Index fell 5.9 per cent during the month to 537.84 yesterday. In contrast, the large cap-dominated Straits Times Index (STI) gained 1.4 per cent to close at 3,210.67 over the same period.\n\nThe source of October's penny pounding can be traced to just three companies which saw sudden price collapses on Oct 4, triggering a series of rare market intervention measures by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and setting off widespread selling among other penny counters.\n\nBlumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corp, in which regulators are reviewing the trading of their shares, saw $10.4 billion, or about 94 per cent, of their combined market value wiped out during the month. That was more than the $3.9 billion month-on-month decline in total market value.\n\nThose three stocks are penny counters now, but one month ago they were members of the billion-dollar club, which now has three fewer members at 112.\n\nMr Wong reckoned that the penny sell-down may actually present an opportunity for bargain hunting.\n\n\"There's a bit of indiscriminate selling,\" he said. \"So investors should really hunker down and look for good-quality companies, and you shouldn't have to wait too long for quick gains in some of them.\"\n\nOverall, Mr Wong thought that macroeconomic conditions also appear to be supportive of stronger equity markets.\n\n\"If you look at China, Europe, things are really, really not as bad as what they thought,\" he said.\n\nDMG prefers the offshore marine, discretionary consumer and construction sectors, and is neutral on property, technology manufacturers and consumer staples.\n\nVoyage Research analyst Ng Kian Teck, however, was not as certain that Singapore's penny stocks will recover that quickly, citing a significant amount of uncertainty and wariness still in the market about how SGX determines when to intervene.\n\n\"Investors are still waiting,\" Mr Ng said. \"They want to hear more from SGX ... They want to know what SGX considers fair, orderly and transparent, and that question mark will keep people from the market.\"\n\nNevertheless, Voyage expects the blue chips to sail along smoothly, with the STI inching higher to test 3,260. For the rest of the year, it also expects a quieter market with the holidays approaching.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the struggles of Chinese author Jung Chang and her British husband Jon Halliday did not end when they published Mao: The Unknown Story (2005).\n\nThe book attracted heavy criticism from the Chinese because it did not recount the \"official\" version of Mao's life story. It showed Mao in less than favourable light - in fact, as a tyrannical leader concerned only with gaining power for himself.\n\n\"After the Mao book was published, there was a book titled Was Mao Really A Monster? published in response to ours. It collected various book reviews attacking us for showing Mao to be a monster, even though we didn't actually use the word. But what can I do? I'm not going to reply to these ill-informed people who are just making assertions,\" Chang says.\n\nJust as her family's biography, Wild Swans (1991) was banned in mainland China, so was Mao: The Unknown Story. However, both books have been translated into over 40 languages and sold more than 15 million copies around the world.\n\nNotably, none of her critics have been able to point out a single factual error in her books, which is why Chang continues to dismiss what they say.\n\nShe explains that her process of ensuring accuracy involves tediously checking and cross-checking facts in original documents in historical archives without relying on secondary sources.\n\n\"Still, I don't like attacks,\" she says over the phone from her home in London. \"I actually don't relish controversy; I'm merely interested in what I'm interested in, and that's to say something new that other people haven't said.\"\n\nChang reveals that she is in the middle of translating her most recently released book from English to Chinese - another controversial biography that shows the positive side of the Empress Dowager Cixi, who has always been portrayed as a villain in Chinese history.\n\nNext Monday at the Singapore Writers Festival, Chang will discuss her works during her lecture, Utopia, Mao and The Empress Dowager Cixi.\n\n\"Mao and the Empress Dowager are both riveting subjects. I think the process of decision-making and policy-making is very interesting. I like to understand how they made decisions that concerned a quarter of the world's population,\" says Chang.\n\nHer interest in the Empress Dowager was piqued when she was carrying out the research for Wild Swans. She learnt that her grandmother was once a victim of China's foot-binding practices, which were abolished by the Empress Dowager at the beginning of the 20th century, and not by the Communist Party.\n\nShe says, with a hint of pride: \"I get tremendous satisfaction debunking myths and exposing lies. I want to do historical detective work . . . so it's great fun writing about controversial people. I don't want to write about someone whom everybody has been saying the same thing about.

When Korean artist Haegue Yang visited Little India for the first time and saw the rich variety of ingredients, she decided to turn them into art.\n\nGanthoda powder, dry mango powder, da huang powder and even Nigella powder - no relation to Nigella Lawson - were among the unusual looking and sounding spices that provided Yang with the starting point for her artist residency at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI).\n\nThe STPI exhibition features frames of \"spice moons\" - circles of spices whose rough textures and earthy hues evoke your sense of sight, smell, taste and touch, even though the circles are encased in their glass frames.\n\nYang, who represented South Korea at the Venice Biennale in 2009, says that she's interested in \"humble, everyday objects, like food and spices\".\n\n\"They are so much a part of our lives that we forget what they reveal about our country's history, culture and tradition. As an artist, I want to turn the commonplace into something sublime.\"\n\nHer interest in Singapore's food and spices reflects a larger concern with issues of migration, diaspora, assimilation and displacement.\n\nYang migrated to Germany in 1994 to further her studies after graduating from Seoul National University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. She has been based there ever since and creates some of her most captivating large-scale installations in her second home.\n\nFor her residency in Singapore, she departed from making threedimensional installations to create two-dimensional art using paper. Even so, the rough textures of the moon spices and the beautifully textured paper works that were created by pressing food items onto paper pulp betray her predilections.\n\nOther works such as a series of squares bearing the names of spices written using the very spice and in the font type found on the spice packaging illustrate Yang's sense of humour.\n\nThere is even, mischievously enough, a series of sheets featuring the various brands of instant noodles found here.\n\nYang says, with a twinkle in her eye: \"I've titled the exhibition Honesty Printed on Modesty because there is a sense of modesty and intimacy in working with paper . . . But that said, I do think I'm communicating intimately with the audience even when I'm making a large-scale installation.\n\n\"After all, what is art but an attempt to make yourself vulnerable and reach out to someone in an intimate way?\"\n\nHaegue Yang's exhibition is on at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute, 41 Robertson Quay, until Nov 23, from 10am to 6pm (Tuesdays to Saturdays). Open on Mondays by appointment only and closed on Sundays. Admission is free.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fact that the part in question - The Phantom of the Opera - is arguably the most famous character in Broadway history makes Little's achievement all the more remarkable.\n\n\"I cherish it,\" says Little, 49, about the defining role of his career. \"I'm no longer a spring chicken and I'll eventually come to the end of doing leading man-type characters.\"\n\nThe Phantom is special to Little for many reasons, but especially because it helps people - himself included - to address their insecurities.\n\n\"We all have insecurities - mine is dyslexia - and the character of the Phantom gives hope,\" says Little in a recent telephone interview. \"The Phantom has made them not feel alone, and unlike any other show, it is therapy for so many people.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I cried when, at age 24, I saw Michael Crawford (the original Phantom) perform. I thought of my dyslexia - here's a musical character that is letting me go to a place I've never gone to before.\"\n\nIt eventually led to a starring role - one that he has performed numerous times before on Broadway and also as a member of productions that have toured the world, including Singapore and other parts of Asia. This weekend, Little will be the headline performer in The Phantom Unmasked, a musical programme at Marina Bay Sands that will include songs from many Broadway shows.\n\n\"It's a musical theatre concert but it won't just be Phantom, it will be Brad Little - I hope the audience will embrace that side of me and see the man behind the mask,\" he says.\n\nAlthough he is pretty nifty on his feet, he has never showcased his dancing skills. \"I stopped dancing because they were giving the lead to the guy that didn't dance so well.\"\n\n\"Phantom is a show that has everything, but it's also just a visual spectacle that transports you to a fantasyland,\" says Little, who was born in Redlands, California and grew up with the theatre as his playground - his father was a theatre professor and his mother taught the piano.\n\n\"I caught the theatre bug when I was very young and I did go through some rebellious teenage years when I wanted to become a basketball player - but my jump shot is not as good as my high note.\"\n\nLittle describes his singing voice as a high baritone. \"I have the warmth of a baritone along with the low tenor notes. \"When I was young I wanted to be Robert Goulet, until my voice teacher told me, 'You are no Robert Goulet - you can do more.'\"\n\nAmong many other roles, Little went on to play the leads in the Phantom, Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!\n\nLittle left California for New York when he was 19 and for most of the past 30 years, has been gainfully employed, doing what he loves. \"I was very fortunate to be an actor, and not waiting tables,\" he says. He tried out for some television and movie roles, but they never panned out.\n\nHe will continue to tour with the Phantom over the next 18 months but he is also spending a lot of time in South Korea, where he is planning to start a musical theatre school and a production team to put on Western musicals. \"Next to Japan, Korea is the most advanced in Asia in putting together their own musicals,\" says Little.\n\nRight now, the theatre scene there is stagnant and there is a lot to be desired in terms of quality, he says. He says that some of the productions he's seen in Asia are \"criminal and embarrassing - promising something to the audience that is not brought to the stage\". \"Audiences are being fooled by sloppiness in theatre and there's so much that's missing to take it to the next level. Don't just do choreography for movement's sake, there has to be a story as well - let's get back to the storytelling.\"\n\nThe Phantom Unmasked, featuring Brad Little with Shoshana Bean, is on at the Mastercard Theatres, Marina Bay Sands, tonight and tomorrow night. Tickets at $95-175. For more information, call 6688-8826 or go to\n\nwww.MarinaBaySands.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Perhaps nowhere is this better illustrated than in the Domaines of Burgundy where personal commitment by succeeding generations to the honour, reputation and integrity of the House ensures its continued success and fame. And who else better to entrust this critical responsibility to than the next generation.\n\nYou can certainly hire someone suitably qualified and with the required competence and ability to take over, but it will not be the same as having your children take over. The personal commitment of an employee, however dedicated, would not be the same. Thus, in recent years I have been increasingly received at the Domaines by the next generation, sons or daughters or both, whose fathers had received me when I first visited in 1986.\n\nAt Domaine Drouhin, it is now Veronique or Frederic, Robert Drouhin's children, at Domaine Louis Jadot by Andre Gagey's son Pierre-Henry, and at Domaine Faiveley by Francois Faiveley's son Erwan, who took over in 2007. (Francois himself is the sixth in line from the Francois Faiveley who founded the company in 1825.)\n\nFaiveley, like Jadot and Drouhin, is both Domaine and negoce, and like them it is the Domaine part that dominates and sets the reputation of the house.\n\nTheir vineyard holdings are extensive, 37.21 hectares of vineyards in the Cote d'Or and a further 82 ha in the Cote Chalonnaise. These vineyard holdings supply 80 per cent of their requirements, allowing them to personally oversee and guarantee the quality of every bottle they produce.\n\nThe harvest was more or less over when Erwan received us last month in the old home of the Domaine in Nuits-Saint-Georges. The Domaine's office in the small building on the rue de Tribourg belies its importance and gives no indication of the presence below ground of its extensive cellars. He led us further down the road to the new chais and cellars, where they were busy dealing with the just-completed harvest.\n\nErwan has great plans for Domaine Faiveley. This was obvious from his excitement as he outlined his plans for the expansion and enhancement of the building planned for completion within the next few years.\n\nThe next generation not only secures the Domaine's reputation but clearly aims higher! Which is as it should be. (I would also want that my children do better than I have!) I am already looking forward to visiting the extended and improved new home of Faiveley a few years down the road.\n\nTasting notes 2012 vintage\n\nGevrey-Chambertin 1er cru Cazetiers 2.05 ha\n\nGreat vibrant colour, very good ripeness, with great freshness and appeal. Good length. Excellent.\n\nNuits-Saint-Georges 1er cru Les Porets St-Georges 1.69 ha\n\nEven riper, very very ripe, packed with fruit. Good balance, acidity and length. Quite lush for a Nuits.\n\nClos Vougeot Grand Cru 1.29 ha\n\nVery dark red, with very attractive ripe pinot fruit bouquet; quite soft rounded body, very ripe fruit with good density, making it very approachable. At this stage seems to lack some finesse and balance, finishing a little short, but quite one of the best Clos Vougeot I have ever tasted, almost seductive. A must-buy!\n\nCharmes Chambertin Grand Cru\n\nGood ripe fruit and concentration, medium length.\n\nLatricieres-Chambertin 1.21 ha\n\nThis is very good. Has very good freshness and density of fruit, has power and concentration. Very impressive.\n\nMazis-Chambertin 1.3 ha\n\nVery different from the Latricieres. Very good, good complexity and length. Has more charm at this stage than the Latricieres.\n\nChambertin Clos de Beze 1.29 ha\n\nNot tasting well at this point. Good but has overlay of vanillin and coconut flavours. Not well integrated. Would be good to see this much later.\n\nChambertin Clos de Beze, Oeuvres Rodin\n\nThis is from a different plot which contains old (60 to 70-year old) vines. This is very, very special. Has good weight, great richness, well-balanced and very good complexity. Since 2010 vintage this wine has been bottled separately as Chambertin Clos de Beze \"Oeuvres Rodin\". Look out for this!\n\nCorton Clos des Corton Faiveley Grand Cru 3.02 ha (Monopole)\n\nThis is a very special plot in the Corton appellation.\n\nThis is very lovely and has everything - great ripeness, freshness, complexity, and very long finish. A great wine and a very, very lovely drink. Another wine to look out for.\n\nA very enjoyable tasting of a very successful vintage for Domaine Faiveley with some great wines. A vintage to look forward to, a must-buy vintage and to cellar!\n\nObservations\n\nI have been tasting (and drinking) Faiveley's wines from barrel to finished wine over the past 25 years, and have noted that they need at least 10 years to reach anywhere near maturity. Before that they tend to be so reserved that they appear even austere. They remain closed for a long time.\n\nA recent example well exemplified that. A 1989 Clos des Corton drank in March last year was still not quite ready - backward and reserved.\n\nA few years ago, in 2007, I was tasting in the cellars with Bernard Hervet, who had just joined the firm as managing director while Erwan was still away completing his studies. It struck me from the first few samples that there was a change in the style of the wines.\n\nThey were certainly not as austere and reserved as I remembered of past barrel tastings, and actually appeared to be more user-friendly. Subsequent tastings both in the Domaine's cellars and in the tasting of a new vintage held locally last year reinforced this impression.\n\nIt is a well-known observation that fine wines reflect the personality of the wine-maker.\n\nMy early tastings of Faiveley's wines took place while Francois Faiveley, Erwan's father, was in charge. Francois is by nature reserved. He relaxes and warms up when he gets to know you better. Erwan is the opposite - he is more sunny and more outgoing. He almost bubbles over in his enthusiasm and eagerness to \"get up and go\".\n\nIt is clear that he loves what he is doing, that he is 200 per cent at his job making wine, the best wine in his world! I look forward to further tastings with him.\n\nWhat emerges then is that Faiveley's wines from vintage 2008 onwards will be ready for drinking much earlier than earlier vintages. Great! Thank you, Erwan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There were more new construction jobs than Q2's 8,500, but fewer new services positions compared with the previous quarter's 22,700.\n\nManufacturing created 3,000 jobs in Q3, up from 2,300 jobs in Q2, marking the second quarter of improvement since the drop in Q1 (minus 1,200 jobs).\n\nRedundancies fell to 2,600 workers in Q3, down from 3,080 in Q2. This offset a doubling in the early release of contract workers to 500 - the highest level since Q3 2011. The fewer layoffs were due to manufacturing redundancies falling to 1,000 in Q3 from 1,630 in Q2.\n\nThe number of construction workers axed jumped from 250 to 300 over the two quarters, while workers laid off in the services sector rose from 1,200 to 1,300.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More recently, he argued for a teenager and his father when they sued Credit Suisse over trading losses, and he also represented the owner of Sijori Resort Club in a class-action suit filed by over 200 former members.\n\nThose who grew up in the 1980s will also remember him as the author of the wildly popular and best-selling The Teenage Textbook (which was later made into a movie and also a stage play) and its sequel, The Teenage Workbook.\n\nWhen asked why he would leave the reliable familiarity of one of the country's best law firms, Mr Tan admitted to The Business Times that it was not an easy decision: \"I spent 21 years in Drew & Napier. I joined as a pupil and I'm leaving as a partner. I learnt from the very best of senior counsel, Davinder Singh. It is a wrench to leave. I feel like a blushing bride leaving her home to join her new family.\"\n\nBut, he adds: \"I'm very attracted to Stamford. It's a Singapore law firm that hires international lawyers. It's boldly going toe to toe with foreign firms. It's showing other Singapore firms how to thrive in the new environment - where young Singapore lawyers now have the choice of working for Singapore law firms or international ones, and consumers have more choice in the market.\"\n\nThe attraction runs both ways. Stamford Law's senior director Mrs Lee says: \"Adrian will, in the first instance, strongly enhance our litigation capabilities.\n\n\"He is an able, unusual and outstanding lawyer. He represents a broad swathe of clients in their key corporate challenges and concerns. He has the ability to be powerful and persuasive for them, to be their strong advocate.\n\n\"But he is much more than a very good lawyer. He has numerous skills, talents and interests outside - as a writer, a humorist, a speaker. He also has a strong sense of service to the community which I admire (Mr Tan also serves on the Law Society of Singapore and is the pro-bono legal adviser to the Singapore Association for the Visually Handicapped),\" she adds.\n\nThe admiration is shared by others in the profession. Senior Counsel Thio Shen Yi, joint managing partner of TSMP Law Corporation, said: \"Stamford is one of the leading corporate practices in town. The addition of Adrian to the disputes practice should significantly increase their bench strength in this area. He's a capable guy and well respected by the fraternity.\"\n\nInfluential American lawyer Richard L Cassin, a best-selling author on international law, who now runs the FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) Blog, said: \"Adrian is smart, creative and humble - a great combination in a lawyer and a friend.\n\n\"The best lawyers are those who really want to help their clients. It's not a trait you can learn in school or measure in someone. But you know it when you see it. And Adrian has it,\" Mr Cassin added.\n\nNo encounter with Mr Tan is ever complete without his trademark wit. When asked what he believes he will bring to Stamford Law, starting from his first day on the job today, he quipped: \"Stamford is a force in corporate law. I am a litigator. The synergy is obvious.\"\n\nAnd the first task he'll tackle? \"For two decades, I've been standing up in court as a Drew & Napier litigator.

This enlarged Grand Banks' share capital base to 173 million shares and increased its market capitalisation to $38 million.\n\nPeter Poli, acting CEO of Grand Banks, told reporters at a press briefing yesterday that with the rights issue, the group was less worried about being able to meet the market capitalisation requirement of $40 million. \"We are almost there, (as) we have 173 million shares now. To get to $40 million, we need a price of about $0.23 a share. If we continue to improve performance, the market will recognise that and we will be fine.\" Grand Banks' share price closed at $0.225 at the end of trading yesterday, reflecting a gain of $0.005 or 2.27 per cent.\n\nThe greater challenge will be in achieving profitability, acknowledged Mr Poli, as he noted that, that in itself, will already have a positive impact on share price and thus, market capitalisation. In its first quarter results released earlier this week, the group reported a net loss of $579,000, 60 per cent down from a year ago. Loss from operations was 68 per cent lower at $405,000. Revenue climbed 46.3 per cent to $9.5 million. It also achieved operating cash flow of $0.6 million, against a negative $1.7 million last year.\n\nThe improvement in its first-quarter performance was due to the recovery in the US luxury boat market and response to its new models, as it noted that its business in Europe had been on the decline as the eurozone crisis had led to more prudent consumption there as well as governments there showing more uncertainty on tax regulations. Business in the Asia-Pacific was also on the rise with the region now accounting for about 20 per cent of the group's sales.\n\nThe group's order book stands at $14.2 million and this includes six new orders that it recently clinched, which are mostly due in the third quarter and will bring in about $7.5 million of cash flow. It is also due to deliver two more boats to dealers in Japan and Australia in the next 30 days, which will bring in about $2.5 million of cash flow.\n\nGrand Banks is hoping to increase sales by participating in the largest boat show globally at Fort Lauderdale over this weekend and the group admitted that it will also look into making acquisitions in the future to create a critical mass. While the utilisation rate of its sole yard in Johor Bahru has improved, leading to higher gross margins, it noted that it may sub-lease its excess capacity there should the opportunity arise.\n\nThe group has applied to the exchange for an extension of time beyond Dec 5 this year for it to meet the criteria for removal from the watch-list and is awaiting SGX's response.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's a company that seems to be in general wholly-incapable of generating free cash flow. It takes on more and more debt, and eventually, this debt has to be repaid.\"\n\nThe shortseller had late last year accused Olam of relying on accounting tricks to boost its bottomline, spending too much on poor quality assets, and said it valued Olam on a \"liquidation basis\".\n\nThe attack, the first of its kind in Singapore, caused Olam's shares to fall 20 per cent to a low of $1.395 at the height of the saga, and subsequently led to an overhaul of Olam's plans after a strategic review.\n\nThe firm said that it now aims to be free cashflow positive from the 2014 financial year onwards, a year earlier than its original target of FY2015, and has laid out plans to cut planned capital expenditure, monetise its balance sheet and divest certain assets.\n\nMr Block said of these: \"The company's saying the right things. The question is whether it actually does those things. It might have become slightly more selective, but you still see substantial cash burn in the company.\"\n\n\"Maybe they can finance their way out of it, however many more times, but there will come a day - it might be sooner, it might be later - when the market will not be open to this company.\"\n\nIn August, Olam reported a negative free cashflow of $316 million for the 2013 financial year, compared with negative $661 million a year before.\n\nOlam's net gearing now stands at 1.93 times, as compared to 2.20 times the previous quarter, and 1.81 times at the end of FY2012.\n\nWhen asked if Muddy Waters still retains a short position on the firm, Mr Block said it does not usually comment on its positions aside from the release of its reports.\n\nBut in a hint that Muddy Waters is still short on Olam, he added: \"Obviously we're usually used to winning within a shorter period of time. Fortunately for many of the names we've shorted in the past, we haven't really had to think to answer that question. Olam is different.\"\n\nShares for Olam, and Muddy Waters' target after that, US cellphone antenna operator American Towers, had not dropped as much as the shortseller's earlier targets, leading to talk that its influence has faded.\n\nIn a sign that its streak of lacklustre results is ending, however, Muddy Waters' latest report launched last Thursday against Chinese mobile services provider NQ Mobile led to its shares falling more than 60 per cent within an hour.\n\nTemasek moving into the ring to support Olam was a move that the shortseller had not foreseen, Mr Block admitted.\n\n\"We looked at it from a purely economic standpoint, which is that it is not an investible company, and maybe we ignored the political elements of this, the psychological element, the issues that were more systemic in Singapore that could interest a sovereign in a bailout,\" he said.\n\nTwo weeks after Muddy Waters spoke out against Olam, Temasek, then the firm's second-largest shareholder, threw its weight behind Olam by agreeing not just to take up its pro-rata entitlement of Olam's US$1.25 billion bonds-cum-warrants rights issue, but also sub-underwrite it. The issue was eventually 1.1 times subscribed.\n\nTemasek has also since then progressively increased its ownership of Olam, from an initial 16.3 per cent before the Muddy Waters attack to 24.07 per cent now.\n\nIn Mr Block's view, Temasek had stepped in because of the wider implications that an Olam collapse would have posed to the commodity-trading industry in Singapore.\n\n\"If Olam had failed, what would the banks have done with the other commodity houses that are borrowing in Singapore?\" he said. \"It's reasonable to assume that if the banks had to write off losses to Olam, you could have a real funding freeze for the commodity trading industry in Singapore. \"\n\nTemasek's spokesman Stephen Forshaw said the Singapore investment company's reason for investing in Olam remained the same: \"We have been, and remain, supportive of its publicly known strategy to take the opportunity, in recent years, to add on more upstream and midstream capabilities and capacities.\n\n\"We also acknowledged that no business is without risks. But that said, at the time of the investment, we were comfortable with Olam's credit position and longer term prospects, and were very pleased to have another opportunity to invest in the company, alongside others.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On site is a two-storey freehold property with approximately 7,000 sq ft built-up area; it has six bedrooms and a swimming pool. The property is believed to have been renovated a few years ago. Newsman Realty brokered the sale.\n\nThe latest transaction would mark the fifth time the property is changing hands in the past seven years; the earlier transactions were at about $7.5 million in March 2006, $12.3 million in July 2007, $13.1 million in September 2008 and the December 2010 sale at $21 million to the current owner.\n\nBT understands that the Dalvey Road transaction is at $33 million, or close to $2,190 psf on land area of 15,081 sq ft.\n\nThe freehold bungalow, with a built-up area of about 8,600 sq ft, is part of The Glencaird Residences collection developed by a unit of Wharf Holdings. In the latest transaction, the seller is believed to be a company linked to Singaporeans currently residing in Hong Kong. It is thought to have bought the property in April 1997 from Wharf for nearly $13.9 million.\n\nThe bungalow was completed in 1999.\n\nSeparately, at Mount Echo Park (in the Chatsworth Park GCB Area), an old bungalow with a freehold land area of 15,116 sq ft has been put up for sale at an indicative price of around $26.8 million or $1,773 psf.\n\nOn site is a two-storey property believed to have been built around 26 years ago. Its owner is a retired Singaporean who has emigrated overseas.\n\nThe five-bedroom bungalow has a built-up area of about 6,000 sq ft. It has a swimming pool and landscaped garden at the rear. \"The new owner will have a few options. One, he could do an ID (interior design) job costing maybe $300,000-400,000. Two, he could do major A&A (additions and alterations) works to increase the built-up area to around 8,000-9,000 sq ft; this could possibly cost $1-2 million. Or three, he could completely tear down the existing bungalow and redevelop the site,\" said KH Tan, managing director of Newsman Realty, which is handling the tender for the property closing on Nov 15. \"The property sits on a flat, rectangular site in a quiet area.\"\n\nCommenting on the state of the market, Mr Tan revealed that he has in hand about a dozen potential buyers looking for a GCB for their own residence.\n\nMost are hoping to sell their existing homes - which could be a smaller bungalow or even apartment - and looking to enter into an agreement to buy a GCB with a longer-than-usual option exercise period.\n\nMarket watchers say this is to give them enough time to sell their existing home to avoid being slapped with a high additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rate on their GCB purchase as well as to settle the loan on their existing property so that they may qualify for the loan amount they will need to buy their new bungalow.\n\nUnder the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework, banks granting property loans to individuals have to ensure that a borrower's monthly total debt repayments do not exceed 60 per cent of his gross monthly income.\n\nAnd, under the January 2013 property cooling package, Singaporeans have to pay 7 per cent ABSD on their second residential property purchase here, with the rate increasing to 10 per cent ABSD on the third and subsequent purchase.\n\n\"The GCB market has been soft for the past few months but I think prices will start to rise again in Q3 next year,\" Mr Tan predicted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Not that it matters much, but the movie itself is a formulaic and slightly muddled effort, directed by Alan Taylor and weighed down by the need to provide extended narrative and a back story to the villain du jour.\n\nAs a result, plot and character development are kept to a minimum while loud, fiery explosions are at a maximum.\n\nAudiences weaned on the likes of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings have seen it all before - better executed too - and while there are some nice individual moments, this Thor lacks the confidence and levity of its predecessor. Plus it's hard not to be blas\u00e9 about yet another effects-led superhero blockbuster.\n\nThis time around, much of the action takes place in the celestial realms of Asgard and surrounding planets, where Thor (Chris Hemsworth), as king-in-waiting to his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), has spent the last two years fighting wars and kicking some alien butt.\n\nHis treacherous adoptive brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston), is festering in an Asgardian prison, while back on Earth, main squeeze Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) waits in vain for Thor to call or email.\n\nJust when peace breaks out, Jane discovers a mysterious portal to an alternate universe and inadvertently unleashes an evil force known as the Aether.\n\nMeanwhile, a rare impending planetary convergence gives Malekith (Christopher Eccleston), the brutal leader of the Dark Elves, a chance to exact revenge and destroy Asgard.\n\nJane may be a brilliant astrophysicist, but there's precious little chemistry between her and her guy. Instead, it's left to Loki to serve as a royal pain in the Asgard and generate some much-needed dramatic heat.\n\nWhen Malekith attacks and kills someone near and dear to Thor, he reluctantly teams up with Loki in an effort to save the day - a smart move by the filmmakers, as it turns out.\n\nStill, it's hard to be taken seriously when you wear a red cape and lug a giant hammer to work every day.\n\nThor lacks the intensity and psychological complexity of his caped counterpart the Dark Knight, but even as he tries his best to be a good demigod and a great king, this movie will take him only so far.\n\nThe Dark World is no catastrophe but it fails to shed much light on a character who, after only two outings, is looking a little uninspired.\n\nThor's immediate future is assured in the form of the next Avengers movie and he remains a Marvel-ous team player but for now, his star is just a little out of alignment.\n\nRating: C+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tokyo is embroiled in separate territorial spats with both countries.\n\nBut JAL said revenues from its international services increased \"despite the suspension of Boeing 787 flights and stagnant demand on Korea and China routes\".\n\n\"On June 1, 2013, JAL resumed operation of the Boeing 787 on completing of all necessary safety measures, after battery problems grounded the fleet in January 2013 and caused substantial concerns and inconvenience\", the company said.\n\nJAL and ANA were sideswiped by the grounding of Boeing's new aircraft that began in January. After a long-running probe the planes were allowed to fly again in June.\n\nJAL said it increased the use of the fuel-efficient Dreamliner on international services to increase overall efficiency, while reducing Narita-Beijing flights because of shrinking demand.\n\nDomestic services also fared well, with expanded routes and improved services such as better airport lounges.\n\nUnlike ANA, which cut its full-year profit forecasts by two-thirds, one-time flag carrier JAL upgraded its annual forecasts, citing strong demand for flights to South-east Asia and cost-cutting efforts.\n\nThe figures were also expected to benefit from an adjustment in foreign exchange movement and falling fuel prices. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/20f68dd1800941c6679551ab84cc34c1241d7cf0b823c5383a4f0d5d09c1b155?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Tough times: In a half that saw the grounding of its Dreamliners, JAL made 81.94b yen, with an operating profit that was down 14.6% at 95.84b. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

Among those purportedly terminated from the board of PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd (PNG SDP) is Lim How Teck, who has been a director since 2003.\n\nA shipping veteran who retired as chief operating officer of Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) after 26 years there, Mr Lim sits on 14 other boards in Singapore. He is currently chairman of Certis Cisco, ARA-CWT Trust Management (Cache) and Temasek Holdings unit Heliconia Capital Management, as well as the Singapore-based director for major German heavy lift and projects cargo liner company Rickmers.\n\nTypically, directors from Singapore-incorporated companies can only be removed under Singapore law in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act and the Memorandum and Articles of Association. But in this case, the PNG government has apparently passed legislation, which it says gives it \"all necessary powers\" to restructure PNG SDP and its operations, and to expropriate its assets including a 63.4 per cent stake in the Ok Tedi mine, among other things.\n\nFormer PNG prime minister Mekere Morauta, who was removed from his position as chairman of PNG SDP last week, has criticised the legislation as \"unlawful\" and which \"violated the rules of international law\".\n\n\"It is apparent that the government passed the legislation to purport to restructure PNG SDP,\" court papers said, \"despite the fact that the structure and governance of PNG SDP was carefully decided and agreed upon after lengthy negotiations between BHP Billiton (the mine's former operator) and the state, and after extensive consultations with key stakeholders.\"\n\nThe company was established when Australian mining company BHP Billiton, in a deal with the government in 2001, divested its majority share in the mine to PNG SDP following concerns about its long-term environmental impact, and in return was granted legal immunity.\n\nIt is responsible for ensuring that dividends from the Ok Tedi mine, which accounts for more than a quarter of the country's total exports and nearly 10 per cent of its GDP, are used and managed transparently and accountably for the sustainable development of PNG's western province region and in communities affected by the mine's pollution.\n\nIn an effort to nullify the board changes and protect its assets, PNG SDP, represented by Senior Counsel Harpreet Singh Nehal of Cavenagh Law LLP, has sued the PNG government and three members of a transitional management team in the High Court this week.\n\nAccording to court papers, PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill wrote to Mr Morauta last week to advise him of the termination, referring to a section in the Expropriation Act passed last month that he said gave the government powers to remove the directors.\n\nBut PNG SDP disagreed. According to court papers, it said that the parties expressly provided that the security deed over the dividends received from the Ok Tedi mine is governed by Singapore law.\n\nThe company is seeking declarations that the existing board has full authority to manage its business; that the PNG government may not restructure the company unless in accordance with the provisions of its Memorandum and Articles of Association. It is also seeking a declaration that its assets can only be applied to promote sustainable development within PNG and to advance the general welfare of its people.\n\nPNG SDP is also seeking an order to stop the transitional management team from \"taking any action or giving any instructions in relation to its property, rights and assets in Singapore or elsewhere\".\n\nRepresented by Nish Shetty of Clifford Chance, PNG SDP has also commenced arbitration proceedings through the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in Washington DC in what is believed to be the first multi-billion dollar claim by a Singapore company against a foreign government for recovery of the expropriated stake, or alternatively, for compensation to be paid. It is also seeking damages for violations of international law, the company said.\n\nMr Morauta said that the company, which has operated the mine since 2002, is entitled to an annual dividend, currently capped at US$350 million a year, on its shares in the mine. To date, the government has not paid, or proposed to pay, any compensation to PNG SDP for taking its property, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Administrative expenses rose 64.7 per cent to 35.4 million yuan, mainly due to a rise in professional expenses relating to legal and advisory services.\n\nMajority shareholder Indofood Sukses Makmur had made a general offer for the company following the latter's share price plunge after Glaucus had accused it of fraud and financial irregularities, including abnormal profit margins and sales that were artificially boosted. China Minzhong said yesterday that it had on Sept 30 started supplying processed vegetables to Indofood.\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, China Minzhong's revenue edged up 4 per cent to 637.8 million yuan on higher sales from its cultivation business segments.\n\n\"The marginal sales increase was on the back of a high revenue base in Q1FY13 which recorded a one-off sales rollover from the previous financial year due to a shift in the operating peak season caused by a late winter,\" it said.\n\nAnalysts BT spoke to said there was no correlation between the Glaucus incident and China Minzhong's poor showing this quarter. Neither did they see any of Glaucus' claims ringing true in the company's financial statement.\n\nMaybank Kim Eng Research analyst Wei Bin said he had not expected some of the costs incurred, especially the 44 million yuan spent on marketing and advertising, but \"if you excuse these one-off costs and expenses items which add up to about 60 million yuan, and you add it back to the bottom line, the net profit is quite comparable to year-ago levels,\" he said.\n\nChina Minzhong said that while demand for vegetables remains healthy and agriculture remains a key industry favoured and strongly supported by the local government, it will continue to face rising labour costs in China.\n\nTo counter rising wages and future labour shortages on farmland, the group is in the midst of setting up two more industrialised farming bases in Jiangsu province and Sichuan province, in addition to its two existing ones in Tianjin and Shanghai.\n\nChina Minzhong shares were last traded at S$1.105 on Oct 18.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It depends on the dancers I'm working with, because every dancer's body is different. So every piece is different.\"\n\nShe described Shift or Go in terms of space and time, and recommends that the audience take it in by just sitting back and focusing on the changes in space as a whole, rather than on the dancers' individual steps.\n\n\"I don't know exactly how to describe it. It's like I'm carving into the space or cutting into the space. It's quite a lot more (like) landscape in a sense, but then again, nobody should have to think about that as a member of the audience. They should just experience it.\"\n\nKinsun, a Swiss-Canadian mounting a piece called Slide for Passages, also prefers to let his audiences make up their own minds about his work.\n\n\"Slide is, for the most part, an abstract work, and what I appreciate most about abstract art is that it gives room for viewers' interpretation.\"\n\nThe choreographer for ballet companies such as the Basel Ballet and Zurich Ballet cautions the audience not to expect a clear narrative like that in Cinderella or Romeo and Juliet; they will not see a relationship develop or emotions portrayed by the six men and six women on stage.\n\nHe said the inspiration for the work is rooted in exploring sliding movements.

The last two ECs in the area, Summerdale and The Floravale, were launched in 1997.\n\nPent-up demand underpins the bullish expectations of consultants who cited psf ppr prices on the higher end: Orange Tee's head of research Christine Li and Ong Kah Seng, the director at R'ST Research, gave a range of $360 to $380 psf ppr.\n\nMs Li also said that the tightening of the mortgage-servicing ratio, the lowering of loan tenure and the implementation of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework were measures working in favour of the EC market.\n\nMr Ong noted that 11,329 EC units were sold between Q4 2010 - when ECs were introduced as a housing class - and Q3 this year. This translates to a yearly average of 3,770 EC units sold each year.\n\nAssuming that previously sold EC sites in Yuan Ching Road, Punggol Drive, and Punggol Central are launched by the end of next year, a maximum of 3,110 EC units will become available next year.\n\n\"The supply in 2014 may be insufficient to cater to EC buyers, based on an average yearly demand of 3,770 units,\" said Mr Ong, who noted that this figure does not take into account buyers who applied but failed to land a unit. \"Given that the TDSR will encourage prudent buying, and more EC-eligible buyers will opt for ECs over private condominium units, the recent historical annual demand for ECs should be sustained or grow even stronger going into 2014,\" he said.\n\nThe tender for the Westwood site closes at noon on Jan 7.\n\nThe site in Lorong Lew Lian, measuring 150,762 sq ft and with a maximum permissible gross floor area of 452,288 sq ft, was released on the reserve list.\n\nBut DTZ's Ms Lee said that the site is unlikely to be triggered in the near term.\n\nMr Ong, agreeing, said that developers might not trigger the site for sale till the second quarter of next year, given the existing cautious sentiment.\n\nAssuming the site is triggered next year, Mr Ong said that he expects about five bids for the site, with an expected top land bid of between $430 and $490 psf ppr.\n\nSLP International's Mr Mak said that he expects the site to achieve a land price of $620-720 psf ppr, assuming the site was launched for sale today.\n\nThe two residential sites are expected to yield 980 housing units.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are also keen to use asset classes beyond traditional bonds to acquire yield and total return.\"\n\nFund investors here currently allocate about 37 per cent of capital into growth funds, 31 per cent into income funds, and 36 per cent into growth and income funds, according to the survey of 300 unit trust investors in July 2013.\n\nBut these weightings are expected to shift in the next six months, with growth funds' allocation falling to 28 per cent, while income funds' allocation is expected to rise to 38 per cent.\n\nThis trend is in line with but slightly more income-focused than the region. On a scale of zero to 100, with a reading below 50 indicating a future preference for income, Singapore scored 43. The region's average was 45.\n\nThe report also showed increasing confidence in equities among Singapore investors, with 50 per cent expressing confidence over the next six months compared with 47 per cent in July.\n\nConfidence in real estate slipped to 37 per cent for the next six months from 42 per cent, while bonds and cash also saw lower forward confidence.\n\nMr Chiu said that the data suggests investors remain cautious and are therefore looking to income products for protection. But within the realm of income funds, the preference is for higher-yielding equity funds.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She also suggests six events with notable writers in attendance\n\nPublished Thu, Oct 31, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNOBEL Prize winner for Literature Gao Xingjian is often quick to distance himself from anything involving politics. He even describes himself as the sort of writer who covers all genres except political papers and advertorials. \"I write what I want to while staying away from issues of politics and economics,\" he says.\n\nBut his body of work tells a different story. Chinese politics often form the backdrop in his writings, ever since he became a pioneer of experimental theatre in China in the early 1980s. His work attracted the attention of the Communist Party, which harassed him and forced him to flee his homeland.\n\nAfter he had made a new life for himself in France, the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident took place. He released a work titled Fugitives, which was set against the backdrop of the incident. In retaliation, the Communist Party banned all his works in China.\n\nThe author now lives in exile as a citizen of France, after giving up his Chinese passport in 1998. In 2000, he became the first writer in Chinese to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, and his works have been translated into 40 languages.\n\n\"I count myself very lucky to be having this kind of recognition. However, it was never my intention to seek fame. I only wanted to do my best for my work because I believe that if I can create something that makes me happy, surely it can work its way into other people's hearts,\" says Gao.\n\n\"My plays and novels depict the survival of man, and the complexity and humour of humanity. They are problems that affect most people - and don't just pertain to China.\"\n\nOver the course of his career, the 73-year-old author has published more than 20 works including plays, essays and short stories. He is best known for his two semi-autobiographical novels. The first, Soul Mountain (1990), tells the story of a man's journey along the Yangtze river, while the second, One Man's Bible (1999), touches on the Cultural Revolution he went through in his youth.\n\n\"I wrote my first novel at the age of 10, and it started from there. During the Cultural Revolution, I was scared so I burnt all my drafts and diaries. But after the revolution, I continued writing, until today, and at the age of 73, I am still not done. This is my life,\" he says.\n\nGao's interests include filmmaking, and he has two films to his name - Silhouette/Shadow (2003), a poetic portrait of an artist attempting to understand life, and After The Flood (2008), where actors dance in front of a screen on which his black-and- white paintings are projected.\n\nNext Friday at the Singapore Writers Festival, Gao will premiere his third film, Requiem for Beauty, after delivering a lecture titled Literature and Aesthetics. He describes the film as a piece of \"cinematic poetry\" that is inspired by his care-free life in France.\n\nWhile he has yet to reveal the subject matter of the film, Gao promises that it will be \"the sort of independent movie that cannot be found in the commercial market\".\n\nracloi@sph.com.sg\n\nGao's lecture, Literature and Aesthetics, is on Nov 8 from 6.30pm to 8.30pm at the National Museum of Singapore Gallery Theatre. This event is not included in the festival pass, and tickets cost $15.\n\nA Meet-the-Author session with Gao on Nov 9 is from 11.30am to 12.30pm at The Salon, National Museum of Singapore. Gao will also take part in a panel discussion, Tongue Ties, Tongue Tied, on Nov 10, from 5.30pm to 6.30pm at the Singapore Management University Binary Pavilion on the Campus Green.\n\nBoth these events are included in the festival pass.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Boeing Design Center in Moscow will also support the design activity.\n\n\"However, at this time, no decisions have been made about 777X design or build in Puget Sound,\" the memo said. The news was seen as a blow to engineering workers in Washington state and a sign that the jobs building the more efficient version of Boeing's best-selling wide-body plane could migrate to lower-cost, non-union states, especially Boeing's production facility in South Carolina.\n\n\"This is another step in Boeing's war against SPEEA (Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace), the engineers' union in Seattle,\" said Scott Hamilton at aviation consultancy Leeham Co in Seattle. \"Boeing has been systematically moving engineering jobs out of Washington all year.\"\n\nThe move also comes as Washington state Governor Jay Inslee is considering proposing a package of tax incentives to persuade Boeing to put 777X design and assembly work at its giant factory in Everett, Washington, where the current 777 is made, and keep work in the Puget Sound region, which encompasses Everett, Seattle and Renton, where Boeing has facilities.\n\nUnion officials said that they expected some 777X work will be sourced from the Puget Sound region.\n\nShifting entirely away from the Everett factory, they said, likely would bring problems similar to those experienced with Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which has suffered a series of glitches, including unstable, overheating batteries and repeated mechanical failures. Design and parts for the 787 were sourced from suppliers around the globe.\n\nBoeing has been considering whether to build the 777X at its factory in North Charleston, South Carolina, and is acquiring land adjacent to that factory. But the company reiterated on Wednesday that it has not yet decided where to build the jet.\n\nThe memo released on Wednesday said that Boeing's goal is to bring engineering skill from across the company to tackle a project as large as the 777X. The company also said that it would apply \"lessons learned\" from the 787 and 747-8 programmes. The new structure of design, \"will allow for an efficient use of resources and enable Boeing to resolve design issues effectively the first time\". - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/brighter-power-sector-solar-energy", "site_title": "Brighter power sector with solar energy", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBrighter power sector with solar energy\n\nPublished Thu, Oct 31, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTO further diversify the energy mix here, Singapore is preparing the ground for renewable energy options, with solar power seemingly the most viable at this point. This comes as the power industry here is in a stable, steady state. With natural gas supplies already helping to fuel most of the electricity produced here, renewables (like solar, as it becomes commercially viable) are targeted, in the first instance, to meet up to 10 per cent of current peak electricity demand here.\n\nThe power industry here has indeed gone from famine to feast: total generating capacity is outpacing electricity demand growth. It has also gone \"green\". Supply of environment-friendly natural gas (the favoured fuel accounting for 85 per cent of the electricity generated here) is more than ample, with recently started global shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplementing what is expected to be diminishing piped gas supplies from neighbouring Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nAny earlier apprehensions about supply security following Temasek Holdings' sale of the three biggest gencos (Senoko Energy, YTL PowerSeraya and Tuas Power) to foreign owners have also all but evaporated. The trio hold over a three-quarters share of the electricity market here, and in coming months, yet another foreign-owned genco (PacificLight Power) will join them. The experience over the last four years (after the genco divestment) is that the increased intra-industry competition, plus efficiency gains from the power market's liberalisation, has helped moderate wholesale electricity price increases here.\n\nStill, from an end-user's (or household's) perspective, there may be some nagging feeling that this hasn't quite trickled down yet to lower electricity tariffs. But this is largely because feedstock prices for both current piped gas and LNG supplies are still pegged to oil prices. Future LNG supplies (which could be sourced on a shorter-term basis and priced off international gas prices like the US Henry Hub) will hopefully help address this. Longer-term, there are also plans to introduce smart meters, allowing households to choose both the price and which electricity retailer they want to buy power from.\n\nSupply security (but not necessarily cheaper utilities) has meanwhile been beefed up for big consumers like the oil and chemical companies here. On this front, Singapore gencos have ventured into alternatives. Tuas Power is using coal and biomass fuel to supply steam and other utilities. Sembcorp has also started using woodchips and recently announced a waste-to-energy plant capitalising on the waste materials it collects. Big Oil like Shell and ExxonMobil have themselves built new in-house cogeneration plants to supply utilities using LNG feedstock from the SLNG terminal.\n\nIn the public sector, the use of solar power panels to generate electricity (including for HDB housing) has started. The latest to do so is the Singapore Sports Hub. Consumers who currently enjoy guaranteed power supplies at the mere flick of a switch have to realise that all this cannot come free.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last Friday's release should be compulsory reading for all parties interested in regulatory matters, how discipline is maintained in daily trading, and overall governance.\n\nFrom a close reading of SGX's release, the first point to note is that the exchange's powers are limited almost wholly to issuing warning signals to the market if trading takes an unusual turn. These warnings range in strength, starting with a query - the first signal that something may be amiss. Then it progresses to designation (which occurs if there may be possible manipulation and/or excessive speculation); and ends with an exchange-driven suspension (when the exchange thinks the market is not orderly, informed or fair).\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

JAIME EE reports\n\nPublished Thu, Oct 31, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nZOMBIES tried to eat Margaret Atwood's head. Gilberto Gil brought the house down with a heady mix of Brazilian samba and Arab social commentary. Lin Hwai-min forced his Brazilian protege to climb a mountain in Taiwan and he came back a \"Crooked Man\"; meanwhile, William Kentridge's Colombian charge realised he could teach people philosophy and give them a good workout if he trapped them in a garden maze.\n\nWelcome to the sixth cycle of Rolex's Master and Protege Initiative - where the arts are ever in their favour.\n\nOver the brief weekend of Oct 19-20 in magical Venice, the gods smiled and put off the inevitable push into early winter, sending a brief spurt of crisp, (mostly) sunny weather over this city so richly steeped in history, arts and culture. A fitting backdrop indeed to the latest instalment of Rolex's longstanding support of the arts - a biennial programme that matchmakes veterans in the international arts world with upcoming young talents to keep the fire of creativity going.\n\nGondoliers and tourists stood by as a flurry of water taxis skimmed from the hotels Westin and Danieli to the Fondazione Giorgio Cini - a monastery-turned-cultural foundation on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore. Over two days, its sculpted, expansive grounds took on an inexplicable energy as the latest round of masters and proteges gathered with international media and the arts cognoscenti to present the fruits of their year-long collaboration.\n\nIn the building's library, or biblioteca, British literary protege Naomi Alderman - feminist author and inventor of a running app which creates an audio illusion of zombies chasing the jogger to make exercise less boring - presented her project with the illustrious Canadian writer Margaret Atwood.\n\nIt was a novel they co-wrote on the unlikely topic of zombies - partly because Alderman had an affinity with them and partly because Atwood didn't believe that serious writers had to only write about serious topics. The Happy Zombie Sunrise Home was her idea, and became a digital novella that can be found on the literary e-platform wattpad.\n\nThe rollicking tale saw Atwood and Alderman each writing a chapter and e-mailing it to the other to continue. They obviously had fun doing so, considering that Alderman's presentation included a live re-enactment of her app Zombies, Run!, complete with \"real\" zombies pursuing a hapless jogger around the room right up to the front where Alderman and Atwood were seated - both of whom were promptly set upon by the zombies and, well, eaten.\n\nWith the zombies satiated and quiet, action of a different kind filled the long, timber-floored space of the Cenacolo Palladiano, tailor-made for the work of Brazilian dancer Eduardo Fukushima. Half Italian, half Japanese but completely original in his approach to dance, the intense, small-built Fukushima parlayed the influence of Taiwanese choreographer Lin Hwai-min into a series of mind-bending movements you should not try at home. Part robotic, part spastic and so tightly controlled that every muscle seemed to work like a carefully calibrated spring, his \"Crooked Man\" defied any attempts at categorisation - the sheer physicality of the work speaking for itself.\n\nAfter the intensity of the Speed Talks where proteges engaged in quick 12 minute chats with any master he or she chose, witnessing the rehearsal of Polish stage director Michal Borczuch working out the kinks of his production which had been overseen by his late mentor Patrice Chereau (he died of cancer two weeks before the event), and surveying the clean lines of the structure that Chinese architect Yang Zhao created with his mentor Kazuyo Sejima, anybody who was pooped could take a relaxing walk in the garden. So they thought.\n\nIt wasn't just any garden but the complicated green labyrinth in the Cini Foundation that protege Colombian artist Mateo Lopez turned into a site-specific installation with the help of visual artist William Kentridge.\n\nWith an iPod playing a simultaneous commentary, it was designed to emulate walking through Venice's maze-like alleys while the narrator gives you advice about life, makes observations and asks you to do silly things like write on a ping pong ball or look for hidden messages in the hedges. It was a walk you needed to complete to get out of the maze, after which you've had some light exercise and a new perspective of life.\n\nBut the best was yet to be when Egyptian musician Dina El Wedidi took to the stage with her earnest, rousing revolutionary songs that had people tapping to her rhythm and melodies even if they didn't understand the politics behind them. But when her mentor Gilberto Gil came on stage to join her, all hell broke loose as he went straight into performance mode and had everyone on their feet in a scene more suited to a foot-stomping outdoor concert than a supposedly restrained high-brow arts event.\n\nIf there was something that everyone agreed upon, it was just how spontaneous, lively and enjoyable the 2012-2013 Rolex mentors programme turned out to be, compared with the previous cycles since the programme began in 2002.\n\nEven Rebecca Irvin, Rolex's head of philanthropy, marvelled at the sheer camaraderie among the proteges and mentors. \"This group has become very close,\" she said, explaining how the initiative requires mentors to spend a total of one month in the year of the collaboration but this group spent much longer than that.\n\n\"We're asking artists to collaborate - they don't have to be friends, they don't have to like each other. But they all really, really liked each other. Naomi (Alderman) loves Margaret (Atwood). I guess it's about putting people together and they either get on or they don't. Why the relationships happened to be very close this year, and uniformly so, I'd like to know so we can see how to reproduce it. The other relationships have been valuable but this year seems kind of special.\"\n\nIt was clear, too, from the way they spoke of each other at a press conference, how fond the proteges and mentors were of each other.\n\nGilberto Gil and Dina El Wedidi shared warm looks as he explained how his idea of mentoring was to let her follow him on the road, even doing a guest performance at one of his shows in London, while she invited him to Cairo to watch her perform.\n\nLin Hwai-Min of Taiwan's Cloud Gate Dance Theatre spoke candidly of how his idea of mentoring was not to teach Eduardo Fukushima how to dance, so he simply had him travel from Sao Paulo to spend time in Taiwan where he was immersed with Lin's dance company. \"I set up strange things for him, made him climb mountains and hike for four days; I think he must have hated me,\"quipped Lin. \"But he came out intact and with more confidence. I am very proud of him.\" From the way they embraced easily and were spotted on the streets shopping together, a bond had definitely formed.\n\nIt was the same with Atwood, the otherwise serious author whose \"strategy was to do a joint project to get to know each other and give my protege a subject where she was superior to me and would not feel intimidated\". That topic was zombies, \"because Naomi is an expert\", but \"let me point out to you that monsters have a long history that goes back to Greek and Roman times, so don't think zombies are a low and un-literary interest\".\n\nWilliam Kentridge, too, spoke of how he helped the usually precise and \"unmessy\" Lopez to see the virtues of \"messiness\", and film editor Walter Murch - whose work includes the seminal movie Apocalypse Now - spoke of the long hours he shared with protege Sara Fgaier in the editing room as he worked on his first documentary feature, where he also learned from her experience in non-fiction film.\n\nKazuyo Sejima, in turn, spoke of how she and her Chinese protege Yang Zhou bonded over their humanitarian project to construct a \"gathering place\" in Tohoku, Japan, for survivors of the 2011 tsunami.\n\nFilm editing and architecture were two new disciplines added last year, and Rolex's Ms Irvin said that they would look at possibly adding more disciplines as the initiative evolves.\n\nMeanwhile, at a glittering finale dinner which in previous years announced names like Martin Scorsese, Brian Eno, Zhang Yimou, David Hockney, Jessye Norman and Anish Kapoor as mentors, the next line-up was announced.\n\nArtist Olafur Eliasson, choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, writer Michael Ondaatje, film director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, composer Kaija Saariaho, lighting designer Jennifer Tipton and architect Peter Zumthor will go on to pick their proteges from a curated list of nominees determined by Rolex's board of artistic advisors.\n\nUntil then, the Palazzo Pisani Moretta glittered with the twinkling lights of Venice and stars like Sophia Loren who lent Italian glamour to a night that marked the end of one artistic journey, but the start of a fresh new one.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Just look at the number of albums that Mick Jagger sells when he's not recording with his bandmates from The Rolling Stones.\n\nBut it's not always the same story. The likes of Justin Timberlake and Robbie Williams have become bigger artists in their own right than when they were part of a band. Likewise, Matchbox Twenty's frontman Rob Thomas has enjoyed plenty of success on his own.\n\nAfter putting the band on hiatus in 2004 - while they were at the top of their game - the 41-year-old went on to enjoy an equally illustrious solo career that includes two platinum-selling Top Five albums, . . . Something To Be (2005) and Cradlesong (2009).\n\nHe also lent his songwriting talents to artists such as rock legend Tom Petty and country stars Willie Nelson and Travis Tritt.\n\nBut nothing beats getting back together with the boys and it's something that Thomas slips back into quite easily as he truly enjoys jamming with the rest of the Matchbox Twenty guys.\n\n\"It's a whole different gig,\" he explains in an e-mail interview. \"I love my solo band but there is something about playing with the same guys for almost 20 years . . . Matchbox Twenty is always home to us; it's something we've built over many years.\"\n\nThe band was formed in Florida in 1995 and comprises Thomas on vocals and keyboards, Kyle Cook on lead guitar, Brian Yale on bass and Paul Doucette on drums. Former rhythm guitarist and founding member Adam Gaynor left in 2005, with drummer Doucette standing in during recording.\n\nThey made their debut in 1996 with Yourself or Someone Like You. The album was a big hit, spawning singles such as Push, 3 am, Real World, Long Day and Back 2 Good. 2000's follow-up Mad Season and 2002's More Than You Think You Are both went multi-platinum and featured hits such as Bent, Unwell, If You're Gone, Bright Lights and Disease.\n\nAfter going on hiatus in 2004, Matchbox Twenty regrouped briefly in 2007 to record a handful of tracks for their retrospective compilation album Exile on Mainstream and toured for about a year before taking another break in 2008.\n\nBut they got back together again three years later and started work on their fourth studio album, North, which features the top 10 single She's So Mean. It was released late last year and shot straight to the top of the album charts in America and Australia.\n\nThomas attributes the success of North to the time out that the band members took from each other. \"Every time we step away from Matchbox, we aren't just sitting around; we are always working with other people in other situations,\" he stresses. \"And every one of those is an opportunity for us to learn something new and bring it back to Matchbox when we're together again.\"\n\nNorth has also set Matchbox Twenty back out on the road with back-to-back sold-out tours through North America and Down Under. The quartet are set to play their first-ever show in Singapore next weekend.\n\n\"The only part of our career that we don't fully control is touring,\" says Thomas, when asked why it took the band so long to finally make it here. \"There are so many factors that involve the label, booking agents, promoters, etc that all we can do is to keep saying we want to go somewhere until they send us there!\"\n\nMatchbox Twenty plays at the Singapore Indoor Stadium on Nov 10 at 8pm.

SLNG is also the first open-access, multi-user LNG terminal in Asia.\n\n\"So Pavilion will be treated like any other commercial operator in the Singapore system,\" he added.\n\nThe issue is timely as Pavilion, which was set up by Temasek Holdings in April to invest and participate in both upstream and downstream aspects of the LNG chain, yesterday announced that it had struck its first long-term LNG purchase for delivery into Singapore and the region.\n\nIt is pertinent as EMA is now developing a Terminal Access Code (TAC) to provide clarity to industry players on how the facility's capacity can be allocated to spot import and other ancillary services without affecting its main throughput services, that is, bringing in LNG to fuel Singapore's power stations and big industries, such as the petrochemical complexes.\n\nThe SLNG terminal, which started with an initial capacity of 3.5 million tonnes per annum (tpa), will see its regasification capacity boosted to six million tpa by year-end when a third tank is completed. It is also planning a fourth tank to ramp this up to nine million tpa, with the final investment decision, including construction award, for this expected in Q2 2014.\n\nThere has been a flood of big global LNG producers and traders, including majors such as Gazprom, Shell and BP, which have set up outposts here to capitalise on Singapore's plan to develop into an Asian LNG hub. But there will be limits to the number of players which SLNG can accommodate at this time.\n\nEMA had earlier assessed that the terminal will be able to support only up to four long-term importers, including initial aggregator BG Group, but said it was considering allowing players to also apply for licences to import spot cargoes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Turnover fell 15 per cent to US$30.4 million. Loss per share was 8 US cents, up from 6 US cents.\n\nPure Beauty's offer for SMG unconditional\n\nPURE Beauty Investments' voluntary offer for Singapore Medical Group has been declared unconditional. This comes after acceptances hit 42.14 per cent, which together with shares owned, controlled or agreed to be acquired by Pure Beauty and any person acting in concert with it, makes it 62.57 per cent of the total number of shares and 53.25 per cent of the maximum potential issued share capital of the company.\n\nLoyz Energy draws first oil in US well\n\nSINGAPORE-BASED upstream energy group Loyz Energy announced yesterday that it has drawn first oil in North Dakota and Colorado in the US, where it is currently far progressed into the first leg of its well-drilling campaign. The announcement comes just over a year after concluding its largest exploration and production (E&P) deal, which provides the group with a 20 per cent share of net revenue interest for each producing well.\n\nYongnam issues Q3 results warning\n\nYONGNAM Holdings issued a warning yesterday that it is expected to record an operating loss for its third quarter, notwithstanding a healthy increase in revenue. This is mainly due to cost overruns from three on-going projects which pared operating margin to new lows and a significant non-recurring one-off loss on disposal of some fixed assets that eroded the already thin bottom-line profit for the quarter. Nevertheless, the group said it is expected to report a net profit for the financial year, though it is expected to be significantly lower than that of 2012.\n\nCosco delivers bulk carrier to Asian buyer\n\nCOSCO Corporation announced yesterday that its Guangdong shipyard had completed and delivered a bulk carrier of 57,000dwt, named Greener, to its Asian buyer.

The stock ended at 15.5 cents yesterday.\n\nIf fully drawn down and converted, the facility will be converted into 100 million shares, or about 9 per cent of enlarged share capital, based on reported share numbers as at Sept 17. Mr Ng's and Mr Lim's last reported deemed stake was 49.3 per cent.\n\nGiven that it is an interested-party transaction, the facility has to be approved by the firm's independent shareholders.\n\nAsiasons will use the facility as standby capital, with $20 million set aside for investments and the remaining $5 million for working capital.\n\nAs at June 30, Asiasons had cash and cash equivalents of $13.6 million, with $7.6 million of debt repayable by June 2014. It also has an $18.5 million term loan due in 2015, which is secured by quoted securities.\n\nMr Lim told The Business Times that the deal should \"give a note of confidence that the founding shareholders continue to believe in the company and are injecting fresh funds at a significant premium to the market\".\n\nAsiasons had been trying to raise $254 million through a placement of shares to a group of institutional investors, but that deal fell through as a result of events over the past few weeks.\n\n\"This is the same direction being adopted, just a smaller amount,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nAsiasons stock has fallen more than 90 per cent from its Oct 3 close. The share's unusually sharp drop on the morning of Oct 4 led to a suspension by Singapore Exchange (SGX), followed by exchange-imposed trading curbs that were lifted only on Oct 21.\n\nSGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore have said they are reviewing trading in the stock.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From that perspective, the latest revelations of US spying on leaders in Germany, Brazil and Mexico, shouldn't have come as a huge surprise. The outrage that was seen in Europe and Latin America and now in Asia is only partly about the revelations that friends are spying on friends, but more about the scope and the scale of this kind of operations being conducted by US spy agencies, and a sense that the Americans have taken things to a new and dangerous level.\n\nMoreover, while world leaders have probably been operating under the assumption that they are, indeed, being spied on by friendly governments, the latest revelations have helped expose what has been going behind the scenes to a wide international audience. As a result, leaders like German Chancellor Angela Merkel are being forced to protest and show indignation because their voters are upset. Hence, while Mrs Merkel originally played down the reports that she was being taped, she has been forced to take a much more forceful approach because of the outrage expressed by the German media and public.\n\nSpying on Mrs Merkel and other friends of the US may provide decision makers in Washington with important information about political and economic developments in target countries such as Germany and can give the US an edge on this or that diplomatic issue. On the other hand, this kind of information has very little effect on the issues that really affect national security. What should be of concern to Americans should be information that would help capture terrorists, as opposed to information about what the German chancellor is thinking about the free trade negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\n\nIf anything, the latest revelations have already ignited tensions between the US and its allies, including the cancellation of a scheduled meeting between President Barack Obama and Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and have the potential of harming the cooperation between US intelligence agencies and their counterparts in European and other capitals that could involve critical national security issues.\n\nHence, in addition to apologising to Mrs Merkel and other friendly leaders for listening in to their phone conversations, the Obama administration should recognise that its intelligence agencies, tempted by the new information technology that is available to them, may have crossed the line in its spying on its friends.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told reporters in Berlin after meeting with the US ambassador last Thursday: \"This undermines trust, and this can harm our relationship.\"\n\nUS officials should pay attention to this advice from a loyal friend and perhaps come to the conclusion that there should be a moratorium on American spying on its friends, and vice versa.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The expo runs Nov 17-21 and is often a showcase for long-haul jets such as the 777.\n\nAn order haul in Dubai for the 777X would be a boost for Boeing years ahead of the jet's commercial debut, now targeted for decade's end. Boeing is betting that it can keep Airbus SAS at bay in the market for the biggest twin-engine jets by upgrading the current 777, not by building an all-new plane as its French rival is doing with the A350.\n\n\"This kind of order would definitely be a huge vote of confidence in the aircraft,\" said Siyi Lim, a Singapore-based analyst at OCBC Investment Research. \"The 777 is already a proven aircraft and most airlines already fly them.\"\n\nA purchase of 100 or more of the new 777s by Emirates would be Boeing's largest-ever initial tally, surpassing the 50-jet order valued at US$6 billion from Japan's ANA Holdings Inc to introduce the 787 Dreamliner in 2004, when the plane was still known as the 7E7.\n\nSuccess with the 777X comes after Boeing's troubles earlier this year with the 787 Dreamliner. The global fleet of 787s, Boeing's most modern aircraft, was grounded for more than three months following the melting of lithium-ion batteries. The grounding was the longest on a large commercial aircraft by US and Japanese regulators since jets were introduced in the 1950s.\n\n\"Boeing sucked up a lot of costs associated with the 787, having significant delays, cost overruns and teething problem,\" said Timothy Ross, Singapore-based transportation analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG.\n\n\"They are probably keener to develop on existing and successful variants rather than start from a complete blank piece of paper.\"\n\n\"We don't comment on possible negotiations,\" Marc Birtel, a spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing, said.\n\nMarco Larsen, a Qatar Airways spokesman at Public New York City, said that he couldn't immediately comment. Natalie Taylor, an Etihad spokeswoman at Quinn & Co, and Arielle Himy, an Emirates spokeswoman at MSL Group, both said that they couldn't immediately comment on the orders.\n\n\"We do not comment on market rumours,\" said Elin Wong, a spokeswoman for Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific. \"We will continue to evaluate all available aircraft models for our fleet needs.\"\n\nFor the 777X, Boeing is adding 50 more seats to the largest current 777 variant so it can seat as many as 400 people. The redesigned plane will feature the biggest engines ever and a wider, fuel-saving wingspan that can be shortened by having the tips fold up after landing.\n\nFresh 777X sales would build on Boeing's momentum after Deutsche Lufthansa AG agreed last month to buy 34 of the planes. While the 777X's list price hasn't been made public, the Lufthansa order implied a retail price of about US$340 million, according to Peter Arment, a New York-based analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach Inc. Buyers typically get a discount.\n\nEarlier this month, Boeing's decades-long dominance in jetliner sales to Japan cracked as Airbus won its first order from Japan Airlines Co, a deal for A350 type aircraft worth US$9.5 billion.\n\n\"Boeing is banking on the new variant of the 777 to defend its market share from Airbus's A350 series,\" said Kelvin Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc.\n\nAirbus plans to hand over its first A350 to Qatar Airways towards the end of next year. The aircraft had won 756 orders at the end of last month from 38 customers.\n\nEmirates is likely to be the so-called launch customer, Robert Stallard, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, wrote in an Oct 28 note. The term refers to the first buyer to fly a new plane. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

It doesn't have to be a concern with a moderate downward reaction in housing prices.\"\n\nThe housing market is showing signs it may be retreating from a half decade of increases during which record-low interest rates drove real estate prices to all-time highs. The central bank this month kept its main rate unchanged for a 10th meeting and predicted tightening will start in the \"summer\" as the economy picks up.\n\nThough Norway's government has no net debt, thanks to its US$810 billion sovereign-wealth fund, consumer borrowing has ballooned to a record 200 per cent of disposable income.\n\nIn an effort to cool the development, Norway has introduced a number of measures, including capping loans at 85 per cent of a property's value, raising bank capital requirements and increasing the risk weights that lenders assign to their assets.\n\nHouse price growth slowed to 2.6 per cent in September, the smallest increase since June 2009, according to a monthly report by real estate brokers. A central bank survey released this month showed banks saw less credit demand from households in the third quarter with demand even seen dropping this quarter.\n\nMr Olsen signalled the bank is ready to tolerate sustained house price declines in response to Norway's financial imbalances. The public should be \"prepared\" for a \"downward reaction\" in house prices, he noted.\n\n\"It's important to realise, especially for households, there could be a reaction downwards in prices over a longer period without the economy entering into a recession,\" Mr Olsen said. \"Even a drop on a yearly basis on house prices doesn't have to spur any chain of negative impulses throughout the Norwegian economy.\"\n\nPolicy makers have sought to calibrate policy to avoid fuelling krone gains while at the same time preventing a build-up in debt and a potential housing bubble. As the euro area struggled through its debt crisis, western Europe's largest oil exporter emerged as an investor haven. While that helped keep unemployment below 4 per cent, it also fuelled the risk of overheating.\n\nMr Olsen said he's for now \"satisfied\" with the measures put in place, which also will include counter-cyclical buffers for banks.\n\n\"I have, on a couple of occasions, warned on having too high ambitions in what you could achieve, whether you could avoid financial crisis in this area, and that has to do with difficult to define, impossible to measure, enormous complexity,\" he said. \"I will not exclude that you could have new measures, but I'm not able to point at any specific measure that's lacking.\"\n\nThe central bank's two most recent rate cuts - in March last year and in December the previous year - were in part driven by monetary policy abroad and by a need to prevent a krone appreciation that was threatening exporters.\n\nMr Olsen as recently as June signalled the bank could cut rates again. The krone has weakened almost 6 per cent since then. He said on Tuesday the krone was the \"main argument\" for cutting rates in March 2012, and was also \"one of several factors\" for the rate cut signals in June.\n\n\"We did that specifically in my time as governor in March 2012,\" Mr Olsen said. It was \"a main argument influencing the decision on the interest rate. That was in a situation where the krone was strong and tended to be even stronger with the danger of pushing inflation, which was low on the outset, even lower.\"\n\nHe said the krone will probably play a part in future policy. \"The krone has been volatile for some time, it was a trend upwards, but if you compare our volatility with some others - Australia, New Zealand, raw material producers other than Norway - I think you can see much stronger fluctuations than we have had,\" Mr Olsen added. \"There will be fluctuations in the krone going forward, I'm quite sure.\"\n\nAt the bank's latest meeting, the deposit rate was kept at 1.5 per cent, after the krone sank and the housing market cooled. Underlying inflation, which adjusts for the effect of taxes and energy, reached the bank's 2.5 per cent target in August for the first time in four years, though price growth slowed to 1.7 per cent last month.\n\nGrowth in Norway's US$500 billion economy is slowing as record household debt burdens curb demand and after persistent krone appreciation last year hurt exports. Mainland gross domestic product, which excludes oil and gas production, will expand 1.75 per cent this year, the bank forecast in September. In 2012, GDP by that measure grew by 3.4 per cent.\n\nMr Olsen, who didn't provide an official forecast with his October rate decision, said indicators since the bank's September report \"broadly\" confirm the same economic picture.\n\n\"If you take a perspective over some years ahead, our forecast now is that growth will remain in the range of 2 per cent to 2.75 per cent and unemployment will remain low,\" he added. \"As we see it now, there will be no dramatic shift in the pace of growth and the overall economic situation.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/0356c67748c6251b2c5d8f4d588d974df47d03cf3de14f17eb39c04c89bf8f56?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Downward reaction: Norway's economy can withstand house price declines 'over a longer period', according to the central bank chief. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

The question is whether we will be able to increase sustainably to 30 aircraft (a year).\n\n\"The target of reaching breakeven on the programme in 2015 is based on that rate (30). At 25 a year, this target would be harder to reach, but on a scale that would still be marginal.\"\n\nAirbus parent EADS told analysts in May that it aimed to bring the loss- making plane to breakeven point in 2015 based on an average delivery rate of 30 aircraft a year.\n\nAn Airbus spokesman said A380 targets had not changed.\n\nDeliveries have been held in check this year as Airbus installs a permanent fix to the recent problem of wing cracks on the huge double-decker jet, which entered service in 2007.\n\nBut analysts say it must on average deliver 30 a year to reach its breakeven goal for the programme in 2015, or else cut costs further and push the break- even threshold below 30.\n\nIndustry sources told Reuters last week that Airbus planned to carry out a review of its flagship jet due to slow sales and had not ruled out shaving A380 output to avoid gaps in 2015 when a handful of the jets remain unsold.\n\nThey also said the review would examine other possible long-term options including making the 525-seat jet even bigger to reduce unit costs amid competition from large twinjets.\n\nParts for the A380 such as strong metal forgings have to be ordered up to two years ahead, meaning time is running out for a decision on output in 2015, which is the critical period for EADS financial targets concerning the aircraft.\n\nA union source said the upstream production rate of 2.8 per month - or 30 planes annually based on an 11-month industrial calendar - had already slipped slightly in the past two weeks.\n\n\"We fine-tune our production on a monthly basis; we have done so successfully in the past and will do so in the future,\" an Airbus spokesman said when asked about the union comment.\n\nExecutive vice-president Tom Williams told Reuters last week that small variations in production would \"not be a crisis\" and ruled out allowing factories to produce A380s that were unsold.\n\nIn a bid to boost A380 sales, Airbus has formed a marketing partnership with Doric Lease Corp, which has placed a provisional order for 20 superjumbos. Industry sources say the race is on to finalise the order, possibly at next month's Dubai Airshow.\n\nHowever, the venture takes effect only in 2016.\n\nIn the newspaper interview, Mr Bregier also confirmed that Airbus may opt to stretch the A380 some time next decade, but said the current version suited the majority of airlines. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The Manulife Investor Sentiment Index (MISI) finds that as much as 40 per cent of assets are sitting in cash. The MISI is a quarterly survey of investors' views across seven markets in Asia.\n\nThe retirement portion of the survey finds that Asians expect they have to depend on retirement savings for an average of 19 years. But the amount they expect to have saved by the time they retire will cover only 13 years.\n\nSingapore's savings shortfall is about seven years, as estimated by respondents themselves in the survey. The largest gap is in Japan with 13 years, followed by 10 years in Indonesia.\n\nSingaporeans in particular expect to be in retirement for 18 years on average, but their estimated savings are expected to last 12 years. In today's monetary terms, this amounts to a shortfall of $250,000 per person.\n\nManulife Singapore president and chief executive Annette King says the risk is that people underestimate their needs. \"The shortfall threatens the security and lifestyle of Singapore's workforce. In our view, even those who have started planning are underestimating their needs. With life expectancy increasing, people should plan to have retirement savings to last at least 20 years.\"\n\nMore Singaporeans (69 per cent) expect to have to work part-time or full-time during retirement than anywhere else in the region (55 per cent on average). In a statement, Manulife said that opportunities for ageing workers may be limited. In 2012, those 65 and older accounted for just 4.1 per cent of the workforce.\n\nMs King said: \"While working past the age of 65 is becoming more commonplace, many ageing workers will find this more difficult than they anticipated. They often fail to consider the limited employment opportunities for their age group. And for a significant portion, health concerns ultimately prevent them from working.\"\n\nIn Singapore, about a fifth of respondents expect to rely on their children for financial assistance, but only 11 per cent feel comfortable doing so. Conversely, 55 per cent expect to support their parents in retirement.\n\nOn investments, sentiment in Asia fell sharply in the third quarter, as the index dropped six points from the previous quarter to 15. This contrasts with the US where a Q3 index score of 45 indicated that US investors believed it was a good time to buy stocks.\n\nIn Asia, the most notable declines in investor sentiment were in Japan and Indonesia. But the deepest pessimism was seen in Hong Kong and Taiwan, driven largely by deteriorating expectations towards equities and the property sector.\n\nRobert Cook, president and chief executive of Manulife Financial, said: \"These findings underline the caution felt by investors around the region. People are sitting on their hands, unsure of what to do . . . The survey is clear that Asian investors aren't looking for excitement; they want secure, steady investment returns.\"\n\nInvestors across the region cited market volatility as the main reason why appetite for stocks has dropped. However, stocks remained the popular choice for further investments.\n\nSentiment towards property also fell in most markets, partly reflecting government measures to cool prices or raise supply in Asia. The most pessimistic on property was Hong Kong, where two-thirds of investors believed current prices were too high and a correction was likely.\n\nAsians held an average of 22 months' personal income in cash. This rises to 35 months in China and 39 months in Singapore. Donna Cotter, Manulife head of wealth management (Asia), said: \"For many investors this represents a big missed opportunity since their cash is providing a very poor return compared to other options available to them.\"\n\nOf the cash holding, about 20 per cent is for daily expenses or emergencies. So most of the holding could potentially shift into investments. When asked what could prompt them to invest the cash, the most common responses were the prospect of a steady, modest return (47 per cent) or guaranteed income (41 per cent).\n\nThe survey is conducted quarterly and is based on 500 interviews in seven markets including Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the case of Sky One, SGX's review of the circumstances revealed no threat to fair, orderly and transparent trading. Hence, no suspension occurred,\" SGX said in a statement.\n\nWith regard to the three previously suspended stocks, \"SGX's review showed disorderliness in the market, and lack of transparency which could also threaten the fairness of trading\", the exchange said.\n\nSGX also said that trading curbs, via the \"designated\" label, were not necessary for Sky One, a logistics provider being targeted in a reverse takeover by a coal mining business. In the case of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold, which had their designated labels lifted on Oct 21, designation and suspension were aimed at helping to \"return the market to finding its own equilibrium\".\n\nWhile SGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore have said that they are reviewing the trading of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold, they have not said if Sky One is also being reviewed.\n\n\"We understand the public wanting to know more about such investigations, but releasing information prematurely could jeopardise the integrity of the investigation,\" SGX said.\n\nSome market observers weren't satisfied with the explanation.\n\n\"How was the review of the circumstances conducted? Is there a clear-cut template that's applicable for all stocks? What are the criteria and parameters? Or was it conducted by a single inexperienced person with gut feel of the situation?\" said one retail investor.\n\n\"SGX mentioned disorderliness, lack of transparency, etc. There's no detailed explanation. Simply arbitrary. There's nothing in the clarification that satisfies my question on how the different standards were applied to different stocks.\"\n\nBut David Gerald, president and chief executive of retail investor advocacy group Securities Investors Association of Singapore, said SGX was doing a reasonable job given its existing tools.\n\nThe bourse operator and regulator's explanations were \"helpful and adequate\", and appear to be working as intended, he added.\n\nMr Gerald said that in this instance, investors have to own some of the responsibility if they suffered any losses from the affected stocks.\n\n\"SGX has got limited tools - query, suspension and designation - and this is about the same as you would find in other jurisdictions and developed markets like Hong Kong or Australia,\" he said.\n\n\". . . the difference is investors here like to make money, but when the investment is affected adversely, they look for a scapegoat.\"\n\nThe key lesson for investors is that there is no substitute for careful analysis of fundamentals and investment goals.\n\n\"My advice to investors is, if you are choosing a stock, be it a penny stock or blue chip, ask yourself what you are looking for,\" Mr Gerald said.\n\n\"If the stock has got a price-earnings ratio of 400 times, why are you there?\"\n\nShares of Sky One remained under pressure yesterday, slipping 3.5 per cent, or 0.3 cent, to close at 8.2 cents.\n\nSky One, which ended the previous week at 47 cents, fell as much as 91 per cent in a dramatic collapse on Monday, prompting a query from the exchange. The company halted trading in its own shares for just over four hours before resuming trading after it said that it was not aware of any material undisclosed information.\n\nAsiasons, Blumont and LionGold, which have fallen as much as 90 per cent from just before their stocks collapsed on Oct 4, were also weaker yesterday.\n\nAsiasons closed at 15.5 cents, down 1.9 per cent or 0.3 cents. Blumont shed 7.8 per cent, or 1 cent, to close at 11.9 cents, while LionGold lost 6.8 per cent, or 1.4 cents, to head out at 19.1 cents.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Kim Young-ha's best-known novel Your Republic Is Calling You does just that for the North and South Korean conflict.\n\nOriginally published in Korean in 2006 as Empire of Light, it tells the story of a seemingly average man living in South Korea named Gi-yeong, who works as a foreign film importer and has a wife and daughter.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Gi-yeong reveals himself to be a North Korean spy who is pretending to lead a normal life in the South. The plot really takes off when he receives a coded e-mail ordering him to return home immediately.\n\nAs part of the Singapore Writers Festival, Kim will take part in a panel discussion titled On The Dirt Road to Dystopia this Sunday and talk about how he handles North and South Korean politics in this book.\n\nIn an e-mail interview, the author says that the conflict serves as a backdrop for examining one man's struggle to understand who he really is.\n\n\"North Korea is the last Stalinist nation in the world, but South Korea is one of the most developed Asian countries. Sixty years ago, the two nations were one, but now they are on extreme ends.\n\n\"Everything but language is different, and this is very interesting to me,\" explains Kim, who was born in South Korea in 1968 but now resides in New York.\n\n\"My protagonist is a North Korean spy, but he is a metaphor for all middle-aged men who have to survive a sudden change. I want people to find something very familiar about the very strange place and people in the novel. That's how novels work and why people read them,\" he adds.\n\nUltimately, Kin believes that his novel is \"about human destiny\" and less so about the political situation in North and South Korea.\n\nKim recalls that the reason he even started writing was because of his own love for reading. He wrote his first complete short story when he was 14.\n\nAfter graduating from university, he worked as a professor and regularly hosted a radio programme, but decided to quit those jobs at the age of 40 and dedicated himself solely to his writing career.\n\n\"I became a writer because that is the only thing that makes me feel that I am a human being of free will. When I write, I can make characters and plots, whatever I want,\" he says.\n\nApart from Your Republic Is Calling You, Kim has had other novels translated into English, like I Have The Right To Destroy Myself (2007), which delves into the topic of suicide.\n\nOne of his most recently translated works, Black Flower (2012), also touches on politics as it is set in 1904 during the Russo-Japanese War, when Koreans were forced to flee their country and rebuild their lives across the world in Mexico.\n\nKim will take part in a panel discussion titled The Writer in a Country's Intellectual Life tomorrow from 5.30pm to 6.30pm at the Singapore Management University Binary Pavilion on the Campus Green. This event is included in the festival pass.\n\nHe will also take part in a panel discussion titled All Art is Quite Useless on Sunday from 4pm to 5pm at The Salon at the National Museum of Singapore. This event is included in the festival pass.\n\nKim is part of a panel discussing \"On the Dirt Road to Dystopia\" on Sunday from 5.30pm to 6.30pm at the Singapore Management University Binary Pavilion on the Campus Green.

Billions of dollars have poured into these funds during the economic uncertainty of recent years, and total assets, which stand at US$234 billion, are up nearly 33 per cent from 2012.\n\nIt's easy to understand why the average investor might be intrigued. Alternatives offer a way to further diversify a portfolio, adding in another layer of protection against market volatility. Long/short equity funds, for instance, which try to minimise an investor's losses by anticipating whether stocks will rise or fall, dropped 15.4 per cent when the market plummeted in 2008, according to Morningstar. That compares with the 37 per cent loss logged by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.\n\nAnd there are plenty of smart financial planners - even those who don't profit on their investment recommendations - who put anywhere from 3 to 15 per cent (or more) of their clients' portfolios into alternative funds.\n\nSo the question becomes: Should you?\n\nThe financial advisers I talked to urged extreme caution for the same reason many investors shun traditional actively managed mutual funds. It's hard to distinguish the skilled money managers from the lucky ones. And even among the seemingly talented, few can sustain a stellar performance over the long haul.\n\n\"Most of them have short track records, obscure trading strategies and few to no adequate benchmarks to compare their performance to,\" said Milo Benningfield, a financial adviser in San Francisco.\n\nHe marvelled at some of the funds' sales strategies. \"One pitch I've seen says, in effect, 'I agree completely that this strategy isn't for everyone and most people should stick with things they know like stocks and bonds. But for someone who's willing to do a little more work and can grasp the concepts, this strategy offers a prudent method of improving diversification and risk-adjusted returns.'\n\n\"In other words,\" he said, \"you must be a pretty smart dude to even contemplate our strategy.\"\n\nFor most investors, slogging through a fund's prospectus will require several visits to Investopedia, and even then, the inner workings will be hard to grasp. Many of them use derivatives, such as options, futures or other complex instruments.\n\nMulti-alternative funds may be the most difficult to digest since they include a sampling of several hedge-fund-like strategies. They might include a long/short strategy, a \"global macro strategy\" (which generally trade on developing economic trends or policies, for instance), managed futures (which invest in futures contracts such as commodities and currencies) among several others. In addition, non-traditional bond funds - which have recently ballooned given fears of rising interest rates - hedge risks tied to rates and trade on anticipated moves in bonds.\n\n\"It takes a lot of investment knowledge to fully understand these products,\" said Derek Tharp, a registered life planner at Mote Wealth Management. \"They're marketed with a shallow representation of what is really going on inside the fund.\" Managing all of that complexity is also expensive. Alternative funds, on average, cost 1.77 per cent of assets, according to Morningstar, compared with 1.28 per cent for the average actively managed mutual fund. Hedge funds, however, generally charge up to 2 per cent of assets and 20 per cent of your profits.\n\nDespite the high costs, the money continues to stream in. Alternative funds hold US$234.4 billion in total assets, up from about US$157 billion at the end of 2012 and US$41.8 billion in 2007, according to Morningstar. Year to date, nearly US$44 billion flowed into non-traditional bond funds alone, and US$14 billion more followed into long/short equity funds.\n\nThis year, 55 new alternative funds have been introduced, according to Josh Charney, an alternative investment analyst at Morningstar, taking the total number of funds to about 400. Even some large hedge fund players - such as AQR Capital Management and most recently the Blackstone Group, one of the largest investors in hedge funds - have started to offer alternative mutual funds to regular investors. By contrast, to invest in a hedge fund directly, an individual must be an accredited investor, with an income of at least US$200,000 (US$300,000 for couples) or more than US$1 million in assets.\n\nSo why would hedge funds even bother with smaller investors? In a third-quarter earnings conference call with analysts, Stephen Schwarzman, chairman of Blackstone, recently called it a \"very big potential market for us\" now that they've \"cracked the code\" on how to manufacture their products for mass consumption.\n\nPut plainly: \"It's a way to gather more assets,\" said Steven Nadel, a lawyer at Seward & Kissel who represents hedge funds. \"Some strategies are very malleable or easily portable from the hedge fund platform to the mutual fund platform. And it's an easier sell.\"\n\nCompared to hedge funds, alternative mutual funds don't require that you tie up your money for long periods of time and they are more transparent (but still enormously complicated). AQR Capital Management also came out with several alternative funds in recent years (offered through brokers and advisers), including a long/short equity fund and a managed futures fund this year. Over the last two years, BlackRock, an asset management firm, has introduced six alternative mutual funds.\n\nBlackstone, meanwhile, opened its doors to retail investors through a partnership with Fidelity's Portfolio Advisory Service, which manages portfolios for investors with at least US$50,000. Blackstone's Alternative Multi-Manager fund, just two months old, is essentially a mutual fund that invests in a variety of hedge fund strategies, and will be included in some of Fidelity's model portfolios for clients. The overall goal is to capture some of the profits generated by the overall market, but limit losses.\n\n\"The key is to provide individuals with access to high quality managers in a well-constructed, diversified portfolio,\" said John McCormick, senior managing director of Blackstone and head of global business strategy for its Hedge Fund Solutions group. It charges 2.4 per cent of assets, and includes 12 hedge fund managers, some of whom specialise in, for instance, distressed debt. Others trade on stock price movements, for example, tied to corporate mergers or acquisitions.\n\nSome specialists still question whether these strategies are truly importable into mutual fund format. \"The track records of hedge funds and private equity funds are based on an illiquid structure that protects the portfolio from panicked selling attacks during down markets, and gives assets time to recover or develop,\" said Lydia P Sheckels, a financial planner and chief investment officer at Wescott Financial Advisory in Philadelphia. \"We question how these funds will perform going forward.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

The latter include oil traders and oil majors, as well as the so-called \"Wall Street refiners\", which refer to investment banks such as Morgan Stanley.\n\nThe details of the proposed framework for trading of electricity futures are expected to be finalised later this week, EMC's CEO Dave Carlson told The Business Times on the sidelines of the Electricity Roundtable conference yesterday\n\n. As a precursor to this, SGX took a 49 per cent stake in EMC in August last year.\n\nApart from power industry players, others like financial institutions have also expressed an interest in it, he said.\n\nHe was commenting on the government's announcement at the Singapore International Energy Week this week that a market trial will be launched next year, with target implementation for the electricity futures market in the second half of 2014.\n\nSpeaking to BT, YTL PowerSeraya's new CEO, Chan Swee Huat, backs the move to have such a market here, saying he understands trials will start early in 2014, perhaps from January.\n\nThis is not unexpected, as trading is in Mr Chan's blood. PowerSeraya said at the time of his appointment as CEO earlier this month that he had led PowerSeraya's new trading and fuel management arm since its establishment in early 2007 and \"has developed and maximised the trading business, as well as the operating efficiency of the company's fuel-related assets, with good success\".\n\nBT understands from industry officials that the initial market trial will involve just the six named \"market makers\" - which include the big genco trio of Senoko Energy, YTL PowerSeraya and Tuas Power, plus Keppel Merlimau Cogen and Sembcorp Cogen. The surprise addition was Hyflux's Tuaspring, which is building a 411-megawatt cogeneration plant to power its desalination plant, with any excess sold to the grid.\n\n\"Tuaspring was a surprise, as while the gencos got additional sales volumes via vesting contracts as an incentive to sign up as potential market makers, Tuaspring does not have any such vesting contract,\" another genco official told BT.\n\nAs market makers, the six will have to offer bids to both buy and sell. \"So the concern is that as gencos, we end up buying more electricity rather than selling it. There have to be enough buyers and sellers to make the market,\" he added.\n\nThe trial will also allow the market makers to decide whether they will eventually stay with the scheme, as they apparently have an option to opt out.\n\nThat is why government has indicated that there could be some leeway to the H2 2014 target date for its implementation. Responding to a BT query, S Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, said on Monday that while \"our objective is to implement it as soon as possible, the pace of implementation has to be informed by the capacity of the system\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This currently takes five procedures over 5.5 days, costing 2.9 per cent of property value. In Georgia, the top economy for registering property, it takes just one procedure over two days with zero cost.\n\nNevertheless, the report noted that Singapore has made transferring property easier by introducing an online procedure for property transfers. It has also improved its credit information system by guaranteeing through the law borrowers' right to inspect their own data.\n\nSaid Babatunde Onitiri, IFC's country manager for Singapore: \"Singapore offers the most business-friendly environment for local entrepreneurs; the government promotes policies that encourage entrepreneurship and facilitate business, thus attracting more investors to start businesses in this country.\n\n\"Other developing countries in East Asia and the Pacific can learn much from Singapore's best practices.\"\n\nThe report also studied TradeNet, Singapore's trade platform that started operations in 1989, making it one of the first economies worldwide to adopt a single window concept.\n\nThe single window concept improves information flows by sharing needed information across all parties involved, ranging from banks to immigration and vehicle registration authorities. Otherwise, traders would have to spend time shuttling between government agencies such as customs and port authorities, it noted.\n\nThe report also features Malaysia's electronic system for paying taxes, which has reduced the administrative burden of complying with corporate tax obligations. The country ranked sixth.\n\nElsewhere in Asean, the Philippines was one of the most improved economies, at 108 this year, while Myanmar, included for the first time, was No 182.\n\nAugusto Lopez-Claros, World Bank director of global indicators and analysis, said of the latter: \"The data show that there is considerable scope for reform, and efforts are under way to improve the country's business regulations. By removing bottlenecks to firm creation and growth, governments can signal the emergence of a more business-friendly environment, as has already been done in a large number of economies in the region.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The filing provides an update about the status of the case.\n\nThe appointment of mediator in complex civil lawsuits is not unusual, said Seth Bloom, a former trial attorney with the Justice Department's antitrust division. In most federal civil litigation, courts require parties to engage in settlement talks before trial, he said.\n\n\"The nature of the complaint makes it a difficult one to settle, which isn't to say these won't be good-faith talks, but it's nothing shocking,\" said Mr Bloom, president of Bloom Strategic Counsel in Washington. \"They were always going to engage in these talks.\"\n\nThe Justice Department sued American parent AMR Corp and US Airways in August, claiming the planned merger, which would create the world's largest airline, would reduce competition and lead to higher prices. A status conference is set for today.\n\nAMR and US Airways declined to comment on the mediator. Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, also declined to comment.\n\n\"The case is proceeding apace and is on track to commence trial on Nov 25, 2013, as scheduled,\" both sides said in their joint filing to US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, who is overseeing the litigation.\n\nAmerican, which has been in bankruptcy since November 2011, was set to exit court protection by merging with Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways when the Justice Department and a group of states sued to block the deal.\n\nAMR would have to start over in its reorganisation if the US is successful in winning a court order stopping the tie-up, the committee representing the carrier's unsecured creditors said in a court filing on Monday.\n\n\"An injunction here would return the AMR bankruptcy to square one with likely disruption and disarray among numerous, financially unaligned stakeholders,\" the committee said.\n\nJudge Kollar-Kotelly signed an order in August saying she \"encourages the use of alternative dispute resolution\". Both sides said in a filing on Aug 28 that the case \"would not likely benefit\" from that process.\n\n\"The question in a settlement is always who makes the first step, and that's where the mediator can be helpful with formulating hypothetical solutions,\" said Robert Mann, president of aviation consultant R W Mann & Co in Port Washington, New York.\n\nAMR gained 5 per cent on Monday, closing at US$6.54 in over-the-counter trading.

Revenue inched up to $60.7 million from $60.1 million.\n\nHealthway said that the specialist clinics continued to show steady growth due to expansion of patient base. \"Our specialist clinics are gaining traction and we will continue to open new clinics,\" it said, adding: \"The primary care sector experienced a slight growth and we plan to open more clinics.\"\n\nThe group said it will focus on improving operational costs, owing to higher rental and manpower costs.\n\nHealthway shares closed trading yesterday at 6.6 cents, down 0.1 cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This committee will elect the various office holders from among themselves, for roles such as first and second vice-president and honorary secretary.\n\nLast year, Mr Chia was elected president.\n\nBut because the membership of the management committee is tied to the company and not the individual, Mr Chia, who is chief operating officer at Far East but will join Guocoland next year, has to resign as Redas president come his last day at Far East. The management committee can then appoint a replacement for the remainder of the term.\n\nFar East will nominate a new representative to the management committee to replace Mr Chia; it has not been decided who this person will be. But the representative will not automatically become the next president of Redas, as each office holder has to be elected by the management committee.\n\nIt may even be possible in theory for Mr Chia to replace himself, since Guocoland is one of the management committee members for 2013/2014. In the event that Mr Chia is nominated as Guocoland's representative on the management committee before the new president is elected, he will be eligible as a candidate.\n\nMr Chia will not be the first Redas president to have resigned during his term.

Straits Real Estate will be set up with an initial capital commitment of $200 million (90/10 per cent basis) and will eventually have a total capital commitment of up to $950 million.\n\nStraits Real Estate will have the mandate to invest in real estate and real estate-related opportunities and help STC transform its \"low-yielding assets into potentially higher-return assets\".\n\nIn the meantime, STC's existing property assets will come under ARA's management in a separate account arrangement. These include the Straits Trading Building, nine good class bungalows (GCBs), 13 units of Gallop Green, and 14 units of The Holland Collection.\n\nAt a press briefing to announce the deal yesterday, STC executive chairman Chew Gek Khim said the strategic alliance represents a \"much bigger real estate platform which over time provides a bigger engine of growth\".\n\nDescribing the deal as transformational, Ms Chew said that while STC's current properties are \"high- quality, they are low-yielding investments with limited growth opportunities\".\n\nBoth parties hope that with the strategic partnership and increased assets under management (AUM), Straits Real Estate will grow to support up to $10 billion of new ARA private funds over time.\n\n\"STC will remain a holding company,\" Ms Chew said at the press briefing, with its three core businesses still in tin smelting, hospitality and real estate. The group's tin smelting business is held under separately listed Malaysia Smelting Corp Bhd. The group's hospitality division recently sold Rendezvous Grand Hotel in Singapore and Rendezvous Gallery to Far East Hospitality Trust for $217 million in cash and $68 million of units in the trust, and formed an alliance with Far East Group to set up a hospitality joint venture to expand in the Asia Pacific.\n\nOn May 13, STC accepted UE Centennial Venture's offer to buy its 44.58 per cent stake in WBL Corp for $4.50 per share, and reaped gross proceeds of $509 million from the sale.\n\nAccording to STC, the acquisition of ARA and the formation of Straits Real Estate are in line with the group's strategy to invest in well managed and sound businesses. The co-investment vehicle will also provide seed capital for property funds to be managed by ARA.\n\nAt $294.4 million, the deal values ARA at $1.7326 per share, and is at a slight discount to the $1.75 close on Oct 25. Both ARA and STC were suspended yesterday for the announcement.\n\nAt these price levels, ARA has an estimated market capitalisation of $1.48 billion. Besides Cheung Kong, John Lim and STC, its other shareholders include Matthews International, Franklin Resources and Alphine Woods Capital.\n\nAs a real estate fund manager, ARA's focus has been investing in publicly- listed Reits and private real estate funds. Its key Reits investments include Singapore-listed Fortune REIT and Suntec REIT, Hongkong-listed Prosperity REIT, while private real estate funds include ARA Asia Dragon Fund, ARA Dragon Fund II and ARA Harmony Fund.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Htay Aung found himself sucked into a scorching maelstrom of debris.\n\n\"I felt my body go up into the air and then drop. Fire was all around me,\" recalled Htay Aung, who is now 19 and lives with the effects of burns across his head and body. His uncle, who was driving that day, was killed.\n\nThe crash, which also gutted the jet, killed one passenger and injured eight, most of them foreign tourists, capped off a horror year for air safety in Myanmar. Out of the country's tiny fleet of domestic commercial aircraft, four were involved in serious accidents last year, one of them causing death.\n\nBut the appalling safety rate has hardly dented a broader trend in Myanmar's aviation industry: spectacular growth. After decades under the thumb of xenophobic generals, one of Asia's last frontiers of commercial aviation is opening up.\n\nPassenger numbers are surging as new airlines spring up and foreign carriers rush in. Some officials and executives talk grandly of turning Myanmar into a regional hub.\n\nThe country, however, appears ill-prepared for the pace of change, putting both safety - and the prospects of many hopeful airlines - at risk.\n\n\"They've opened up, in my personal opinion, far before they're ready for it,\" said Shukor Yusof, an analyst who specialises in the aviation sector for credit-ratings agency Standard & Poor's in Singapore.\n\n\"The infrastructure is not there to cope with demand. There's going to be a point where it's going to get choked up,\" he said, adding that safety is \"not going to improve any time soon.\"\n\nIn the 2011/12 peak winter season for foreign tourists, who are driving much of the growth, there were 50,000 seats per week in and out of Myanmar provided by 13 international airlines, including flag carrier Myanmar Airways International (MAI), according the Capa Centre for Aviation, which advises airlines, and flight industry database Innovata.\n\nLast year, that jumped to 80,000 seats, with Capa predicting it will surpass 100,000 this winter. The number of international airlines in the country nearly doubled to 23 as at early this month, with MAI and Golden Myanmar the only locals.\n\nThere are signs too many airlines are entering at once, meaning the number could shrink in coming years as some carriers merge or die off, said Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at Capa.\n\nWin Swe Tun, deputy director of Myanmar's Department of Civil Aviation (DCA), is shockingly candid about Myanmar's air accident rate. \"It's nine times higher\" than the global average, he said.\n\nIn the 1950s, Yangon, then known as Rangoon, was South-east Asia's aviation hub. But after the military seized power in 1962, civilian aviation entered a long decline.\n\nInternational isolation made it hard to deal directly with manufacturers, import equipment, train staff or finance infrastructure. Some of those problems were lifted with the end of European Union sanctions this year. The US has suspended sanctions, but not ended them entirely.\n\nState-run Myanma Airways, a domestic airline that partly owns international flag carrier MAI, grounded its three Chinese-made Xian MA60s last year after two of the turboprop aircraft suffered accidents on landing within a month, said Win Swe Tun.\n\nThe purchase of the aircraft in 2010 was a direct result of sanctions, he added.\n\nLocally owned airlines began to emerge before the advent of a quasi-civilian government in 2011. Many, like Myanma Airways, are losing money. Seven carriers, six of them private, are operating regular flights. Four more domestic airlines are planned.\n\nInternational airlines are jostling to get in.\n\nVietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co, Vietnam's only privately owned airline, is in talks with an unidentified local carrier. Thai AirAsia has entered into joint venture talks with \"some potential partners\", said Tassapon Bijleveld, chief executive of the unit of Malaysia's AirAsia Bhd.\n\nJapan's ANA Holdings Inc (ANA) announced in August it was buying 49 per cent - the maximum under Myanmar law - of tiny domestic carrier Asian Wings. The new deal will add international routes and expand its fleet with jets and turboprop.\n\nAs Myanmar's skies get busier, so are its antiquated and under-funded airports. Only three of Myanmar's 33 airports - Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyitaw - are international. Others often lack bigger runways, advanced navigation and safety equipment and adequate security.\n\nYangon airport, the country's busiest, is already over its annual capacity of 2.7 million passengers, accepting 3.1 million last year.\n\nA US$150 million upgrade to Yangon airport was recently awarded to a consortium led by an affiliate of Asia World, a conglomerate run by Tun Myint Naing, also known as Steven Law, the US-sanctioned son of the late drug kingpin-turned-tycoon Lo Hsing Han. A Japanese consortium has been charged with revamping Mandalay's airport, seen as a future logistics hub.\n\nThe big project, however, is a plan to build a new US$1.5 billion airport for Yangon at Hanthawaddy, north-east of the city, a job given to a consortium headed by South Korea's state-run Incheon International Airport Corp.\n\nThe new airport will be designed to handle 12 million passengers a year on its opening in 2018, and will eventually become a regional hub in its own right, handling 30 million passengers annually by 2030, Win Swe Tun said. That compares with 48 million passengers at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport and 51 million at Singapore's Changi Airport.\n\nHeho Airport, where Air Bagan crashed last December, shows just how far Myanmar has to go.\n\nAs airlines queue up to enter the country, the biggest international carrier flying to Myanmar, Thai Airways, sounded a note of caution. Infrastructure constraints mean there is \"not now\" any money to be made on domestic routes, executive vice-president Chokchai Panyayong told Reuters.\n\n\"I think in a couple of years we'll move in,\" he said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/gst-laudable-step-taken-najib", "site_title": "GST - A laudable step taken by Najib", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGST - A laudable step taken by Najib\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Oct 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAFTER years of debate on its feasibility, Malaysia has finally opted for a broad-based goods and services tax (GST) at a relatively high level of 6 per cent. Given that the country has one of Asia's highest debt-to-GDP (gross domestic product) ratios at 54.8 per cent in 2013 - just below its own legal limit of 55 per cent - Prime Minister Najib Razak may not have had much choice. Rating agency Fitch had warned of a possible sovereign-debt downgrade in July.\n\nThe new tax system will come into force in April 2015. It will replace the sales and service taxes. Generally, anyone with a family and earning RM4,000 (S$1,575) or less per month will no longer need to pay any income tax. From 2016, the corporate tax rate will be cut by one percentage point, from 25 per cent to 24 per cent. And for small and medium enterprises, the reduction will be from 20 per cent to 19 per cent from the year of assessment 2016.\n\nUnlike other jurisdictions with a similar tax system, there is a substantial list of exemptions. Rice, sugar, salt, flour and cooking oil are to be excluded. Government services such as passports, licences and, remarkably, highway tolls are also to be GST-free. Inevitably, it will add complexity to the system and, thus, it is significant that the start date is 18 months hence. The tax authorities will need time to gear up. It is going to be no mean feat, given the political realities in Malaysia. In effect, the GST makes every business a tax-collection point as well. It will take some doing to get the system in place to ensure that the right amount is collected and regularly handed over to the government.\n\nMalaysia's 13th General Election may be out of the way, but Mr Najib's administration clearly understands that the urban vote was decidedly against the ruling coalition. How some of these people, who make up the merchant class, will respond to tax inspectors checking up on their compliance after April 1, 2015, remains to be seen. Mr Najib could take a leaf from other jurisdictions with GST systems that have overcome the problem. In this region, Taiwan has probably one of the best systems for ensuring compliance. The island imposes a 10 per cent GST - with very few exemptions - and compliance is ensured by running a lottery based on sale-receipt numbers. Thus every customer has an incentive to demand a receipt for every transaction. Sales are thus recorded and the government gets its fair share of revenue.\n\nMr Najib should be lauded for having taken a significant step towards repairing Malaysia's finances. He has been trying to balance the nation's budget by slashing subsidies since 2010. Two of the biggest items - fuel subsidy for vehicles at some RM17 billion last year and spending by non-financial public enterprises, companies that are owned or controlled by the government and statutory bodies that will soak up RM93 billion or a massive 9.4 per cent of the GDP this year - should be in his sights the next time around.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The launch of Asian foreign exchange futures on SGX enables customers to manage both currency and equity risks in the same clearing house.\n\nRichard Vine, head of Asia-Pacific futures at ICAP Singapore, said: \"Volumes and interest in listed foreign exchange futures are continuing to grow, and the introduction of these contracts by SGX comes at an opportune time for all market participants. (We) expect substantial regional demand for these products.\"\n\nSGX's introduction of Asian foreign exchange futures is in line with global G-20 regulatory reforms, under which all standardised over-the-counter derivative contracts are to be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms and cleared through central counter-parties.\n\nThe trading of foreign exchange derivatives on a regulated exchange platform will promote greater transparency and better serve investment and risk-management needs in the Asian time zone, SGX said.\n\nIn the next few quarters, it plans to introduce new Asean equity index futures and to have dynamic circuit breakers available by early next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These will account for about 6.39 per cent of the further-enlarged issued and paid-up share capital.\n\nThe price represents a 9.6 per cent discount to the volume-weighted average price of 83.56 cents of trades done last Thursday, before the signing of the placement agreement on Friday.\n\nPrimePartners Corporate Finance and UOB Kay Hian Private are the co-placement agents.\n\n\"We are rapidly growing our portfolio of concessions and the proceeds from our IPO (initial public offering) in July 2013 will be accounted for with our committed drilling programme in the Middle East, Trinidad and Norway and interests in new concessions that we have since acquired,\" said Mr Lidgren.\n\n\"The proceeds from the private placement will give us the fire power to realise our aspirations to further grow our portfolio of assets, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, and to work with other established industry players.\"\n\nRex International shares ended trading seven cents lower at 78 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of this, 12 per cent of the buyers were offshore investors - half from Australia and the other half from South-east Asia, said Mr Young.\n\n\"Put simply, the local demand is extremely strong, as well as interest from South-east Asia and Mainland China,\" he said.\n\nQueens Residences, which offers 273 residential units in the heart of Auckland's central business district, was launched in early August and met with similar success.\n\nNew Zealand attracts investors due to its transparent and stable business environment and positive outlook with consistent economic growth, strong currency, and population growth, noted Mr Young.\n\nOther factors, such as the country's transparent real estate sector, favourable long-term economic indicators, lack of land tax and stamp or conveyance duties, add to its allure.\n\nThe fact that the property market is at the bottom of its property cycle helps too.\n\n\"According to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, the Auckland median dwelling price has increased a remarkable 103 per cent over the last 10 years, and is predicted to continue. We have waited some four years for the New Zealand property market to strengthen,\" said Mr Young.\n\nIndeed, Singapore has now replaced Japan as the fourth largest foreign investor in New Zealand, according to Statistics New Zealand, which show that total foreign direct investment from South-east Asia hit NZ$4.4 billion (S$4.5 billion) in the first three months of 2013, up from NZ$2.8 billion a year before.\n\nCanada too has seen a surge in interest from Asian investors.\n\nAccording to Virata Gamany, director of Vision International Properties, a breakdown of buyers of some of its recent projects showed that roughly 35 per cent of the units were bought by Asian investors.\n\nIts latest project, Sage Gardens condominium in St Alberta for instance, saw all the units set aside for Asian investors snapped up.\n\nDuring its Asian tour - for which 25 units of its Phase 1 launch was reserved - the developer sold 17 units in Malaysia, and 15 units in Singapore. As a result, it had to cancel the planned preview for Hong Kong which was scheduled for the following weekend.\n\nOn the broader investment front, Singaporean investors have returned to the Australian property market with a vengeance, snapping up some US$585 million worth of real estate - comprising all commercial property transactions above US$10 million - between January and September this year, according to CBRE data.\n\nThis is a 105 per cent increase compared with the same period last year, noted Petra Blazkova, head of research for Singapore and South-east Asia at CBRE\n\n\"Since the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, the liquidity has returned to the market and the first wave of strong appetite for Australian real estate from Sngaporeans appeared in 2011,\" she added.\n\nOf the different commercial assets, investors have flocked to the office class (63 per cent of overall investment), followed by retail (22 per cent), and industrial (9 per cent).\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, key cities such as Sydney (40 per cent of overall investment) and Perth (27 per cent) continued to draw the most investor dollars, followed by Melbourne (18 per cent) and Brisbane (12 per cent).\n\n\"Strong investment activity is likely to continue on its trajectory in Q4 2013 and beyond as some large deals are in the pipeline. That said, the weight of capital and the race for core assets has been pushing down yields. As a result we may see some of the interest shifting to the suburban markets and Grade B assets but Sydney and Melbourne still remain the key target,\" said Reid Mackay, CBRE executive director.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The cap is to ensure there is sufficient electricity reserve (from the gencos) to back up the intermittent energy sources and ensure power system stability.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nUS: Nasdaq hits new record as markets shrug off tariff talk\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:13 AM\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

Mr Tan will provide strategic counsel and leadership in developing the team's management capabilities.\n\nPreviously, Mr Chia - who is also an executive director at Far East - reported to group CEO Philip Ng. As COO, Mr Chia has been responsible for the business planning and positioning of the sale of Far East's residential, commercial and industrial properties, and the steering of its marketing activities regionally and locally.\n\nWhen contacted by BT, Far East confirmed the changes, which will officially kick in when Mr Chia leaves for Guocoland next year.\n\nLast Friday, Guocoland announced that current head honcho Quek Chee Hoon is retiring from the company after 15 years, and will leave his post on Jan 31 next year. Mr Quek told BT that he was diagnosed with early-stage kidney cancer last year, and has received treatment but wants to \"take things easy\".\n\nMs Shaw has spent 10 years with Far East, during which she has been involved with its serviced apartments and leasing business before becoming a director in its property sales team. Like Mr Chia, she worked at Singapore Airlines before joining the property developer.\n\nSources in the property market whom BT spoke to say that Ms Shaw has played a major role behind the scenes in helping Far East with its residential sales in the last few years.\n\nSaid one market player, who declined to be named: \"Lay See, working under Boon Kuah, has played a key role in helping Far East achieve a lot of the good sales it has seen in the last three years or so.\"\n\nFar East has been the top seller of private homes in Singapore in the last few years. Last year, it topped the table with 2,181 transactions - accounting for about 10 per cent of the 22,290 new homes sold, with The Hillier in Hillview and Watertown in Punggol among its star projects.\n\nBT understands that Far East is also looking to strengthen its administrative processes, and will name Oh Thay Lee, currently its group general manager and director of corporate affairs, as group director of administration from Nov 1.\n\nThe latter is a newly created title which includes oversight in Far East's overseas administrative operations such as in Indonesia and China.\n\nAs he takes on the new title, Mr Oh will relinquish his responsibilities at corporate affairs to better focus on boosting Far East's processes. His position at corporate affairs will be taken over by Edwin Koh, currently the department's deputy director.\n\nFar East's decision to strengthen its administration capabilities comes amid its expansion both locally and regionally, and the need therefore to ensure that its backroom systems are in place to keep up with the expansion.\n\nMuch of the expansion involves its hospitality operations. Just last week, Far East Hospitality Management said that it will launch three Singapore hotels over the next three months. These are the Village Hotel Katong in the Marine Parade/East Coast area, Amoy at Far East Square in the Chinatown/\n\nCBD area, and a relaunch of the Rendezvous Grand Hotel in the Bras Basah area - which Far East Hospitality Trust (FEHT) acquired recently from The Straits Trading Company.\n\nFar East Hospitality is the hospitality management arm of main board-listed Far East Orchard (FEOrchard). Far East owns about 52 per cent of units in FEHT.\n\nIn August this year, a 70:30 joint venture company between FEOrchard and The Straits Trading Company completed its 50:50 joint venture with Australia-based Toga Group, expanding Far East Hospitality's portfolio to 72 properties and 10,600 rooms under management.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

How can Asia, and Singapore in particular, build a culture of shareholder activism in enhancing corporate governance?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Oct 27, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTan Chong Huat\n\nManaging Partner\n\nRHTLaw Taylor Wessing\n\nA culture of responsible shareholder activism is not built in a day, or even in a few years. Minority shareholders in Singapore are becoming more vocal, but to build a culture of responsible shareholder activism requires the long-term participation of all stakeholders, such as boards, directors, regulators, investors and even the media. Instead of pitting stakeholders against one another or stakeholders working in silos, it is timely to explore whether a cross-functional committee comprising representatives from each stakeholder should be set up to discuss ideas or collaborate on ways to promote responsible and effective shareholder activism. Also, while efforts have been made to inform investors about their rights, training programmes should also be organised for directors to let them understand that responsible shareholder activism is to be welcomed, not feared.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nDRASTIC changes need to be implemented before Asia - and Singapore, in particular - can build a healthy and positive culture of shareholder activism in enhancing corporate governance.\n\nIt starts with the board having a majority of independent directors (IDs). The chairman should ideally be an ID. These IDs should not be linked to the majority shareholders in any way, such as the old boys' network. It is not true that there is a shortage of qualified and experienced IDs.\n\nOn important matters such as investments, mergers and acquisitions, delistings, remuneration and appointment of IDs, the majority or founding shareholders should abstain from voting. The risk of minority shareholders not supporting such important matters is low when there is a high level of independence on the board.\n\nThe proposed changes are easier said than done. The issue of protecting minority shareholders' interests is a complex one. While there is no panacea for it, a ''many helping hands'' approach should be promoted and encouraged. In this regard, key stakeholders such as the Securities Investors Association and the Singapore Institute of Directors have a vital role to play - to advance minority shareholders' interests by providing another mechanism of check and balance, to complement existing regulations and listing rules.\n\nUltimately, it is about how robust our corporate governance regime is. Herein lies the challenge for all key stakeholders to tackle: not to over-regulate while ensuring that the required standard of corporate governance is met to protect all shareholders.\n\nDavid Gerald\n\nFounder, President and CEO\n\nSecurities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS)\n\nTHE fear of minority shareholders of the tyranny of the majority should no longer be a major concern. Since the founding of SIAS in 1999, many minority shareholder issues have been resolved in the boardroom and not the courtroom. Today, companies are sitting up and listening to SIAS, which pursues a responsible shareholder activism stance, often achieving a win-win resolution. Minority shareholders together, therefore, have a strong voice.\n\nMore importantly, the brand of activism in Singapore - one of reconciliation and not confrontation - seems to achieve much more than what the traditional contentious brand of activism, more common in the West, has. The recent changes to the Code of Corporate Governance recognised for the first time shareholders' rights and responsibilities as a new regulatory principle. The Code, in fact, requires boards to encourage shareholders to actively participate at meetings and to engage them regularly outside the statutory meetings. Companies are also required to implement an investor relations policy and state in their annual reports the steps taken to solicit, and understand, the views of shareholders through analyst briefings, investor road shows and Investors' Day briefings.\n\nOver the last decade or so, there has been a marked improvement in the participation of individual shareholders at meetings. Boards and senior management are responding to their calls, perhaps not immediately but usually in good time. SIAS has been providing regular training for our members on how to understand and interpret the annual report, and pose relevant and useful questions at meetings to help the board understand the expectations and aspirations of shareholders. SIAS also provides independent commentaries on company annual reports to help shareholders raise relevant and important questions at annual general meetings. These are all important initiatives that go towards raising corporate governance standards in Singapore.\n\nMagnus Bocker\n\nCEO\n\nSingapore Exchange (SGX)\n\nOVER the years, it is encouraging to note that shareholders in Singapore have formed an even ''stronger'' voice and become more active in engaging their companies. In supporting this voice, SGX will continuously introduce initiatives to strengthen Singapore's corporate governance practice and enhance shareholder engagement. We also work closely with leading agencies like SIAS to understand and reach out to investors.\n\nAs an international financial centre serving global investors, Singapore has an important and unique responsibility in maintaining a robust platform that gives trust and veracity. I urge corporate leaders, regulators, professional agencies and investors in Asia to come together to explore how we can work collectively to instill good governance and promote shareholder activism across our markets.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nTHE interests of all stakeholders, not just shareholders (whether majority or minority) must be considered as companies embark on best practices corporate governance. Managing stakeholder relations does not necessarily mean that every group's interests is served but to consider their interests sufficiently to gain buy-in and inspire them to put forth their best effort and support. Engagement with stakeholders can be done not only through annual general meetings but also organised group forums or other communiques so that there is full transparency and accountability for decisions made.\n\nUltimately, corporate governance is everyone's business - from boards and management to shareholders to regulators to market watchers - and activism on everyone's part, when practised with the right motivation and taken in the right perspective, can contribute to a more robust corporate governance ecosystem.\n\nJoe Poon\n\nPresident\n\nXchanging, South-east Asia\n\nSHAREHOLDERS are becoming better informed and more assertive in their expectations in terms of corporate communication on shareholder policies and business strategy. However, minority shareholders may still find it challenging to voice their opinions due to a lack of influence and voting power.\n\nWith globalisation, companies now have to be able to operate in different countries with varying levels of corporate governance and regulation. With this comes extra scrutiny, and it is thus important for corporations to demonstrate exemplary governance measures, which can be achieved by proactively engaging all shareholders both big and small.\n\nGreater shareholder involvement creates the need for increased transparency and corporate disclosures, as well as well-documented systems, processes and best practices so as to ensure that shareholders' expectations are consistently met and fulfilled.\n\nProf Mak Yuen Teen\n\nFormer Founding Director of Corporate Governance and Financial Reporting Centre (CGFRC),\n\nAssociate Professor of Accounting, NUS Business School\n\nSMALL investors will naturally have little power to influence corporate decisions. However, in order to build a robust capital market, we must have strong rules and enforcement for protecting minority investors - and we should look at how we can improve their ability to seek redress if the rights are violated.\n\nI think this is improving in many markets in Asia, often through shareholder bodies such as SIAS here and MSWG (Minority Shareholder Watchdog Group) in Malaysia. However, there is also a role for individual shareholders - perhaps through investor education at universities and through events organised by shareholder associations like SIAS. In addition, business schools should start coaching students about attending general meetings and asking good questions - I'm thinking of doing that through my corporate governance course at NUS.\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nSHAREHOLDER rights continue to have prominence as highlighted in the Singapore Code of Corporate Governance, and it is being asserted through shareholder meetings. While shareholder activism may be relatively mild in Asia with a less assertive culture and with most listed companies being family or state-controlled, there is traction in Singapore with the growth of proxy advisory companies and shareholder associations.\n\nContinuous education of shareholder rights through seminars will result in more intelligent questions raised, minimising blind voting on corporate decisions. With the rise of a more financially literate population amid a demanding financial climate, shareholder activism can enhance corporate governance.\n\nAng Hao Yao\n\nDirector\n\nTrader Investment Pte Ltd\n\nMINORITY shareholders of listed companies should actively participate in the activities of corporate governance and investor bodies. They can also voice their opinions on website forums and in social media groups. While it may be easy for a company to brush aside one small investor, it would be difficult to ignore a well-organised group of investors presenting a common, strong and reasonable position. These groups should also rope in the larger minority shareholders and institutional investors to add voting clout.\n\nAs for investors in unit trusts, they should be discerning and invest in funds that have strong engagement practices of attending and voting at shareholder meetings and participating in corporate governance initiatives.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE'S Code of Corporate Governance was recently updated, and it is important to review and revise it periodically to keep in step with international best practices, especially if we want to position the country as a strong financial hub. While the Code provides a good foundation for corporate governance, it does, after all, represent the minimum that companies are expected to abide by.\n\nTo build a culture of shareholder activism against a backdrop of enhanced corporate governance, both parties - companies and individual shareholders - need to do their part. Companies should strive to do more than just comply with the Code; they should actively work towards aligning their internal control measures with international standards. Certainly, this is easier said than done, particularly when it is a voluntary move and companies are not being threatened to do so with a stick.\n\nThus, for their part, shareholders need to demand good corporate governance, be it in the form of activism or by sending a signal to the market by choosing to invest in companies that exhibit good corporate governance. But this needs to be done en masse or there will be little impact.\n\nWhat is really needed is a collective paradigm shift and positive reinforcement aided by greater awareness and education via the media and other avenues such as the Singapore Corporate Awards, which recognise and celebrate excellence in corporate governance.\n\nAt the end of the day, shareholders - especially minority shareholders who cannot afford to incur major personal financial losses - should always remember the principle of caveat emptor. As the buyer, you must take responsibility for managing your own risks and you need to do your due diligence on the company before investing in it.\n\nNicholas McGrath\n\nCEO\n\nAIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit\n\nWE believe that continuous disclosure, high corporate governance standards and transparency are fundamental to building trust and confidence among investors. These principles should apply equally to all participants - minority shareholders as well as institutional investors.\n\nWe welcome opportunities to talk to both minority and institutional investors about our investment strategy, financials and corporate developments. All shareholders have a right to enquire about the health of their investments and should be respected as beneficial owners. I'm often impressed by the quality of questions from our retail investors at our annual general meetings.\n\nInvestor Days are another platform where we engage retail investors. We hold regular roadshows to present our investment strategy to existing and potential institutional investors. Our investor relations function plays a key role in developing and maintaining strong relationships with the investment community.\n\nRachel Eng\n\nJoint Managing Partner\n\nWongPartnership LLP\n\nA KEY tenet of company law is that the powers of managing a company is vested in the executive management, not the shareholders. Nevertheless, shareholders have the right to be heard.\n\nIn the past, shareholders tended to be reticent and, at times, apathetic during general meetings. More recently, however, shareholders are posing quality and probing questions to the board and management.\n\nCompanies also hold investors meetings, online forums, etc, to enhance shareholder communication. If both sides continue to play their part well, we will be able to build a culture that gives shareholders a role in enhancing the corporate governance of companies.\n\nRaed S Haddad\n\nManaging Director, Asia-Pacific\n\nESI International\n\nRISK management is essential to raising and ensuring corporate governance standards, and should be thought of as a competitive advantage by organisations when seizing opportunities and optimising business results. Adopting an integrated governance approach can provide a framework for a cross-functional committee of decision makers and stakeholders to achieve oversight, insight and foresight during and across all phases of the investment life cycle, thus allowing for a change of direction if needed.\n\nThe call for transparency means greater scrutiny. Enterprises in Asia can meet the demands of accountability by improving the performance dynamic itself: transforming management into measurement, and using better insight and foresight to address current and future challenges.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nCOMPANIES which practise transparency have a greater advantage over their competitors in the long run. In Singapore, the culture is slowly shifting - we have definitely seen change in recent years. This will certainly be a growing trend. Continued engagement between companies and stakeholders, regular forums and updates will also help build a culture of shareholder activism.\n\nZaheer K Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore and Europe)\n\nQi Group of Companies\n\nIN a June 2000 McKinsey survey, 77 per cent of its Asian respondents listed good board practices as a key element in stock selection. I believe that this view has since grown stronger. Corporate governance and management accountability are industry watchwords which should have, at their heart, shareholder interests.\n\nMinority shareholders have become sophisticated, and recent regulatory amendments to the Code of Corporate Governance have helped ensure that shareholders have a louder voice. Clearer disclosure and better investor relations to understand shareholder views are strong enactments towards corporate transparency.\n\nOn their part, shareholders should push for more information, clarity, independence and for strong internal controls and risk management. The entire effort will, initially, hinge on the help of the regulatory framework in the Code, the oversight of the Singapore Exchange, and organisations such as SIAS. Over time, strong board professionalism and corporate governance should eventually prevail.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nTHE culture of shareholder activism matures with the state of development of the country and sophistication of the financial ecosystem. Financial play is the domain of educated and sophisticated investors. Activism must come complete with knowledge of corporate governance matters and the rules of the game.\n\nIn Asia, shareholder activism is stronger in the more mature economies such as Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. But you don't see as much combative minority action in Asia as, say, in the United States.\n\nStill, minority voices are increasingly heard across Asia, though they still belong in the minor league. As the minority voices gather in the form of organised bodies, they can become a powerful pack, like in the case of SIAS.\n\nThe power of the minority voices comes from knowledge and the right to demand disclosure and transparency. Those who have vested interests in the shares of companies generally have to accept the majority rule - but the power of the pack protects their interests and ensures that they are treated fairly. The power of association lies in the pack so long as minority shareholders can form a bargainable bloc to represent their interests. The power of the pack comes from knowing the game and knowing how to play to the rules of the game.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman / Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nYES, minority shareholders do have a voice at annual general meetings, which are excellent platforms to voice their concerns. But individual shareholders may not know enough for a close scrutiny of the company. In this case, independent directors should play a larger role, especially if they are part of the audit committee. They represent other shareholders' interests and would be in a better position to monitor the company's performance and spot any irregularitiy. With their help, shareholders would then have more detailed and relevant information. They can then make a more informed decision as to whether they should continue their investment.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, given (about) 90 per cent occupancy, we do not expect a correction in rents either.\"\n\nTurning to retail properties, Credit Suisse said it continues to favour suburban malls, which will benefit from the rising affluence of the population. It is least positive on downtown malls as a result of the intense competition, evidenced by higher vacancies in the second quarter. Rents could come under pressure.\n\nIn residential property, Credit Suisse expects headline prices to be resilient in the near term, \"given the low system vacancy and healthy household balance sheet\".\n\nWhile sales may come down about 30 per cent from last year to between 15,000 and 16,000 units this year, Credit Suisse does not expect an oversupply, \"as we believe the government will try to balance between ensuring housing remains affordable, and not crashing prices due to high ownership\".\n\nIt added that in the last four decades, property prices have not fallen more than 5 per cent except when there is a shock to the system.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The number of units in deficit in the market has risen from around 5,174 units in 2006 to some 142,175 units in 2011.\n\nEven when the full expected supply pipeline comes on board in 2015, Mr Cheong still forecasts a deficit of around 3,765 units, which will support prices.\n\nHe added that even as population growth in Singapore between last June and this June was its lowest in nine years at 1.6 per cent, this will still compound to about 7.1 million people over the next 17 years.\n\nThis compares with planning parameters laid out in the Population White Paper for up to 2030 earlier this year of up to 6.9 million.\n\nAlso, rental demand remains strong. Assuming about 20,000 new employment pass approvals each year, this works out to roughly 6,600 rental units of demand, Mr Cheong said, assuming an average household size of about three.\n\nFrom a technical viewpoint, he believes the market is not overbought.\n\nUsing a benchmark of 80 for the Relative Strength Index of the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Property Price Index, he said current property prices are not at levels before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, nor are they at the extreme peaks seen here in 1980 and 1996.\n\nThere is also plenty of financial firepower still in the market. The cumulative profit for property traders who sold their properties in 2011 after buying them in the years leading up to that from 2005 was about $709 million, according to Savills research.\n\n\"So there is a lot of hidden wealth still in Singapore,\" Mr Cheong said.\n\nOn the supply side, the top five local developers controlled nearly 48 per cent of new property sales in 2011, he noted.\n\n\"The developers have (a) very strong balance sheet, very strong holding power. (The) market is controlled in some sense.\"\n\nWith a new total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework in place and land getting more expensive, \"it's not easy for a new entrant to come into the real estate market anymore\".\n\nBut Mr Cheong acknowledged that the increasing entry of foreign developers last year has had an impact. That said, he doubts developers will sit idle if these foreign players continue to be aggressive in land bidding.\n\nOverall, Mr Cheong believes that even if there was excess supply, developers would still wield some controlling power, and that there would not be a crash - \"unless you scare the hell out of the supply side and then the supply side (is) forced to dump\".\n\n\"It will only happen through an exogenous event or when banks pull the line,\" he said, adding that excess supply may cause prices to \"stabilise or come off a little bit\".\n\nHowever, Mr Cheong says the pace of sales will not be as torrid as it has been, and that releases will be more spread out over time. In areas that have seen three or four launches, sales may be slower due to saturation.\n\nIn terms of opportunity, he favours shoebox apartments, which he said can generate a yield spread of about one per cent over condominium units. More and more expatriates are coming in with no housing allowance, he said, and may prefer these smaller units.\n\nMr Cheong also urged investors not to short-sell their homes. The upside for going long on one's home is about 156 per cent, versus about 24.8 per cent from going short.\n\n\"The numbers are stacking up against you trying to short your own home.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That would make it easier to set up communication infrastructure for customers scattered worldwide, and cut costs linked to dealing with individual providers.\n\nThe deal announced yesterday is the latest in a string of acquisitions by Japanese firms, including mobile carrier SoftBank's US$21.6 billion takeover of US-based SprintNextel earlier this year.\n\nLast month, drinks giant Suntory said that it would buy the top-selling Lucozade and Ribena brands from British drugs firm GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for US$2.1 billion, while bathroom giant Lixil Group agreed to scoop up Germany's Grohe in a US$4.1 billion deal.\n\nThe moves are aimed at expanding beyond Japan's borders, where firms are wrestling with unfavourable demographics as the population rapidly ages while the birth rate falls.\n\nDespite a sharp decline in the yen since the start of the year, the Japanese currency's historically high levels in recent years made firms' overseas acquisitions relatively cheaper. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

The report is based on a survey of more than 5,000 data centre professionals.\n\nSlightly over half of the investment was made in facility equipment and solutions, while the rest was split almost evenly between IT optimisation and outsourcing.

About 12,250 people work in and around data centres here.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan (APEJ) region, the report noted that data centre investment grew to US$19.2 billion in 2013, at a slower rate of 10.3 per cent over last year, compared to the 28.9 per cent increase recorded in 2012.\n\nIn the region, data centre white space - which comprises all data centres including co-location and end user enterprise data centres but excludes server rooms - grew 7 per cent to 5.09 million sq m in 2013. Mainland China and India had the largest expansion with 24 per cent and 10 per cent respectively while Australia and New Zealand saw a fall in space due to consolidation projects and an increased uptake of outsourced solutions.\n\nTotal power requirement by data centres in the region rose to 6,075 megawatts (MW) at a slower rate of 4.7 per cent over last year, compared to the 24.4 per cent surge seen in 2012.\n\nInterestingly, Singapore had one of the largest increases in power requirements at 9.3 per cent. According to Nicola Hayes, managing director of DCD Intelligence, this is a result of older facilities built to specifications where efficiency was not necessarily high on the agenda in the design and build phase, unlike newer facilities being built in mainland China and India.\n\nHowever, she pointed out that more data centre owners and operators are increasing their energy monitoring practices, with 70 per cent of organisations here continuously monitoring energy efficiency, compared to just 51 per cent last year.\n\nGiven the heavy use of energy by data centres, where the energy cost can make up 50 per cent of the operating cost, concerns arise over the effectiveness of PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness), a metric used to determine the energy efficiency of a data centre. This is the total energy used by a data centre divided by the energy used by IT equipment in that data centre.\n\nA Digital Realty survey conducted earlier this year among 100 respondents found that the average PUE of data centres in Singapore is 2.61. That means that for every watt of IT power, another 1.61 watts are used for cooling, lighting and other ancillary functions. An ideal PUE is 1.0, which means all of the energy is used for computing.\n\nHowever, PUE does not measure how efficiently the IT equipment is performing; power that is going to IT equipment does not mean the equipment is efficiently utilised.\n\nMs Hayes added that PUE does not measure how green data centres are. \"You can have a very, very efficient data centre from a PUE perspective that is completely un-green from the fact that it uses all dirty energy. You can have a very inefficient data centre that is the greenest and completely runs on renewable sources of energy.\"\n\nThe Building and Construction Authority (BCA) is also lending a hand to local data centres trying to improve their energy efficiency by test-bedding emerging technologies in its zero energy building.\n\nStephen Mok, deputy director of BCA's Centre for Sustainable Buildings and Construction Research Group, said that it has installed in the building a lighting and control system from Redwood Systems that not only powers and controls lights but also uses devices that provide multi-sensor capabilities to monitor light, temperature, motion and power consumption. Data is transmitted through a low-voltage cable and the system can be integrated with building management systems like cooling and ventilation for better power optimisation.\n\nAccording to Brent Boekestein, director of global markets for Redwood Systems, the lighting and control system can potentially bring about 50-80 per cent in lighting savings. Lighting makes up 3-6 per cent of a data centre spending on energy. Mr Boekestein said that the Redwood platform will be used in a data centre and an entire office building which are currently under construction in Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/macquarie-eyes-slice-aussie-banks-home-mortgage-pie", "site_title": "Macquarie eyes a slice of Aussie banks' home mortgage pie", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMacquarie eyes a slice of Aussie banks' home mortgage pie\n\nMove comes as the investment bank diversifies into less risky areas\n\nPublished Mon, Oct 28, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SYDNEY] Australia's largest investment bank Macquarie Group Ltd is pushing rapidly into home mortgages, threatening to disrupt a highly profitable segment of the banking industry long dominated by the country's top four lenders.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia, National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) and Westpac Banking Corp are on track to report a combined record profit for the fifth consecutive year. Part of the profit stems from their leading positions in the country's US$1.25 trillion mortgage market.\n\nTogether, the four write as much as 90 per cent of the nation's home loans. They typically make a profit of almost A$75,000 (S$89,000) over the lifetime of an average sized 25-year home loan, excluding fees charged, according to estimates by The Australia Institute, a Canberra-based think tank.\n\nThe prospect of such lucrative gains appears to have enticed Macquarie to expand rapidly into residential mortgages in its own backyard this year. Such a move, analysts say, has the potential to shake up the industry, offering borrowers a competitive alternative to the Big Four.\n\n\"Macquarie is probably the standout and the more aggressive mortgage lender at the moment,\" said Paul Dowling, principal analyst at East & Partners. The research firm says that the investment bank is deploying \"considerable cash balances\".\n\nA Macquarie spokeswoman declined to comment on the bank's moves in the mortgage sector.\n\nMacquarie's share in mortgages for investment purposes jumped 25 per cent in the three months to July alone, although that still only accounts for 1.1 per cent of the overall investor mortgage market, UBS analysts have calculated.\n\nIts push comes as Macquarie diversifies away from investment banking into less risky areas, and is seen as smart use of capital when return on equity from the mortgage market is high. The investment bank also has more liquidity, giving it a strong base to fund home loans.\n\nOther firms too are delving deeper into Australia's home loans market, including mortgage group Yellow Brick Road Holdings Ltd, 14.9 per cent-owned by Macquarie, and the Australian arms of ING Groep NV and Citigroup Inc.\n\nTo raise more funds to lend to homebuyers, those smaller lenders are now securitising mortgages in a market which came to a halt just a few years ago after the global financial crisis spooked investors and lifted the cost of funding to exorbitant levels.\n\nWhile funding costs are still significantly more expensive than in 2006 before the crisis, they have sufficiently fallen from the peak to allow small lenders to take a crack at the Big Four's stranglehold of the home loans market.\n\nThe Big Four haven't always had such dominance. Before the crisis, smaller lenders had 30 per cent of the market. They included Australian regional banks such as St George Bank, Suncorp Metway and Adelaide Bendigo Bank, and non-bank lenders such as Resimac and FirstMac.\n\nAustralian arms of international lending institutions were also part of the group, with Citi and ING able to gain a solid presence even without the brand recognition in the country that Macquarie enjoys.\n\nTalk that Australia's housing market is in a bubble has intensified with a spike in an index for home prices in the country's major cities to an unprecedented high as well as close to record auction clearances in parts of Sydney.\n\nFinancial authorities have sought to quash such talk, with the central bank calling it \"unrealistically alarmist\". But the fears themselves are real and the banks' earnings over the next two weeks will be scrutinised for any hints as to the health of the mortgage market.\n\nANZ, Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac are on track to report an 8.5 per cent rise in combined full-year cash earnings to A$27.1 billion.\n\nAny shifts in home loan market share for individual banks are also set to go under the microscope, with analysts citing commentary on mortgage demand and pricing from the banks as drivers for share prices.\n\nAustralian mortgages represent 61 per cent of gross loans and advances for Westpac, 60 per cent for Commonwealth Bank, 45 per cent for NAB and 42 per cent for ANZ, according to figures from UBS.\n\nWestpac may be of particular interest after it experienced slower growth in its domestic mortgage book of 3.8 per cent in the 12 months to the end of August, compared to the banking industry average of 5.1 per cent.\n\nIt reports on Nov 4 and is expected to post annual cash earnings, which exclude one-off and non-cash items, of A$7.1 billion, up 7.6 per cent on the year before, according to an average of estimates from three analysts polled by Reuters.\n\nANZ reports today and is projected to book a 9.8 per cent rise in full-year cash earnings of A$6.4 billion. NAB is expected to post a 6.8 per cent rise in annual cash earnings to A$5.8 billion on Thursday.\n\nCommonwealth Bank, the nation's biggest lender by market value, is expected to report first-quarter cash profit on Nov 6 of around A$2.15 billion, up from A$1.85 billion from a year earlier, Morningstar analyst David Ellis has projected.\n\nIt reported full-year cash profit of A$7.82 billion in August.\n\nTwo analysts surveyed by Reuters expect Macquarie, which reports on Nov 1, to log first-half net profit of A$475 million, up 32 per cent from a year earlier. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/dae7ee596699ec92107d007d0af58ca82d8fa064cf824b2364eb8dae29deb279?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "High-stakes: Macquarie's share in mortgages for investment purposes jumped 25% in the three months to July alone, although that still only accounts for 1.1% of the overall investor mortgage market. -\u00a0PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

But in this case, the federal court found that the Act doesn't apply because Hong Leong Finance doesn't have any business or clients in the US, in connection with the Pinnacle Notes.\n\nHLF, in its suit, alleged that Morgan Stanley had persuaded it to sell the Notes (which were ultimately designed to fail) to its customers by emphasising they were \"conservative\" and \"low-risk products\" suitable for middle-class and working-class Singaporeans and small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\nUnder a distribution agreement with the US investment bank, HLF sold S$72.4 million worth of Notes, which later failed, and the Singapore financial firm was ordered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to pay more than S$32 million to customers in compensation.\n\nIn dismissing the case, US District Judge Jesse Furman found there is \"no nexus between (Morgan Stanley's) activities in the United States and the allegedly infringing activities abroad\".\n\n\"At most, Hong Leong Finance alleges that Morgan Stanley issued and structured the Pinnacle Notes from its headquarters in and around New York City. But the gravamen of HLF's Lanham Act claim is false advertising; that is, it rises and falls on whether Morgan Stanley made statements that were 'likely to deceive' or 'likely to confuse investors', not on any statements Morgan Stanley made to HLF,\" he ruled.\n\nJudge Furman pointed out that HLF made no allegations that Morgan Stanley directed any false advertisements from the US to the Singaporean investors.\n\nIn fact, HLF does not allege that Morgan Stanley made any contact with the investors - as opposed to HLF employees - let alone mailed promotional materials to the investors from the US, he noted.\n\nAsked if HLF plans to appeal against the ruling, a company spokesman said it can't comment. Morgan Stanley said that it is pleased that the lawsuit has been dismissed.\n\nDaniel Hume of Kirby McInerney LLP, who represents a group of Singapore Pinnacle Notes investors in a US$154.7 million suit against Morgan Stanley in New York, said that the HLF ruling doesn't impact his case at all.\n\n\"The decision does not comment on the merits of the investors' underlying allegations. It is strictly about jurisdiction and the applicability of the Lanham Act, which are not issues for the investors,\" he said.\n\nThousands of Pinnacle Notes retail investors in Singapore can now join the suit against Morgan Stanley after Judge Furman, who also presides over the case, approved certification of the case as a class action last week.\n\nHe found that the plaintiffs have \"put forth numerous issues that are common to the class, including whether defendants withheld information regarding the Pinnacle Notes' underlying assets from the investors; whether defendants engaged in behaviour that constitutes bad faith\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yale University professor Robert Shiller, one of this year's winners of the Nobel Prize in economics, warned in his 2000 book Irrational Exuberance that bubbles in real estate and the stock market can build up as people imitate one another's buying decisions. Prof Shiller said policy interventions to protect societal interests are justified in the event of a market bubble.\n\nBut when powerful regulatory forces intervene in the functioning of free markets, they can do more harm than good by introducing distortions and inefficiencies. To handle potentially delicate situations, regulators have resorted to using verbal signals and threats instead of actually taking action. Since markets operate on expectations, the mere suggestion of potential action from a credible authority can reassure markets or cool them down. Excessive market volatility resulting from traders second-guessing market authorities can thus be avoided. Hence the US Federal Reserve tries to regularly communicate its intentions on interest rates. European Central Bank president Mario Draghi calmed the European bond markets last year by saying he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save the euro, together with a programme of potentially unlimited bond-buying that was never actually used. With a properly executed communication strategy, regulators can cool febrile markets without using more sledgehammer-like distortionary policies.\n\nSimilar lessons in communication can be learnt from the recent penny stock fiasco, where three stocks - Blumont Group, Asiasons Capital and LionGold Corp - had a spectacular run-up in price over the past year before crashing down to earth earlier this month. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) had used all three tools available to it in querying, designating, or suspending a security. But questions remain about how it could have done these in a more timely and pertinent fashion.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

A total of 17 companies recorded 35 purchases worth $4.25 million versus a paltry two firms with 15 disposals worth $5.24 million. The number of companies and trades on the buying side were up from the previous week's four-day totals of 11 firms and 27 acquisitions. The buy value, however, was sharply down from the previous week's purchases worth $6.8 million. On the selling side, the sales figures were down from the previous week's five companies, 17 disposals and $12.7 million.\n\nWhile the buying by directors was high last week, the buyback activity among listed firms fell with only five firms posting 17 repurchases worth $1.57 million. The figures were near the previous week's four-day totals of seven companies, 16 trades and $1.5 million.\n\nThere were several significant corporate shareholder trades last week. Courts Asia Ltd bought back for the first time after the stock fell by 30 per cent. On the directors' front, there were key insider buys in Asiaphos Ltd, Megachem Ltd, Innovalues Ltd and Religare Health Trust.\n\nOn the funds' side, there was a first-time sale by APG Algemene Pensioen Groep in Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust and purchases by Aberdeen Asset Management in Petra Foods and Yoma Strategic Holdings.\n\nCourts Asia Ltd\n\nElectrical, IT and furniture retailer Courts Asia Ltd recorded its first buybacks since the stock was listed in October 2012 with 916,000 shares purchased from Oct 21 to 24 at an average of 80.1 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 13 per cent of the stock's trading volume, were made on the back of the 30 per cent drop in the share price since May from $1.15. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since November 2012 from 66.5 cents. The group's buyback price was near the IPO price of 77 cents. The stock closed at 83 cents on Friday.\n\nAsiaphos Ltd\n\nCEO Ong Hian Eng recorded the first corporate shareholder trade in newly listed phosphate explorer and mining firm Asiaphos Ltd since the stock was listed on Oct 7 with 800,000 shares purchased on Oct 18 at 26 cents each. The trade increased his deemed holdings to 548.932 million shares or 68.6 per cent of the issued capital. He also has direct interest of 6.164 million shares or 0.8 per cent. The acquisition was made after the stock fell by 34 per cent from the stock's trading debut price of 39.5 cents. Although Mr Ong bought shares following the steep fall in the share price, his purchase price was near the IPO price of 25 cents. The counter closed at 27.5 cents on Friday.\n\nMegachem Ltd\n\nExecutive chairman and managing director Chew Choon Tee resumed buying shares of specialty chemicals distributor Megachem Ltd after the stock rebounded by 26 per cent from 23 cents on Oct 16 with 53,000 shares purchased from Oct 21 to 22 at 29 cents each.

The counter's last traded price was 30 cents.\n\nInnovalues Ltd\n\nExecutive chairman and CEO Goh Leng Tse recorded his first on-market trade in customised precision machined parts and components manufacturer Innovalues Ltd since January 2010 with 406,000 shares purchased on Oct 21 at 11.9 cents each. The trade increased his deemed holdings to 2.486 million shares or 0.78 per cent. He also has direct interest of 63.199 million shares or 19.69 per cent. The acquisition was made on the back of the 15 per cent drop in the share price since August from 13.9 cents.

The acquisition was made on the back of the 10 per cent rebound in the unit price since September from 73 cents. Despite the rebound in the unit price, the counter is still down since May from 99 cents. The CEO previously acquired 300,000 units on Oct 22, 2012, at 78 cents each and an initial 937,000 shares on Oct 9, 2012, in the IPO at 90 cents each.\n\nAlso positive this year is independent director Michael Sydney Hwang with 500,000 units purchased from Aug 20 to 28 at an average of 77 cents each, which doubled his deemed stake to 1.000 million units or 0.13 per cent.

The trade reduced its direct holdings to 198.000 million units or 8.99 per cent.\n\nThe filing was made on the back of the 23 per cent drop in the unit price since May from 58 cents. Despite the fall in the unit price, the counter is still up since December 2011 from 33.5 cents. The group became a substantial shareholder in February 2010 after it acquired an initial 106.891 million units or 9.95 per cent via off-market trade at an estimated price of 49 cents each. The counter closed at 45 cents on Friday.\n\nPetra Foods Ltd\n\nAberdeen Asset Management acquired more shares of ingredients manufacturer and supplier Petra Foods Ltd at lower than its acquisition price earlier this year with a purchase-related filing on Oct 22 of 139,000 shares at $3.50 each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 61.210 million shares or 10.02 per cent. The filing was made on the back of the 11 per cent rebound in the share price since September from $3.16. The fund manager previously reported a purchase-related filing on May 15 of 809,000 shares at $4.20 each. Prior to the notices this year, the group acquired a net 17.65 million shares from December 2011 to December 2012 at $1.71 to $3.40 each and an initial filing in December 2011 of 1.88 million shares at $1.71 each, which raised its interest to 5.12 per cent. Overall, Aberdeen's stake is up by a net 29.9 million shares or 96 per cent since that initial filing in December 2011. The stock closed at $3.52 on Friday.\n\nYoma Strategic Holdings Ltd\n\nAberdeen Asset Management turned positive in property developer, construction and piling services provider Yoma Strategic Holdings after selling shares in June with a purchase-related filing on Oct 22 of 5.85 million shares at 77 cents each. The trade increased its deemed holdings by 9 per cent to 73.865 million shares or 6.38 per cent. The filing was made on the back of the 21 per cent drop in the share price since June 25 from 97 cents.\n\nThe group had reported a disposal-related filing on June 20 of 7.6 million shares at 93 cents each. Prior to that sale, the fund manager acquired 12.5 million shares from May 1 to 17 at around 82 cents each and an initial filing on April 30 of 3.34 million shares at 81 cents each, which raised its interest to 5.03 per cent. Overall, Aberdeen's stake is up by a net 15.6 million shares or 27 per cent since that initial filing in April. Investors should note that executive director Andrew Rickards unloaded seven million shares on April 22 at 81 cents each, which lowered his direct stake by 48 per cent to 7.500 million shares or 0.65 per cent. That was his first on-market trade since his appointment in November 2011. The counter closed at 77 cents on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Ltd\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Earnings per share have more than doubled to 8.9 cents in 2012 from 3.8 cents in 2002. The company has paid out a dividend every year since listing, and is currently yielding about 4.4 per cent based on 12-month historical payouts. Kingsmen has been profitable every year since listing.\n\nThe stock is well liked by analysts. AmFraser has a \"buy\" call on the stock \"for its quality management and consistent earnings deliver\". DMG & Partners likes its \"sturdy balance sheet\".\n\nKingsmen's executive chairman, Mr Soh, explains why: \"We supply quality work that clients keep on coming back for. That's the fundamental of Kingsmen's foundation.\"\n\nKingsmen's track record is a combination of strategy and luck.\n\nThe company, which designs and builds interiors and displays for retail stores, museums, conferences and exhibitions, has close to 20 offices in the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East, employing 1,500 creative staff and technical managers.\n\nAbout 42 per cent of its sales in 2012 came from Singapore, followed by 22 per cent from the greater China region.\n\nGeographically, the company has chosen to focus on Asia.\n\n\"We have chosen to focus only in the Asia-Pacific region as far as setting up our own offices is concerned. In the last three to five years, the growth has been in this region. So we are well positioned to take advantage of the faster growth in Asia,\" Mr Soh said.\n\nKingsmen also prides itself on its range of offerings. The company's services run across the supply chain, from designing concepts from scratch to mass-producing fittings for clients who have hundreds of stores around the world. The company has, over the past few years, also begun to clinch projects at theme parks, opening a new channel for future business.\n\n\"Imagine these are assorted chocolates, we have so many of all these chocolates, from design to build,\" said Mr Ong, the group managing director. \"We offer the whole box of chocolates to our customers . . . but we can also sell individual chocolates if you want.\"\n\nThe company is \"an indirect proxy to Asia's growing consumerism\", CIMB analyst Kenneth Ng wrote in a report in June.\n\nThe unfortunate implication of that view, however, is that Kingsmen's fortunes tend to be cyclical and highly tied to its markets' retail economies.\n\nRecalling past regional recessions such as the Asian Financial Crisis, Mr Soh likens the experience to operating in \"survival mode\". Luck came into play in Kingsmen's fortunes during the Global Financial Crisis, with the opening of Singapore's integrated resorts. That gave the country's retail scene an invaluable boost, and Kingsmen an invaluable cushion in an otherwise down market.\n\nBeyond new theme park business, the resorts also added retail space, and drew more visitors who stayed longer and spent more - all positives for retail in Singapore.\n\n\"Our growth is very much in keeping with the growth of Singapore in the last five to 10 years, and especially post the two integrated resorts,\" Mr Soh said.\n\nKingsmen, which has won theme park contracts in Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, sees theme parks as a promising growth driver.\n\nIts consistency is also a reflection of the company's record in customer retention. Mr Soh said about 70 per cent of the business comes from repeat customers.\n\nGetting customers to come back requires, first of all, that every job be well done.\n\n\"We are as good as our last job, so we must make sure that whether we make more money or less money the first thing is to get the job done well,\" Mr Ong said.\n\nKingsmen, which had a net profit margin of about 6 per cent in 2012, also makes it a point to price its services competitively, Mr Ong added. The company even goes as far as to work with customers during tough economic times to ensure that jobs can still be done, he said.\n\nFinding talent has always been a limiting factor for the company, and Kingsmen has been trying to address that by setting up its own Kingsmen Academy to train its staff, the directors said.\n\nBut perhaps the more concerning talent issue, as some analysts told The Business Times, is the one that Kingsmen will face when Mr Soh, 64, and Mr Ong, 60, finally decide to call it a day.\n\nThe two directors say that a succession plan has been in place since the company was listed. Currently, exhibitions and museums managing director Anthony Chong, interiors business managing director Alex Wee and general manager Andrew Cheng form the team that is being groomed to take over from Mr Soh and Mr Ong, who have been working side-by-side since they founded Kingsmen in 1976.\n\nSome of the early transition has already begun.\n\n\"We would be handing over step by step,\" Mr Soh said.\n\n\"As it is, we've already been doing it. As you can see in the last two, three years, there was a slight change already. Two of us, just one holding the CEO, and just one holding the chairman position. So, in the next two to three years, we expect more changes of this nature. But it doesn't mean we will just quit like that. We will ensure that things are done smoothly so that we can just fade into the sunset, and not just die in the office. That would be irresponsible.\"\n\nMr Soh described their philosophy of a successful company as one that lasts beyond its founders.\n\n\"An organisation is dynamic,\" he said. \"It's an animal by itself, that you should feed it, you should nurture it so that it can grow strong and go on racing ahead.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will further enhance our income stream and maximise returns to our unitholders,\" said Ronnie Tan, chief executive officer of Bowsprit Capital Corporation, the manager of First Reit.\n\nBowsprit said that First Reit remained largely unaffected by the recent weakening of the rupiah and Indonesia's slowing economy, as rental for its Indonesia properties are in Singapore dollars and as economic and demographic factors continue to support the country's growing healthcare market.\n\nUnits of First Reit ended two cents higher at $1.125 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is, until you take a bite of its chilli crab and pomelo, which will not only clear your sinuses but any bias you had at the start.\n\nUnderneath its casual noodle bar exterior, there's a serious Chinese restaurant trying to bust out. But not in the Imperial Treasure/Crystal Jade or even Tung Lok (where Ng was COO for years before going solo) way with its structured Cantonese banquet cuisine and \"What, no braised whole comb of shark's fin or two-head abalone for you today?\" attitude. Rather, it's about applying high-end restaurant standards to folksy, homespun favourites.\n\nIt helps that, as an independent operator, Ng - who's traded in his cool-dude wardrobe for T-shirt and jeans - can work on the fly, tweaking dishes in real time in response to feedback while adding new items or dropping unpopular ones any time. He's at the restaurant all the time, so a minimum standard of quality is assured - and if it isn't, he takes complaints on the chin.\n\nEven though he lost his original chef due to employment pass issues, the second in command has stepped up to the plate. The cooking is assured, the menu streamlined and less of a hotchpotch attempt to appeal to all tastes.\n\nAt lunch, quick meal options include upgraded hawker classics such as bak kut teh, char kway teow and prawn noodle. The pork rib soup ($18) is cooked with black garlic - which adds a rather cloying, unnatural sweetness to the broth although it's supposed to have health benefits.\n\nIt's a trifle alienating, but we can appreciate that the ribs are steamed beforehand to keep the meat from losing all its suppleness when left to cook in the broth. In turn, the prawn noodle ($18) is actually ramen in an intense, truffle-scented superior stock with a plump, cushiony prawn dumpling. Meanwhile, the char kway teow ($16) operates on the premise that there's more to be done with prata than to dunk it in curry or wrap it over banana and chocolate.\n\nHere, it's shredded and fried in black sauce with fat crunchy prawns and bean sprouts. The jury is out on whether the chewy dough shreds work better than conventional rice noodles, but we'll vote for the fragrant wok hei and the plump seafood.\n\nThe real appeal of Blue Lotus, though, is in its generosity with ingredients and the quality. No fillers or substitutes are used to stretch the supply of fresh seafood used in everything from dumplings to chilli crab.\n\nThat's what makes the lemongrass prawn sticks ($18 for four) such a winner - lightly packed minced shrimp shaped around the fragrant stalks instead of sugarcane. Dip into a creamy citrus emulsion for a fusion Vietnamese staple that works.\n\nThe same with deep-fried salt and pepper squid ($18) - a guilty pleasure of fat, octopus-like tentacles with a light crisp coat that leaves a lingering tingle on your tongue from the Szechuan pepper.\n\nOf course, there's the must-order chilli crab that can't decide if it's sweet, sour, tangy, fiery or punchy so it settles for all in a peppy orange-red gravy that cloaks Sri Lankan specimens so solidly packed, they might have still been bench-pressing weights when the fishermen's nets came in.\n\nTo alleviate the chilli sting, meticulously peeled pomelo segments are showered over the crab in a surprisingly successful antidote. How well it works if the heat is dialled up on request is not something we want to try.\n\nBlue Lotus's ever-evolving menu has also thrown up a couple of new hits. Available only on weekends, the roast pork belly ($18) is excellent, the wobbly, melt-in-the-mouth layers of fat and fork-tender meat topped with a lacquered layer of crackling belying its nondescript appearance.\n\nAnd while we didn't try it, the home-made lor mai kai ($38) - which needs two days' advance order and eight people to eat it - sounds promising from its description as a whole chicken encased in glutinous rice, wrapped in lotus leaf and slow-cooked.\n\nFor a fuss-free weeknight meal of serviceable sweet-sour pork and mapo tofu with rice, to a more elaborate feast of crab and wok-fried wagyu cubes and everything in between, Blue Lotus appeals with its neighbourhood charm and polished uptown core.\n\nSentosa Cove neighbourhood, that is. We have something like that in our neck of the woods, too, but it's called a zi char. So until we can afford to move, we could do a lot worse than drive to Sentosa for a meal we actually like.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nRating:\n\n7.5\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Fri, Oct 25, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSPEAKING highly of one's boss may be customary practice for any employee, but Versace chief executive Gian Giacomo Ferraris's admiration for Donatella Versace borders on the effusive. \"Working with Donatella Versace is a most rewarding experience,\" declares Mr Ferraris in his suite at the St Regis Hotel, when he was in town to grace the opening of the brand's 2,013 square feet boutique at Paragon. \"She possesses not just incredible creative talent - imagine the amount of concentration required for creating our range of products - but has great managerial skills as well.\"\n\nIt would have been easy for Mr Ferraris, who was the former head of the Jil Sander Group and Gucci Group, to take personal credit for the brand's successes. After all, within a year of his appointment at Versace in 2009, he managed to increase revenue of the Versace group by 9 per cent. Saddled with debt after the death of founder Gianni Versace in 1997, followed by the global financial crisis in 2009, the group posted operating profits only in 2011.\n\nAnd the secret to the group's success, besides much drier restructuring measures, lies in creative consistency. Picking up a printed throw cushion from the settee, Mr Ferraris explains: \"Every line, every product had to be placed under the direction of Mrs Donatella to deliver the same emotion and DNA throughout the brand. From men's ready-to-wear to a cup, to a cushion, to a woman's accessory - everything has to be approved by Mrs Donatella.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

This mid-sized saloon displaces another Merc, the compact C-Class sedan, which was the No 1 model in the first half of 2013, as it carried its momentum from being Singapore's most popular model in 2012.\n\nThe E-Class's success can be attributed to its recent facelift. Called the \"new\" E-Class, it features a dramatically revised front end to align this usually conservative model with the three-pointed star's latest family look.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

In addition to controlling the main risk factors, such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol levels and smoking, we can further maintain our health by not exposing ourselves to the risks that will be detrimental to our health. Interestingly, the very diagnostic tests and procedures that can save our lives may have the potential to increase our risks of stroke, cancer and dementia.\n\nInvasive diagnostic angiograms\n\nThe first group of tests called angiograms are diagnostic procedures that involve the insertion of a plastic tube and the injection of contrast agents into the arteries of the heart or brain under X-ray guidance; these tests carry both an increase in the risk of stroke and increased exposure to X-ray radiation. Safer non-invasive alternative tests have replaced most of these tests. Currently, imaging the arteries using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computed tomography (CT) of the arteries can be performed non-invasively with no risk of stroke, heart attack, or bleeding. While brain angiograms have been largely replaced by non-invasive scans, invasive angiogram of the heart arteries (coronary angiogram or CAG) is still a commonly performed diagnostic procedure.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/lowdown-tie-ups", "site_title": "Lowdown on tie-ups", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nLowdown on tie-ups\n\nInternational chain stores aren't the only ones to bank on collaborations with posh brands. A handful of Asian brands are now working with higher-end designers to entice savvy shoppers. By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 25, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE most talked-about high-low fashion tie-up this season may be Isabel Marant's insouciant-chic designs for H&M (which will be released on Nov 14). But one doesn't need to camp out at a chain store to get a piece of collab action. Closer to home, home-grown labels are also joining forces with international fashion wunderkinds to whet the appetites of style trendites.\n\nMalaysian fashion retailer Dude & the Duchess, which specialises in well-tailored shirts and dresses, for one, has snagged rising fashion star Jonathan Liang, a fellow countryman who is based in Paris, for its first-ever collaboration - DD x JL.\n\n\"There is an ongoing movement of brands at all levels, from luxury to mass, and the trend of launching collaborations has helped many levels of businesses, giving them a different edge and helping them appeal to different demographics,\" says founder of Dude & the Duchess Kristy Yong, who has already started work on yet another collection with Mr Liang after enjoying the experience of teaming up on the capsule line. \"It has been a very intense six to seven months of Skyping across Kuala Lumpur and Paris time zones, and we're incredibly excited about the outcome.\"\n\nTo be launched next Friday in its retail and online stores, the capsule collection checks all the boxes of a buzz-worthy line: precisely-cut separates, of-the-moment trends, a hot name and, above all, great value for money.\n\nMost notably, the high-tech fabrication employed, like embossed snake and crocodile skin, and grated foil-glazed viscose, are more luxurious than what one would usually expect from a high street label. And with prices ranging from RM329 ($129) for a Lurex jacquard swing skirt to RM459 for a metallic blue dress with a pebbled sheen finish, the pieces are practically steals when considering the four-digit price-tagged looks from Mr Liang's main line.\n\n\"We've infused details such as hidden pockets, kangaroo pouches on a shirt and slits on sleeves and shirts, which play a role in the tuck-and-fold of the garments,\" elaborates the 25-year-old designer, who briefly interned at Givenchy before launching his own label in the fashion capital. \"These details may be uncommon for a high street collection, but the aim was to create personal pieces the wearer could relate to.\"\n\nAnd the high-low divide between collaborators is even wider for yet another capsule line: online fashion retailer Love, Bonito's collection by haute couture designer Julien Fournie. Launched during the Fide Fashion Week earlier this month, the range of 15 looks was designed in just three days during a trip to Paris by the brand's founders and took two months to materialise.\n\n\"We attended Julien's show last year, and casually mentioned to Frank Cintamani, chairman of Fide Fashion Weeks, about the idea of Love, Bonito possibly working with Julien Fournie,\" says Viola Tan, a co-founder of the affordable fashion label. \"Julien's team was initially very reserved; they hardly ever collaborated with other designers, much less an online shop so this is more than an honour for us. We have been dreaming of this since last year and it was only this year that we were graced with an answer.\"\n\nFor lesser-known Asian brands, attracting big-name talents may be a challenge when it comes to creating a tie-up that's on the lips of shoppers. In the case of home-grown house Raoul, working with an up-and-coming talent - rather than a superstar designer - is a long-term strategy to elevate the brand's credibility and style cachet.\n\n\"Accessories are an integral part of a fashion house, and we knew that it was an area that needed to be addressed and put in the right hands,\" says Raoul's creative director Odile Benjamin, who appointed Raphael Young, a Paris-based accessories designer whose creations have been worn by Lady Gaga and Beyonce, to design its Pre-Fall 2014 shoes and bags.\n\n\"We didn't actively go out looking for a designer; the introduction happened, Raphael and ourselves got talking immediately and Doug (Douglas Benjamin, Odile's husband and co-creative director of Raoul) and I felt that he really understood what we wanted. So everything fell into place naturally.\"\n\nIn fact, Mr Young, who was born in Korea and adopted and raised in France, has no qualms about working for a smaller Asian label, despite having headed the shoes and accessories design team at Calvin Klein Collection.\n\n\"My Asian blood causes me to like Asia, and working with Mr and Mrs Benjamin is as exciting for me as working for the oldest European maison - we even speak French sometimes with Odile,\" says the designer, who now has an eponymous shoe label. \"Raoul is growing fast and its base in Singapore is a great 'trampoline' to connect with the whole world.\"\n\nLikewise, although he had moved to Paris to propel his career to an international level, Mr Liang also does not regard a collaboration with a less premium Malaysian brand like Dude & the Duchess as a step backwards.\n\nHe says: \"It doesn't matter where a label comes from or what level it is at, what matters most is the values and visions of its founder.\"\n\nRather than worrying that a lower-priced collection would dilute the luxe positioning of his own fashion house, Mr Liang focused on creating pieces that ranked high on versatility and value, and introduced some classics from his label such as uniquely placed hems and slits, hidden details and elongated button stands, all while retaining Dude & the Duchess's classic shirt styles and relaxed fits.\n\nBesides, when asked if his designs for the tie-up could be paired with looks from his own collection, the designer jokes: \"If I spot anyone in a piece from this collaboration mixed with our main line, I would stalk them, stop them and take lots of pictures so I could show them to my mum.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/bali-getaways", "site_title": "Bali getaways", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBali getaways\n\nTay Suan Chiang checks out 3 resorts which will appeal to those seeking the sun, sand and sea, with some shopping thrown in\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 25, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMENTION Kuta and images of backpackers' hostels and the stretch of great surfing beach in Bali come to mind. All that is still there for the budget conscious travellers who want to rough it out. But the area is now getting a more upmarket feel with the opening of the Sheraton Bali Kuta Resort.\n\nThe great thing is that the Sheraton is located in the heart of Kuta beach with the golden sandy stretch and the Indian Ocean just across the road, and the bars, restaurants and pubs all within walking distance.\n\nAlready, the resort is popular with families and the slightly older crowd, who may have given Kuta a miss before.\n\nInstead of sticking with the slanted, thatched roofs typical of Balinese architecture, the hotel has opted for a modern look, but retaining some Balinese touch. The hotel rooms and main social areas are elevated and this has advantages.\n\nFor one thing, you don't quite see or hear the traffic that goes past the resort. Perched on the rooftop of Bene Italian restaurant, you get clear views of the sunset, which beats having to squeeze with the masses on the beach for an Instagram worthy shot.\n\nThe resort makes no bones about cashing in on its prime sunset viewing spot. From 5pm to 7pm nightly, it hosts Sunset Gatherings for hotel guests and the public. For 149,000 rupiah (S$16.50) and you get to sample wine, with canapes, artisanal cheeses and breads or handmade wood-fired pizzas while watching the sun set.\n\nThe resort's 203 rooms and suites are spacious with balconies either facing the ocean or its two courtyards. To put it simply, the rooms are nothing short of what you would expect from the Sheraton brand.\n\nWhat stands out more at this resort are the dining options, and the activities that raise the guest experience.\n\nThe Indonesian island getaway is known for its local fare, such as babi guling and bebek betutu, but giving that a miss, and opting for Italian is not a bad idea.\n\nAt Bene, executive chef Rossano Renzelli does a mean hand-made pasta, alongside his signature dishes including Spezzatino di maiale, manzo, and e salsiccia con piselli - stewed diced pork, beef and pork sausage with green peas and onion and a classic Risotto ai porcini - Italian rice with porcini mushroom.\n\nIf you have a group of 10, opt to dine in the private dining room, where you and your pals can sit around a solid single tree trunk dining table which overlooks the beach.\n\nThe resort's other dining option is Feast, its 160-seater restaurant that has live stations, offering buffets three times a day.\n\nThe food quality and variety are decent, but the best time to come is on Sundays, from noon to 3pm, when the restaurant holds its weekly Market Brunch, believed to be the first of its kind on the island. The theme is Sip, Savour and Shop. The food menu changes weekly, but you can expect artisanal cheeses and sliced meats, sushi, and seafood barbecue. And if you like the cheese or seafood on the buffet spread, they are also for sale, alongside other fresh produce and pre-made items. It is also at the market brunch that you can get chocolates from the island's only chocolate manufacturer, Pod Chocolate, started by Australian Toby Garritt.\n\nIf you are lucky enough, you may get invited to dine at the chef's table. Chef Renzelli will invite 12 guests to dine with him in the pastry room, inside the resort's kitchen. \"It will be for open-minded diners,\" he says. The menu is extensive, but forget dining on fancy tableware. Instead, your jumbo river prawn bouillabaisse is served in a pot, and the veal leg in a shallow metal bowl. Not quite the fine dining experience you would expect, but nevertheless a fun story to share with the other not-so-lucky guests.\n\nIf you are the sort who must shop, the resort is next door to the famed Poppies Lane, a row of shops selling local beachwear and apparel and other souvenirs.\n\nAlternatively, head to Beachwalk next door, an open air shopping mall, that looks suspiciously like The Star Vista.\n\nMost of the brands here are what you can find in Singapore, so if you are looking for something that is more local, head to Satu. The multi-label fashion boutique houses some of Bali's best designers, such as lace brand Uluwatu, Niluh Djelantik, a Balinese brand that has gone international, and Erika Pe\u00f1a, a jewellery brand with celebrity fans such as Beyonce and Kim Kardashian.\n\nThe resort also ties up with Satu to host a monthly fashion show during afternoon tea sessions.\n\nDario Orsini, Sheraton Kuta's general manager, describes the resort as \"a sanctuary on Kuta, but with a mute button. You still have the beach, shopping and nightlife nearby\".\n\nNo small change\n\nJUST like how a haircut or a new wardrobe can instantly make a person look more refreshed, a change of interiors in a hotel can also give it an updated look.\n\nThe 15-year-old Four Seasons Resort Bali at Sayan is a prime example of that. \"Our one and two-bedroom villas have always been considered unique in the world,\" says its general manager, Uday Rao. \"The 42 villas have been impeccably maintained since the resort was built, but we wanted to evolve the design to ensure their place among the finest villas in Bali.\"\n\nJapanese designer Koichi Yasuhiro from Design Studio Spin in Tokyo is behind the villas' new interiors, which are now chic and modern, but with a strong reflection of Balinese architectural style, tradition and culture.\n\nLike before, you see only lily ponds on the ground level, which indicates where the villas are. To get to the villa, you have to go down a flight of steps, which ups the anticipation level.\n\nWhereas the rooms previously looked bland and generic, the feel is now much warmer. In place of a bare wall behind the bed, there is now an intricate carved wooden screen featuring a delicate pattern of leaves and birds with an inlay of traditional ikat fabric. The bed now comes with a sheer white canopy that was previously missing. It doesn't sound like much, but with the ambient lights turned on, the bedroom now takes on a much more romantic feel than before. It is no wonder the resort continues to be popular for weddings and honeymoons.\n\nThe recent renovation also meant that little touches which were not considered necessary five years ago, are now in place. For example, opening a drawer on the bedside table reveals several types of chargers built into it, so you can have your smartphones and other devices charging away beside you even when you sleep.\n\nThe resort prides itself on its larger than large bathrooms, which now have a more tropical feel. Marble has replaced boring beige tiles, giving the bathrooms a luxurious look. Each villa comes with a private plunge pool, but should you wish for a bubble bath, you can do so in the new marble free-standing tub. For a fee, the resort can draw different types of baths.\n\nJimbaran Bay beauty\n\nAlso cashing in on a new look is The Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay. Standing in place of PJ's, the resort's former casual restaurant is now the swanky Sundara.\n\nThe beachfront restaurant is also designed by Design Studio Spin, and certainly lives up to its name, meaning \"beautiful\" in the Sanskrit word. If your idea of a perfect holiday is spending the entire day by the beach, this is the place to be.\n\nSet in two Balinese-style pavilions, the two-storey restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Regardless of whether you choose to sit downstairs or upstairs, you get panoramic views of Jimbaran Bay and the amazing sunset.\n\nThe restaurant is headed by Australian Greg Bunt, who owns three restaurants in Brisbane, and has worked in Hong Kong and Macau. The lunch menu comprises lighter choices such as sushi, salads and wood-fired pizzas.\n\nFor dinner, pick from the wide selection of grills, such as lobster, mahi mahi and lamb rack, of which Sundara is known for. The 1kg grain fed 200 days boneless rib eye, which is big enough to share among two to three diners, is worth going off the diet for.\n\nYou can start the day with breakfast at the resort's other restaurant Taman Wantilan, or choose to dine in their villas.\n\nThen head to Sundara and spend the morning working a tan on the many day beds, with a cocktail or two in hand. The menu boasts 42 cocktails, such as Smoked Berries, made from Bombay Sapphire, Lagavulin 16-year-old single malt scotch and wild berries; and the innocent-sounding Tea Time, made of Ketel One vodka, peach and tea.\n\nAfter lunch at Sundara, a dip in the 55m-long infinity lap pool sounds just about right. Or chill on the day bed with a book in hand, before dinner.\n\n\"Sundara will become a must-see landmark for all of Bali,\" says Michael Branham, general manager of Four Seasons Resort Bali at Jimbaran Bay.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/roof-view", "site_title": "Roof with a view", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRoof with a view\n\nThe view of the neighbourhood and its surrounding greenery was what enticed the Lohs to buy the slightly elevated land on which their two-storey house was built. By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 25, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nYOU would think the best views in the house are from the master bedroom, right? But not in this home.\n\nAndrew Loh and his wife Sharon Seetho allocated prime space in the home for ... an attic and roof terrace. As the two-storey semi-detached home stands on slightly elevated land, the roof terrace offers unblocked views of the neighbourhood off Holland Road and its surrounding greenery. \"I knew I had to buy this land when I saw the view,\" says Mr Loh, a director at a bank.\n\nMs Seetho adds: \"We could have put our bedroom at the back and wake up to this view, but we rather put our entertainment area here, so that everyone can enjoy the space.\" In contrast, the couple's bedroom on the second floor faces their neighbour across the street.\n\nIn the attic is a cosy living area and a small, partially equipped kitchen for doing some light cooking. There is more seating on the roof terrace alongside a dining table that can seat eight. Even when the family is not entertaining friends and relatives, the roof terrace is still frequently used. \"Every weekend, we come up here for dinner, sometimes for a BBQ,\" says Ms Seetho.\n\nWhile the roof terrace has the best views, the rest of the house isn't too shabby either. On the first floor, the living and dining areas have an almost \"doorless\" feel. In place of walls, the design team at Wallflower Architecture + Design placed large sliding doors all around. \"We usually have these doors open, and with direct access to the driveway, it feels as if there are no doors,\" says Mr Loh. \"The house is very open.\"\n\nA row of trees have been planted to give the family some privacy. \"The trees do double work - not only as a privacy screen, but they help absorb dust that the wind brings in,\" says Mr Loh.\n\nThe couple put much thought into the design of their home. For example, instead of a lap pool, they decided to make do with a smaller one near the entrance, which also doubles as a water feature at night. \"This way, we have more deck space for outdoor activities,\" says Mr Loh. Even though there is enough room for two kitchens, a dry and a wet one, the Lohs decided to just make do with one. A breeze constantly wafts through the kitchen so cooking fumes don't linger.\n\nEven how the space under the stairs should be utilised was thought through. \"Typically, you could build storage space there, but that would make the area look too heavy. We wanted something that is more open, so we chose a water feature instead,\" says Ms Seetho.\n\nThe couple and their two children, Shaun and Clare, have their bedrooms on the second floor. Apart from the usual features such as a walk-in wardrobe, and a spacious bathroom, the couple's bedroom has its own loft area, which is used as a study. The study also connects to the attic and roof terrace. There is also a family room on the second floor, where apart from the roof terrace, the Lohs spend most of their time.\n\nOn the outside, the house has a multi-layered facade: a combination of glass doors and windows, a veil of operable vertical timber louvres, horizontal aluminium sunscreen and vertically drawn blinds. \"These are all different expressions of material and composition but primarily enabling the family to control the amount of sun screening, breeze, and view,\" says architect Robin Tan. \"Sometimes it is not just what the family want to see, but what the neighbours can see of them.\"\n\nTo let in more light into the home, skylights have been strategically placed. The extensive use of large windows and sliding doors also help brighten up the home, while encouraging plenty of natural ventilation all around. \"We used to have all the doors open, but now we only open the necessary ones,\" says Ms Seetho. \"Can you imagine when it rains, we will all be running everywhere to close the doors?\"\n\nTo give the home some warmth, the couple added their personal touch through their choice of artworks and posters that dot the walls. Most, such as the large Vietnamese, lacquered painting in the living room, were purchased during their travels overseas. \"We often go into galleries, and should a piece catch our eye and the price is right, we will get it,\" says Mr Loh.\n\nHe also collects smaller items, such as a wooden spice box from Jaipur, and a cow bell from Chiangmai. On display in another part of the home are his father's binoculars, and an old dictograph. \"Before my school moved out of its old premises, some of us went around the grounds picking items. I found this dictograph in the science lab,\" says the former St Joseph Institution student. \"It is having these little things around that make a home feel more cosy, and gives it more soul.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/larger-life-funnyman", "site_title": "Larger-than-life funnyman", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nLarger-than-life funnyman\n\nRob Schneider, who plays an exaggerated version of himself in his act, says he's a better stand-up comic now than in the past. GEOFFREY EU reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Oct 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHE'S inhabited a succession of wacky characters and outrageous personas over a 25-year movie and television career but lately, funnyman Rob Schneider - you may know him as Deuce Bigalow, The Hot Chick, the Sensitive Naked Man or maybe even Orgasm Guy - has been tickling live audiences and tackling the comedy world with perhaps his most shocking creation ever: himself.\n\nOr an approximation of the real Rob Schneider anyway - one that has a stash of typically irreverent, sometimes offensive but always humorous observations on topical issues and life in general up his long sleeves.\n\nSchneider has devoted the past four years to relentlessly honing his stand-up skills and will bring his act to Singapore tomorrow when he performs at The Star Theatre.\n\nHe was here in 2011 but declares that he's simply a better stand-up comic now - thanks to all the effort he's put into fine-tuning the act.\n\nDeveloping a style\n\n\"Humour is a wonderful way to subvert people to your point of view,\" says Schneider over the phone from his hotel room in Adelaide, where he was at the tail-end of an Australia tour. \"I play an exaggerated version of myself and I just developed a style after awhile. The topical stuff ebbs and flows and then during the part with some basic universal truths, you kind of explain what it is and then exploit it for comedic purposes.\"\n\nIt takes a lot of work to examine the lighter side of life and extract all the humour from a situation, says Schneider. \"Mark Twain said explaining humour is a bit like dissecting a frog: all the parts are there but in the end it doesn't jump anymore,\" he says. \"I've been doing nothing but stand-up for four years, that's the only way to get good at it - people need to see you up there.\"\n\nSchneider's brand of humour may not appeal to everyone but he has no qualms about taking on what he calls \"hot-button issues\" in order to find bring attention to issues that matter.\n\nHis act takes aim at current events as well as American pop culture (such as Mylie Cyrus' sartorial sense, or lack thereof), but it also includes a bit on the Taliban practice of stoning women to death for adultery - the punchline involves using a single pebble instead of many rocks.\n\n\"I also have an Oscar Pretorius joke - not a lot of people can pull that off,\" he says, adding that the audience will let you know if you go over the line. \"If you want to be a world comic that's what you have to do, but if you're afraid to offend, you can't be a comedian.\"\n\nTaking a topic that is somewhat familiar and then going a little further by presenting a what-if scenario and shocking the audience by design - that's the comedian's job, explains Schneider. \"It's about digging in and going a bit deeper - but never forget you're there to entertain.\"\n\nSchneider, who turns 50 next week, is not averse to poking some fun at himself either. \"I'm going to get my own special parking space in five years,\" he says.\n\nOn reflection though, he says the half-century mark is a positive milestone. \"I'm excited about where I'm at, both in my life and my stand-up act,\" he notes. \"I'm doing this because I love it, and because I want to be the best. It's taken 25 years to get to this - I don't know how much longer I'm going to be doing this but I'm giving it everything I've got.\"\n\nSchneider credits Chris Rock - a buddy and fellow comedian - with persuading him to go the stand-up route. \"Chris Rock talked me into doing this and now I want to give him a run for his money,\" he laughs, adding that the US comedy scene is in the pink of health at the moment.\n\n\"Stand-up comedy is a great art form and there are a lot of great comedians at their peak - they're a little angrier, more bitter, and it makes comedy better.\"\n\nThere's also enough going on in the world to provide stand-up material, he adds. \"US democracy is a mess, but it was also invented by people that owned slaves.\"\n\nMulling various ideas\n\nSchneider says he admires comedians like Rock, Louis CK, Daniel Tosh and Bill Burr and will continue to focus on his stage act, but his wish list includes a few more chances on the movie go-round as well.\n\nAmong the ideas he is mulling over are a story about a taxi driver who connects with a child that is born in his cab and another that reunites a bunch of ageing comedians on the big screen - an Expendables-like comedy.\n\nHe acknowledges that some of his films have bombed at the box office and been savaged mercilessly by critics. \"If all my movies had worked out, I wouldn't be doing stand-up - but now there's no other place I want to be,\" says Schneider. \"I've had some disappointments, not all my movies have worked and I've had my fights with people but I've mellowed now, like a 25-year-old Bordeaux that's ready to drink - better drink me soon though.\"\n\nRob Schneider performs tomorrow at The Star Theater at 8 pm. Local comedian Hossan Leong will be the opening act. For more information go to\n\nwww.sistic.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A collaboration between a dance choreographer and a film producer resulted in an almost cinematic spectacle of movement on stage with just a few dancers and video art on a flash drive.\n\nFilm producer Eva Baro and dance choreographer Matias Martinez's production, Praying Mantis, is a story told with video art, visual effects and light.\n\n\"We defend clean technologies and we liked the concept of storing scenery in a memory stick, so that the only physical presence on stage is the dancers and movement, their soul,\" says Baro.\n\nAnd their dance production promises to be cinematic, with the cinema music of Armand Amar, cinema photography direction of Reinier Van Brummelen and cinema special effects of David Marti and Montse Ribe.\n\nPraying Mantis is a dance production about a girl in the middle of the Bolivian Salt desert who's saved by a group of praying mantis. Martinez mashes several dance and movement techniques in a style which he personally developed, which emphasises the centre of the body and adapts to the plot of the story that is going on.\n\n\"But rather than showing a dance technique or style, we try to bring original stories representing them with dance, video art, music and light all together,\" says Martinez.\n\nWorking on feelings\n\nThe two collaborators' starting point was how they wanted the audience to feel, they share.\n\n\"Rather than action that was clear from the plot, we worked on the feelings we wanted to show with images, movements, dance, music and special effects. It's been a creative collaboration from the dance point of view and the video point of view,\" says Baro.\n\nHow movement is linked to emotions is a question that has intrigued the film producer. Since technology has made such major changes in society and the way people communicate with one another, she began to see the need for movement even more than ever.\n\n\"The real physical experience is becoming a question of survival for humans. We need to move in real life more than ever . . . we need dance,\" she muses, recalling the creative period she went through thinking about the importance of movement.\n\nInvited by Martinez to help him in a production, she was impressed enough to look for ways to help him express his art form. Dance, for him, he shares, is a corporeal expression of something.\n\n\"It's not about movement or style, but choreography is about pulling together everything to take people to another dimension,\" he shares.\n\nWhen their project got underway, Baro was inspired by a Zana Brinski picture of a bug which dances in front of its prey before attacking it. \"It's like bug's dance of the death. So I started to compare the instinctive dance of insects versus the instinctive/artistic dance of the humans and keep asking why dance and movement makes us so happy,\" she elaborates.\n\nSharing beauty with art\n\n\"At the end what was clear was that we wanted people to stop for a little moment in their lives and feel, to be aware about the beauty that is still there outside. We all wanted the same thing that is making people happy for a moment in their life provoking ticklish, magical, and positive feelings through art,\" she says.\n\nAdds Martinez: \"We wanted to share beauty with art. There was a script and then from there every creative side contributed with an expression.

They were interviewed over the phone in August this year.\n\nMany believe that the general economic environment in Singapore over the next 12 months is positive, with over half saying that the Singapore economy would expand.\n\nThree in 10 think that there would be no change from this year, while 15 per cent expect to see some contraction.\n\nA large number of respondents also think that the economic expansion would trickle down to benefit their firms. Some 42 per cent have positive expectations for their firm's performance over the next 12 months, while another 42 per cent expect it to stay unchanged. About 15 per cent see a contraction.\n\nThe survey noted: \"Echoing the positive economic outlook, Singapore companies are confident of and positive towards business expansion by riding on the growing business momentum and magnifying their scale through exploring new markets and opening outlets.\n\n\"However, the present stable performance and stagnant global economy projected for the next 12 months has caused the same weight of views foreseeing their business performance to stay steady.\"\n\nAs many as 84 per cent of respondents said that industry competition was a key challenge, and 76 per cent expressed worry over the interest rate environment and currency volatility. Ranking third in the list of concerns was labour cost, with about seven in 10 respondents fretting over it. Property cost was in tenth place, with about four in 10 saying that it was an issue.\n\nAndrew Chan, managing director of homegrown food chain The Soup Spoon, said that competition in the food & beverage industry has definitely increased over the last few years.\n\n\"We have to be very careful now because the conditions are right for others to come and snatch a bit of the pie. The open economy, the supply of new spaces and the generally high levels of optimism in the industry all mean that almost anyone who wants to open a joint can do so.\"\n\nThe Soup Spoon has tried to set itself apart with store revamps and a healthy eating concept. He added that the competition had also contributed to a manpower crunch in the industry.\n\nEllen Teo, general manager at liquefied petroleum gas group Union Energy, said that one of the group's key challenge is retaining and hiring staff.\n\n\"Industry competition isn't exactly as pressing because ours is a mature industry. The more apparent problem is the manpower crunch.\"\n\nAccording to the American Express survey, firms are trying to meet the manpower challenge through a variety of means. These include working to retain talent, such as raising benefits, providing more training to employees, improving and streamlining the work flow, and automating.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SilverNeedle has around 60 properties under management or licence, with more than 4,000 rooms in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe introduction of a franchising model for its 23 Country Comfort brand of upper mid-scale hotels, is one such avenue for growth.\n\nSilverNeedle operates on management contracts and brand licensing agreements, and adding a third business model gives hotel owners another option, said Mr Jumabhoy.\n\nFor example, they can now own more than one property. Potential suitors can also tap SilverNeedle's investments into areas, such as back-end systems and technology.\n\n\"But at the same time they can manage their own destiny through the business,\" he said.\n\nAll the hotels under the Country Comfort brand are in Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). The aim is to extend the brand's reach both within ANZ and out to South Asia, South-east Asia and North Asia.\n\nThe introduction of franchising for its Country Comfort hotels will coincide with a revamp of the brand over the next 12 months to focus more on the business traveller.\n\nAs part of this transition, Country Comfort hotels will offer more business-focused amenities, such as high-quality beds, free Wi-Fi and local calls, and simple check-in and check-out services.\n\nCurrent licensees of the brand will continue existing arrangements with SilverNeedle, which will look at whether Country Comfort is still the right fit when the agreements expire.\n\nEven if it is not, Mr Jumabhoy remains confident that there are other brands under SilverNeedle that can serve their needs.\"We would not want to lose them, so we have alternatives for them; there is no push factor,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has a market capitalisation of about HK$36 billion.\n\nThe bank, controlled by the Fung family, said last month that it was in discussions to sell a significant stake. The Bank of New York Mellon Corp is its second-biggest shareholder. Together, the Fung family and BNY Mellon control about 45 per cent of the bank.\n\nOCBC, South-east Asia's second-biggest lender, has invested about $1.5 billion in China so far - one of the three areas of focus for the bank outside its core Singapore market - chief executive Samuel Tsien said at the opening of the bank's China headquarters in Shanghai last month. The other key markets are Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nThe bank's presence in China dates back to 1925 with the opening of a branch in Xiamen. Following local incorporation in 2007, it now has 16 branches and sub-branches across nine cities, up from five branches and representative offices.\n\nUOB, Singapore's third biggest bank by assets, opened a foreign direct investment advisory unit in Hong Kong last month. The bank said it plans to double its cross-border business between Hong Kong and South-east Asian companies within the next three years on rising intra-regional trade flows within emerging Asia.\n\nAcquiring a stake in Wing Hang will allow the two banks to expand their operations in Greater China, which accounts for 5 per cent of OCBC's profits before tax and 9 per cent of UOB's in the first half of this year.\n\nRival DBS Group receives close to 30 per cent of its pre-tax profits from Greater China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After reading recently about a change in the federal flood programme, they checked on next year's rates and were stunned: Their bill will grow to US$14,000 annually.\n\nNow the elementary school teacher and her husband Clint, an information technology specialist, are considering selling their two-bedroom St Pete Beach home, probably at a loss, because she said they can't afford the bill, and their mortgage requires flood coverage.\n\n\"It was very frustrating to finally have what we've worked hard for all of our life,\" Ms Dockery, 52, said. \"I feel like the rules were changed in the middle of the game. And unfortunately, we can't play by the new rules.\"\n\nMonthly premiums for more than one million homeowners are set to increase due to a rewrite by the US Congress last year of the federal flood insurance programme. As a result, home prices in flood zones around the country are declining as potential buyers baulk at the premiums, said Moe Veissi, a Miami real estate agent who led the Chicago-based National Association of Realtors last year.\n\nFederal flood insurance covers US$1.3 trillion of property in all 50 states, with Florida, Texas, Louisiana, California and New Jersey making up two-thirds of all policies, according to Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the programme.\n\nAbout 85 private insurance companies contract with Fema to administer the flood programme, including Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate Corp and Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.\n\nConsumer groups, governors and mortgage bankers are calling on Congress to reverse the law, which was designed to reduce the National Flood Insurance Programme's growing debt. The measure, called the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, phases in rate increases for the 20 per cent of policyholders who have been receiving federal subsidies on premiums.\n\nSome of those subsidies began disappearing or shrinking on Oct 1, 15 months after the law passed with bipartisan support.\n\nStates are searching for ways to reduce homeowners' bills. In Florida, home to 37 per cent of the nation's 5.6 million flood policies, state lawmakers are trying to attract private companies to write flood policies and are considering starting a state-based flood insurance pool.\n\nMississippi sued the federal government to stop the rate increases, saying the US failed to study the economic impact. Louisiana is preparing to sue. Massachusetts attorney general Martha Coakley proposed legislation this month to cap the amount of insurance lenders can require.\n\nBills pending in the US House and Senate to delay rate increases have bipartisan support, mostly from lawmakers in coastal states. Research groups that advocate market-based policies, such as Heritage Action for America and the R Street Institute, have urged members of Congress to leave the measure in place.\n\nThe law is an an \"appropriate\" way to restore financial viability to the programme, and it makes sense to ask those with the greatest risk to pay more, said RJ Lehmann, senior fellow for the Washington-based R Street Institute, in a statement. Mr Lehmann helped write the law sponsored by Representatives Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, and Judy Biggert, an Illinois Republican, who lost the November election.\n\nMs Waters, who said she never expected the bill she sponsored to cause large rate increases, is now working to delay its implementation. \"When I agreed to co-author this legislation, our goal was to create a bipartisan solution to repair our National Flood Insurance Programme,\" Ms Waters said in a Sept 30 statement. \"Neither Democrats nor Republicans envisioned it would reap the kind of harm and heartache that may result from this law going into effect.\"\n\nLouisiana property assessments on homes in flood zones have already dropped by as much as 30 per cent because of the new flood rules, said Michael Hecht, president of Greater New Orleans Inc, an economic development organisation. Mr Hecht's group has been using such stories to warn lawmakers to change the law. \"Owners will lose everything, values of unsellable properties will plummet, bank mortgages will go into default, local tax bases will erode, and economies will be eviscerated,\" according to material distributed by Greater New Orleans.\n\nBuyers flee\n\nHomebuyers are walking away from contracts when they see the insurance costs, said Ross Miller, who owns a mortgage brokerage in Metairie. In parts of Plaquemines Parish, a coastal community on the Gulf of Mexico, neighbourhoods will have insurance premiums of US$10,000 to US$25,000 a year, Mr Miller said. \"What do they think people are going to do?\" he said.\n\nMs Dockery said she and her husband moved from a 2,200-square-foot home inland to a property half its size in June, drawn to the barrier island on Florida's west coast.\n\nTheir son had moved out of the old house for college and they expect to retire in the next five to 10 years, she said. \"We absolutely love it, and it would be very difficult to have to sell,\" she said. \"It's the lifestyle we were looking forward to.\"\n\nMs Dockery said they never would have bought the US$400,000 home if they knew insurance rates would increase so rapidly. The property is assessed by Pinellas County, which includes St Pete Beach, at about US$521,600.\n\nSome house hunters in the area have already begun blacklisting neighbourhoods where rates are rising, said Wendy Lockhart, a St Petersburg, Florida, real estate agent. Ms Lockhart is struggling to sell her own home after quotes for the insurance premium went from about US$1,000 to US$8,105.\n\n\"We were getting five or six showings a week,\" she said. \"Then when all this started hitting the front pages about three weeks ago, we've had no showings.\"\n\nRealtors in the St Petersburg area, which has more than 50,000 subsidised policies, have taken up a marketing pitch for homes that don't lie in flood zones: \"No flood insurance required!\"\n\nKaren Hoyt, a physical therapist who is preparing to move from Colorado to St Pete Beach, said the insurance rates she's seen have discouraged her from buying. \"We're going to rent for a year and see what happens,\" Ms Hoyt said.\n\nUnder the law, those who bought homes after July 2012 became ineligible for subsidies after Oct 1. The flood insurance programme amassed more than US$20 billion in debt after Hurricane Katrina slammed into New Orleans in 2005 and it borrowed more after superstorm Sandy hit the East Coast in 2012.\n\nUnder the law, owners of vacation homes began to lose federal subsidies in January, with annual rate increases of 25 per cent until reaching full price. Beginning Oct 1, subsidies for businesses and primary homes began being phased out. Those who buy homes in flood zones or sign up for new policies won't be eligible for subsidies.\n\nSubsidies have kept rates as low as 10 per cent of the actual cost. Fema is reassessing its risk calculations, drawing flood maps that will bring higher rates to some areas.\n\nIf the Florida legislature finds ways to give homeowners more options for flood insurance, that may pressure lawmakers in Washington to reduce rates, said Florida state Senator David Simmons, the Republican chairman of the banking and insurance committee. Florida policyholders have paid US$16 billion into the federal programme over the last 35 years, while taking out about US$4.5 billion in claims, he said.\n\n\"We're the ones who are subsidising the entire National Flood Insurance Programme,\" Mr Simmons said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": []}

The resulting uncertainty is preventing JAL from planning its flight schedule for next summer and hindering its mid to long-term business plan, he added.\n\nIn another historic move, JAL ordered 31 Airbus A350 jets, declining for the first time to buy from Boeing. JAL and ANA have traditionally bought from the US manufacturer in what was seen as essentially an extension of the close US-Japan security alliance.\n\nJAL went with the European maker, Mr Ueki said, in part because it was worried about the risk of being a launch customer for new aircraft, a commitment it would have had to make had it opted to pick the Boeing 777X.\n\nJAL's fleet planning, he said, would next turn to replacing its older Boeing 737 jets. The carrier, which owns 30 of the single-aisle aircraft, will consider proposals from both Boeing and Airbus, Mr Ueki said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

A few other CEOs flipped roti prata as cameras flashed.\n\nThe CEOs' Hawker Guide, the slim volume that was the reason for last night's event, is a collaboration of The Business Times and Knight Frank Pte Ltd. A follow-up to the first edition published in 2010, the book makes its debut against the backdrop of a rather more serious issue - that of the uncertain future of Singapore's hawker traditions as the culinary masters approach retirement with no clear succession plans.\n\nAs Alvin Tay, Editor of The Business Times, put it: \"Together with Knight Frank, we hope to use this book as a springboard for discussion and action - to promote the hawker profession as not just a noble one, but comfortable and even fashionable as well.\"\n\nThe \"action\" he mentioned was a reference to the book's mission - to raise money for a fund to help young people pick up hawker skills through a Business Times and Knight Frank initiative called Project Hawkerpreneur.\n\nThe book is not for sale, but for a minimum donation of $20 donors will receive a complimentary copy. More than $100,000 has already been raised, and a target of $300,000 has been set.\n\nThe book features the hawker food series published in the weekend edition of The Business Times between September 2012 and April 2013, as well as new exclusive content. To put the book together, 10 top executives, including Singapore Press Holdings CEO Alan Chan, Ambassador-at-Large in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Professor Tommy Koh and Kwek Leng Peck, executive director of Hong Leong Asia, each came up with a list of their 10 preferred stalls in various hawker food categories. The list was then sent to The Business Times' database of Who's Who in Singapore business, for them to vote for their favourites.\n\nAlso at the book launch, hosted by UBS and held at the UBS Business University Asia-Pacific Command House last night, were hawkers such as Casuarina Curry, Haron Satay, 328 Laksa, Tian Tian Chicken Rice, 968 Popiah, No 18 Zion Road Char Kway Teow and Founder Bak Kut Teh serving up their signature dishes.\n\nThe guests included Ronnie Tay, CEO of the National Environment Agency (NEA); Chong Siak Ching, CEO of the National Art Gallery; Tan Kian Chew, group CEO of NTUC FairPrice; and Chong Kee Hiong, CEO of OUE Hospitality Reit Management.\n\nEdmund Koh, Singapore country head and CEO of UBS Wealth Management South East Asia and the Asia-Pacific hub, said: \"Food is an important part of life in Singapore. . . The launch of the CEOs' Hawker Guide 2013 is a wonderful celebration of the street food tradition we have here.\"\n\nUnder the Project Hawkerpreneur initiative, YMCA, the beneficiary, will put aspiring hawkerpreneurs through the Hawker Master Trainer Pilot Programme set up by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency and the NEA. Aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship and preserving a piece of Singapore's street food culture, the initiative has already enlisted veteran hawkers to pass on their culinary skills to the participants who sign up for the programme. The target: To develop hawkers for the 10 new hawker centres to be built by 2017.\n\nKnight Frank's executive chairman Tan Tiong Cheng said: \"There is now an urgency to promote and ensure this cultural heritage remains alive. . . I believe the funds raised from the guide book will, in a small way, bring the need to preserve our unique food culture into sharp focus and encourage more Singaporeans into the trade.\"\n\nFor information on the Hawker Master Trainer Pilot Programme, please visit www.wda.gov.sg.

This is having a profound impact on enterprises, many of which are struggling with the issue of BYOD (bring your own device) and the extensive use of non-corporate apps such as Gmail and Evernote. The question is, are Singapore's chief information officers (CIOs) ready for this tectonic shift with the right set of policies? There used to be a saying that you can't get fired for choosing Microsoft. While this may still hold true, the new complexity that technology has brought in has made the task of CIOs that much harder and resistance to change is not an option. As Khoong Hock Yun, assistant CEO (Infrastructure and Services Development) of Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, said last week at a roundtable organised by BT, a good organisation-wide mobile strategy needs to strike the right balance between usability, cost and security.\n\nMicrosoft has been the long-standing incumbent in the enterprise applications space. However, viable alternatives have emerged thanks to the same technology trends alluded to by Ms Rometty. Google offers its cloud-based Google Docs and email service as a low-cost alternative to Microsoft's cash cows, Office and Outlook. Google's Chromebook - a notebook running on its Chrome OS (operating system) which essentially puts everything in the cloud - has become quite popular and can be bought for as little as $300. A combination of low-cost hardware and excellent cloud services - available for a small fee - that run on any machine or OS makes Google a viable alternative for many small businesses at least. At its big event earlier this week, Apple officially put its hat into the ring by offering its Mac OS and iLife and iWork suit of apps for free to users who buy its hardware. While iLife is a suite of mainly creative apps for Mac OS and iOS devices, iWork is Apple's answer to Microsoft's Office. Combined with its push of the popular iPad into the enterprise through BYOD, Apple has now made a strong case for iWork for the enterprise.\n\nTo be sure, Microsoft Office is far more feature-rich than the Apple or Google counterparts. However, the two competitors are setting an example that software and OS should come for free and storage should be in the cloud and not on devices. Microsoft generates around 96 per cent of its operating margins from its OS and productivity software and so this move would certainly be a cause for concern for the Redmond, Washington-based company. It is responding to the challenge in its own way, by shifting most of its software into cloud-based services and producing new types of devices such as the Surface tablet.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

But more likely than not, the dip last month will turn out to be a blip in an uptrend.\n\nHigh and rising costs of healthcare, housing and (in particular) transport continued to drive the consumer price index (CPI) this year, raising it 2.8 per cent in the first six months. Domestic cost issues in a labour-tight economy, coupled with a bigger concern over imported inflationary pressures, in fact kept the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) hand in at its recent October monetary policy review, with the Singapore dollar maintained on an appreciating path with no change in the slope, width and centre of the policy band. And arguably, despite the encouraging September CPI report - the market had expected the inflation rate to be maintained at August's 2 per cent - the risks of rising price pressures haven't dissipated. Indeed, if anything, the signs point to a pick-up in the inflation measures in the months ahead.\n\nWhat stands out in September's CPI numbers is the decline in transport costs - specifically, private road transport costs fell 2 per cent in the month, driven no doubt by fluctuations in vehicle certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums. Financing restrictions on motor vehicle loans introduced in February led to corrections in COE premiums in the ensuing months. But subsequent policy decisions since - particularly plans to regroup cars in the COE categories, taking into account engine power output as well - have resulted in swings in the vehicle premiums, mostly upwards, as buyers seek to pre-empt the changes. In fact, compared to August, car prices were actually higher in September. In any case, underlying the CPI transport figures over the past 12 months or so has been a high base effect that will soon run out, in fact from October.\n\nThe other key driver of domestic price pressures are manpower costs, given the tight labour market and restrictions on the hiring of foreigners across the lower and middle levels of the workforce. While employers and business owners brace themselves for rising labour costs, business rentals or pricier commercial vehicles, these higher costs will eventually pass on down to the consumer. For the year to September, Singapore's inflation rate stands at 2.5 per cent; some economists expect it to cross 3 per cent in the coming months and possibly touch 4 per cent by mid-2014. Even the official core inflation (excluding accommodation and private road transport) - 1.6 per cent for the first nine months of 2013 - is expected to rise to perhaps 3 per cent in 2014.\n\nSingapore may have withstood higher inflation in the past, but with the economy looking at another year in the fairly subdued 2.5-3.5 per cent growth range, the need to keep a lid on rising cost pressures should be amply clear.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its iMovie, Garageband and the productivity suite iWork - a rival to Microsoft's Office - will now be free with a new Apple Mac.\n\nCommenting on this, Jan Dawson, chief telecoms analyst at Ovum, said: \"Microsoft generates 96 per cent of its operating margins from its operating system and productivity software licensing. Apple is now teaching people to expect both of those things to be free. While this won't disrupt Microsoft's business overnight, it will create further pressure on Microsoft to bring down prices for its productivity software and especially for Windows.\"\n\nHe said that just as Google uses advertising revenue to fund its software and services, Apple is now using its hardware to subsidise its software across the board. \"The big question is: What can Microsoft do to compete, when its cash cow is being eroded by these moves from its competitors?\"\n\nThis has been a watershed year for the tablet market: For the first time, the Android operating system (OS) overtook Apple's iOS as the dominant tablet platform.\n\nInformation technology research and advisory company Gartner noted that Android's market share is 49.6 per cent, and that of iOS, 48.6 per cent; last year, Android was at 44.9 per cent and iOS, 53.9 per cent.\n\nFor Apple, therefore, the success of its two tablets - iPad and iPad Mini - is key, since it would not want a repetition of what happened in the smartphone market, where Android, once it overtook iOS, raced ahead to corner nearly 80 per cent marketshare, leaving Apple's share in the low to mid-teens.\n\nAvinash K Sundaram, IDC Asia-Pacific's senior market analyst, told The Business Times that Apple's commitment to deliver the Retina-class iPad Mini as early as in the last quarter of this year \"was a pleasant surprise\" and signalled the Apple camp's urgency in regaining its grip on the tablet market.\n\nHe said: \"While these new launches will help Apple regain some lost ground in the short term, longer-term though, Android will continue to chip away at Apple's share, especially as players in this eco-system continue to bring out similar products at much lower price points.\"\n\nGartner vice-president of research Carolina Milanesi pointed out, however, that Android's market share comes from lower-end devices. \"We need to account for that when judging the success Android has had over iOS.\"\n\nThomas Husson, vice-president and principal analyst for marketing and strategy at global research and advisory firm Forrester, said that Apple is best placed to maintain its premium positioning, and Android to capture the mass-market, given that its OS is open to a wider range of original equipment maker partners.\n\n\"It is just the beginning for Microsoft, but it has stronger assets in the business space. That said, by offering free OS software (OS X Mavericks for Macs) and services (iWork and others), Apple can play a strong role in the business space, thanks to its Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) developments.\"\n\nMs Milanesi added: \"iOS will be more high-end than Android and it will also be about enterprise, but still, more a mix between BYOD and enterprise versus Microsoft, which will remain mainly enterprise-focused.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As for those whose cars are still on order, stock only arrives next year, so there's no rush to bid for a COE.\"\n\nThe managing director's last remark was a reference to the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class, whose 1.6-litre model is said to have sparked the recent surge in the Cat A premium.\n\nAs for the Cat B premium, he said there was some uncertainty initially about its direction because its spike in the previous tender had been attributed to a luxury brand's aggressive bidding. But as it turned out, he was pleasantly surprised by its almost $5,600 drop.\n\n\"I thought it would be plus or minus $2,000 to $3,000,\" he said.\n\nBut it was the Cat E premium that caught most off-guard. It jumped from about $70,000 to $90,000 with half an hour left to the end of the tender, when the other categories were still at $1.\n\n\"I understand one of the luxury brands is stocking up on Cat E COEs to make a final sales push at the end of the year and top the market rankings,\" he said.\n\nLooking ahead, he believes the Cat A premium will rebound because mass market car buyers, who have been on the sidelines, will return to the showrooms.\n\n\"There are many Japanese and Korean car buyers who have been priced out of the market and are just waiting for the right time to come in,\" he said.\n\nAs for Cat B, he believes it will also rise again. His reason?\n\n\"Cat E has set the pace, so Cat B has no choice but to follow it.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was not unexpected, as the TDSR framework (under which financial institutions are required to take a borrower's total debt servicing obligations into account when granting property loans) was targeted at Singaporeans rather than at foreigners.\n\nIn contrast, the initial rollout of the additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) back in December 2011 had a much bigger impact on foreign buyers.

Mac users won't have to pay to upgrade to the latest operating system, the company said at its event on Tuesday. Those who buy a new product won't pay for work software like spreadsheets or creative photo and movie packages - on the device or in the cloud. In short, Apple, like Google, is training users to expect software to be free. For Microsoft, that's a problem.\n\nThe iPhone and iPad maker uses software to sell premium hardware, so its approach makes sense. Macs are pricier than entry-level PCs. And the company led by Tim Cook is forgoing only a small chunk of revenue. Even including the hugely popular iTunes with its paid-for content, software and services accounted for less than 10 per cent of the company's revenue in the first nine months of the year. Those already sold on the advantages of Apple's products will get a slightly cheaper meal. Having all the software thrown in may also attract new customers.\n\nGoogle started this fire with its free Android operating system for mobile phones as well as its calendars, word processing capability and other online software. Google's method is slightly different - it uses advertising sales to subsidise the creation and distribution of these programs. But from their different angles, both the search giant and Apple are well on the way to making sure users get used to free software.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The multilateral body has to intervene in this matter,\" KN Shrivastava, India's aviation secretary, told Reuters.\n\nAlong with China, India has defied the European Union move, even refusing to submit emissions data before the EU suspended it for a year amid threats of a trade war.\n\nThe EU proposal also could push the US government to invoke a law signed by President Barack Obama in November 2012 that would shield US airlines from what Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx may deem an unfair charge.\n\nRepublican Senator John Thune, who introduced the measure in the Senate, will raise the issue in a letter to Mr Foxx and other US officials, his office said. The law gives the secretary of transportation the authority to ensure that US carriers are not penalised by unilateral EU emissions charges.\n\nICAO negotiators this month reached a consensus on a market-based system to curb carbon emissions from airlines by 2020, but rejected a proposal to let Europe apply its own plan to foreign carriers in the meantime. The deal averted a looming global trade dispute over aviation emissions.\n\nUS airlines hope that because the European Commission's most recent proposal was a draft, the Europeans will revise the plan in line with what was agreed to at ICAO, according to Vaughn Jennings, spokesman for the industry group Airlines for America (A4A).\n\nThe European Commission said it is acting in good faith. \"Limiting it to EU airspace and not touching on somebody's else's airspace.

The owner of the Four Points by Sheraton overlooking Sydney's Darling Harbour dropped plans to raise as much as $463 million in April 2012 because demand was weaker than targeted, two people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.\n\n\"Whenever the market recovers, we'll look at a listing seriously, whether it's Australia or Singapore,\" Mr Kum said in an interview in Singapore on Tuesday. \"We'll continue to look at Australia, at Brisbane, Perth\" for acquisitions, he said of the state capitals of Queensland and Western Australia.\n\nCapital values of hotels in Australian city centres are expected to rise 2.7 per cent over the next two years, the strongest growth of any commercial property asset class, according to a second-quarter survey of real estate professionals by National Australia Bank Ltd.\n\nCompanies have raised US$4.8 billion through initial public offerings (IPOs) in Singapore in the past year, with real estate investment trusts (Reits) and business trusts accounting for the majority of fund raising, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Australia, they raised US$2 billion, the data show.\n\nMr Kum declined to give more details on the next listing attempt. M&L owns two hotels each in Melbourne and Sydney, where its 683-room Four Points was cited by the New South Wales state government as the biggest in the country. The property, along with assets including Japan's Hilton Nagoya, the Swissotel in Sydney and the Ibis in Singapore, were among the hotels in the earlier share sale in the city-state.\n\nM&L last week said that it had received government approval to expand its Sydney Four Points by adding a third tower and 230 rooms. The company is also spending about A$6 million (S$7.2 million) to upgrade its Citigate Hotel in Melbourne from an \"economy\" to a \"mid-scale\" property, Mr Kum said.\n\nIn addition to Australia, M&L owns four hotels in Japan, one in Singapore, one in New Zealand and two in London.\n\nThe decision to consider the Australian stock market also came after the Singapore benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) posted the smallest gain among the world's developed markets. The Australian benchmark stock gauge has climbed 16 per cent this year, compared with the STI's 1.4 per cent advance, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Singapore dollar has increased 1.1 per cent this year against the US currency, while the Australian dollar fell 6.3 per cent, the most among developed markets.\n\n\"In the case of Singapore and Australia, both are quite developed markets, so the risk capital is not going to diverge that much,\" said Alan Richardson, a Hong Kong-based money manager at Samsung Asset Management Ltd. \"This is a good time for opportunistically listing Reits right now because the risk-free rates have peaked over the next three to six months, so there is this window of opportunity.\"\n\nM&L is also considering the stock offering as hotel property sales increased. Asia-Pacific hotel sales more than doubled to US$2.8 billion in the third quarter, with Australia, Singapore and Japan accounting for 83 per cent of the investments, property broker Savills plc said in a report on Oct 7. Hotel sales will rise about 30 per cent in the fourth quarter, it added.\n\nThe S&P/ASX 200 A-Reit Index that tracks property trusts in Australia trades at a 5.3 per cent yield, while a similar gauge of Reits in Singapore offers 4.9 per cent. Still, the valuations are higher in Australia, where the Reit index trades at 18 times earnings, or twice the multiple for Singapore.\n\n\"Wherever there's good opportunity, that's where we go,\" Mr Kum said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7c60d0d4f6066a31aaa2488db99b7acf8bb68e0d4942e04ae1254d4c2c27fcf0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "'Whenever the market recovers, we'll look at a listing . . . whether it's Australia or Singapore.'- Mr Kum- PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

This offset the absence of contributions from CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan, which is undergoing asset-enhancement works, said CRCT Management Limited (CRCTML), the manager of CRCT.\n\nFor the quarter under review, tenants' sales in the multi-tenanted malls, except CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan, rose 10.1 per cent year-on-year, while shopper traffic rose 3.4 per cent.\n\nOn the rental reversion front, the multi-tenanted malls excluding CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan rose 10 per cent. \"We have already secured leasing commitments and are also in advanced negotiations with other retailers, which together account for nearly 60.0 per cent of the total net lettable area,\" said Tony Tan, chief executive of CRCTML.\n\nProviding an update on the asset-enhancement initiative at CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan, CRCTML said more than half of the space to be leased had been committed or was under advanced negotiations, with rents achieved at 15.8 per cent higher than the target rent (excluding the anchor tenant).\n\nSome of the committed tenants include UA Cinemas (the only IMAX within the vicinity), Swatch, Charles & Keith and Starbucks.\n\nIn yuan terms, gross revenue for Q3 dipped 1.3 per cent to 191.7 million yuan (S$38.8 million). This was due to the absence of contributions from CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan. As a result, net property income (NPI) fell 4.3 per cent to 121.1 million yuan. This translates into gross revenue of $39.5 million, a 2.2 per cent year-on-year increase.\n\n\"As for our proposed acquisition of Grand Canyon Mall, we have submitted the application to the Chinese government and we expect to receive official approval before year-end,\" said Mr Tan.\n\n\"The target NPI yield of the mall in the longer term is 7.0 per cent to 8.0 per cent. Following the expected completion of the acquisition by the first quarter of next year, we can further maximise the potential of this mall and enhance returns to our unitholders.\"\n\nOCBC Investment Research yesterday increased its fair value on the counter to $1.64 from $1.58, maintaining its \"buy\" rating on CRCT.\n\nSeparately, CRCT said it was issuing 45.4 million new units at $1.30 per unit through a non-renounceable preferential offering to its existing unitholders. This will be made on the basis of six new units for every 100 existing units held by eligible unitholders.\n\nCRCT targets to raise gross proceeds of about $59 million; the net proceeds raised will partly finance the proposed acquisition of Grand Canyon Mall in Beijing.\n\nIn support of CRCT, CapitaMalls Asia has committed to take up its pro-rata entitlement, and to undertake to apply for excess units to the extent that CapitaMall Trust does not accept its pro-rata entitlement under the preferential offering. The remaining 62.5 per cent of the units is fully underwritten by DBS Bank, the lead manager and underwriter of the offering.\n\nCRCT ended unchanged at $1.395 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Matters which are currently communicated only between auditors and those charged with governance are now brought to the table and presented in a public report.\n\n\"Secondly, the requirements for more disclosures result in renewed focus of the auditor on the key matters to be reported, which may help to increase professional scepticism and thereby improve audit quality. Providing greater transparency about the audit also improves the perception and visibility of audit quality, perhaps 'repairing' the damage done to the audit profession in the light of corporate scandals, and increasing the confidence that users have in the audit and in the financial statements.\"\n\nHaving a new \"key audit matters\" section is one of the more significant proposals in the ED. The IAASB had originally asked for an \"auditor commentary\" to highlight matters \"likely to be most important to users' understanding of the audited financial statements or the audit\". But feedback indicated that such a commentary would be too subjective as the onus would be on the auditor to determine the issues to be highlighted.\n\nIn response, the ED suggests that key audit matters be determined through the following criteria:\n\nThis section must be included in the auditor's report for listed companies; for non-listed companies, its inclusion is up to the auditor unless required by law.\n\nAnother key proposal is a new section which will contain the auditor's conclusion on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting - a move that will involve management to a greater extent on this issue. Currently, management is not required to state the company's going concern unless material uncertainties have been identified.\n\nMs Fua and Mr Kang wrote: \"These changes may also bring about an improvement in the quality of financial reporting. Key audit matters are required to make reference to the corresponding management's disclosure in the financial statements, so that users understand the management's and the auditor's perspectives on those matters raised. This would no doubt result in greater focus on high-quality disclosures as management would now be more mindful of their assumptions used, figures presented and related disclosures.\n\n\"The enhanced auditor's report will also lead to a more robust dialogue between auditors, management and those charged with governance, particularly on the key audit matters that will be communicated.\"\n\nHow these proposals will apply in the Singapore context will be discussed by the profession and other stakeholders today at an event organised by ISCA.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We will base the tax on the gross revenue and not on the net profit. The tax concession is on investment and not on the hotel operation. We will clarify all these in the new gazette.\"\n\nThe ministry over the weekend released photos of Mr Packer meeting officials in Sri Lanka and Mr Abeywardena said he had asked Mr Packer to invest more in the country.\n\n\"He said he was willing to bring more investments.

Many overseers of public pension funds, desperate to bolster returns and meet ballooning retiree obligations, have turned from traditional investments like stocks and bonds to hedge funds and private equity. These so-called alternative investments now account for almost one-quarter of the roughly US$2.6 trillion in public pension assets under management nationwide, up from 10 per cent in 2006, according to Cliffwater, an adviser to institutional investors. Investments in public companies' shares, by contrast, fell to 49 percent from 61 percent in the period.\n\nFans of alternative investments argue that they can generate higher returns. But the increased risks, higher fees and lack of transparency associated with such investments make them problematic. A 2007 paper by Fiona Stewart at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris said that \"lack of transparency makes the level of risk and type of exposure hard to gauge\" in hedge funds.\n\nLast week, an investigation of the Rhode Island pension system's recent foray into alternative investments raised fresh questions about the high costs and considerable risks of investing in hedge funds and whether their returns are indeed worth it.\n\nThe investigation, by Benchmark Financial Services, a forensic firm hired by a Rhode Island council of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, concluded that the US$7.7 billion Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island was at risk because of its increased concentration in high-cost and opaque alternative investments. The union represents workers whose pensions are invested by the state.\n\nIn less than two years, the Rhode Island pension system has ramped up its investments in hedge funds, private equity and venture capital from zero to almost US$2 billion, or more than one-quarter of its assets under management. But this mix of investments hasn't outperformed the fund's peers, the Benchmark report said. For the year ended June 30, the fund returned 11.07 per cent, against 12.43 per cent earned by the median public pension fund.\n\nGenerating returns on the Rhode Island pension is a task of Gina M Raimondo, the state's general treasurer, who is also chairwoman of its retirement board. A Democrat, she was elected in 2010; previously, she was a partner at Point Judith Capital, a smallish venture capital firm.\n\nAs treasurer, Ms Raimondo has won national praise for her efforts to reform the state's public pension system.\n\nShe published a report on Rhode Island's pension problems in 2011. At the time, the state employees' pension fund was only 57.4 per cent funded and had increasing obligations. The state legislature passed a law increasing the retirement age for many workers and tying cost-of-living adjustments to actual investment returns. Unions are now challenging that law in the courts.\n\nBut even as many retirees in the Ocean State have experienced benefit cuts, the Benchmark Financial report contends that hedge fund managers are earning rich fees that could otherwise be used to shore up the state's pension. A recent report in The Providence Journal said investment expenses at the pension were US$70 million for the year that ended June 30. Earlier estimates had investment expenses amounting to around US$11.5 million for the period, the Benchmark report said.\n\nIt is well known that hedge funds charge much higher fees than other money managers. The alternative investments in the Rhode Island pension charge management fees of as much as 2.5 per cent and performance fees of up to 20 per cent of profits. Transaction costs are additional.\n\nUnfortunately, the hedge funds held by the state have underperformed the overall stock market so far this year. As of Aug 31, the most recent data available, the Rhode Island State Investment Commission said its 10 hedge funds investing in stocks returned an average of 8.73 per cent, while nine so-called real-return hedge funds generated 3.61 per cent. Neither matched the 16.15 per cent gains in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index during the period.\n\nAsked about the problems highlighted in the Benchmark report, Ms Raimondo, through a spokeswoman, declined to be interviewed. But in a news release, Ms Raimondo's office said the report was motivated by her political enemies.\n\nEdward AH Siedle, the president of Benchmark Financial Services in Ocean Ridge, Florida, conducted the investigation into the Rhode Island pension's investments. A former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr Siedle said he found it troubling that state officials won't require the hedge fund managers they have hired to disclose how they are investing the pension's money. He also noted conflicts of interest common at hedge funds that may put the Rhode Island pension at a disadvantage to insiders or favoured investors.\n\nA review of documents from three of the hedge funds managing money for the Rhode Island pension fund show that some investors are more equal than others. Special treatment includes fee discounts, more frequent redemption rights than those given to other investors, and the ability to receive reports including information about the fund's portfolio that is not provided to other shareholders.\n\n\"The hedge fund documents all say that 'We're not going to disclose what we are doing with your money',\" Mr Siedle said. \"However, they say that certain strategic investors will be told what's being done with your money and that those strategic investors may use that information to profit at your expense.\" The documents don't specify who might receive these benefits. Instead, they note that the benefits may be based on the size of an investor's holdings in the fund or that they may be granted to an investor who agrees to hold an investment for a significant time.\n\nMr Siedle questions why any state pension plan would agree to invest under such unequal terms.\n\n\"The hedge fund industry has maintained that they should be allowed to manage public pension money in secret,\" he said. \"But now we have evidence that insidious business practices are involved. The performance is bad enough, but when you add in these other features, these investments are inherently unsuitable for public pensions.\"\n\nJoy Fox, the Rhode Island treasurer's spokeswoman, said in a statement: \"Strong returns from our investments, including alternative investments, help move the pension fund closer to the 80 per cent funded level, where the cost-of-living adjustments come back. We constantly monitor our investment strategy, and make changes when necessary.\"\n\nIt is clear that public pensions, like many investors, are being hurt by the Federal Reserve's zero-interest-rate policy. But investors who reach for yield do so at their peril. And when the investments that retirees in any state are relying on involve high costs, opacity and conflicts, that can only increase the hazards. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

As Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin pointed out in Parliament on Monday, the aim is to ensure that Singaporean professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) are fairly considered, not only at the job entry stage but throughout their careers. To this end, the MOM will monitor companies' human resource (HR) practices, and watch for those that breach certain thresholds relating to the proportion of Singaporean PMEs in their employ, among other benchmarks.\n\nOverall, the move is well intended and has many merits, at least on paper. Over time, it could help achieve the goal of ensuring a \"Singaporean core\" in workplaces. It can boost skill development and the upgrading of Singaporean workers, as companies will have to work harder to ensure that such workers are capable of not only filling jobs but performing them to the standard required. It may also be popular with voters. However, in practice, the move could prove challenging. Extending government scrutiny to the actual operations of companies in hundreds of different industries can be not only difficult, but also risky. If done in an intrusive, heavy-handed manner, it can compromise operational effectiveness and lead to higher costs for business and a loss of competitiveness. It can also hamper business expansion and reduce the attractiveness of Singapore as a business destination, translating eventually into lower economic growth, less cutting edge innovation, and fewer opportunities for Singaporeans - which would be the opposite of what was intended.\n\nGetting the implementation right will therefore be key, which is also what a number of HR professionals pointed out when asked for their reactions to the proposed measures. Certain points of caution are worth flagging. To cite just three: first, not all companies' HR practices can be easily compared, even with other companies in the same industry - they may occupy different niches, serve different markets and face different constraints. Second, as a number of CEOs have pointed out, companies have special needs. For example, some may be using Singapore as a regional base and may need to bring in talent from the region for staff development and to foster exchanges of ideas and knowledge. Third, as also noted by CEOs, Singapore is a multinational business hub and as such, there will be companies that need an international workforce - which is less true of many other countries, whose policies on HR practices may therefore not be an appropriate guide for Singapore.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Venture capital and private equity investments also remain popular, a report by Swiss bank UBS and research specialist Campden Wealth has found.\n\nThe report surveyed or interviewed more than 25 family offices in Asia-Pacific which manage a range of wealth, from under $100 million to over $1 billion.\n\nDavid Bain, head of research at Campden Wealth, said that while Asia's wealthiest families are becoming more optimistic about investment returns, they are not putting more money in equities and hedge funds.\n\n\"On the contrary, they are cutting their investment allocations to these asset classes and, like their counterparts in Europe, investing more in direct investment opportunities like other businesses and property,\" he said.\n\nAsked to give an expected asset allocation over the next three years, family offices said they plan to increase their property allocation from 16 per cent now to 22 per cent. Meanwhile, their cash holdings are estimated to drop from 14 per cent to 8 per cent.\n\nThe report noted that the preference for property is similar across other regions because property is seen as a low-risk asset with an easy-to-understand profile, even though it could become a speculative and risky asset to hold in some markets.\n\nEquities will still take up about a quarter of family office portfolios, split into 16 per cent for developed market equities and 10 per cent for emerging market equities.\n\nAfter equities and property come direct venture capital or private equity investments, taking up 15 per cent. Bonds will take up 12 per cent, with investment grade bonds more popular than junk bonds.\n\nMeanwhile, family offices expect to cut their commodities and private equity fund allocations from 4 per cent each to 3 per cent each, keep their hedge fund allocation at 5 per cent, and invest 2 per cent each in real estate investment trusts, passion investments, and other tangible assets.\n\nThe report noted that last year, family offices were more inclined to invest in commodities.\n\nThe most promising sectors to invest in were healthcare and energy. This was followed by consumer discretionary and information technology businesses. The least popular were telecommunications, materials and utilities.\n\nThe most worrying aspect of financial markets for family offices were macroeconomic risks like inflation, and investment strategies pitched to them that were difficult to understand.\n\nCiting the collapse of a couple of notable hedge funds, a Hong Kong family office chief investment officer noted: \"If they can't give me the elevator pitch on how they make money, I'm not interested in them.\"\n\nFamily offices set up to manage wealth are still relatively rare in Asia as entrepreneurs here prefer to concentrate on their family business.

This was mainly attributable to the additional rental income from upward rental adjustments and acquisitions of investment properties completed in 2012 and 2013.\n\nThe weighted average lease term to expiry for the portfolio was 3.4 years as at end-September, with no renewal risk for 2013, and only 3 per cent of leases expiring in 2014. More than 25 per cent of the gross floor area has been committed beyond 2017.\n\nSaid Daniel Cerf, chief executive officer of ARA-CWT Trust Management (Cache) Limited, the manager of Cache Logistics Trust: \"Cache continues to deliver steady financial performance. The portfolio remains fully leased with only 3 per cent of leases expiring in 2014. We continue our pursuit of yield-accretive acquisitions as well as organic growth opportunities in both AEI (asset enhancement initiative) redevelopment and built-to-suit projects.\"\n\nFor the nine months ended September, DPU rose 4.8 per cent to 6.507 cents from 6.211 cents while distributable income rose 15.7 per cent to $48.9 million. Gross revenue rose 12.6 per cent to $60.3 million while NPI rose 12.5 per cent to $57.2 million.\n\nLooking ahead, the manager said that the global economic and political uncertainty and increased incoming warehouse supply over the coming years is largely balanced with resilient end-user demand for quality logistics warehouse space and efforts underway to establish new port infrastructure to facilitate growth in trade and logistics.\n\nThe manager expects to continue to deliver continued growth for 2013.\n\nThe distribution of 2.126 cents per unit will be payable on Nov 27.\n\nCache ended trading unchanged yesterday at $1.195.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ray Dalio, the 64-year-old founder of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world with some US$150 billion under management, has quietly begun teaching his investment secrets on YouTube.\n\nMr Dalio, who is said to be worth some US$13 billion, was one of the few investors to see the financial crisis of 2008 developing, and perhaps just as important, the rebound. He's made his money by predicting big macroeconomic cycles. His economic theories, up until now, have been known only to a small group of investors and those willing to pay his firm 2 per cent management fees and 20 per cent of the investment profits.\n\nMr Dalio's plain-spoken 30-minute video is an oddly entertaining animated cartoon filled with provocative theories about the way the economy runs. He dispenses with the way economists have long taught economics in school, and instead explains the economy as if it were a \"machine\" that he believes is much easier to understand and predict.\n\nThe average Main Street investor has probably never heard of him. It also may seem counterintuitive that a money manager who sells his clients on his foresight would want to preach to the masses. But he told me that he decided to make the video to demystify economic cycles because he believes most investors, regulators and politicians are focused on the wrong issues.\n\n\"While I kept it confidential until recently, I now want to share it because I believe that it could be very helpful in reducing big economic blunders, if it was more broadly understood,\" he wrote in an email. He explained that: \"I believe that most influential decision makers and most people cause a lot of needless economic suffering because they are missing the fundamentals.\" Mr Dalio believes that the traditional approach to economics is too academic and impractical. It is one of the reasons he, and others, believe that the Federal Reserve and many other institutions missed the signs of the financial crisis.\n\nJust as there is monetarism and Keynesianism, Mr Dalio's approach may be a more practical way to think about the economic cause-and-effect relationships. There are refreshingly basic explanations for neophytes in his video, titled \"How the Economic Machine Works\", that even the most sophisticated investors will appreciate.\n\n\"Think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward,\" he says, explaining that to buy something you can't afford today, \"you essentially need to borrow from your future self. In doing so you create a time in the future that you need to spend less than you make in order to pay it back\". This is how he explains austerity: \"When borrowers stop taking on new debts, and start paying down old debts, you might expect the debt burden to decrease. But the opposite happens. Because spending is cut - and one man's spending is another man's income - it causes incomes to fall.\" Mr Dalio's effort is attracting attention with both students of economics and the financial cognoscenti. Already, more than 300,000 people have viewed the video since it went up last month. Henry M Paulson Jr, the former Treasury secretary, has been sending the link to friends.\n\nPaul A Volcker, the former Fed chairman, a fan of the cartoon, described it as \"unconventional but it casts strong light on how the economy actually works, with its history of repetitive and ultimately destructive excesses in credit creation. The analysis points the way to practical ways central banks and governments can ease the pain of defaults and deleveraging.\"\n\nMr Dalio has been compared to George Soros and has become something of a philosopher king in recent years - though it is worth noting that his firm's returns in the last year have been a bit lacklustre.\n\nMr Dalio has always believed he can see more clearly than others. His approach to running his firm, for example, is based on 210 rules he devised in a handbook for his firm called Principles. (Among them: \"Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion.\") As a result of his unconventional management style, his firm has been likened to a cult, a description that irks him because he believes it undervalues the success of the approach.\n\nUnlike traditional economists - Mr Dalio isn't one - he does not focus on the much-watched statistics that most economists depend on. He also doesn't focus on basic theories like supply and demand nor does he believe that monetary policymakers can control inflation simply by controlling the money supply. He derides the MV=PQ formula that is a central principle of economics. (A quick economics lesson, by way of TheStreet.com: \"M is the money supply; V is velocity - the number of times per year the average dollar is spent; P is prices of goods and services; and Q is quantity of goods and services. The equation suggests that if V is constant and M is increasing, there must be an increase in either Q or P.\") That theory, developed by the esteemed Milton Friedman, leads to the wrong conclusions, he says.\n\nMr Dalio said in an email that his template indicates the formula \"is misleading because there really isn't much 'velocity' of money happening as most of what we call velocity is credit growth, which is very different and has different reasons for happening. Velocity is made out to be some vague force that drives the rate that money goes around, and it's not that at all. I believe that we should agree that spending comes from either money (with a bit of velocity) or credit and we should understand how each is made up and spent to make nominal GDP (gross domestic product).\" If that sounds a bit confusing, that's because it is. But his video is more straightforward.\n\nFor example, he says that there are only two types of economic cycles, but investors always seem to miss them. \"One takes about five to 10 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years. While most people feel the swings, they typically don't see them as cycles because they see them too up close - day by day, week by week,\" he says in his video.\n\nSo where are we now in the economic cycle? He doesn't exactly say. But based on his theories, we are probably in the back half of a long deleveraging, which Mr Dalio says he doesn't believe has to be a bad thing.\n\n\"The key is to avoid printing too much money and causing unacceptably high inflation, the way Germany did during its deleveraging in the 1920s,\" he says. \"If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn't so dramatic. Growth is slow but debt burdens go down. That's a beautiful deleveraging,\" he continues. \"It takes roughly a decade or more for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal - hence the term 'lost decade'.\" So if you studied his lesson, you can estimate that it will be 2018, or at least 10 years after the crisis, before you can begin to proclaim all clear. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

This represents a 1.6-1.8 per cent discount to the trust's last closing price of $1.23 on Oct 21. The placement offer amounted to an estimated $125 million.\n\nBy the market close on Tuesday, some 163 million shares worth $194.4 million had changed hands, market data from the Singapore Exchange showed.\n\nTemasek's share sale works out to 3.74 per cent of KReit, representing the stake it had received from the dividend in specie distributed by Keppel Corp to its shareholders during its FY2012 final results announced on Jan 24, 2013.\n\nOn top of a final cash dividend of 27 cents, Keppel had distributed a special dividend in specie of one KReit unit for every five Keppel Corp shares held.\n\nTemasek, Singapore's state-owned investment company, continues to hold a small deemed stake in KReit through Keppel Land and Keppel Corp.\n\nTemasek continues to hold 21 per cent in Keppel Corp which in turn holds 54.6 per cent in Keppel Land. Keppel itself has less than a 1 per cent stake in KReit following its two rounds of dividend in specie, while Keppel Land remains KReit's largest shareholder at 44.86 per cent.\n\nBesides Keppel group, the other significant shareholders are Capital Group, Franklin Resources, Goldman Sachs and Aberdeen.\n\nWith the Temasek share placement, KReit's free float will rise to more than 55 per cent from 24.4 per cent in January.\n\nAccording to some analysts, Temasek's decision to sell its KReit shares could potentially lead to further placements from other Keppel shareholders who had received the dividend in specie earlier this year.\n\nKReit recently posted a 9.9 per cent increase in net property income to $100.9 million for the nine months to Sept 30, 2013. Distributable income rose 6 per cent to $159 million, while distribution per unit rose 1.9 per cent to 5.91 cents.\n\nFor Q3 2013, the group announced a distribution per unit of 1.97 cents, which works out to a distribution yield of 6.4 per cent.\n\nManagement had said that its total portfolio value was more than $6.8 billion.

Vessels of that size going from the East Coast to Asia currently have to go around Cape Horn or through the Suez Canal.\n\nConstruction to double the canal's capacity is 64 per cent complete, the Panama Canal Authority said on its website on Sept 10. The expanded waterway will be able to handle ships as long as 366 metres and as wide as 49 metres, against the current 294 metres and 32 metres, data on the website show. Only seven of the VLGC fleet's 154 vessels can use the canal now, according to data from IHS Maritime, a Coulsdon, England-based research company.\n\nOnce the canal project is completed, sailing time will be cut to 25 days, compared with 41 via Cape Horn, Sanford Bernstein's Neil Beveridge, a senior analyst in Hong Kong, said. Freight costs will be reduced by 30-50 per cent, he said.\n\nThe expansion comes as Asia's appetite for lower-cost NGLs is increasing. China has approved the construction of 17 propane dehydrogenation units, which convert propane into propylene used to make plastics, antifreeze, deodorant and other consumer products. The new plants will require 12 million tonnes per year of propane, most of which will probably be imported from the US, Sanford Bernstein said.\n\nChina's economic growth accelerated for the first time in three quarters, as Premier Li Keqiang spurred factory output and investment to meet the government's expansion goal for 2013.\n\nGross domestic product rose 7.8 per cent in the July-September period from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said last Friday in Beijing, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. Industrial production advanced last month by 10.2 per cent.\n\n\"Most of the uptick in US propane deliveries overseas has been very recent,\" said Hassan Ahmed, head of research at Alembic Global Advisors in New York. \"If the glut of NGLs in the US continues, you're definitely going to see more exports to the Asia market.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The minimum reserve price is set at $39 million, which translates to $415 per square foot on the existing gross floor area of 93,969 sq ft for the campus. Situated near the former Turf Club grounds, the 130,216 sq ft site is zoned for \"educational institution\" use under the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) Master Plan 2008.\n\nThe school's enrolment has been on the rise and has outgrown its current premises. Besides the Bukit Tinggi premises, GESS operates a campus on a short-lease site on Jalan Jurong Kechil in the Bukit Batok area.\n\nSelling a long sub-lease for the Bukit Tinggi premises to another educational institution will help the school to fund development of a new campus in Upper Bukit Timah which is expected to be ready in 2017 and which will replace the current two locations.\n\nGESS is currently in talks with the Singapore authorities for allocation of the site for the new campus.\n\nThe school has appointed Savills Singapore to find a sub-lessee for the Bukit Tinggi premises. \"We expect strong interest in this attractive asset, given that such an offering is rarely brought to the market by the private sector,\" said Suzie Mok, senior director of investment sales at Savills Singapore. \"Currently, the supply of both long- term sites and temporary facilities for educational institutions is made available only by the state. On the demand side, there is growing interest from many educational institutions seeking quality premises on a long-term basis.\"\n\nThe sub-lessee will not be allowed to redevelop the site. The existing buildings and facilities can support an enrolment of up to 800 students.\n\nThe property includes seven low-rise blocks, carpark lots, a basketball court, playground and a forum. Two of the blocks were completed in the mid-1980s while the remaining buildings were added in 2000. \"The campus is well kept with refurbishments and upgrading programmes implemented in various phases,\" said Savills.\n\nThe tender will close on Nov 18.\n\nThe 26-year lease period is expected to begin on Aug 1, 2018, after GESS has begun operating at its new location.\n\nPayment for the lease will also be staggered. After forking out an initial 10 per cent deposit when the contract is awarded (probably some time later this year or early next year), the sub-lessee will pay another 10 per cent on each anniversary of the contract date with the balance to be paid on completion of the lease sale, which is expected in 2018.\n\nMarket watchers reckon GESS is selling a 26-year lease term on the Bukit Tinggi property probably because it expects to be awarded a 30-year lease term for its new site in Upper Bukit Timah by the Singapore authorities.\n\nCurrently, GESS has a 68-year balance lease term out of a 100-year lease it was granted in 1981 on the Bukit Tinggi property by an entity understood to be linked to Swiss Club Singapore. That entity holds a 999-year leasehold interest (from August 1878) on the site granted by the state.\n\nGESS's two existing campuses have a combined enrolment of more than 1,500 students aged between 18 months and 18 years.\n\nThe junior school campus on Jalan Jurong Kechil is for pre-primary and primary school students. It is on land leased from the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) on a 3+3+3 years lease which is due to expire in 2017. The Singapore authorities have informed GESS that no long-term lease can be granted for this location, according to information on the school website.\n\nThe main campus on Bukit Tinggi Road, for secondary students and kindergarten kids, has reached its maximum capacity of 800 students and is not large enough for GESS's entire and still-growing student population.\n\nSince 2009, GESS has been working with the Economic Development Board (EDB) on finding a sustainable long-term solution post-2017. It is currently negotiating with the Singapore Government for the allocation of a site in Upper Bukit Timah to build a new school to host its entire student population in a single campus that will be ready in 2017. \"We are not allowed to mention the location till the final approval by EDB/URA is given,\" said a GESS spokeswoman.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Previously that level of scrutiny applied only to individuals entering the United States.\n\nThe pre-screening, some of which is already taking place, is described in documents the TSA released to comply with government regulations about the collection and use of individuals' data, but the details of the programme have not been announced publicly.\n\nIt is unclear what information the agency is relying upon precisely to make these risk assessments, given the extensive range of records it can access, including tax identification number, past travel itineraries, property records, physical characteristics, and law enforcement or intelligence information.\n\nThe measures go beyond the background check the government has conducted for years, called Secure Flight, in which a passenger's name, gender and date of birth are compared with terrorist watch lists. Now, the search includes using a traveller's passport number, which is already used to screen people at the border, and other identifiers to access a system of databases maintained by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nPrivacy groups contacted by The New York Times expressed concern over the security agency's widening reach.\n\n\"I think the best way to look at it is as a pre-crime assessment every time you fly,\" said Edward Hasbrouck, a consultant to the Identity Project, one of the groups that oppose the prescreening initiatives. \"The default will be the highest, most intrusive level of search, and anything less will be conditioned on providing some additional information in some fashion.\"\n\nThe TSA, which has been criticised for a one-size-fits-all approach to screening travellers, said the initiatives were needed to make the procedures more targeted.\n\n\"Secure Flight has successfully used information provided to airlines to identify and prevent known or suspected terrorists or other individuals on no-fly lists from gaining access to airplanes or secure areas of airports,\" the security agency said in a statement. \"Additional risk assessments are used for those higher-risk passengers.\"\n\nAn agency official discussed some aspects of the initiative on the condition that she not be identified. She emphasised that the main goal of the programme was to identify low-risk travellers for lighter screening at airport security checkpoints, adapting methods similar to those used to flag suspicious people entering the United States.\n\nAnyone who has never travelled outside the United States would not have a passport number on file and would, therefore, not be subject to the rules that the agency uses to determine risk, she said, although documents indicate that the agency is pre-screening all passengers in some fashion.\n\nThe official added that these rules consider things such as an individual's travel itinerary, length of stay abroad and type of travel document, like a passport. If an airline has a traveller's passport number on file, it is required to share that information with the TSA, even for a domestic flight.\n\nThe agency also receives a code indicating a passenger is a member of the airline's frequent-flier programme and has access to details about past travel reservations, known as passenger name records. This official could not confirm if that information was being used to assess a passenger's risk.\n\nThe effort comes as the agency is trying to increase participation in its trusted traveller programme, called PreCheck, that allows frequent fliers to pass through security more quickly after submitting their fingerprints and undergoing a criminal-background check.\n\nThe TSA has emphasised its goal of giving 25 per cent of all passengers lighter screening by the end of next year, meaning they can keep their shoes and jackets on, wait in separate lines and leave laptop computers in their bags. But travellers who find themselves in the higher-risk category can be subjected to repeated searches.\n\nThe airline industry has supported the expansion of PreCheck and using data about travellers to decide who should receive more or less scrutiny at checkpoints, to reduce security bottlenecks and focus resources on higher-risk passengers.\n\nAt the heart of the expanded effort is a database called the Automated Targeting System, which is maintained by the Department of Homeland Security and screens travellers entering the United States.\n\nData in the System is used to decide who is placed on the no-fly list - thousands of people the US government has banned from flying - and the selectee list, an unknown number of travellers who are required to undergo more in-depth screening.\n\nMuch of this personal data is shared within the Department of Homeland Security and with other government agencies. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/b5d0f7fe0a9b575bb3893d3e209abc6f339898e9a17812d2a3f8a08bf4eb8b1d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Streamlining procedures: The new measures give the government greater authority to use travellers' data for domestic airport screenings. -\u00a0PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

The country's public debt is at 54 per cent of gross domestic product while household debt, at 86 per cent of GDP, is the second-highest in Asia after Korea. Meanwhile, its surplus on the current account of the balance of payments has fallen to 1.1 per cent of GDP in the second quarter of the year, from an average of 11 per cent in 2009-12.\n\nReining in the budget deficit will be key. Mr Najib, 60, has said the deficit should come down to 4 per cent of GDP this year.\n\nBank of America-Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin thinks he will miss it slightly. \"Our forecast is at 4.2 per cent of GDP, given weaker growth and rising financing costs,\" he said in a report yesterday. \"The fiscal deficit is nevertheless tracking 4 per cent of GDP.\"\n\nTotal debt has come off, thanks to some asset shuffling. Earlier this month, the government transferred around RM42 billion (S$16.4 billion) in government housing loans to three private-sector financial institutions. That is 4.5 per cent of GDP and will give Putrajaya some breathing space on its legal obligations towards debt since it cannot exceed 55 per cent of GDP.\n\nDr Chua said he expected the Budget to target a 3.5 per cent of GDP deficit for next year. He also did not think that growth would be blazing. \"We expect the government to forecast lower GDP growth of 4.5-5.5 per cent for 2014, given signs of a growth slowdown,\" he said.\n\nThe economist thinks that a goods and services tax (GST) will be mentioned \"but details may be lacking\". Even so, it has to be meaningful, he argued. At 7 per cent, the government has estimated the tax could raise some RM25.7 billion; currently, the existing sales and service tax raises RM15 billion. Anything lower would be meaningless. \"Ballpark calculations suggest that a 4 per cent GST will be revenue-neutral (given loss from sales and services tax),\" he noted.\n\nOn a more encouraging note, Dr Chua said he expected subsidy rationalisation to continue, though he conceded that this would be done gradually. Fuel subsidies cost the government RM24 billion last year. \"We expect another 20 sen or a 10 per cent hike in subsidised fuel prices some time in the second or third quarter next year,\" he predicted.\n\nThe economist thinks that there will be some property measures to cool the market. Even the opposition said it would introduce such measures in its shadow Budget tomorrow. \"We expect some property measures, both to raise revenue and cool the housing market,\" Merrill said.\n\nSaid Dr Chua: \"The government could hike the property gains tax or stamp duties, and tighten macro-prudential measures, such as loan-to-value ratios.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is translating into a surprisingly robust new source of business for Boeing, Airbus, and regional aircraft makers such as Mitsubishi Aircraft, Bombardier and Embraer SA.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association expects Vietnam to become the world's third-fastest growing market for international passengers and freight next year, and second-fastest for domestic passengers. Vietnam's Aviation Department expects 15 per cent growth in domestic passengers this year, more than double last year's 7 per cent rise.\n\nThough starting from a low base, Vietnam's carriers will boost their fleets in the next few years, double or tripling them to serve a domestic market of 90 million people and tourist arrivals growing on average 20 per cent annually.\n\nVietJet Aviation Joint Stock Co, Vietnam's first private airline, agreed last month to a provisional order for up to 92 Airbus jets worth US$9 billion at list prices.\n\nThe low-cost carrier is aiming for a stockmarket listing in either Hong Kong or Singapore in 2015 to fund the expansion, which would start with flights to Tokyo, Beijing, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and South Korea, then eventually, China, Russia and Australia and beyond, managing director Luu Duc Khanh said.\n\n\"Further it could be the United States, where four million people of Vietnamese origin live. They're waiting for VietJet anxiously,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nVietJet plans to double its fleet by 2015 to 20 jets, and is speeding up work to get three joint ventures in the air, including one with an undisclosed carrier in Myanmar and another agreed with Thailand's KanAir, to operate in early 2014.\n\nVietJet's bold expansion after less than two years in business could raise the stakes not only at home but in South-east Asia's fast-growing low-cost market, dominated by Malaysia's AirAsia and Indonesia's Lion Air.\n\nThose ambitious plans may have shaken state-run flag carrier Vietnam Airlines (VNA) into expediting its long-awaited initial public offering and fleet expansion.\n\nVNA dominates the local market and will increase its fleet by 28 per cent to 101 aircraft by 2015. It has been preparing for an IPO in the second quarter of 2014.\n\nThe airlines and industry experts say the growth potential comes mainly from Vietnam's topography and what Mr Khanh of VietJet called a \"fortune location\".\n\nVietnam is 1,650 km in length, its biggest cities and tourist resorts are far apart, and it has poor road and rail infrastructure.\n\nIt is also within a few hours of Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand and China and tourist arrivals are rising, with 5.5 million in the first nine months of the year, a 10 per cent rise from the same period in 2012.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The official, who spoke by telephone on the condition of anonymity because of ministry policy, said the two North Koreans had not cooperated and may still face criminal charges.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry official said the other crew members had cooperated, and that all of them had asserted that they had no idea the vessel was carrying military cargo. Two North Korean diplomats have been granted visas, the official said, to travel to Panama and to complete arrangements for those crew members to leave the country.\n\nThe July 14 seizure of the freighter, the 450-foot Chong Chon Gang, near the Panama Canal caused a spat between Panama and North Korea and Cuba, one of the few countries that enjoys cordial relations with the isolated North Korean government. The seizure shed light on the clandestine maritime trading practices of North Korea, one of the world's most impoverished countries, hobbled by UN sanctions over its nuclear weapons and proliferation activities.\n\nThe vessel's crew, armed with sticks, tried to resist the Panamanian boarding party and disabled the cranes used to unload the cargo hold, piled high with 200,000 bags of sugar. Underneath, the Panamanians found two disassembled MiG jets, 15 MiG engines and nine anti-aircraft missiles. The Cubans acknowledged the military cargo was theirs and said they had been shipping it to North Korea for maintenance.\n\nBut the Foreign Ministry official said the parts were in \"mint condition\", suggesting that they had been intended for North Korea's use. The official also said Panama and Cuba had not discussed the military cargo, which remains impounded.\n\nIt was unclear what would happen to the Chong Chon Gang, despite demands by North Korea that the ship and entire crew be returned. The Panamanian official said the vessel was \"in pretty bad shape after its very own crew damaged it when they saw the police coming\".\n\nA committee of the UN Security Council, which oversees the sanctions on North Korea, sent investigators to Panama in August to determine whether the impounded cargo had violated any provisions. Jacques Flies, a spokesman for the Luxembourg mission to the UN, which leads the sanctions committee, said in an email on Monday that the investigators had not yet submitted their final reports. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

This echoes last year's data, where individual tax rates also rose 0.3 per cent.\n\nThis year also saw the second-highest number of rate increases - in nine countries - in the last decade.\n\n\"To address government budgetary deficit concerns, many countries have either created new income tax rate bands for very high income tax earners or are introducing new temporary taxes,\" said BJ Ooi, partner and head of international executive services with KPMG in Singapore.\n\nThe most highly publicised tax rate change for this year came from the United States, where the expiration of Bush administration-era tax cuts saw the highest federal rate increase - from 35 per cent to 39.6 per cent.\n\nSlovenia experienced the greatest increase - nine percentage points - as its highest marginal tax rate moved up from 41 per cent to 50 per cent.\n\nAs for the implementation of temporary taxes, India introduced a 10 per cent surcharge on tax paid by individuals earning more than 10 million rupees (S$201,960), for the 2013/14 fiscal year only.\n\nAnd the Czech Republic introduced a \"solidarity surcharge\" from Jan 1 this year, applied at an additional rate of 7 per cent to income exceeding 1.24 million Czech koruna (S$82,000) - which is the cap for social insurance.\n\n\"Targeting high-income earners is a way for governments to gain revenue. It also allows them to be seen by taxpayers as doing something that is fair and necessary for the benefit of their country,\" said Mr Ooi.\n\nThe personal income tax rate landscape was a lot more stable in Asia. KPMG noted that average rates remained more or less constant at 28.24 per cent across the region, a marginal decrease from 28.29 per cent last year.\n\nJapan, however, increased its highest rate by 0.84 per cent, due to the introduction of a Special Reconstruction Surtax to help fund the cost of rebuilding after the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011.\n\nSingapore's top rate of tax, at 20 per cent, continues to be among the lowest in the region, along with Hong Kong's 15 per cent.\n\nThere were also tax rate decreases this year - in Greece, Iceland, Latvia and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe most significant decrease occurred in the UK, where the top rate was reduced from 50 per cent to 45 per cent from April 6. The 50 per cent rate, in operation for three years, had been widely criticised for driving high-earning individuals abroad and acting as a deterrent to entrepreneurship.\n\nKPMG noted that similar criticism had been levied in France at the highly publicised 75 per cent tax bracket on individuals earning over one million euros (S$1.7 million) proposed by French President Francois Hollande more than a year ago. France's constitutional council ruled in December last year that the 75 per cent rate was unconstitutional, and it is still unclear whether a tax on the \"super rich\" will be introduced in France in a different form.\n\nMeanwhile, Latvia decreased its flat tax rate by one per cent as part of a staggered move to reduce its rate from 25 per cent to 20 per cent by 2015.\n\nGreece decreased its top rate from 45 per cent to 42 per cent, but increased the rates at the lower and middle levels, as part of a wider move to restructure all tax rate bands. As a result, its tax rates were higher for all individuals earning under 220,000 euros.\n\nKPMG's Online Tax Rates Tool, which also covers corporate and indirect taxes, can be found on the firm's website (\n\nwww.kpmg.com\n\n).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/keppel-thrives-despite-tough-environment", "site_title": "Keppel thrives despite tough environment", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nKeppel thrives despite tough environment\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Oct 21, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nKEPPEL Corp's recent strong set of quarterly results should position the group to achieve projected FY2013 net profit of $1.5 billion, which falls within the mean full-year estimates of the top 10 equities research firms covering the stock. Not surprisingly, most analysts have maintained their \"buy\" rating on the stock.\n\nAfter the results were announced last Thursday, the stock gained six cents on Friday to close at $10.87. Analysts are projecting Keppel's FY2014 and FY2015 earnings to push upwards to $1.63 billion and $1.66 billion, and have a median stock price target of $12.50, a 15-per cent upside from Friday's close.\n\nThis vote of confidence is hard-earned, as investors and key shareholders are well aware of the competitive environment within which the group operates. In the offshore and marine division, for instance, both South Korean and Chinese shipyards are bidding aggressively for offshore rig-building contracts to fill shipyards suffering from a dearth of commercial shipbuilding contracts.\n\nYet Keppel's offshore & marine margins (which analysts watch like hawks) remain robust with operating profit margins at 16.5 per cent in Q3 2013, up from 14 to 14.2 per cent in Q1 2013 and Q2 2013, and 12.9 per cent in Q4 2012 - an indication that the group had kept a lid on costs and is still able to price its rigs competitively.\n\nOn top of that, the group has secured an enviable $5 billion of new offshore rigbuilding contracts year to date, bringing its total orderbook to $13.7 billion with deliveries into 2019. A good part of these new orders have come from repeat, long-term customers such as Ensco, Diamond, Maersk, Pemex and Sete Brasil. This is a strong endorsement of the group's capabilities and track record. Its yards in Singapore, Brazil and Azerbaijan now have 21 jack-ups drilling rigs, six semi-submersibles, three accommodation semi and numerous FPSO newbuild and conversions to deliver over the next five years. To sustain earnings, the group needs to continue to replenish its orderbook with at least $4 billion-$5 billion of new contracts every year.\n\nKeppel's key shareholders have been an equally loyal lot. Apart from Temasek which still holds 21 per cent of the stock, its top shareholders' list reads like the Who's Who of asset management firms with Aberdeen topping the list, followed by Blackrock, Fidelity, Invesco and Capital. Keppel's solid balance sheet, strong core earnings, attractive dividend yields and management track record have ensured its position as a key holding.\n\nBut these expectations would weigh heavily on any management team, let alone one where a new CEO is being groomed to take over in three months' time.\n\nThat is why Keppel's July announcement that the group's current CFO, Loh Chin Hua, had been picked as CEO-designate took many in the investment community by surprise.\n\nFirstly, the group's previous CEOs or executive chairman (in the days of Sim Kee Boon and Lim Chee Onn) when recruited were already long-serving leaders, rising from the ranks and successful top managers in various operational divisions. For instance, Mr Lim had been Keppel Land's chairman and managing director since 1997, and a director of Keppel FELS and was Keppel's senior executive director since 1983, when he was appointed as Keppel Group's executive chairman in January 2000.\n\nWhen current CEO Choo Chiau Beng was appointed as group CEO in January 2009, he had held the position of CEO of Keppel Offshore and Marine for almost 25 years.\n\nIt was under Mr Lim's stewardship that Keppel sold its stake in KeppelTatLee Bank to OCBC, and then merged and privatised Keppel FELS, Keppel Shipyard and Keppel Hitachi Zosen under the listed holding company, and establishing offshore marine, property and infrastructure as the three core group divisions.\n\nUnder Mr Choo's stewardship, the group divested its stake in Singapore Petroleum Company and established K-Green Trust. Meanwhile, a combination of new rig building orders, fuelled by rising oil prices and a booming property market, boosted the group's net profits from $1.2 billion in FY2009 to a record $2.2 billion last year.\n\nGiven the track record and calibre of the previous CEOs, it would be an understatement to say that Mr Loh will have big boots to fill. But he is no newbie either.\n\nMr Loh started his career at Keppel as head of Keppel Land's fund management business under Alpha Investment Partners in 2002, and grew its assets to $10.6 billion todate. Prior to that he was MD at Prudential Investment Management, and at GIC. He was appointed group CFO in January 2012, and will have held the position for just two years before he becomes group CEO.\n\nWhen he takes over the helm in January, the Keppel group is expected to achieve near peak earnings (excluding exceptionals). The key earnings drivers would still be its offshore & marine and property divisions, with infrastructure a distant third.\n\nThere is a saying that the CEO's job is a lonely one. But at Keppel, a culture of teamwork and mentoring at the top has ensured continuity remains a strong tradition. It is perhaps telling that in its December 2008 announcement that Mr Lim would step down and Mr Choo would assume the CEO position, it was also announced that Tong Chong Heong would be promoted to CEO of Keppel Offshore and Marine. In the past five years, Mr Tong has been Mr Choo's right hand man in building up Keppel Offshore and Marine.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, Keppel revealed that 32-year offshore & marine veteran Chow Yew Yuen would succeed Mr Tong as CEO from Feb 1, 2014.\n\nHowever, Mr Loh's upcoming promotion will leave an important vacancy which Keppel's board will need to fill. So far, no announcement has been made, but presumably the kingmakers at Keppel are lining up the candidates.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yes, OSV seems to be a bit more resilient in the shipbuilding environment but if everybody is to shift the focus, we would again have a supply overhang,\" he warned.\n\nMr Yeo added that the shipbuilding industry should have learnt its lesson post-2008, which marked a period when an excess supply of ships, particularly from state-backed yards in China, flooded the market and coincided with a drop in demand of cargo due to the global economic crisis.\n\nHe emphasised that the industry should exercise more caution in flooding the market with vessels but his concerns are also based on the view that traditional shipbuilding is still in choppy waters. \"Even though the Baltic Dry Index has improved a little bit, a slight pick-up does not mean that we are out of the woods yet and the numbers show that conventional shipping has not recovered yet.\"\n\nThe situation is even more dire in China, suggested Mr Yeo as he believes that the shipbuilding industry there has a long road ahead to recovery, given that it is still dealing with the excess capacity that it created.\n\n\"The China shipbuilding industry is disastrous at the moment. The China state government has come out to say that at least one-third of the shipyards must close or consolidate and they need to cut that overhang,\" he said.\n\nStill, he feels that vessel builders around the world, including in Singapore, could benefit from the situation the Chinese yards find themselves in, by leveraging on the cost advantage there and to gain a foothold in what he believes could be the most important offshore and marine player going forward.\n\nSwissco itself has been building vessels in China for more than a decade, he said. \"There is no doubt that the world's shipbuilding industry has to always shift to a lower-cost centre, in terms of lower labour costs. China has been one of the most cost-efficient places to build vessels in the last 20 years. The Europeans, and not only the Asians, are also moving there. It is definitely going to be the number one shipbuilder in the world.\"\n\nHe is certain that this will be the case and as a result, Mr Yeo said that Singapore yards will definitely find China an enormous challenge. \"Singapore yards are doing well right now as they are more specialised and are building specialised rigs, but it is only a question of time before the Chinese yards start doing it. It is all a cycle.\"\n\nBut the China factor could also be a blessing, Mr Yeo concluded, as the lower prices the yards there offer also puts pressure on local industry players here and is a \"wake up call for them to be more competitive\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In return, OKH will receive new shares in the holding company under a restructuring exercise.\n\nSubsequently, OKH will undertake a reduction of the issued and fully paid-up share capital of the company and distribute all the shares it owns in the holding company to its shareholders rather than distributing cash.\n\n\"The proposed distribution will enable the company to return value to shareholders free of payment,\" OKH said.\n\nOKH's shareholders will then hold shares in two separate companies: OKH and the holding company. The distribution will be made on the basis of one holding company share for every share held in OKH. Shares in the holding company will not be listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).\n\nShareholders who do not wish to own unlisted shares of the holding company can choose to sell their shares back to the holding company and receive cash instead.\n\nAs at end-June, the two units had a combined net tangible assets attributable to shareholders of 149.6 million yuan (S$30.3 million). Based on this - as well as the holding company's issued share capital of 628.7 million shares after the restructuring - shareholders will not receive more than 0.24 yuan for each holding company share, OKH said.\n\nThe holding company will fund the buyback by internal cash resources and/or external financing. \"Shareholders should note that (OKH) will not be funding the buyback,\" the company said.\n\nTo ensure that the holding company has enough funds to effect the buyback from minority shareholders, OKH chairman Bon Ween Foong, former Sinobest chairman Zou Gefei, Jin Changren and Profit Saver International will not elect for the buyback.

The Shanghai Containerised Freight Index showed rates on routes from Asia to Northern Europe had fallen to US$661 per 20-foot container (TEU), compared with an average level of US$1,378 in 2012, and to levels which are considered loss-making for most shipping companies.\n\n\"The main problem is overcapacity and I expect rates to continue to trickle until the beginning of November,\" said head of maritime analysis company SeaIntel, Lars Jensen.\n\nMr Jensen said he did not expect the announced rates would be fully accepted by customers, but that Maersk Line would likely succeed in raising rates enough to exceed the break-even level of around US$1,000-1,100 per 20-foot container on the Asia to Europe route.\n\n\"They will get a good portion of the announced price hike through, but I do not expect it will go 100 per cent,\" Mr Jensen said.\n\nAccording to data from the Shanghai Shipping Exchange on Friday, spot rates for container shipping on the Asia to Northern Europe route have fallen 2.1 per cent last week.\n\nMaersk Line is the biggest container shipping operator with nearly 600 container vessels, competing with lines such as Israel Corporation-controlled Zim Lines, Chinese Orient Overseas Container Line, Korean Hanjin Shipping and Hapag-Lloyd.\n\nMaersk's competitors have announced they will attempt to raise rates by between US$950 and US$1,000 per TEU, also from November. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Revenue grew one per cent to US$36.6 million.\n\n\"Given hopes of an expected beginning of recovery in the container shipping industry next year, we will continue strengthening our balance sheet, positioning us to capitalise on growth opportunities as and when they arise,\" Thomas Preben Hansen, chief executive of Rickmers Trust Management, said.\n\nTrade growth is projected to reach around 4.7 per cent this year and accelerate to 6.2 per cent in 2014, subject to global economic developments, according to Clarkson Research Services, a unit of the world's largest shipbroker. Continued uncertainty in the global economy and high oil prices pose downside risks.\n\nRickmers' vessel operating expenses during the quarter were 2 per cent higher at US$9 million due to a contractual increase in fixed operating expense and vessel management fees.\n\nFinance expenses almost halved to US$5.8 million on reduced outstanding bank loans balances and expiry of interest rate swaps contracts, which resulted in lower interest expenses, the company said.\n\nRickmers had a 99.9 per cent utilisation rate in the third quarter. It has cash and cash equivalents of US$57.8 million, higher than the US$53.5 million a year ago.\n\nAs at end-September, the group's net asset value per unit fell to 63 US cents from US$1 dollar at the end of last year.

As a result, NPI rose 6.9 per cent to $111.6 million.\n\nAs at end-September, average portfolio occupancy was 98.4 per cent, up from 93.6 per cent a year ago. This was mainly a result of the recovery of Causeway Point's occupancy to 99.5 per cent upon completion of the addition and alteration works.\n\nDuring Q4, 49 leases, accounting for 36,351 square feet (sq ft) or 4.1 per cent of FCT's total net lettable area, were renewed with a 10.8 per cent rental reversion. The average rental reversion for the financial year 2013 was 7.7 per cent.\n\nTotal asset size rose 10.9 per cent to $2.13 billion, as a result of the recognition of $195.7 million from net surplus on revaluation of FCT's properties. Correspondingly, net asset value per unit of FCT grew 15.7 per cent to $1.77 from $1.53 a year ago.\n\nThis led to a 2.5 percentage point improvement in gearing level to 27.6 per cent. The average cost of borrowing in Q4 remained stable at 2.73 per cent and the weighted average debt maturity stood at 2.85 years as at end-September.\n\nThe counter ended trading half a cent higher at $1.85 yesterday, before the results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He lost 800 million kroner (S$168 million) from 2000 to 2011 following a property bust that forced him to sell all 12 hotels there. He has now returned to the scene, cherry- picking two hotels in Copenhagen.\n\n\"Last time we did business in Denmark, we did everything wrong,\" Mr Stordalen, 50, said in an interview over breakfast at The Thief, his newest six-star hotel in Oslo. \"I expanded too fast. This time we do it differently with brands that are better defined, stronger management and a plan to stay only in Copenhagen.\"\n\nThe lessons are helping Mr Stordalen rebuild his empire, and his personal fortune, even as much bigger competitors including Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc and InterContinental Hotels Group Plc sell properties.\n\nFor the former triathlete, the trick is to make every hotel opening a lavish event that dazzles guests and steals newspaper headlines. In the past, that's included arriving on a hotel roof in a bright blue helicopter. He's even descended from a ceiling with a disco ball while playing drums for an opening in Gothenburg, Sweden. At a hotel opening outside Oslo, he set fire to a guitar for dramatic effect.\n\n\"He's untraditional in the way he communicates,\" said Torgeir Silseth, CEO of Nordic Choice Hotels AS, which has 171 hotels in the Nordic and Baltic regions. He has worked with Mr Stordalen since he entered the hotel business in 1996. \"He talks about his kids, his worries when he wakes up at 4am and his worst fears. He's much more open and sharing, way beyond what is normal in business - a bit eccentric.\"\n\nThe approach has worked. Mr Stordalen is now Norway's ninth-richest man worth 10.2 billion kroner (S$2.1 billion), according to an annual ranking by Norway's Kapital magazine.\n\nThe native of Porsgrunn, a small town about 160 kilometres south of Oslo, runs his business through the Home Invest Group, a private company which includes Nordic Choice Hotels, a property business and an investment firm. His companies had sales of 6.2 billion kroner in 2012.\n\nMr Stordalen became manager of a shopping centre in Trondheim, northwest of Oslo, at the age of 24, before he finished college. Then in 1992, when a financial crisis in Norway pushed the shopping centre operator Steen & Stroem ASA into bankruptcy, he rallied investors to save the business.\n\nBy selling off the individual stores and inventory, he said it took him and his two business partners 48 hours to transform a company with 45 million kroner in annual losses into a profitable enterprise.\n\nIn 1996, Mr Stordalen was fired as CEO of Steen & Stroem after falling out with fellow billionaire Stein Erik Hagen, one of the company's largest shareholders.\n\nHe sold his shares in Steen & Stroem to buy what was then called Choice Hotels, which had 40 hotels. During the first three years, he bought one new hotel every other week, folding in on average 50 more employees with each purchase.\n\n\"It was a time of a lot of commotion,\" Mr Silseth said. \"It was mostly frustrating because so much happened and there were so many changes but the system, structure and organisation was always behind. Speed is his strongest asset and is what built the company - but it's also what could be dangerous.\"\n\nMr Stordalen took Nordic Choice public in 2000, holding on to 40 per cent to finance an expansion. By 2005, he was fed up with investors who couldn't look beyond the next quarter's bottom line and bought out the company for 462 million kroner.\n\nToday, he doesn't need help financing his business. \"Cash flow is the most important thing,\" Mr Stordalen said.\n\nHome Capital, the investment arm of Home Invest, has one billion kroner in bonds and shares. That, combined with returns in property business and his model of borrowing only up to 65 per cent of the value on his properties, gives Mr Stordalen the cash flow to expand his business.\n\nOver the next five years, he wants to add 29 hotels to the Nordic Choice chain. Last year he returned to the shopping centre business, buying Sektor Gruppen AS and its 13 malls in Norway with a partner for 7 billion kroner.\n\nMr Stordalen's next big thing is turning his entire empire into an environment-friendly enterprise.

How do you think 2014 will be different from 2013?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Oct 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMichael Jenkins\n\nChief Executive\n\nRoffey Park Asia-Pacific\n\nTHE rather bleak French expression Plus \u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose - the more things change, the more they remain the same - might be one way of characterising the world at large as we look to 2014. Our challenge is to stay alert and not assume that the BRICs will continue to be ''the ones to watch'' - we need a greater level of awareness to ensure we are alive to what was yesterday's news, to guide our organisations with a fresh, discerning eye and to be able to grab opportunities as they present themselves. At one point in the recent past the BRICs looked set to be replaced by the CIVETs - Colombia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Egypt and Turkey. How things change! And yet our fondness for acronyms persists as we try to make sense of the complex and prioritise our efforts. The one constant is to ensure that our leadership is strategic and of the moment.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive\n\nABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and Chief Executive Officer of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nUNCERTAINTY and its twin brother, volatility, may continue to lead the way for the global economy in 2014. We are all - whether we like it or not - closely tied to US politics, and what we see there this (past) week is at best the fact that we have ''just kicked the can further down the road''. The debt ceiling overhang has not been solved, but delayed. It will be back. Who knows how this will affect the crucial decisions on quantitative easing to be made next year by Janet Yellen, the next governor of the US Federal Reserve?\n\nDespite the uncertainty, I believe there is a silver lining in the progressive recovery of the global economy, with developed nations generating growth in 2014, albeit at lower levels, and crucially providing increased demand that will bolster the Asian growth story. And if Asia grows, Singapore grows.\n\nAt ABN AMRO, uncertainty is the basis for prudent risk management amid potential opportunities and consequently does not worry us unduly. If anything, it highlights the need for us to continue to stay close to our clients as their trusted adviser. Our approach continues to be to focus on truly understanding our clients' risk profiles and investment horizons and then craft the best possible portfolio options for them.\n\nLeon Perera\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nSpire Research & Consulting Group\n\n2014 will see more balanced growth between developed and emerging economies. Provided the US overcomes its current political gridlock, and with an experienced new leader at the Fed, their economy may perform decently as economic fundamentals continue their recovery. Japan should grow briskly, as Abenomics gathers momentum. Europe's performance will lag that of the US and Japan. Emerging market growth rates will be crimped by various domestic issues, some capital flight due to US Fed tapering and the uncertainties surrounding elections in India, Indonesia and Brazil. But given healthy domestic demand, emerging economies will still grow at a respectable rate. Singapore should see slightly better growth in 2014 amid these global and regional conditions. Uplift will come from the tourism, construction and regional services sectors, to compensate for some softness in manufacturing and financial services.\n\nJeremy Lee\n\nRegional Manager, SE Asia & Taiwan\n\nMoog\n\nWITH every passing year, it is becoming increasingly challenging to predict what's round the corner. However, there does seem to be a strong silver lining after the past few years of roller coaster rides of the global economy. While the days of heady growth may be pass\u00e9, governments across the world are realising that unrestricted credit growth is only a bubble. Singapore being one of the most open economies can do little to insulate itself from the global scenario.\n\nThe initiatives of the government to help local businesses to expand during these trying times will definitely ease the pain to some extent. Further, Singapore has the advantage of being at the epicentre of a region that will still register the most promising growth globally. There are some signs of manufacturing picking up as Japan looks to enhance its presence in South-east Asia and China gets serious in developing its services sector. All these should help change the prevailing uncertain and sombre mood in 2014.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWE can look forward to a positive 2014. Clearly there are still challenges on the economic front, particularly with the ongoing crises in Europe. From a regional front, we can expect positive changes from Myanmar and the Philippines. From a talent resource perspective, human capital professionals here clearly have some challenges as companies continue their search for the best talent available. Talent mobility will still be a priority and core focus for many firms. As business leaders, we continue to look forward to stronger partnerships and sharing sessions with other business leaders as well as continued discussions with government.\n\nMark Micallef\n\nArea Vice-President, Asean\n\nCitrix Systems\n\nTHE resilience of South-east Asia in 2014 will hinge on fundamental structural reforms that harness medium-term growth potential. It is vital for South-east Asian businesses to implement policies that foster closer economic cooperation and strengthen integration in the region as a whole. To do so, the emerging economies that are trying to catch up with the developed ones in the region, should look to embrace growth based on productivity increases driven by enhancements in the quality of human capital and business innovation.\n\nFor example, organisations can look to enterprise mobility which leverages technology solutions, such as desktop virtualisation, network technologies and cloud computing, that empower employees to work and collaborate from anywhere, on any device and at any time. This not only enhances an organisation's overall productivity and capabilities, it can also help foster integration and boost intraregional agility, which is critical to ensure South-east Asia's ongoing economic prosperity.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC FairPrice Co-operative Ltd\n\nI AM quite cautious over the global outlook for the year ahead. There are many reasons to expect tepid growth, if not worse. The world's fiscal and economic uncertainties remain unresolved. And just as one cannot multiply wealth by dividing it, the debt situation in many countries cannot be solved by borrowing more. So, until this severe over-borrowing is resolved or a plan, painful as it may be, is put in place, global markets are likely to continue to be very turbulent. Singapore will have to ride through such periods. We have a few things on our side. We are financially strong, we are in a region which is growing, and we have sound fiscal and monetary policies. The challenge is for us to remain competitive and find a way to keep operating costs under control. Only then can we be pro-business and pro-worker at the same time.\n\nCharlie Foo\n\nVice-President\n\nBrocade\n\nTHE overall business outlook for 2014 will be mixed, with pockets of growth in some sectors while certain industries may experience contraction. Nevertheless, we are hopeful that Asia-Pacific will perform bullishly given its economic diversity and the growth potential of emerging markets such as Indonesia and Myanmar.\n\nIn the technology sector, we are seeing market momentum and strong demand for critical infrastructure development from South-east Asia, China and India, while mature economies such as Australia, Singapore and South Korea are investing in transformative technologies to improve productivity and competitiveness. We believe the adoption of new technologies and the resulting market growth will even surpass nominal GDP growth in some countries.\n\nSubbaraju Alluri\n\nCEO\n\nGrey Group Singapore\n\nMOST companies are still seeing growth opportunities in the region. In 2014, we predict an increase in the level of activity especially in the relatively untapped emerging markets.\n\nWe don't anticipate the pace of business to slow down for many of our clients. However, companies will now relook their budgets to ensure greater returns on investments. To this end, we expect to see clients becoming more digitally savvy, as they try to engage consumers on a more personal level. A strong brand equity will help keep their products and services top of mind among customers - an important strategy to bolster the effects of temporary economic cycles.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE'S economic growth should continue to be moderate in 2014, with economic restructuring measures continuing to pose a challenge for many businesses. Human capital is a key component of any business and as PrimeStaff operates in the talent acquisition arena, we foresee that the tightening of foreign labour policies will exacerbate the manpower crunch that many companies are already facing. Further tightening measures may be introduced next year so the business community should brace themselves for this possibility.\n\nRegionally, countries that have been on a strong growth trajectory in recent years, such as Indonesia and Vietnam, may continue to experience good growth prospects. However, it may not be as buoyant as in previous years. Of all the countries in South-east Asia, it is likely that Myanmar will experience the highest growth for obvious reasons. Overall, I believe the global economy will still be rather fragile and susceptible to policy missteps and political shake-ups in the US and Europe, as we have witnessed this past year.\n\nGerald Foo\n\nPresident\n\nWalton International Group (S) Pte Ltd\n\nTHE US fiscal health will be of concern and will have an impact globally. However, according to World Bank economist Olivier Blanchard, Core Europe is at last showing some signs of recovery, which will bode well for the global economy. With this scenario, the outlook for 2014 looks patchy although most countries in Asia will see growth in their economies with China leading the way.\n\nAs for the Singapore economy, businesses in general will be affected by the squeeze in manpower constraint as well as high labour costs. As a result, inflation will be higher. Singapore's growth may be marginally higher than this year. The way forward for Singapore businesses is to innovate and increase productivity without relying too much on manpower. In this regard, training our workforce to multi-task and also to use more technology to overcome the manpower issue is the way to go. At Walton, we constantly emphasise on training and we send our staff for courses regularly. Once the staff are well trained, they are more confident and able to undertake additional duties efficiently.\n\nPhupinder Gill\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nCME Group\n\nSINGAPORE has greatly benefited from stable government policies that has enabled its financial sector to expand and take advantage of the tremendous growth in Asia. The environment that has been cultivated by the government will continue to serve Singapore well for many years to come.\n\nIn the US, uncertainties about fiscal and monetary policies are seriously hindering growth prospects as we enter 2014. Slower growth in the US, along with continued stagnation in Europe, are likely to encourage Asian economies, especially China, to increase their emphasis on domestic or regionally-driven growth. For China, this might mean increasing the pace of financial reforms to give more flexibility to the consumer and business sectors as reliance on large-scale new infrastructure projects is decreased.\n\nAllen Ang Swee Meng\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd\n\nI EXPECT the global outlook for 2014 to be less volatile, underpinned by slow but steady growth in major Western economies. However, there are potential risks, including the possibility that the scaling back of stimulus measures in the US may cause severe capital outflow and disruptions in emerging economies. In Asia, I foresee some headwinds as China gears itself for a controlled slowdown which will affect the economies of the rest of Asia.\n\nIn 2014, I expect Asia's growing middle class to continue to spend on housing and consumer products on the back of low interest rates, boosting domestic consumption. This will spur industrial activities, especially the semiconductor industry which provides chips for almost every consumer product. It will be a boon for Singapore's manufacturing industry and export-driven economy.\n\nAgainst this positive backdrop, Aldon Technologies, a manufacturer in the semiconductor industry, is cautiously optimistic about prospects for 2014. Advance estimates show the economy grew 5.1 per cent in Q3 of 2013. We have felt the economic robustness and share the MAS' expectations that the economy will continue to expand for the rest of the year and into 2014. However, like other manufacturers, the foreign labour policy will increase our operating costs and crimp our manpower capacity. We have implemented some work redesign and productivity improvement measures and are hopeful we can grow 8 to 10 per cent this and next year.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nDESPITE continuing global economic uncertainty, almost 70 per cent of chief executive officers surveyed in PwC's Asia-Pacific CEO Survey 2013 stated that they intend to increase investments in the region, with 42 per cent being very confident of revenue growth over the next 12 months.\n\nCEOs are confident of growth in Asia-Pacific, especially South-east Asia. Of the top five 'dark horse' economies that CEOs identified as most likely to show more business opportunities - Indonesia, Myanmar, China, the Philippines and Vietnam - four are located in South-east Asia. Our CEO survey shows much confidence in the region as the apex of growth in the coming year.\n\nWe believe that Singapore's geographical proximity and our good political and economic standing in Asean puts us in a natural beneficial position.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nManaging Director\n\nDHL Express (Singapore)\n\nDESPITE lower global economic growth ahead, the logistics sector remains stable. It is expected to grow at a modest rate of 5.3 per cent in 2014, better than 2013's 3.5 per cent. Growth in the South-east Asian economies is set to remain buoyant on the back of robust consumption, rising investment and increased intra-regional trade, with GDP growth projected at 5.7 per cent in 2014. In 2013, DHL Express continues to see sustained growth across all countries in South-east Asia, with the strongest business expansion coming from the Philippines and Vietnam. We expect this momentum to continue in 2014.\n\nLooking ahead, SMEs will remain our key focus. We will also grow our footprints and strengths in specialised sectors, including oil and gas, electronics, life sciences and aerospace, by providing comprehensive and innovative solutions to enhance our customers' overall competitiveness. The opening of Myanmar will also offer us an exciting market in 2014.\n\nSaw Ken Wye\n\nCEO\n\nCrimsonLogic\n\nCRIMSONLOGIC has achieved accelerated business growth in 2013, driven mainly by the expansion of our footprint in the emerging markets. We secured exciting projects, including the roll-out of trade facilitation systems in Oman and the building of Mauritius' national identity card system.\n\nIn 2014, we are confident that emerging economies, like the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will remain the key growth drivers for CrimsonLogic, as these untapped markets continue to represent huge potential for eGovernment projects. We expect our overseas business to grow faster, but Singapore remains a strong showcase of our capabilities.\n\nAlthough global business sentiment may be a little uncertain currently, the Singapore brand continues to be strong. This, coupled with a capable and knowledgeable workforce, will enable local businesses competing regionally and globally to have a competitive edge over others.\n\nToby Fowlston\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nRobert Walters (Singapore) Ltd\n\nWHILE sentiments for 2014 are generally cautious, we can look towards a positive start to 2014, given Singapore's economic growth this year. Singapore remains one of the top choices within Asia for multinationals to base their regional businesses. Hence, we anticipate the entry of even more global firms in 2014, which will contribute significantly to the economy.\n\nIn addition, while we have faced a talent crunch for local professionals over the past few years, the Singapore government's new initiatives to attract returning Singaporeans from overseas will create a more dynamic workforce. This will be another noteworthy upcoming development which is likely to channel a positive outcome.\n\nRaed S Haddad\n\nManaging Director, Asia-Pacific\n\nESI International\n\nWE expect moderate growth in the global economy in 2014 with Asia-Pacific leading most of the expansion while the Euro area stabilises. The outlook for South-east Asia, China and India has remained optimistic so far and this will continue into 2014 and the medium term.\n\nSingapore, with its strong economic fundamentals and advanced workforce, will enjoy quality growth as a regional business hub as it transforms its economy into a more sustainable and inclusive growth-led model. In that regard, enterprises in Singapore will need to innovate the way they conduct business, with the integration of technology and human capital training, so as to improve productivity and performance, and thrive under such an economic model.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\n2014 will remain uncertain. The hot spots in the world - the US economy, eurozone crisis - and the slowing economies of Asia, in particular China, India and Japan, have not fully recovered. If anything, they are in convalescence. The current gridlock on the US debt ceiling and spending, although it seems to have been resolved, has put a damper on the anticipated recovery. All the major economies of the world are affected by systemic risks and the responses of monetary policies, for example, quantitative easing from the US and Abenomics in Japan. It is the worst kind of economic concoction that will drive Singapore's vulnerability to a higher level. There is little room for us to manoeuvre out of this persistent economic predicament. Singapore would have done well if we can maintain the current economic growth in 2014.\n\nBusinesses should therefore be prudent with investments and keep as much cash as possible. Indeed, if need be, they should monetise assets such as inventories or redundant facilities to keep cashflow positive. Going forward, governments will have to be more aggressive with their fiscal policies and be relentless in creating employment and attracting investments, to exit from this economic malaise. Surgical actions will need to be taken as the medicine that has been prescribed is evidently not working.\n\nRanjit Khanna\n\nHead of South-east Asia & Global NRI\n\nCoutts & Co Ltd\n\nTHE world is healing, slowly. The fallout from the banking crises in 2008 is still with us in the form of quantitative easing (QE) programmes in developed nations. Soggy growth in most of the G-7 means that, even in the US, QE will be around for quite some time. Growth in developed nations is not breaching 2 per cent and will be a struggle again in 2014. Heavily indebted consumer sectors are a significant drag and developed nations are now reliant on companies investing again or on increased demand growth in emerging markets.\n\nWe think Asia will do better in 2014 as investment rates increase in cash-rich companies. Sentiment about the region's larger nations and Singapore's large export-oriented economy will improve, although some post-plenary doubts will continue about China's extended credit cycle. India's new central bank governor has been a great choice and the prospect of an SK Modi premiership should make 2014 a very dynamic year. We view the Philippines' renewed investment cycle very favourably and hope that 2014 is a better year for policymaking in general.\n\nWong Heng Chew\n\nPresident\n\nFujitsu Singapore\n\nIN recent years, we have seen tremendous upheaval in the business environment and society. Globalisation has transformed economic activity, leading to seismic shifts in the market landscape, along with increasing uncertainty. However, businesses are also becoming more adept at leveraging technology to fuel their expansion and resolve issues facing business and society. For Asian businesses, this means becoming more nimble, cost-effective and streamlined for business expansions.\n\nLooking ahead, Fujitsu envisions a Human Centric Intelligent Society where people will play a central role and leverage information and communication technology to realise sustainable development globally. This creates potential to drive new business value and transform social infrastructure. People will be able to exploit the benefits of new insights and harness critical knowledge for innovation, business growth and an intelligent society.\n\nV Hariharan\n\nCEO\n\nSingapore Mercantile Exchange\n\nFROM the perspective of Asia's major exchange traded asset classes, 2014 is likely to be an improvement over 2013. In commodities, precious metals demand, especially silver, will be robust. We expect the steadying and strengthening of Asia's currencies, with the Singapore dollar consolidating its position as an Asian currency anchor. Since US government debt is not a major component of trading activity in Asia, a US default or downgrade would have negligible impact. Conditions are ideal for Singapore to further encourage the inflow of global capital and to comprehensively consolidate its position as a leading global financial centre into 2014.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nAS we prepare for 2014, it's that time of the year to project and extend new outlines for our businesses. The economic outlook for Emerging Asia (China, South-east Asia and India) is looking bright, although America may once again be a subject of uncertainty in 2014, given the flux in the US economy.\n\nMacroeconomic policies such as monetary reforms and policies to narrow income ceilings and promote inclusive growth around the world will play a critical role in driving sustainable development; this will influence how business owners plan for 2014. But Singapore is progressing steadily as our economy shifts towards a more broad-based growth led by rising productivity and innovation.\n\nGurpreet Dhillon\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nReligare Health Trust Trustee Manager Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE will continue to enjoy steady growth in 2014. The recovery in the Western economies is having a positive impact on Asia. We are encouraged by this outlook and hopeful that Asia will remain the world's economic growth engine through sound macroeconomic policies, expanding domestic consumption and continued investments. These will be key in driving sustainable growth in the Asian economies through improved living standards and bolstering the rise of the middle income class throughout Asia.\n\nWhile we continue to monitor the volatile capital markets in the US and Europe, given the impact they have on the rest of the world, we are confident in the resilience of the global economy.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nBASED on the latest developments in major economies such as the United States, Europe, China and Japan, the sentiment of late appears to be more positive than in previous quarters. The only hiccup seems to be the US shutdown and debt ceiling issue, which has come under control for now. However, this is a factor to watch out for as it may create a blip in the global recovery. In the Asia-Pacific, news has come out that China is still experiencing healthy growth while Japan's economy is also growing, judging from its buoyant stock market and export market.\n\nGenerally speaking, compared to 2013, the Asia-Pacific region and South-east Asia will do better in 2014. Singapore's growth has always been dependent on the global economy. Singapore's economic growth has borne the brunt of the manpower crunch in the past 12 to 18 months. Growth for the year will probably come in around the mid-point of the forecast 1 to 3 per cent. I think this climate will persist into 2014 as the government has sent a clear signal in giving Singaporeans and permanent residents priority for jobs. It is not the case that Singapore does not welcome foreigners but it seems that the immigration tap will not be as open as before. The employment market will be even tighter and it is likely to continue to be an employee's market as the demand for Singaporean and PR workers heats up.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\n2014 will see the US and Europe shift to a higher gear of growth. Despite continuing transatlantic economic turbulence, they will remain each other's most important markets. China's slowing economy will see its investments flowing out to find better returns, particularly to America and Europe.\n\nThe world will also be watching how the US will handle its debt ceiling issue and how it can go on as the de facto world reserve currency without any loss of confidence in the US dollar. This will have a direct impact on interest rates. Any upward movement is likely to affect growth prospects.\n\nSingapore will have sluggish growth. The strong Singapore dollar is unlikely to weaken over the long term and this will affect the republic's export competitiveness. Businesses will face higher business costs, higher wages and a contracting labour supply. 2014 will be a year of low expectations for Singapore as the macro environment will remain challenging.\n\nZaheer Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQI Group of Companies\n\nFOR 2014, I expect a mixed bag of fortunes overall. I am confident Singapore will maintain its economic growth into 2014 on the present 5.1 per cent growth in the third quarter 2013. Inflation and labour factors need to be reined in, but the finance and services sector seem strongly positioned for continued growth. This should help our business sectors.\n\nRegionally, the ''opening-up'' of Myanmar, and dynamism of Indonesia and Philippines, are the bright spots. I believe Malaysia will also be fine if its currency issue is dealt with since there is political stability. Prospects over Europe are still slow, while the US uncertainty is unhelpful. I am hopeful of 2014 being different from 2013 because I am confident there will be clear economic certainty with the Fed's leadership settled.\n\nBryce Boland\n\nAPAC, Chief Technology Officer\n\nFireEye\n\nIN 2014 the Personal Data Protection Act and the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act will come into force, increasing the cost and complexity for enterprises as the rapid uptake of smart phones and tablet computers continues unabated. We expect to see more attacks with malicious mobile applications, fake application stores and manipulation of the supply chain to deliver devices preinstalled with malware.\n\nGlobally, the cyber crime market will continue to grow. Terrorist groups, political activists, whistleblowers and criminal organisations will continue to leverage poorly protected IT systems.\n\nSteve Melhuish\n\nCo-Founder and Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nPropertyGuru\n\n''Volatility'' and ''uncertainty\" are two words we have heard very often this year when we talk about the economy. The truth is, 2013 has indeed proven to be somewhat of a roller-coaster ride. Taking into consideration the key events that have transpired so far - the changes in political leadership and the lack of in some cases, and the 16-day shutdown of the United States government that cost the economy US$24 billion, for example - 2014 will feel the spillover effects one way or another, while it faces new challenges and its fair share of volatility and uncertainties ahead.\n\nThat said, it's not all gloom and doom. We will see global growth, and recovery from the crisis will continue, albeit slowly. That's important. Some have even predicted that the year will turn a corner. And if we focus on Asia, which remains a global growth leader, there's good reason to be optimistic. Barring any external surprises, the Singapore economy also looks poised to expand steadily. As usual, my advice to investors and business owners is this: Don't put all your eggs in one basket, always know what you're getting yourself into and have a back-up plan.\n\nDavid Siah\n\nCountry Manager\n\nTrend Micro Singapore\n\n2013 saw an increase in the frequency and impact of cyber-attacks, as well as greater awareness among consumers, enterprises and governments. In Singapore alone, regulations and laws like the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and MAS Technology Risk Management Guidelines reinforce the need to maintain due diligence when dealing with confidential and personal information.\n\nWith the momentum on mobility push, it will be important to ensure that BYOD does not turn into Bring Your Own Disaster. It will be critical for organisations to follow smart data protection practices, ensure instantaneous data protection and build up a strong security system for effective detection and quick response to targeted attacks.\n\nLionel Lim, President\n\nAsia Pacific & Japan\n\nCA Technologies: In this ever volatile world, it is likely that the uncertainties in the US and European markets will continue to cast a shadow somewhat on this region in 2014. That said, I remain optimistic about the growth prospects of this region, and especially about the increasingly significant role that Singapore has as the governance, infrastructural and financial safe haven for the region. This is a region that is teeming with opportunities. All indicators point to the fact that this region is the world's largest growing cloud-connected consumer base. The largest-growing internet user base and smartphone user base, the soon-to-be largest ICT spending region are all within the Asia Pacific and Japan, complemented by growing intra-regional trade and strong forex reserves. Companies, organisations, and governments need to be agile and innovate to succeed and better connect with their constituents in this connected market. This underscores the increasingly important role that IT plays in business transformation to drive greater productivity, collaboration, efficiencies and sustained growth. This age of innovation in Asia Pacific and Japan will gather strength next year, centreing on Singapore as the innovation hub to drive further growth for the region beyond 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/getting-hang-dabbling-alternative-investments", "site_title": "Getting the hang of dabbling in alternative investments", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGetting the hang of dabbling in alternative investments\n\nThe key advantage of such instruments is in the diversification they provide to a portfolio, says ANG BEN YOU\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Oct 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nA few of my friends overseas buy and sell playing cards. The notion that such an endeavour would amount to any sort of business or investment seemed far-fetched - until the news came that someone in Norway had successfully funded his purchase of an Audi by selling rare out-of-print \"Jerry's Nuggets\" cards at 200 euros (S$339) per deck.\n\nRight now, companies and even individuals are printing their own decks, keeping them limited to depress supply, holding them in their personal inventories and then selling them in the hope of making a killing. It is not uncommon to see a newly-released deck of cards selling out in a few hours, only to reappear later on eBay, sometimes costing 10 times more.\n\nOne can see how playing cards could be a viable - if unconventional - investment. They can be lumped under the category of alternative investments, which refer to any form of investment not considered part of the traditional portfolio of stocks, bonds and cash.\n\nBut the term evolves with investment trends.\n\nIn recent years, alternative assets such as wine and art have become the rage. Like the popular term for emerging markets BRIC - a grouping comprising Brazil, Russia, India and China - the popularity of alternative assets has given rise to a new acronym, SWAG - for Silver, Wine, Art and Gold.\n\nSuch unconventional asset classes are needed in an investment portfolio mainly because of their low correlation to traditional securities. Gold, the traditional safe haven during economic distress, is now joined by several other alternative asset classes.\n\nWine and art\n\nThe popularity of wine and fine art as investment instruments has been driven predominantly by the growth of high net worth individuals (HNWIs) in emerging markets such as China. If investing in such exotic assets is your cup of tea, it is useful to understand some of the forces behind art and wine prices.\n\nThe key winds behind market movements will also apply to art and wine, albeit sometimes in an opposite way, reflecting their low correlation to the market. Some of these forces involve general economic conditions and inflation. Logically, an increase in global wealth through economic prosperity will lead to an increase in demand for wine and art, leading to price appreciation.\n\nNon-systematic and specific factors for art include interest in certain genres, trends and even culture. Thus even within art genres like Impressionism or Realism, returns can be different.\n\nOther factors contributing towards the value of an art piece include the artist's critical acclaim, whether it is supported by leading art dealers and its previous ownership if owned by reputable collectors or art galleries.\n\nEconomic conditions determine the value of these items. With wines, for example, it is important to understand that not all wines are \"investment grade\", so going down to the neighbourhood NTUC FairPrice store to buy a bottle of red wine in anticipation of price appreciation is probably not a good idea.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, red wines from key French estates are investable, but investors need to look for quality and scarcity. Intermediaries like brokers, consultants and private banks may be able to advise on such investments.\n\nTo gain exposure to such assets, one can possibly buy into funds. Funds that invest in art are still rare, but are rapidly growing with the increase in HNWIs. For the financially capable, hoarding art pieces from notable artists can be a possible portfolio strategy. A notable example of a foray into an art investment portfolio was made by the British Rail Pension fund after 1974. The portfolio comprised some 2,500 individual works of art, built as a response to the financial crises of the time in the UK.\n\nThe Economist's Guide to Investment Strategy said that from 1974 to 2003, when the last piece of art from the portfolio was sold, the portfolio appreciated from \u00a341.1 million to \u00a3170.4 million; this worked out to a net gain of \u00a3129.3 million and an annual return of 3.7 per cent net of commission, fees and taxes, excluding storage and insurance costs. This is evidence that investments of passion can be used successfully in the context of a portfolio strategy.\n\nBut is there an opportunity for entering the art and wine market?\n\nThe size of the art market is now insignificant relative to disposable wealth. Reports suggest that it is the same for the wine market. What this means is that any move by a substantial investor to establish or extend a major collection of art or wine may provide considerable support to prices. Thus, entering the market for such investments now could be prudent in anticipation of future gains from this standpoint.\n\nOther alternative investments\n\nWhile wine, antiques, fine art and even playing cards may be considered alternative investments, let us also consider more passion-neutral and liquid classes of alternative financial assets.\n\nIn the context of an investment portfolio, alternative investments are also defined as investments that are not constrained by the limitations of long-only listed investments. These include real estate, private equity, hedge funds, managed futures and even distressed securities. With the exception of real estate, these assets are usually part of a larger investment portfolio of, say, a mutual fund.\n\nInvestors in alternative non-passion financial assets are usually institutional investors or HNWIs rather than regular retail clients. This is not unusual because such instruments are usually more complicated. While this is a limitation, retail clients can still participate through more accessible financial products such as real estate investment trusts (Reits) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nFeatures of such investments\n\nSome important features of alternative investments are worth noting:\n\nAlternative investments, being unconventional in nature, can sometimes have low levels of liquidity. This is sometimes not well understood by investors and is the reason why a liquidity premium is required.\n\nOther features of certain alternative investments, specifically funds, that are deemed less attractive include a high due-diligence cost, difficulty in valuation and a lack of access to information.\n\nThe comparatively higher costs in due diligence come from the additional research and monitoring required stemming from limited information. Limited information is in turn a result of poor transparency and pricing difficulties, requiring more specialised professionals. For example, fees for alternative investments, specifically funds, can include an annual management fee of one to 2 per cent in addition to an incentive fee of 10 to 20 per cent. These fees may not be justified, considering their returns, when compared with the returns and costs of investing in traditional assets.\n\nThe role of alternative investments\n\nThe key advantage of alternative instruments is in the diversification they provide to a portfolio. This is because of possibly better risk-adjusted returns - which mean lower volatility, together with better gains or less painful losses. Alternatives can thus diversify a traditional long-only portfolio of stocks and bonds.\n\nHowever, do take note that diversification does not insure against loss. A better risk-adjusted return is achieved by selecting instruments with returns that are not correlated with traditional assets. By reducing the correlation between individual assets in a portfolio, volatility will be reduced, lowering a portfolio's overall risk.\n\nOne can also use alternative investments as a hedge in a portfolio. Since the returns of such products are usually not correlated with the core instruments in a portfolio, we can use them to protect against certain downside risks.\n\nRisks of alternative investments\n\nAs the saying goes, never invest in something you don't understand.\n\nAlternative investments are usually more complex. That being the case, they are usually also less transparent. For example, hedge funds, a lightly-regulated alternative investment instrument, are not obliged to disclose much publicly. You can't be sure that the tools employed by managers within a hedge fund are well suited towards making investment decisions.\n\nIn addition to the issue of trust, alternative investments can also disappoint in bull markets. A bull market can usually be observed during periods of rapid economic growth, where assets appreciate strongly. The period between the dot-com bubble to the 2008 crisis is an example of such a market. While returns of instruments that are not correlated with traditional assets can protect a portfolio against losses, let's not forget that this also means that gains will be capped. For example, short-selling strategies used to generate an absolute return tend to lag long-only strategies in a strong bull market.\n\nAlternative investments can also possibly disappoint in extreme down markets, where correlations converge due to herd mentality.\n\nInvest in moderation\n\nTo conclude, when used in moderation, alternative investments can be a prudent way to invest. An appropriate allocation to alternatives within a portfolio would be 10 to 20 per cent. This is large enough to impact returns and to reduce risk, and also small enough to keep due-diligence fees from becoming exorbitant.\n\nIt is also prudent to opt for a conservative approach by going for strategies with a proven track record. This is of course based on the assumption that the investment team chosen is somehow more skilled and knowledgeable.\n\nWhile we understand the irrationality of the markets and the limits of models in predictability, we can also potentially use such alternative investments to benefit from market uncertainty. Such an outlook will typically employ a further layer of allocation towards alternatives which are extremely high-risk, high-reward.\n\nPsychologically, one should be prepared for loss, but a small bet could potentially reap unexpectedly huge gains - it all boils down to playing your cards right.\n\nThe writer is a fourth-year student at the Lee Kong Chian School of Business in the Singapore Management University (SMU) and a student trainer in the Citi-SMU Financial Literacy Programme for Young Adults.

The invitation is priced at a price-earnings ratio of 12.4 times based on the group's pro forma net earnings per share for the year ended Dec 31, 2012.\n\nEstablished in 1988, ValueMax has 17 outlets in Singapore, as well as three other pawnshops with pre-owned jewellery retail outlets operated by its associated and investee companies. It also operates five outlets in Malaysia through its associates.\n\nLast year, ValueMax's profit attributable to shareholders was $14.3 million, slightly lower than the $14.5 million in FY2011. Sales fell 4.3 per cent to $509 million on lower revenues from its jewellery and gold trading business.\n\nThat business segment contributed $486.7 million to sales in the last fiscal year, 5 per cent lower than the previous year. \"This is because of the declining gold prices in the last quarter last year,\" chief financial officer Carol Liew said.\n\nValueMax gets its pre-owned jewellery from walk-in individuals and unredeemed pledged articles from its pawnbroking business and suppliers. It purchases gold bars for trading from refiners and gold traders.\n\nOver the same period, the company's pawnbroking business grew 17 per cent to $22.3 million.\n\nValueMax intends to use 60 per cent of the $66.3 million in net proceeds to finance the expansion of its business, such as opening or acquiring pawnshops in Singapore and other countries, Mr Yeah said.\n\nIt will use the remaining 40 per cent to fund working capital.\n\nThe group said it planned to open a flagship store in central Singapore to target wealthy individuals in the second half of next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/coping-enterprise-mobility", "site_title": "Coping with enterprise mobility", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCoping with enterprise mobility\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Oct 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPanellists:\n\nModerator:\n\nAmit Roy Choudhury, Technology Editor,\n\nThe Business Times\n\nENTERPRISES are facing a BYOD (bring your own device) wave as employees want applications that work both on their mobile devices as well as computers. An added complexity is the fact that in the mobility space, unlike the traditional workstation/notebook environment, there are a number of competing OSes (operating systems) with different APIs (application programming interface). This has made the implementation of an enterprise-wide mobile strategy a complex issue. To understand the problems and the way forward, The Business Times bought in a group of experts for a roundtable on the issue. Excerpts from the discussion:\n\nAmit Roy Choudhury:\n\nMobile computing, BYOD and consumerisation of IT are on top of the list of things that keep chief information officers (CIOs) awake at night. The problem is mobile enablement/empowerment can mean different things to different companies and there is a sense that many are clueless as to how to implement a coherent strategy around it. What are the basic things that need to be taken care of while implementing a company-wide mobile strategy that is both cost-effective and effective?\n\nKhoong Hock Yun:\n\nA good organisation-wide mobile strategy needs to strike the right balance between usability, cost and security. In the case of BYOD, the issue of data security is paramount and the key issue is the amount of control device owners are willing to cede to organisations. A good way to determine if organisations should implement BYOD is to conduct risk assessments on data and devices. The assessment should produce a register of risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data accessed, stored and transmitted through the device. This register will allow the organisation to explore cost-effective means of deployment and protection that is commensurate with the risks identified. In terms of a comprehensive mobile strategy, it should address five key areas, namely, clear definition of ownership and responsibilities; device usage policies; device and data lifecycle policies; technology protection mechanisms; and user awareness and education.\n\nLee Han Kheng:\n\nEnterprise mobility is about how a company mobilises IT by using applications, services and solutions to engage its customers, suppliers, and partners in its supply chains to improve productivity, transform its business and gain a new competitive edge. With enterprise mobility, work is no longer confined to the desktops. It allows employees to create and add value anywhere, anytime, and on-the-go. It can also help enterprises deliver better customer experience and drive new revenue growth.\n\nHowever, businesses need to consider some challenges in implementing enterprise mobility. What used to be a standardised and homogenous PC environment has now shifted into a heterogeneous mobile world with different platforms such as Android, iOS and Windows Mobile. With employees starting to bring their own devices to work, it raises the issues of security, manageability, and control: How do enterprises ensure that vital corporate data remains secure as they mobilise their IT? How do enterprises erase sensitive corporate information from a missing device?\n\nThen there are also concerns relating to costs. Enterprises have to justify and manage the Return on Investments (ROI) of implementing enterprise mobility for their businesses. In addition, they have to ensure that there is visibility and transparency in their total costs of deployment and operations for accountability. In short, the challenge is to implement a secured, manageable and cost-effective solution to enrich the users' experiences, improve productivity, and facilitate the transformation of businesses.\n\nChuang Song:\n\nI encourage our clients to consider setting up a Mobility Centre of Excellence or create something similar - a cross functional group consisting of stakeholders including business unit representatives who bring knowledge of the company's business targets, burning problems and opportunities, as well as IT representatives who bring knowledge of what mobile technology can do and what the options are. Working with a steering committee and executive sponsor, this working group should work on crafting the company's top level mobile goals and identify a prioritised list of business problems that can be solved using mobile technology. Funding can then be steered to exactly the areas that will bring the company the most return.\n\nDavid Lee Heyman:\n\nEven within a single company, mobile has many different meanings. The diversity of employee functions within a company leads to quite different needs when it comes to mobility. When assessing IBM's own corporate mobility needs, we segmented our employees' roles into 13 different personas. For each persona we looked at a number of different aspects of how mobile would bring additional value and effectiveness. Some of the aspects we examined include the types of tasks they would perform, the connectivity they would have available and their attitude towards personal technology adoption. Customer-facing employees who travel frequently typically have laptops and personal smartphones. They are likely to benefit from collaboration tools which enable them to leverage tablets and lighter weight laptops while they are on the go. Employees working in manufacturing may be using shared workstations to request vacation time, but their managers may benefit from a smartphone application to cut down on the time it takes them to approve those vacations. For successful mobile empowerment, the discussion must go beyond treating mobile as a one-size-fits-all, one-off IT project to encompass a wide range of mobile management issues. In short, companies need to prioritise and implement a mobile strategy across the company.\n\nAmit:\n\nFeedback that I get from industry seem to suggest that while IT departments as well as line managers realise the huge benefit that accrues from mobile and the opportunity cost associated with not having a coherent mobile strategy, many in top management are not really clued in. In short there could be resistance to change from the top because of a lack of a sense of urgency in implementing change. Do you get a sense that this is happening and if so what are the ways around it?\n\nDavid:\n\nThe most successful and impactful mobile projects start with direct input from the employees who will use mobile to become more productive and effective in their roles. It is key to reach out to the bank's relationship managers, the cable operator's field technicians, the retailer's sales floor staff and the managers who need to approve POs and shift swaps. They are adept at using mobile in their personal lives and provide great insight into how mobile can improve their work. Making them key stakeholders in the process will also lead to an easier adoption process as those employees become champions during the deployment. What I am seeing in many organisations is similar to the emergence of Internet and Intranet applications 20 years ago. Line managers are searching outside the organisation for someone who has an application that will support their business needs. IT departments are making IT-oriented decisions without taking into account the impact it will have on future flexibility and productivity. Top management are often taking a wait-and-see approach as their organisation contracts with 10 different implementation firms using seven different platforms to develop 15 applications which may even answer similar requirements. A leading analyst firm stated in 2010 that by 2014, some 60 per cent of the Fortune 1000 companies wouldn't have a mobile strategy in place. They stated that this would lead to overspending and we are seeing this today. The longer it takes for a company to put in place a comprehensive strategy, the more money they will waste on projects that will simply need to be re-implemented as the technology landscape continues to change.\n\nHock Yun:\n\nOne important component of a mobile strategy would be to enable a professional mobile workforce. IDA has been working with the industry to explore new ways of work. In the past two years, IDA has rolled out various initiatives such as the award of Home-based Work CFC (Call for Collaboration) pilot projects, the Smart Work Centres CFP (Call for Proposals) launched this year and the outreach platform to encourage employers to adopt flexible working arrangements through the use of IT. The nationwide deployment of the Next Gen NBN (Next Generation National Broadband Network) makes implementing home-based work and Smart Work Centres more attractive as the network offers pervasive, affordable broadband connection that supports major office functions such as high quality video-conferencing and cloud computing. Through the engagement with the industry, we do see increasing interest from the companies wanting to know and how to implement new ways of work for their organisations.\n\nHan Kheng:\n\nWith mobilisation and consumerisation of IT, thanks to the BYOD, enterprise mobility is an unstoppable trend. In fact, it is set to accelerate. A CIO once told SingTel that \"BYOD\" can stand for \"Bring Your Own Disaster\" if an enterprise lacks a coherent mobility strategy and allows BYOD in a frivolous and uncontrolled manner.\n\nTherefore, I would advise enterprises and IT leaders to look at ways of embracing the adoption of the BYOD trend at a measured pace in order to create value and also meet the expectations of their employees. At the same time, they must also ensure that BYOD does not compromise their enterprise data and internal security. They should not disallow BYOD because they will end up having issues with employees' morale. If they do so, they will have trouble attracting new and better employees, and before they know it, their younger and better talents will end up with their competitors who do deploy this BYOD strategy!\n\nSong:\n\nI agree but I really see both kinds of companies. There are companies that are extremely progressive, one of the companies I interact with has over 30 internal mobile apps! If top management doesn't get it, it is most likely because the mobile opportunity has not been articulated in a manner that top management can understand and identify with. This problem is not unique to mobility, we spend a lot of time helping clients with the same thing in security. Just like with security, the proposal needs to speak to clear business benefits on simple dimensions that are top of mind for top management.\n\nAmit:\n\nThey say when it comes to mobile, it's all about the app and not the device. How true is that, and why/not? But mobile device management (MDM) and BYOD are important topics with very real consequences if left unchecked, how should companies go about MDM/BYOD in their organisation? (or what are the top mistakes/pitfalls with MDM and BYOD?)\n\nHan Kheng:\n\nEnlightened business and IT leaders should safely embrace the BYOD trend by approaching enterprise mobility from a holistic lifecycle angle. From SingTel's perspective, this can be expressed through a four-pronged strategy - \"Secure, Manage, Control and Reduce\", and offered through SingTel's Enterprise Mobility Managed Services.\n\nWith the proliferation of cyber-crimes, it is imperative that enterprises protect their vital enterprise data by securing and encrypting data to ensure their privacy. In the event an employee's device goes missing, the enterprise must be able to trace, lock, and wipe sensitive data on it. To simplify mobile operations, enterprises need to be able to manage their corporate applications through a platform that is synonymous with an app store. Through this managed application development platform, their employees can simply click and launch these services on any device or mobile operating system.\n\nNext, enterprises must be empowered with the flexibility of setting up their controls and filters according to their defined usage policies. This capability will help CIOs retain control in a complex and heterogeneous mobility environment. Lastly, enterprises will benefit from gaining full visibility of the costs of using enterprise mobility. With just one click, enterprises should be able to get a slice-and-dice view of mobile expenses from different departments or even users for analysis, in order to manage and reduce unnecessary costs.\n\nSong:\n\nMost clients go about securing the device piece first. And then they very quickly mull over what are the apps that will go on the screens. The suggestion I have above for mobile strategy is exactly the kind of best practice that could lead to a list of internal mobile apps. Sorting out the device piece first also allows companies to scope what mobile platforms are relevant for their app dev efforts. Here are some common pitfalls for BYOD programmes:\n\nDavid:\n\nThe explosion of mobile apps was what made it possible for many people to work anywhere, anytime. An effective mobile application strategy is hence critical in an ever-changing multi-platform and multi-device terrain. It is also crucial to plan how to manage those applications and the device on which it will be used. In today's fast-moving, highly competitive business landscape where data gathering, information sharing and decision making do not stop regardless of a user's location, the mobile device is destined to continue growing in popularity and importance. Security is a paramount factor. It is also common for discussions to focus on managing the vast amounts of data these devices generate. But organisations also have to address issues beyond security of the device and Big Data - issues that can have significant consequences for business and productivity. Companies should not make decisions about how to manage a device without considering the business requirements and effectiveness of the users. Are you more productive if you need to check multiple calendars, personal and work, before knowing whether you can accept a meeting? Is your e-mail so slow that the security benefit is reducing the ability of your employees to conduct business?\n\nHock Yun:\n\nA holistic approach is required in order for successful BYOD deployment in organisations. This means looking at security for the device, applications and data in totality. Organisations should adopt a \"defence in depth\" approach by putting in place various layers of protection at the infrastructure, device, applications and data. Organisations will need to undertake risk assessments to identify threats with the introduction of BYOD, in order to determine what security risk mitigation measures are needed.\n\nAmit:\n\nRegarding mobile apps, are there too many to make sense of? Also, with consumerisation of IT, most employees want to use apps that they are familiar with at home like, for example, Evernote or Gmail. At the same time, companies would want employees to use dedicated apps custom built for the company. How does one strike a proper balance so that there is no \"application overload\" and that a small select set of apps are identified for use by employees?\n\nHock Yun:\n\nIn keeping with IDA's overall e-Government 2015 masterplan, IDA has initiated a five-year blueprint known as the Workplace of the Future (WOF) to meet the emerging needs of the ICT workplace in the civil service. The aim of WOF is to support collaborative and social networking technologies, to improve productivity and allow staff to work smarter; allow work on the move; and to improve information sharing among staff with intelligent knowledge treasury systems. As part of this plan, there are a couple of POC (proof of concept) testings that we are working on. Proven and beneficial concepts will be subjected to trials before being implemented. One of which is GoMAX which enables government officers to access their e-mails and Intranet websites on selected mobile devices. This service has increased the mobility of the officers and enables them to be more productive. Another is the HyperConnectivity Concept which enables officers to tele-work seamlessly by providing easy setup of mobile sites and offices with enhanced and convenient security authentication methods, on top of the current VPN access. This will also enable Next Gen Workplace Services such as IP Phone & seamless transitions between networks.\n\nSong:\n\nCompanies that implement an extensive whitelist or blacklist are the minority today. Unless they have special needs for security assurance, this approach is very conservative in our increasingly BYOD world. I think they will learn over time and accept that BYOD is not going away. The leading clients I work with do care a lot about security but they have taken a more progressive approach to managing the risk of enterprise data leakage. One method is to use a container to isolate enterprise data from the rest of the phone. Another is to identify the leading personal cloud services and consider bringing them in-house, that is, provide an enterprise equivalent and then black list the undesired apps/services.\n\nHan Kheng:\n\nMany enterprises tend to develop apps that serve a single function and end up having too many apps over time. Eventually, they find building, supporting and managing those apps costly, tedious and complex. Enterprises should adopt a holistic approach in managing \"off the shelf\" apps and customised ones. They need to look into their current requirements, future expansion plans, and the whole lifecycle management of the apps and integration of those apps into their enterprise backend systems.\n\nDavid:\n\nIt is not enough that companies have a plan for getting their mobile users up and running. They also need to know how well the apps are working and if employees are not only just installing the custom apps but also making good use of them and are satisfied users.\n\nBalancing consumer apps from public app stores and company apps within an enterprise app store is an ongoing process of socialisation, reporting and measurement. Socialisation refers to communicating what's new with existing systems, and allowing users to get to know the company's apps and corporate data all over again, this time through a mobile perspective. Reporting means capturing mobile app usage in order to understand which users are adopting which apps and how users came to find those apps. Finally measurement is not quantitative as much as it is qualitative analysis and assessment to understand what users think of work apps. Things to consider include how do employees like the apps the company developed and how usable and effective are these apps for users? What could be improved and how do they report problems or outages? Once such feedback is received, socialisation kicks in again.\n\nThis series is brought to you by IBM\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The WSQ training will include service and hygiene modules to equip the trainees with the right skills to become successful hawkers, as well as to provide better service and raise a more professional image of hawkers.\n\nFrom there, the participants will follow through with a four-week OJT training with veteran hawkers that have been featured in the upcoming CEOs' Hawker Guide, published by The Business Times and Knight Frank, and other foodie television shows. The first four hawkers to join the scheme are Thian Boon Hua of Boon Tong Kee Chicken Rice, Sulaiman Bin Abu of D'Authentic Nasi Lemak, Tan Ah Guan of Apollo Fresh Cockle Fried Kway Teow and Lai Yau Kiew of Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist. More veteran hawkers are in the process of signing up to participate in the training programme.\n\nAfter completing the OJT, the trainees will be required to work in stalls at either hawker centres, food courts or food shops for a minimum period of three months. NEA will provide incubation hawker stalls to allow trainee hawkers to showcase their culinary skills using traditional hawker recipes from the veteran hawkers.\n\nWDA will provide a training grant of up to 90 per cent of the course fee for the WSQ training at Project Dignity while Knight Frank and The Business Times, via YMCA's Project Hawkerpreneurs (see sidebar), will fund up to 90 per cent of the OJT course fee charged by the veteran hawkers.\n\n\"With the HMT pilot programme, we want to groom a new generation of hawkerpreneurs to preserve our country's popular dishes and traditional hawker fare. This programme will allow aspiring hawkers to learn and hone their culinary skills from veteran hawkers,\" says Janice Foo, director, Tourism Division, WDA. \"The WSQ modules, coupled with practical on-the-job training is a holistic approach to prepare the trainees to deal with real-life scenarios such as interacting with customers and payment processes.\"\n\nRichard Tan, director of NEA's Hawker Centres Division adds: \"This collaboration between NEA and WDA and the private sector will contribute to preserving our unique hawker heritage and ensuring that traditional hawker fare will continue to thrive, even as times change and food tastes evolve in Singapore. We hope that our veteran hawkers will also step forward to support this programme and pass on their expertise honed over many years.\"\n\nThe HMT Pilot Programme is open to Singapore Citizens and Singapore Permanent Residents aged 18 years and above who are able to commit full-time during the OJT training period.

In November 2011, TG Development and Master Contract Services offered a top bid of $138.9 million or about $364 per square foot per plot ratio for the 99-year leasehold Yishun site.\n\nWhen launched in October 2012, Skies Miltonia was one of the top-selling property projects, with a $1,034 psf median price.\n\nPeeyush Pallav, of DBS Bank's structured debt solution, treasury and markets unit, said he expects more such transactions as they help developers diversify their sources of funding while investors like the cash flow from buyers' progress payments.\n\nThe receivables due from buyers of off-plan properties in Singapore, are linked to the construction progress, and paid over time.\n\nThe amounts are deposited in project accounts, which are governed by rules which permit usage of funds only for limited end-use.\n\n\"The developers of residential projects in Singapore therefore need to wait for on average 3-5 years before they can realise the profits of the developments,\" said Mr Pallav. \"Previous transactions were done in 2001 to 2008 when the deferred payments system existed,\" he said. Some of them also had portions of progress payment streams in the cashflows, in addition to the deferred payment ones.\n\n\"However, this is the first transaction, after the financial crisis, in the world to be structured, rated and sold to investors, and completely based on progress payments,\" he said.\n\nSkies Miltonia is more than 93 per cent sold and scheduled for completion by Dec 31, 2016. For the investors, they are comforted by the fact that the project is 93 per cent sold, he said.\n\nTo be able to raise funds from other sources will help developers, as banks tighten up on bank loans. Being able to tap other investors for funding would also raise a developer's profile, noted Mr Pallav.\n\nTG Development is related to the Tong Garden Group which is involved in the nuts business. In a 2004 interview, Ong Boon Chuan, son of Tong Garden Food Products founder Ong Tong Guan, said that TG stands for his late father's initials.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

An IP address is an identifier for each gadget on a network.\n\nIn the second quarter of this year, the world added 18 million more IP addresses compared with the quarter before. This added up to 752 million unique IP addresses globally.\n\nLooking at the numbers, it's clear where a large portion of new devices is originating from.\n\nWhile the United States, the world's oldest Web-connected country, still holds the largest volume of unique IP addresses at 154 million, the developed market's growth is just 8 per cent year on year.\n\nChina, on the other hand, is the second-largest holder of IP addresses, at 113 million, and possesses a far more aggressive growth rate of 22 per cent year on year. It's also notable how quickly China has caught up with the US in terms of volume of users.\n\nWhile Japan was also one of the earlier mass adopters of the Internet, its third place globally is far behind that of its much larger Asian neighbour. Japan has just 40 million devices connected in a population of some 127 million.\n\nOther emerging markets outside of Asia are coming online quickly as well. Brazil had a whopping 44 per cent growth rate of new addresses being added, although this was over a far smaller base of just 30 million addresses.\n\nAkamai helps its customers' sites serve content more quickly. It operates a network of servers globally, with the objective of getting its customers' sites to work faster by placing content geographically nearer to users.\n\nIt has been estimated that almost a fifth of the world's traffic goes through Akamai's servers, and it's through this massive reach that Akamai tallies its Internet reports.\n\nMobile devices continued to push new traffic numbers up. Quoting traffic data collected by Swedish telecoms firm Ericsson, Akamai said the volume of mobile data traffic almost doubled from the second quarter of 2012 to the second quarter of 2013.\n\nOut of these, the data points to more Android-based devices joining the World Wide Web.\n\nApple mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPad held about 54 per cent of Web-surfing activity online. Android devices comparatively had 27 per cent.\n\nThis time last year, Apple had a 60 per cent share, with Android at about 22 per cent, according to Akamai's older reports.\n\nAnd according to NetMarketShare metrics, Apple devices held a 62 per cent share in end-2011, up from 49 per cent in end-2010. The first iPad was released in mid-2010.\n\nAndroid mobile traffic was climbing from 11 per cent to 18 per cent market share during that period.\n\nNetMarketShare's statistics are compiled from a network of sites and largely tally with Akamai's findings.\n\nApple's sales aren't slowing down, however. In fact, Apple continues to beat its previous models with each release of the iPhone, for example. It broke its previous record with nine million iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c models sold on the first weekend.\n\nThis only highlights Android's even more impressive growth. The world's largest Android-devices maker, Samsung, managed to trump Apple in the US in the third quarter of this year, accounting for 38 per cent of smartphone sales, said Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Apple missed Samsung, at 34 per cent.\n\nWhen it comes to high broadband speeds, Singapore surprisingly missed its peers in the region by a considerable measure.\n\nMeasured by speeds of more than 10 Mbps (megabits per second), only 13 per cent of Singapore households had connections that fast, although this is quickly changing, at an 87 per cent growth rate over the year before.\n\nThis finding tallies with the adoption of Singapore's next-generation fibre broadband network. According to the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, there were 133,000 fibre subscribers by June 2012. The first households started to receive connectivity to the fibre network in 2009.\n\nGlobally, South Korea and Japan dominated in terms of fast broadband take-up, with 45 per cent and 43 per cent adoption. Third in the region was Hong Kong, which took the sixth spot globally at 32 per cent subscription.\n\nAcross the world, the global average connection speed was 3.3 Mbps. Again, South Korea had the highest average speed of 13.3 Mbps, with Japan in second place at 12 Mbps.\n\nThe US was eight on the list at 8.7 Mbps, and Singapore was 27th, hitting 6.5 Mbps on average.\n\nWhile not mass-adopted, some connections in Singapore were very fast. The island state broke into the top-five list at the fifth spot for top peak connection rates, at 45.6 Mbps, growing this at 61 per cent over last year.\n\nHong Kong, South Korea and Japan were the top three on the list, in descending order, with Hong Kong's top speed at 65.1 Mbps.\n\nThe global average was 18.9 Mbps.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But I tell them, there are even more regulations in Holland.

By Rachel Loi\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 18, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHITE truffle season is back again, but this time, things are looking up. Following last year's disappointing harvest, this year has started off promisingly for those in the truffle business. \"The seasons are not as regular like they were in the past, because the weather is quite crazy. But this year's truffle will be cheaper than last year, maybe slightly above half of last year's price,\" says Francesco Marconi, who runs Trifola Pte Ltd, a truffle distribution company based in Singapore.\n\nWhite truffle can be found in different parts of Italy, some areas of France, and certain countries in Eastern Europe like Yugoslavia and Croatia among others. However, it is the ones from a small town called Alba in Piedmont, Italy that have the best reputation for its aroma and quality. Restaurants can purchase the Alba white truffle for about $5,000 to $7,000 per kilogram this year, compared to last year's high of $10,000 to $13,000. The price range depends on the quality and size of the truffles, as larger specimens are considered rare and can command a higher price per kilogram. These current figures are nowhere near fixed, as they may fluctuate according to the weather patterns in Italy as the season progresses. If the country sees heavy rains in the weeks to come, the ground could become too wet for the truffle hunters' dogs to sniff out the truffle's rich scent.\n\n\"It is always difficult to predict because if the season gets worse and the quantity is limited, there will be an automatic price jump through the sky,\" says Roberto Galetti of Garibaldi, who brings in Alba white truffles from a personal friend living in the Piedmont region.\n\nBut even if this year ends up having an unexpectedly high yield, Galetti doubts prices will go any lower than they currently are, as most truffle hunters who lost money during the bad harvest last year would be trying to recover their losses with this year's sales. Still, the drop in price is already enough for some restaurants to feel confident enough to bring in more truffle this year to meet growing demands. According to il Lido's Chef Beppe De Vito, his restaurant was cautious last year about how much they were bringing in, but this year he already foresees an increase to their current pace of one kilogram per week.\n\n\"It's not just the rich people who are willing to pay for truffle now, we can propose it to anybody who walks in and there is a good take up rate. For example, at least one out of two young couples will say yes when we offer it,\" he says.\n\n\"It's one of those things with a cult following. Like anything with a label in Asia, like Wagyu, the demand will keep growing as long as Asia keeps growing and more people become affluent.\"\n\nSimilarly, Chef Lino Sauro who owns Gattopardo has noticed a higher demand for truffle, and attributes it to an increasing awareness. At the moment, he estimates about 20 restaurants in Singapore using white truffle. Even French restaurant Saint Pierre brings in white truffle at this time of year, and Chef Emmanuel Stroobant handpicks them himself through a supplier that brings them in exclusively from Italy.\n\n\"It's mostly about the smell and feel. It needs to be heavy and dense, with no holes that could have been made by worms. Think of it as a banana. You can see the black rotten spots, and if you touch it you can feel the soft parts caused by damage. It's like picking any fruit, really,\" he explains.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That spacious bit of asphalt between the bus and the sidewalk is no place to linger with your Samsonites. Danes are extremely friendly people in general but you don't want to get between them and their destination. Don't forget - they're Vikings.\n\nYou can't really fault their smug sense of entitlement. It comes with the territory as the most liveable city on earth - if you believe in magazine rankings like that of Monocle's. And what's not to like: cool late summer days; sumptuous waterfront views; user-friendly and efficient public transportation; strong economy; wide open spaces and small population; generous social benefits and quality-of-life policies - almost makes you want to buy into the hype (and high taxes) and cash in your Ezy-link card.\n\nBut - let's not be too hasty. Like buying an overseas condo based on a 3-D model in a hotel function room - it's always better to see before you buy. Copenhagen is so compact, so flat and walkable, bike-able and easily explorable, you can cover the city and its surroundings in a few days and feel almost like a local by the end of it.\n\nThe first thing you should do is get a Copenhagen card. While it sounds a little pricey at DKK299 (S$68) for a 24-hour card up to DKK749 (S$170) for five days, it's a value-for-money option if you're planning to get out and about a lot. Already, transportation is free whether you take the bus, subway or even a train out of the city. And the price of admission for one adult and two kids to one attraction a day is built into the card - with 1,000 years of history, Copenhagen has had plenty of time to build up a collection of them.\n\nEspecially castles. Denmark - which is a constitutional monarchy - has a bunch of them, mostly around Copenhagen, and all of them inhabited at one time or another by a king named either Christian or Frederik. While the Danish royalty wasn't too imaginative in term of birth names, their designers were less restrained when it came to interior decor.\n\nFrederiksborg Castle\n\nis one of those Medieval Quarterly home-of-the-century kind of abode that dates back to 1560 and named after, yes, Frederik II, who lived there until Christian IV moved in around 1602 and gave it a Dutch-inspired aesthetic that remains today. Now it's home to Denmark's Museum of National History - a walk-in showpiece that recalls the days when guests came to dinner, admired your ceiling and demanded to know which designer did your trompe-l'oeil.\n\nChurches, too, weren't wanting in terms of grandeur, with the granddaddy of them being\n\nRoskilde Cathedral\n\n, circa 12th century and now designated a Unesco World Heritage site. The brick Gothic church which spawned a design trend throughout Northern Europe was also where the founder of Copenhagen, Bishop Absalon led his diocese at the tail-end of the 12th century. It's been the burial ground of monarchs since the 15th century and current queen Margarethe II already has a spot picked out for her. It's both magnificent and macabre to see the elaborate tombs that are testament to the game of royal one-upmanship that does not end even in death.\n\nThe cathedral stands in the charming little town of Roskilde - an easy-to-get-to spot that's worth a half-day of meandering around. Flea markets spring up on the cathedral grounds on weekends and there are enough by way of cafes and shops to distract you. If you're open to seeking out your inner Viking, the\n\nViking Ship Museum\n\nnearby is ready to accept you with appropriate outfits for your personal rampaging close-up. Carefully preserved remains of five ships salvaged from the Roskilde Fjord take centrestage but if you like action with your history, there's a small replica docked outside that you can test your oar-pulling skills in.\n\nWater, of course, is the key feature of Copenhagen. Geographically, it sits on the east of Denmark on the coast of Zealand, practically kissing Sweden (it's just a half-hour train ride to Malmo). The city itself is divided into different neighbourhoods by the many canals and waterways - each with its own vibe from retro to modern to bohemian. The best way - albeit also the most touristy - to get a feel of the place is on a\n\nCanal Tour\n\nwhich takes you past landmarks like the Black Diamond library and even Noma - the acclaimed restaurant that captured the world's attention with its new Nordic cuisine.\n\nGet on the boat at\n\nNyhavn\n\n,so you can kill a couple of birds with the same stone at this colourful waterfront district where Hans Christian Andersen penned his fairy tales for 18 years. Once a red light area, Nyhavn sits at one end of Stroget, the popular pedestrianised shopping street home to the likes of crockery doyenne\n\nRoyal Copenhagen\n\nand\n\nIllums Bolighus\n\n- a multi-storey retail shrine to Danish design. For a one-stop shopping spot,\n\nMagasin du Nord\n\noffers the works in a conserved 19th century hotel building. That, and dinner or high tea at the luxury digs of\n\nHotel D'Angletere\n\n- Copenhagen's Raffles Hotel - give you a concise sampling of old world glamour.\n\nThey're a sharp contrast to the cleaned up grittiness of Nyhavn - now a bit of a tourist trap with its throngs of foreigners spilling out of the restaurants and cafes such as smorrebrod specialist\n\nRestaurant Cap Horn\n\n. The former brothel is now home to the Danish speciality of open faced sandwiches - thin brown bread piled high with everything from pickled herring to mustard-slathered roast beef slices. Check out also the\n\nRoyal Smushi\n\ncafe inside the Royal Copenhagen store for its Japanese take on smorrebrod - dainty sandwiches moulded into sushi shapes. It's also a feature of the newly opened\n\nRestaurant Kahler\n\nin the still fun-filled\n\nTivoli Gardens\n\n, where upscale smorrebrod is topped with high-end meats and cheeses and served amidst Danish designer furniture.\n\nBut there is more to Danish food than smorrebrod, thanks to the likes of Rene Redzepi and his like-minded ilk who have edged away from traditional Danish austerity - eating for sustenance and not enjoyment was the way of the Lutheran church after wresting religious control from the Catholics during the Reformation - towards high-minded culinary delights.\n\nThe result is a Danish food movement sanctioned by the Michelin guide with its generous sprinkling of stars on the likes of Noma, Geranium, Relae, Kadeau and Restaurant AOC - all with different personalities but united by their proud embrace of locally sourced ingredients.\n\nFor sure, there's a lot to pack into any visit to this Danish gem, and if you feel comfortable enough to get around by bicycle on your own - don't. Save your skin and ego with a less challenging but no less efficient \"rickshaw\", where strapping young men (and women) will do the peddling while you sit down in their little carriage and explore the sights and sounds of the streets, even making a pitstop at where else but the Little Mermaid - the icon of the city which, for all intents and purposes, makes Copenhagen, well, some kind of wonderful.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nThe writer was a guest of Wonderful Copenhagen and Singapore Airlines. SIA flies five times weekly non-stop to Copenhagen.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nRadisson Blu Royal Hotel, Copenhagen\n\nHammerichsgade 1\n\nCopenhagen V, DK-1611, Denmark\n\nTel +45 3342 6000\n\nThis 50-year-old hotel looks its age but it's also a living tribute to the life and work of Danish design legend Arne Jacobsen. Many of his original designs remain in the rooms and lobby, and one highlight is the Arne Jacobsen suite 606, which remains true to the designer's original vision. Also, the hotel is in a fantastic location - a stone's throw from Tivoli Gardens and the central train station.\n\nCopenhagen Marriott Hotel\n\nKalvebod Brygge 5 1560\n\nCopenhagen, Denmark\n\nTel +45 88 33 99 00\n\nThe recently-refurbished Marriott sits on the waterfront and offers some dazzling views even as it caters to the business traveller's every need as a major chain property does. Located smack in the middle of downtown and walking distance to Tivoli Gardens and the Stroget shopping district, the glass-and-aluminium staggered building was built in 2001 with spacious rooms and all the amenities of its calibre. Don't expect any distinguishing design or hip elements - this is for those who value reliability, comfort and professional service.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is especially so \"now that we are coming into a new phase 3 of SLNG. It's a logical time to have a new leader\", he said, referring to SLNG's expansion plan to build a fourth storage tank and associated facilities to boost its regasification capacity to nine million tonnes per annum.\n\nIt is Mr McGregor's view that \"for a business or industry to grow, like for LNG, you need people to move on and people to move up, and to grow up quickly\".\n\nAnd that is where someone like John Ng, from the power industry but familiar with the LNG business, comes in, he said. While both of them were from PowerSeraya, there was no nepotism and Mr Ng's choice as SLNG's new CEO was strictly \"through a competitive process\".\n\nMr McGregor feels that \"it's time now to look further afield, and see how I can still be of help to Singapore\". However, he intends to remain in Singapore, where he has a Sentosa home. Revealing that he has \"several (job) options which I'm evaluating\", Mr McGregor declined to say what these would involve, apart from conceding that \"LNG is one possibility\". Another possibility is a job with a bigger regional responsibility, like for example Australasia, he said. For now, he will take a break before deciding on his next challenge \"sometime in Q1 next year\".\n\nAs he departs SLNG, Mr McGregor can look back on a job well done. \"A lot of good things have been achieved by SLNG. We have created a model for a future gas hub here, and the industry probably didn't think it was possible for us to grow the market here in the last three to four years to what it is today,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All that is needed is the green light from Apple headquarters for the launch of the South-east Asian store.\n\nAn industry source with knowledge of the matter told BT that iBookstore's launch for the region will include Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and \"maybe the Philippines and Brunei\". He revealed that agreements had been signed and accounts had been created. Now, material simply needs to be developed for upload onto the Apple servers.\n\nWhen Apple launched its iTunes store here last June, it brought the full force of its movie and music offerings to the local market, but its commercial book service remained out of reach. While the iBookstore is available on the iOS platform for users here, only free books - those that have passed into the public domain - can be accessed at the moment.\n\nThe groundwork for an iBookstore launch appears to have been laid at least a year ago. Last November, a local digital publishing consultant spotted the 'SG' country code in what appeared to be the back-end portion of the iBookstore during its e-book submission process, and posted a screenshot online.\n\nWhile the industry believes the iBookstore to be an eventuality in Singapore, the question of when it will launch hangs over the market. \"Soon\" was what one player in the industry was able to offer.\n\nThe path being beaten by global e-book sellers to Singapore's door appears labyrinthian. Amazon's Kindle store is available in almost 200 countries but not here, while Apple's entry remains the subject of speculation.\n\n\"Kindle and other large e-book retailers may have an all-or-nothing approach. They may either want to be able to announce to customers in a territory that they are able to offer virtually any title through the e-store or they don't launch an e-store at all,\" said Jinesh Lalwani, an intellectual property and IT lawyer at ATMD Bird & Bird LLP.\n\n\"If they can't provide that then there is a risk of platform fragmentation and lack of customer subscription and belief in the ecosystem.\"\n\nAt the same time, the fact that Singaporeans are savvy enough to buy e-books through the retailer's US store using giftcard redemptions might lower the incentive for sellers to localise an e-store for this market, Mr Lalwani added.\n\nApple's entry, if it happens soon, will be well timed. \"There is a trend away from dedicated device consumption and towards increase in consumption of content over smartphones,\" noted Rob Bratby, managing partner of technology law firm Olswang Asia.\n\nEven so, its appearance will have ramifications for local e-book retailers. \"They are aware that the big boys are coming, so once the big boys do, they will dominate the market,\" a veteran in the book trade told BT.\n\nTwo of the four global big boys are already here - Japan's e-book service Kobo and Google Play Books. The remaining two, the iBookstore and the Kindle store, are widely expected to follow suit. Coincidentally or not, two local e-book retailers - SingTel's skoob and MediaCorp's ilovebooks.com - have closed within months of each other this year.\n\nNow, Booktique, StarHub's e-book store, is the only local one left. Even so, StarHub is under no illusions about the realities of the business.\n\n\"Though we're the last one standing today, I'm very sure within the next 12-14 months, you will see new competitors coming into this area,\" said Stephen Lee, head of StarHub i\u00b3 division, which runs Booktique.\n\nWelcoming Apple's potential entry in the e-book business, he said: \"The spotlight on e-book services will ultimately boost awareness and encourage more people to explore reading digital titles on the go. This benefits the digital publishing industry as a whole.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(Part 2)", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHow safe are statins? (Part 2)\n\nThere is real concern when considering expanding their use to patients who are well\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 18, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCHOLESTEROL lowering drugs, also called statins, are one of the most commonly used drugs. The commonest side effects, muscle pain and liver abnormalities have been described in greater detail in the previous article (The Business Times Weekend, Oct 5). The muscle aches are believed to be related to the statin effect of decreasing production of Coenzyme Q10, a catalyst in the cells which is responsible for speeding up the production of energy in cells. Supplementation with Coenzyme Q has been found to be able to alleviate the symptoms for those with mild muscle aches in some studies but the data has not been consistent. Of greater concern is a 2009 publication in the Canadian Medical Association Journal which reported that a significant number of the biopsies of muscle in those with statin related muscle pain had demonstrated structural damage to the muscles.\n\nCancer\n\nOne of the myths on statin is its relationship with cancer. The trials have dismissed this unfounded fear and there is absolutely no evidence that the incidence of cancer was any different between statin treated groups and those who were given placebos.\n\nDiabetes Mellitus\n\nCurrent evidence points to a trend of a minor increase in blood sugar and a slightly increased risk of developing diabetes with statins. A 2010 Lancet publication based on data from combined studies showed that for every 1,000 patients given statins for four years, there will be an additional four new diabetics but this is offset by the prevention of about 22 cardiovascular events (heart attacks or strokes). For non-diabetics taking statins, on the average, the fasting blood sugars are 3mg/dl higher than those not taking statins. For diabetics, statin consumption also results in a small elevation in the blood sugar.\n\nImpact on the brain\n\nOne of the more recent concerns of statins is its impact on cognitive function. In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a consumer advisory to inform those taking statins that some statin users experienced brain cognitive impairment, such as memory loss, forgetfulness and confusion. More recently in May 2013, researchers from Arizona University reported in the Disease Models & Mechanisms Journal, that when brain cells of an insect were treated with statins, the brain cells developed swellings which were labelled as \"beads-on-a-string\" (BOS) effect. The researchers postulated that the effect was akin to a traffic jam, and the development of the beads was like a traffic pileup that was so bad that it disrupted the function of the brain cell. Removal of statins resulted in disappearance of the BOS effect and restoration of normal brain cell growth. Although cognitive impairment is a rare and reversible event, it is nevertheless of concern as statin users may go about their daily activity with impaired cognitive function without realising that it is related to statin intake and not due to ageing.\n\nFor statin use in recent strokes, only high dose atorvastatin was associated with a higher risk of bleeding in the brain as was demonstrated in the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study.\n\nKidney effects\n\nAmong the statins, rosuvastatin intake is associated with leakage of protein into the urine, especially at doses of 40 -80 mg daily. This may also be associated with leakage of red blood cells into the urine. This is an effect not seen in those receiving other statins. In a small percentage of those with high dose rosuvastatin, the urinary protein leakage may be persistent and may be associated with evidence of impairment of the kidney function such as elevation of the blood creatinine levels (blood marker used to measure kidney function). A few cases of kidney failure with high dose rosuvastatin have also been documented.\n\nThe impact of statins on the kidney caught media attention when a large retrospective observational study involving more than two million patient records was published in March this year in the British Medical Journals. The study noted that those who had no kidney disease, who were started on high dose statins, had a 34 per cent increase in hospital admissions for acute damage to the kidney when compared to those who were given lower dose of statins. This effect was seen during the first four months of commencing high dose statins. In this study, statin dosage was considered as high if the patient was on 10mg or more of rosuvastatin daily, 20mg or more of atorvastatin daily and 40mg or more of simvastatin daily. In absolute numbers, the researchers estimated that one admission for acute kidney injury may be seen for 1,700 patients who are started on treatment with high dose statins. This adverse tendency was not seen in those with pre-existing kidney disease. Currently, there is conflicting data on the use of statins in those on dialysis and with chronic kidney disease with some studies showing benefits and others showing increased risk of complications and no reduction in total death.\n\nImportant statin facts\n\nStatins as a class of drugs are generally safe and there is no doubt that statins are beneficial for those with pre-existing blockage of the heart arteries. While there is data to support the use of statins in patients who are at risk of heart disease but do not have pre-existing heart artery disease, there is real concern about the safety of statins when considering expanding the use of statins to patients who are well. When commencing statins, it is imperative to be aware that beyond the usual side effects of muscle aches and elevation of liver enzymes, there is a small but real risk of diabetes, cognitive impairment and kidney damage.\n\nThere are a few golden rules to follow. Firstly, start your statin dose at a low dose. This is especially true if you are an Asian and you are taking rosuvastatin, as blood drug level is about double that of a Caucasian for the same dosage. Secondly, higher doses of statins are associated with more adverse side effects and decreased tolerability, and hence combining a statin with ezetimibe (Ezetrol), which blocks cholesterol absorption in the intestine, may be considered first for further lowering of LDL or \"bad\" cholesterol before considering increasing statin doses. Thirdly, if there is pre-existing kidney disease or urinary protein leakage, it is best not to use rosuvastatin. Fourthly, for those with recent strokes, atorvastatin should be avoided. Fifthly, for those who are about to commence on statins, based on the analysis of the combined data of 135 studies on statins published in June this year in Circulation Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, among all the statins currently available in the market, low to moderate doses of simvastatin and pravastatin have the best safety profile and are the preferred statins.\n\nStatins and brand names: pravastatin (Pravachol), simvastatin (Zocor), atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin (Crestor) .This is the second of two parts on cholesterol-lowering medications .Dr Lim is medical director at the Singapore Heart, Stroke & Cancer Centre.

Of the dollar value, a hefty $602 million or 60 per cent was done in the 30 STI components, which suggests that activity in penny stocks has dropped off sharply. A large number of retail brokers have confirmed this, reporting virtually no business from their clients.\n\nThe main market-moving development as far as blue chips were concerned was that US politicians agreed to kick the country's fiscal can down the road when they raised the government's debt ceiling for the time being, at least until Jan 15, 2014.\n\nThat a compromise - albeit one that is only temporary - was eventually reached did not come as a surprise at all since the alternative of the US government defaulting on its debt payments was extremely unlikely and no one really expected it to happen.\n\nAs it turned out, after much dramatic posturing and finger-pointing, it was the Republican Party which backed down with its demands, though it remains to be seen what happens between now and the new Jan 15 deadline.\n\nThis \"governing by crisis\", however, presented traders with an opportunity to \"buy in anticipation and sell on news\", with Wall Street rising before and during the announcement of a deal, but falling the very next day.\n\nIn the local market, the main plays this week continued to be penny stocks, although in much subdued trading compared to a fortnight ago. Singapore Exchange's recent decision to declare three speculative stocks as \"designated securities\" probably contributed significantly to curbing trading in the pennies, as did the mysterious crash suffered midweek by Chasen Holdings when it lost 54 per cent in one session. The stock of the investment holding company, whose businesses include logistics and engineering services, ended the week 24.5 cents or 57 per cent down at 18.5 cents. When queried by SGX, the company said it did not know what was behind the selling.\n\nIn its latest fund manager survey, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (B0AML) found that 71 per cent of respondents expect global economic growth to remain \"below trend\" in the coming 12 months, up from a net 61 per cent a month ago, and that 18 per cent expect corporate profit margins to fall, up from 11 per cent a month ago.\n\n\"Asset allocators have scaled back their equity holdings. A net 49 per cent of global asset allocators are overweight equities, down from a net 60 per cent in September,\" said B0AML. \"Over the past month, investors have reduced their positions in eight out of the 11 sectors monitored by the survey. Last month, a net 9 per cent of the panel remained overweight US equities, and this month, that measure has dropped to zero per cent.\"\n\nOverall, 235 panellists with US$643 billion of assets under management participated in the survey from Oct 4 to 10.\n\nA total of 183 managers managing US$500 billion participated in the global survey, while a total of 118 managers managing US$291 billion participated in the regional surveys.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What's driving the art rush? By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Oct 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN 2009, there was just one art fair in Singapore. In 2010, there were three. By 2014, there may be as many as 10 art fairs of varying sizes, including four large-scale ones.\n\nAre there enough buyers to support so many fairs? Will the phenomenon threaten the livelihood of galleries that have been here since before the global art craze? And will it affect the quality of the works of popular artists compelled to produce more within a shorter turnaround time? Questions abound.\n\nOf course, Singapore isn't alone in experiencing the explosion in art fairs. Across the globe, major cities are witnessing a dramatic rise in fair numbers, fuelled by a few major factors. They include a growing interest in art, the desire to own something unique that no one else has, the media frenzy surrounding stratospheric record prices at auctions, and a belief - misguided in many cases - that art is a solid form of investment.\n\n\"In an image-overloaded age where everyone can see and download almost any image they want from the Internet, buyers want to possess a unique artwork that's exclusive,\" says one gallerist who didn't wish to be named. \"But the trouble comes when they read all the headlines of blue-chip art fetching these crazy prices at auctions, and they think the art they're buying will one day fetch those prices too. . . Well, there's a good chance that it won't.\"\n\nThe gallerist estimates that less than one per cent of the artworks being sold in the world has resale value.\n\nDramatic numbers\n\nStill, the art craze shows no signs of abating. Next year, there may be in Singapore as many as four major art fairs, three hotel art fairs, one major photography fair and two small-scale but not insignificant fairs. The organisers are optimistic about the market, some citing their own solid numbers to prove the cynics wrong.\n\nThe four major art fairs taking place next year are Art Stage, the premier art fair in the country; Affordable Art Fair, which will now hold two editions every year instead of one; and the Singapore Art Fair, a new event by the organisers of the successful Beirut Art Fair.\n\nCamilla Hewitson, fair director of Affordable Art Fair (Singapore & Hong Kong), says: \"Affordable Art Fair has 16 fairs globally so we are able to track the general success of a fair by comparing data across the board, but also taking into account local differentiators.\n\n\"Both London and New York have two AAF editions a year and following such a success rate in Singapore over the past three years - in terms of visitor numbers and gallery interest - it was a natural decision to launch another AAF fair in Singapore in May (following the usual November fair).\"\n\nLast year, the AAF Singapore attracted 16,000 visitors and rang up more than $4 million in sales - $1 million more than the previous year. In fact, compared to its first year in 2010, the numbers marked a 68 per cent increase in visitorship and 129 per cent increase in sales - sterling figures indeed.\n\nMeanwhile, the organisers of the brand new Singapore Art Fair (SAF), set to open next year, are relying on the country's reputation as a cosmopolitan city and hub for South-east Asian art to attract buyers.\n\nLaure d'Hauteville, who is the CEO and fair director of the Beirut Art Fair (BAF), thinks they can transfer the success formula of the BAF onto our shores with SAF. She says: \"We specialise in art from the Menasa region (Middle East, North Africa and South Asia) but we see similarities between them and South-east Asian art. Beside the growing interest in the art of South-east Asia and Menasa, they address similar issues like urbanisation and post-colonisation.\"\n\nReflecting on the competition, she says: \"We're not worried about the other art fairs. Each one has its own unique identity, and ours is quite different from theirs. And we're expecting many art collectors originally from the Menasa region to congregate in Singapore for this event.\"\n\nSAF hopes to feature between 80 and 100 galleries, a figure that's comparable to Art Stage's 130 galleries and Affordable Art Fair's 101.\n\nFilling smaller niches\n\nAt the other end of the scale, smaller players are finding ways to enter the market and carve their niches. Next week, seasoned New York art dealers Jerry Gun and Mary Pan will debut Spot Art, a new art fair dedicated to South-east Asian artists under 30.\n\nIt will showcase more than 200 works by 70 young artists, selected by by a jury of well-known art professionals including artist Milenko Prvacki, curator Iola Lenzi and Patrick D Flores, professor of Art Studies at the University of the Philippines. Because of the professional jury and the lower price points of the artworks - between $500 and $5,000 - the event is expected to draw strong interest.\n\nMr Gunn says: \"Many talented young artists in South-east Asia don't get to show their works outside of their country because the art scene or the gallery system there is small or doesn't even exist. So we see our effort as something of a social enterprise, bringing works by promising regional artists to one place.\"\n\nWhile all this is good news for artists and art collectors, the art fair phenomenon is a double-edged sword for the galleries. Gallerists say they are well aware of the attractions of the art fair: Art lovers get to see a wide variety of art from many galleries under one roof. There is also the thrill of buying quickly as fairs typically last no longer than three or four days.\n\nBut for galleries, the costs of taking part in art fairs aren't low. It's not uncommon for galleries to fork out between $15,000 and $30,000 for a mid-sized booth at a major art fair, and then not selling enough art to break even. In fact, a few have made substantial losses - one as much as $50,000 - after failing to sell a single piece of artwork. Competition, after all, is fierce at art fairs as local galleries go toe-to-toe with international galleries boasting big-name artists.\n\nOne gallerist echoes others when he says: \"The art fair sales model seems to appeal to a lot of Singaporeans because it has a sort of supermarket mentality - you have to buy it now or you'll lose out.\n\n\"On the other hand, the galleries' way of selling art is more relaxed. You come into the gallery, you get a chance to meet the artist and understand his or her practice, and usually you have more time to consider whether you want to buy the work. . . I hope the latter mindset will seep in.\"\n\nThe gallerist adds that usually after a major fair, business at his local gallery is \"slow\" for two months.\n\nStill others were more sanguine about the situation, seeing the fair as a not-to-be-missed opportunity to meet new collectors who may otherwise not think of buying art or seeking out their galleries.\n\nOne says: \"Nothing beats having a big crowd milling about your booth. . . At the end of the day, you just have to compete better, find stronger artists, connect with new collectors, and sell more aggressively. It is a free market, after all.\n\n\"But you know, judging from my experience, don't be too surprised if some of these art fairs disappear after just one or two editions.\"\n\nSpot Art runs from Oct 26 to Nov 4, 2013, 11am to 9pm at ARTrium@MICA 140 Hill Street.\n\nAfforable Art Fair Singapore 2013 runs from Nov 21 to 24, 2013, at the F1 Pit Building, Republic Boulevard.\n\nFor a complete calendar of the art fairs next year, see \"\n\nMore art than you have walls for\n\n\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We're very excited to have the opportunity to support one such project,\" a company spokesman told BT.\n\nThe Lu'an project is the first large-scale (one million tonnes per annum) coal-to-diesel project approved by the Chinese government, and an integral part of China's national energy strategy. The water plant will operate on a sophisticated 'closed loop' water management system.\n\n\"The 'closed loop' system is like the holy grail of the water management industry,\" said the spokesman. \"It seeks to reclaim every single drop of water from effluent and integrate it back into the water supply continuously in a loop, hence achieving 'zero liquid discharge' and promoting water reuse.\"\n\nThe water plant - similar to Sembcorp's existing plants on Jurong Island and Zhangjiagang in China's Jiangsu province - will be able to treat high-concentration and high-salinity industrial wastewater streams, reclaim water, as well as supply industrial, potable, demineralised and cooling water.\n\nSaid Sembcorp's group president and CEO Tang Kin Fei: \"Besides serving Lu'an Group's water requirements, we also help them protect the environment and conserve water resources.\"\n\n\"This project also gives us our first foothold to tap into the coal-to-chemical sector, which includes coal-to-diesel, coal-to-gas and coal-to-alkene facilities,\" Mr Tang added.\n\nSembcorp will establish a wholly owned subsidiary, Sembcorp Changzhi Water Co, to manage the plant, which is expected to be completed between late 2014 and 2015. With this project, Sembcorp now has 23 utilities operations across 11 provinces in China, serving both industrial and municipal customers. In August, Sembcorp announced that it would develop an additional two industrial wastewater treatment plants in Liaoning province.\n\nSembcorp shares closed five cents higher at $5.36 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Market observers say this points to the New York Stock Exchange-listed group's serious intention to sell the landmark circular building opposite International Plaza and Tanjong Pagar MRT Station.\n\nThe pricing expectation is believed to be at least $2,000 per square foot (psf) based on the existing net lettable area (NLA) of 674,000 square feet - which would amount to $1.35 billion.\n\nWord on the street is that CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle, whom BlackRock has appointed as exclusive agents to market AXA Tower, are talking to interested parties.\n\nFeaturing quadruple road frontage along Shenton Way, Maxwell, Anson and Prince Edward roads, the 50-storey building is on a site with a balance lease term of 68 years.\n\nDespite its circular shape which gives it low efficiency (ratio of net lettable to gross floor area) of only 66 per cent - compared with 80-plus per cent for a modern office development - AXA Tower offers significant asset enhancement potential. BT understands the buyer has potential to tap unutilised plot ratio for the property which can be used to construct a retail podium on an undeveloped part of the site facing Maxwell Road.\n\nAXA Tower's existing gross floor area (GFA) is about 1.02 million sq ft, reflecting around 8.64 plot ratio (ratio of GFA to land area). The GFA can be raised to 1.24 million sq ft, translating to a total plot ratio of 10.5 as allowed for the site under Master Plan 2008 - inclusive of bonus plot ratios for the property's substantial site area and proximity to Tanjong Pagar MRT Station. Some analysts reckon a development charge of about $140 million would be payable to the state to tap the unutilised plot ratio.\n\nThe additional space of over 200,000 sq ft can be built in the form of a low-rise block with a big floor-plate. \"The best use for this would be probably retail,\" suggested an industry observer.\n\nAXA Tower currently includes about 29,000 sq ft NLA of retail space in the basement and level 1, with 645,000 sq ft offices filling up the rest of the building. There are some 600 carpark lots in the basement levels.\n\nThe property has had a few name changes over the years. When it was completed by the government in the 1980s, it was known as Treasury Building before being renamed Temasek Tower when the Finance Ministry moved out in 1997.\n\nAfter a CapitaLand subsidiary sold the property in 2007, the building saw another name change to 8 Shenton Way before taking its current name in 2011 when AXA became anchor tenant.\n\nEarlier this month, BlackRock completed its acquisition of MGPA, which was formerly known as Macquarie Global Property Advisors. The latter bought the Shenton Way property, then known as Temasek Tower, for $1.039 billion or $1,550 psf of NLA in March 2007. The acquisition was made through MGPA Fund II, which is said to expire in 2015.\n\nBlackRock's recent acquisition of MGPA has created a combined US$23.5 billion global real estate investment platform and is serving a diverse client base of some 700 investors.\n\nIn addition to providing exposure to a recovery in office rentals, AXA Tower's buyer stands to reap substantial value creation from constructing a retail podium.\n\nIn June this year, Tuan Sing Holdings paid $2,580 psf of existing NLA for Robinson Point, a freehold property. Last December, the freehold 79 Anson Road changed hands at $2,029 psf while Mapletree Anson, with a balance land tenure of 94 years at the time, was transacted at $2,049 psf.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Home values in the city may fall more than 10 per cent into 2014 amid government measures to curb prices and rising US interest rates, he said.\n\n\"Hong Kong is in a challenging position at the moment,\" Mr Swan said on Oct 10, adding that the firm had sold shares of companies based there in the last 12 months. \"You've had very strong liquidity as China leveraged up and you've had very low cost of credit because of the currency situation. Now both of those things are changing.\"\n\nAn influx of mainland Chinese buyers, near-record low interest rates and a lack of new supply have made Hong Kong the world's most expensive property market. Home prices in the city surged since the end of 2008, prompting the government to introduce property curbs. Prices fell about 3.1 per cent since peaking in March and the number of homes sold in the city last month slipped to 3,686 from 7,301 a year earlier, according to the Hong Kong Land Registry.\n\nThe property market also faces pressure as the Federal Reserve prepares to trim record stimulus. With the city's currency pegged to the dollar, the market tracks rising rates in the US, which translates into higher mortgage costs. Hong Kong's benchmark 10-year government bond yields have climbed about 90 basis points since Feb 1 through Wednesday.

After two solid productions this year that received rave reviews - namely The Rabbithole and Next To Normal - the producers are back with another play that may again attest to the company's production and directorial prowess.\n\nThe difference is that, unlike those previous productions, the new Gruesome Playground Injuries is set to be a more intimate experience with just two actors performing in a small studio space - a marked departure from the large and ambitious productions Pangdemonium is used to staging. \"It's far removed from what we usually do,\" notes director Tracie Pang. \"But we love the script and we hope our audiences will take to it too.\"\n\nGruesome Playground Injuries centres on a boy (Alan Wong) and a girl (Seong Hui Xuan) who meet each other at age eight in a school clinic. Sharing a fascination for each other's injuries, they become instant pals. Over the next 30 years, the two will meet again in various critical settings - a mental institution, a funeral parlour and various hospital rooms - to share details of their lives and their injuries. And though he is attracted to her and wants to be her lover, she resists him for various reasons.\n\nOne of the things the play tracks is how the optimism and naivete of childhood get eroded - at least for one character - by the realities and disillusionment of adulthood.\n\nBut the play is done is such a compelling and sympathetic manner that critics have lauded it - as \"funny\", \"sweet\", \"romantic\" and \"relatable\".\n\nWritten in 2009 by Pulitzer-nominated playwright Rajiv Joseph, it will be the first time the play is staged in Singapore after gracing stages on Broadway and West End - and, unsurprisingly, numerous college theatres. And its stars Seong and Wong are likely to put on strong turns after beating dozens of contenders for the roles.\n\nSeong has already had a string of well-received performances these past two years, capping it with a Best Supporting Actress trophy at the Life! Theatre Awards in July.\n\nSeong reveals: \"This is one of the most difficult roles I've ever had to do, because it requires me to move through various ages quickly, from eight to 21 to 38 and other ages in between ... But I used to teach young kids piano and dance, so I try to remember what they're like so I can be like them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, newcomer Wong is an Asian-American theatre graduate who's making his debut on the Singapore stage. He nabbed the role earlier this year when he had just moved to Singapore from Hong Kong and was asked to audition. Shortly after, he also scored a gig at MTV Asia as the host of The MTV Show and is now better known as a VJ. Still, he insists: \"My heart is in acting - that's what I really want to do.\"\n\n'Gruesome Playground Injuries' plays at the Esplanade Theatre Studio from Oct 31 to Nov 10, 2013. Tues-Fri: 8pm, Sat and Sun: 3pm and 8pm. Tickets at $35 and $40 from Sistic.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This plan incited staunch opposition from countries such as the US, China and India, and nearly sparked a trade war.\n\nAs a result of the opposition, the EC was forced to put its plan of incorporating international aviation in the ETS on hold last November.\n\nThen on Wednesday, it issued a statement announcing a change to the idea - that is, the emissions tax would be payable only by airlines with flights in European airspace as opposed to the last point of departure, and that this would take effect ahead of the planned global market-based mechanism (MBM) that becomes applicable to international aviation emissions by 2020.\n\nConnie Hedegaard, the European Commissioner for Climate Action, said: \"I am confident that the European Parliament and the Council will move swiftly and approve this proposal without delay.\n\n\"With this proposal, Europe is taking responsibility to reduce emissions within its own airspace until the global measure begins.\"\n\nUnder this proposal, all emissions between airports in the European Economic Area - the 28 EU member states as well as Norway and Iceland - would be liable to the emissions tax. Flights to and from third countries which are not developed and which emit less than one per cent of global aviation emissions are exempted. The Commission said it would like to see the proposal adopted by the European Parliament and Council by March 2014, though it wants the tax payable to begin on Jan 1.\n\nAviation associations were clearly alarmed by the move, which comes shortly after the 38th ICAO Assembly. At that meeting, the 191 ICAO member states had voted to develop a global MBM to curb the growth of carbon emissions from airlines. Proposals for the scheme will be put forth at the next ICAO assembly in 2016, with an eye on implementation in 2020.\n\nCommenting on the EC's new proposal, Andrew Herdman, the director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA), said: \"We view this development with concern. The inclusion of international airlines without the consent of their respective governments is likely to meet with strong opposition, particularly from major developing countries. This runs counter to the substance and spirit of the agreement reached earlier this month at the ICAO's 38th Assembly.\"\n\nThe director-general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), Tony Tyler, who had appeared confident this week that the inclusion of international aviation under the ETS would no longer fly, also signalled his concern yesterday.\n\n\"As the Commission's proposal moves to the co-decision process with the European Parliament and Council, we trust that there will be wide stakeholder engagement including with the international community. We have all worked hard to reach a consensus on the way forward through ICAO for a global MBM. It is of critical importance to ensure that everybody - including Europe - stays focused on the big picture of Carbon-Neutral Growth (CNG) 2020.\"\n\nThe aviation industry is working towards carbon neutral growth from 2020, and to halving the 2005 net emissions levels by 2050.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Plush is an attempt to rediscover her edgy indie roots, but it falls well short of the mark.\n\nHayley (Emily Browning) is a wild child and frontwoman for alternative rock band Plush, which comes across as a latter-day version of a 70s new wave band like Blondie. Hayley is also blond and alluring, exuding sexual energy and the sort of onstage personality that could incite riots and attract creepy fans. But just as fame, fortune and Rolling Stone magazine beckon, Hayley's brother Jack (Thomas Dekker), her close songwriting collaborator and a vital cog in the Plush machine, fails to wake up from a drug-induced binge.\n\nHayley goes into a creative tailspin and loses her mojo, until replacement band member Enzo (Xavier Samuel) takes up the slack and helps her get back on track during a cross-country tour. He wears way too much eyeliner, hovers protectively around her, offering warm words of solace (and a hot bod) along with some songwriting tips. \"In order to create you have to embrace the dark side,\" he whispers knowingly.\n\nThe group's tour is over but in true stalker fashion Enzo refuses to stay away. Even more distressing for Hayley, he becomes a fixture at her hillside home - playing with her kids and chugging beers with her husband Carter (Cam Gigandet). The family's routine is further compromised when the regular nanny fails to show.\n\nHer replacement (Frances Fisher) is a tight-lipped Nurse Ratched-type - the kind you wouldn't want to bump into in a dark alley.\n\nThe story, by Hardwicke and Arty Nelson, is painfully contrived, with each plot development more predictable than the one before.\n\nAn attempt at dangerous eroticism, complete with a few token bondage scenes, goes badly awry and viewers will find it difficult to suppress gasps of surprise - not at some disturbing sex scene, but at how poorly executed the movie is. As a result, there's no rush to see Plush.\n\nRating:\n\nC-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/unacceptable-hostage-situation", "site_title": "An unacceptable hostage situation", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAn unacceptable hostage situation\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Oct 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n'IF I WAS your high school teacher, I would give all of you a D-minus,\" wrote one commentator in a New York Times blog post yesterday, addressing the US Congress, whose Republican wing came close to forcing a US debt default.\n\nWell said. The shenanigans by a cabal of politicians in Washington over the last 17 days - which held not just the US but the global economy to ransom - were an economically reckless and politically stupid outrage.\n\nNot just Americans, but anybody with any connection to the world economy (which means just about everybody) should be relieved that it didn't happen in the end; that, at the last moment, the Republicans stepped back from the abyss and agreed to reopen the federal government and raise the debt ceiling - without which the US would have been forced into defaulting on its obligations, sending a financial tsunami across the world.\n\nBut the relief being felt is something akin to that of a hostage released by a terrorist who had for two weeks threatened to blow him up - the hostage in this case being the global economy. It was straight blackmail: \"We demand that you roll back your healthcare plan, President Obama - or we'll blow up the world economy!\"\n\nEven though the worst didn't happen, damage has been done. According to Standard and Poor's, the government shutdown alone shaved 0.3 percentage point off US GDP per week - and it's been more than two weeks.\n\nUS consumer confidence, which looked to be recovering this year, has sunk to its lowest level since the worst of the global financial crisis in 2008.\n\nPerhaps more serious is what the episode has done to international confidence in US creditworthiness; it's no longer spotless. There is now political risk attached to owning US Treasuries that wasn't there before - which means yields are higher than they should be.\n\nYields did indeed spike up as the debt-ceiling drama played out. Hundreds of billions of dollars were moved out of Treasuries into cash by investors who didn't want to take a chance.\n\nAs Treasuries are a benchmark for several other interest rates elsewhere, higher-than-otherwise borrowing costs are being felt across the world, hitting businesses, consumers, homeowners and other governments.\n\nBut the relief we feel about the debt deal in Washington may be short-lived. The standoff in the US Congress has not ended; there is more political theatre to come. The US government will be funded only until mid-January next year and the debt ceiling will be raised only till Feb 7. So, within a few months, we are likely to witness a rerun of the hostage situation.\n\nIn a sane world, this would not be allowed to happen. Nobody in the US, or anywhere else - no person, politician or organisation - would be permitted to hold the global economy hostage. Business groups, the IMF, the World Bank, the G-20 and other governments should say to the US Congress: \"You cannot do this!\" They will most likely have the support of sensible US lawmakers, most Americans and President Barack Obama.\n\nOne of the more sensible, even if radical, proposals (put forth by Martin Wolf of the Financial Times, besides others) is to simply abolish the US debt ceiling - which investor Warren Buffett describes, accurately, as a \"political weapon of mass destruction\".\n\nThere is a legal provision for doing so in the US Constitution. Section 4 of the 14th Amendment states that: \"The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorised by law, including debts incurred for payment of pensions and bounties for services in suppressing insurrection or rebellion, shall not be questioned.\"\n\nIn 2011, former president Bill Clinton said that if faced with a debt-ceiling impasse that threatens a US default, he would go ahead and invoke this provision \"and force the courts to stop me\".\n\nInvoking the 14th Amendment\n\nHouse Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, among several Democratic politicians, has also advocated invoking the 14th Amendment.\n\nPresident Obama has been reluctant to take the constitutional route to put an end to the insanity of the sort we have just witnessed. In January this year, White House press secretary Jay Carney said: \"Our position on the 14th Amendment has not changed . . . Congress has the responsibility and the sole authority to raise the debt ceiling. And Congress must do its job.\"\n\nAfter the events of the past 17 days, this much is clear: Congress is not doing its job and cannot be relied upon to do it. In the bargain, it is putting the global economy at risk.\n\nWhoever Mr Obama listens to should remind him: \"Mr President, this is unacceptable.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's not something he does very often - on average, the local music legend does it only about 20 per cent of the time he performs - and he's not bothered by the sometimes-negative reaction he receives anyway.\n\n\"Some people love it, some people don't. It's a different sound, and some people have a thing about the piano being a natural instrument and the organ being an electric instrument. But I don't care, because I'm committed to play them both,\" says the bi-instrumental musician.\n\nNot only that, he most recently teamed up with two other jazz organists, Alberto Marsico from Italy and Tony Monaco from the US, to tour three Asian cities with his latest project called The Jazz Organ Summit. The tour starts in Bangkok tonight, and will continue in Hong Kong next Monday before making its way to the Esplanade Recital Studio next Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nThe Jazz Organ Summit is the first of its kind to be held here. It's a 90-minute performance made up of three mini-concerts by each musician, and a finale where they will all play, pass-the-baton style.\n\n\"It's the perfect concert for people with an attention deficit, because just as you're getting bored of one player, I go off the stage and the next one comes on,\" he jokes.\n\nWhen asked why he put together this summit, Monteiro says it wasn't just to get the public to be better acquainted with jazz, he also intended for it to inspire his jazz pianist peers to join him in taking up the organ as well.\n\n\"Not counting those who use an organ sound as part of their set-up to play pop or rock, there are only about four jazz organists in Singapore. I'm hoping some of the pianists I know who are interested in the organ but haven't taken the plunge will do it so that this time next year there will be at least six or seven of us doing it,\" he explains.\n\nIncidentally, Monteiro himself actually gave up playing the organ years ago mainly because of the inconvenience brought about by the sheer size of the instrument.\n\nIt was only after he had seen Marsico play a small, compact Nord organ at his concert in Singapore five years later that Monteiro decided it was about time he picked up the instrument again.\n\nNow he even has an organ set up right beside his piano at home, and spends about an equal amount of time practising on each instrument.\n\n\"The organ is a thing that came and went; I played the organ in the early eighties but I had to carry over 200 kg of gear (around whenever I performed). But now organs like Nord are only 13-15 kg, so it's not as cumbersome anymore; that's why it's come back,\" he says.\n\nMonteiro adds there are still a lot of followers of the organ's sound who bemoan the instrument's demise after the height of its popularity in the '80s. But he hopes The Jazz Organ Summit will help him spread the word that it has since made a comeback.\n\n\"In fact, it's been back for about 15 years around the world; we're just slow in Singapore,\" he adds.\n\nThe Jazz Organ Summit will run on Oct 23 and Oct 24 at the Esplanade Recital Studio at 7.30pm.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/tell-investors-why-cpfis-stock-chasen-crashed", "site_title": "Tell investors why CPFIS stock Chasen crashed", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTell investors why CPFIS stock Chasen crashed\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Oct 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN Chasen Holdings' shares plummeted almost 19 cents or 54 per cent on Wednesday to 15.9 cents, in heavy volume of 58 million shares, conventional market wisdom was that the selling must somehow be connected to the recent crashes suffered by three stocks classified as \"designated securities\" by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) - namely Asiasons Capital, Blumont and LionGold.\n\nMarket players, however, were at the time unclear as to the exact nature of this connection. Apart from speculation that Chasen too might soon be designated by the exchange, no one had much to offer in the way of useful information.\n\nSince then, the more popular theory which has emerged is that there was forced selling suffered by a large shareholder or broker to cover losses elsewhere, though no disclosures of this nature have yet been made.\n\nAnother anomaly?\n\nAs always when a large price movement occurs, the company was queried by SGX - and its reply was (predictably) that it did not know why its shares fell as sharply as they did. The stock recovered only slightly yesterday, rising 1.8 cents to 17.7 cents with 42 million units traded, so it looks like it is still suffering the fallout from the mid-week collapse.\n\nWhy exactly did the stock fall on Wednesday? Does this question even matter, or should we simply brush it off as one of those anomalies that occasionally surface in the local market and forget about it? After all, Chasen's shares had been chased up (pardon the pun) to a two-year high of 49 cents just a fortnight ago in line with a large market-wide play on penny stocks. So perhaps investors should just accept that a correction of some description was to be expected?\n\nMaybe so. It would certainly be convenient to ignore the incident, view it with only passing academic interest and thereafter move on - as is usually the case with odd price movements and queries in the local stock market.\n\nBut 54 per cent in one day in heavy volume is an eye-popping loss and, more importantly, there is the inconvenient fact that Chasen is a counter approved under the Central Provident Fund Investment Scheme (CPFIS). This means that investors could potentially have lost some of their retirement funds in Wednesday's crash.\n\nIn our view, this places a different complexion on the incident, making it wrong to simply write it off as one of those inexplicable episodes that sometimes crop up in daily trading and then to forget about it. This is all the more so when you consider that Chasen is a decent enough company on the verge of a turnaround.\n\nFormerly China Entertainment Sports, the investment holding company with engineering and logistics expertise that services regional manufacturing industries transferred from Catalist to the mainboard in February this year. Although it incurred a loss for the year ended March 31, 2013, this was reportedly because of an arbitration settlement with a customer, and Chasen said last month it expected to be profitable in FY2014.\n\nIn the past six weeks, Chasen said it had secured $16 million in new business in China, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Middle East, which puts it on track to live up to its forecast.\n\nIf Chasen is therefore not your typical penny speculative, what on earth happened on Wednesday?\n\nCaveat emptor\n\nAll reasons given earlier are based wholly on speculation and only the regulatory authorities with access to sophisticated surveillance systems would know for sure. It is important that they tell the market what they know because if the rule of \"caveat emptor\" or \"buyer beware\" is to have any force when it comes to CPF investments, it can only do so if buyers are given as much relevant, material and timely information as possible.\n\nIn this connection, questions that must be answered are: Was Chasen's collapse due to forced selling and/or margin calls, as the market now thinks? If so, who was the party or parties that had their positions cleared? If it wasn't forced selling, then what was the reason?\n\nFurthermore, when large shareholdings of CPFIS stocks are pledged as collateral, shouldn't this information be disclosed to potential investors because of the very real risk that forced selling and margin calls could one day massively depress their investments and lead to a loss of retirement money?\n\nLet's hope investors get some answers - sooner rather than later.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I want to learn from that,\" said Mr Lau. \"I've been in touch with the SingTel partners to make sure we're in the loop (on) their findings.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation.\n\nDBS, too, had previously said that it was working with SingTel to find out why the network contingency plan did not work for some of its branches.\n\nOf the three local banks affected last Wednesday, OCBC was the only one with unaffected branches, while services for 11 of its 600-odd ATMs were disrupted. DBS was the hardest hit, with some ATMs and 18 of its branches seeing disruptions.\n\nDBS said yesterday that only a \"small proportion\" of its ATMs, cash acceptance machines and branches were affected because all its branches have \"dual network connectivity\", while its machines are connected in a way that prevents a network incident from affecting all the others in the area.\n\nFor a 30-minute spell yesterday, DBS and POSB customers had difficulties using some of the bank's ATMs, which DBS chalked up to a \"system connectivity issue\" that was not related to the Bukit Panjang fire.\n\nYesterday, OCBC said its branches were unscathed by the fire because each branch is supported by two different exchanges. Also, its Bukit Panjang branch's main line is connected to SingTel's Jurong West exchange, rendering the fire a moot issue.\n\nThis level of contingency planning can be costly. When OCBC upgraded its network's backup systems in 2010, it ended up spending $600,000 as a one-time investment, and paying $35,000 more in monthly maintenance costs for the additional network lines and connections to more exchanges, it said yesterday.\n\nToday, the bank spends more than $100,000 a month on maintenance for the ATM and branch network lines alone.\n\nWhile some of OCBC's ATMs are also connected to two different exchanges, other OCBC ATMs rely on just one. This was the case for 11 of the bank's machines which experienced outages after the SingTel fire, as their primary and backup network lines were both connected to the Bukit Panjang exchange.\n\nOCBC's Mr Lau said that when the bank's ATMs follow the one-exchange configuration, it is because there are other OCBC ATMs located nearby that are connected to other exchanges. The 11 affected ATMs, for example, were spread out across the island, in places such as Woodlands and Changi Airport.\n\n\"We are talking about looking (again) at this approach, (at) whether there is more that we can do,\" Mr Lau said.\n\nYesterday, SingTel outlined its plans for its newly formed committee of inquiry. It will focus on four areas: the cause of the fire; how effectively the telco handled the incident; a comparison of its network design and contingency processes with global standards; and recommendations to prevent similar events and improve network resilience.\n\nThe three-member committee will be chaired by Bobby Chin Yoke Choong, a non-executive and independent director of SingTel and chairman of its risk committee. He was previously the managing partner of KPMG Singapore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Australian Reits plan to invest more than A$3 billion in the asset class over the next five years.\n\nAustralian Reits, with more financial flexibility after cutting debt and seeing their share prices rise 46 per cent over the past two years, are looking at warehouses to bolster earnings as a decline in white-collar jobs weighs on office demand and retail sales growth slows. Some may come up short as prime buildings available for purchase are constrained, according to broker Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\n\"There's a significant number of buyers in the market chasing a limited amount of product,\" said Michael Fenton, Sydney-based head of industrial property at Jones Lang LaSalle, who forecasts yields on warehouses could shrink by about 0.25 per cent point within a year as prices rise.\n\n\"A lot of the Reits will struggle to meet the upper end of their projected targets for acquisitions over the next year or two. I don't think they'll overpay, but they'll be operating at the upper end of the pricing range.\"\n\nIndustrial properties delivered rental returns of 8.6 per cent in the year through June, compared with 7 per cent for retail and 7.3 per cent for offices, according to the Property Council/IPD Australia All Property Index. The value of A-grade industrial properties rose 4.9 per cent as of June 30 from a year earlier, according to CBRE Group.\n\nSydney-based Stockland, which earlier said it was looking to sell industrial real estate, reversed that strategy in May under new managing director Mark Steinert. The company plans to raise warehouses to as much as 15 per cent of assets from about 7 per cent over the next five years, with a goal of holding as much as A$1.5 billion of the properties.\n\n\"We acknowledge that industrial is now the most competitive part of the market,\" said Mr Steinert. \"We'll be very disciplined in our process.\"\n\nStockland shares rose 1.8 per cent to A$3.97 at the close of trading in Sydney, extending gains this year to 12.5 per cent, compared with a 6.7 per cent increase in the S&P/ASX 200 A-Reit Index in 2013. The A-Reit Index has gained 47 per cent from a low in August 2011, compared with a 27 per cent advance by the S&P/ASX 200 Index, a benchmark for Australian equities.\n\nReit purchases of industrial properties valued at more than A$5 million jumped to A$111 million in the three months to Sept 30 from A$42 million two years earlier and A$71 million a year ago, data from broker CBRE show.\n\nAs Reits compete for modern warehouses, those that already own industrial land that can be developed will fare better than those looking to buy existing properties, Simon Hemphill, Australian research director at broker Savills plc, said in an interview in Sydney.\n\nGoodman has A$3 billion of land that could be developed into buildings with a value of A$10 billion, chief executive officer Greg Goodman said.\n\n\"There's more emphasis on modern warehousing, efficient warehousing, putting a number of operations together or creating a hub for their activities to get cost efficiencies,\" Mr Goodman said. \"The growth in e-commerce is also continuing at a very, very strong rate.\"\n\nOnline retail sales rose 10 per cent in August from a year earlier, data from National Australia Bank showed, while total retail sales rose only 2.3 per cent in the same period, according to the Bureau of Statistics.\n\nMuch of the goods purchased online are from overseas, helping drive a 5.3 per cent rise in imports in August from a year earlier, according to the bureau data.\n\nGoodman has no plans to sell any of its industrial assets even though it has received unsolicited offers, as it expects values to rise, Mr Greg Goodman said. The company's shares rose 0.2 per cent to A$4.95 and have gained 14 per cent this year.\n\nWith a limited supply of willing sellers, only A$1.37 billion of industrial properties, including land, changed hands across Australia as of Sept 30, compared with A$3.5 billion in 2012, and A$4.3 billion in 2011, according to broker Colliers International.\n\nMany owners have refinanced debt following the financial crisis, leased up their warehouses and are reluctant to sell, Savills's Mr Hemphill said.\n\nSignalling strong investor interest in industrial properties, Fife Capital of Sydney is seeking A$129 million through an initial public offering for an Australian industrial Reit that will hold seven properties in Sydney and one in Melbourne, all fully leased.\n\nFife's fully underwritten IPO contrasts with attempted listings of property trusts with office or shopping centre assets that failed to attract enough interest this year, including Centuria Property Trust, which had one Sydney office building, and Pacific Retail Reit.\n\nFife's Reit, which will start trading on Oct 23, had an annualised yield of 8.25 per cent for the eight months to June 30 and offers 8.5 per cent for the six months to Dec 31, 2014, it said.\n\nThe Reit is a \"very good offering\", said Peter Davidson, Sydney-based head of property securities at BT Investment Management, who has an overweight rating on Goodman and Dexus Property Group, Australia's second-biggest industrial landlord. \"People are spending on the net or in malls, but the product still has to come through warehouses.\"\n\nGPT Group, which expects to meet its industrial property target of 15 per cent of assets by developing land it already owns, may still seek acquisitions for its new unlisted fund, chief executive officer Michael Cameron said.\n\nThe Sydney-based company failed this year in its attempt to acquire Australand Property Group's commercial property division, which itself planned to boost warehouses to 70 per cent of properties in five years from 50 per cent now.\n\nGPT recorded comparable income growth of 3.2 per cent in its industrial property division in the six months to June 30. That beat an increase of 1.5 per cent in its retail unit and a 0.7 per cent decline in its office business, the company said in August.\n\nGPT shares were 1.4 per cent higher at A$3.69, and have risen 0.3 per cent this year while Australand shares were up 1.4 per cent to A$3.64, extending this year's gains to 7.1 per cent.\n\nOffice vacancies jumped to 10.1 per cent as of July 1 from 8.4 per cent six months earlier, as tenant demand for space fell to the lowest level in four years, data from the Property Council of Australia showed.\n\nAt neighbourhood shopping malls - defined by the council as local centres with one supermarket and about 35 specialty stores - vacancy rates jumped to 5.8 per cent in June, from 4.6 per cent in March, according to a survey of 100 malls managed by Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nWhile industrial properties can typically be built within a year, compared with about three years for offices, a lack of available land in areas with access to infrastructure including roads, rail and ports will keep a lid on supply, said Mr Hemphill at Savills.\n\nDexus, Australia's second-largest listed warehouse developer, generates higher rents and longer leases at a 44-hectare state-of-the-art development 26 kilometres west of Sydney's centre, than at its other developments, said Mark Cuddy, head of industrial property at Sydney-based Dexus.\n\nThe average size of a property at that development is 16,206 square metres, compared with 2,428 sq m at an older industrial estate, and the average lease term is 10.5 years compared with 4.1 years across all its industrial properties as of June 30, according to Dexus.\n\n\"The location, both near large employment pools and near major infrastructure, the amount of investment tenants make into their fitouts, all add to the stickiness of the tenants,\" Mr Cuddy said. \"That makes these precincts higher-return investments.\"\n\nThe company, which completed its exit from US property in April, has said it aims to have about 20 per cent of all assets in industrial spaces. Dexus shares rose 0.5 per cent to A$1.065, extending gains this year to 4.9 per cent.\n\n\"Industrial property is the sector with the least headwinds and probably the strongest tailwinds,\" said Tony Sherlock, Sydney-based head of property research at Morningstar Australasia. \"You're going to see some quite respectable asset value growth over the next one to two years\" of as much as 4 per cent, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": []}

It will keep the government services running until Jan 15, when Republicans and Democrats will have to agree on a new tax-and-spending package. Congress will also have to vote by Feb 7 on whether to raise the debt ceiling or default on bond payments.\n\nYet, this limited deal confirms investors' belief that not even the most radical conservatives such as Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz will allow the US to default. As Thursday's deadline drew close, investors had hedged themselves against a missed payment by selling short-term Treasurys. But veteran investors such as Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund, and Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at mutual-fund firm Hodges Capital, had long dismissed as rhetoric statements by Senator Cruz and others that they would push the US into default unless President Barack Obama compromised on healthcare reform.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Sebastian Tan, of course, better known as the Broadway Beng.\n\nThe hybrid showman, like the Merlion, seems to enjoy being half and half. Half of the songs he sings in his new revue Benging You Back To Basics are Hokkien classics and the other half are Broadway standards. Half the time he's sweet-tempered and honey-voiced, and the other half he's so crude he makes you blush. He also seems to enjoy - dare I say it - being half-man and half-woman, dragging it up ever so often and belting out diva hits.\n\nIndeed, the dual persona hits a high note in one nostalgic tribute to the 70s musical Grease. Here he plays both John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John. Dressed as Newton-John on the right side of his body and Travolta on the left, he crooned Hopelessly Devoted To You with his right facing the audience, then Sandy with his left - plus excerpts of every other number from the show.

They are zoned for Business 2 use with a plot ratio of 1.4 each.\n\nBoth sites are within walking distance of Joo Koon MRT station and are served by the Ayer Rajah Expressway or Pan Island Expressway.\n\nThey are the latest industrial properties put up for sale or transacted in recent weeks. Last week, JLL put 158 Gul Circle up for sale. Industrial plots sold this month include 5 Loyang Drive and Guang Ming Industrial Building.\n\nNicholas Ng, JLL's local director of investments, cautioned against over-reading into the activity.\n\n\"Every company has different reasons for selling, it's not like the economy is doing badly,\" he said. For example, the tender for 158 Gul Circle happened because the company felt the plot was too big.\n\nThe owner of 9 Joo Koon Road decided to sell as it did not find the location suitable and had found a new space. As for 20 Joo Koon Crescent, the owner realised it did not need the asset after buying the company that previously held it.\n\nThat said, Mr Ng noted that demand has been strong when it launches sites for sale, perhaps because state tenders for industrial land have tended to be for bigger plots.\n\n\"So end users don't have the bidding power against all these big boys, they have to buy . . . through the secondary market.\"\n\nTo that end, Mr Ng sees the two Joo Koon plots as good fits for industrialists, not least for their longer leases, smaller sizes and potential for additional GFA. The two sites are currently owned by \"engineering companies\", he said.\n\nTenures for new industrial Government Land Sales sites are either at around 22 years or capped at 30 years.\n\nThe plot at 9 Joo Koon road has a balance lease of 31 years. It has a GFA of 23,266 square feet (sq ft), with potential for another 31,496 sq ft of GFA. The guide price is around $7.5 million for this 39,116 sq ft plot currently housing a single-storey standard factory with a mezzanine level.\n\nAs for 20 Joo Koon Crescent, it has a remaining lease of 43 years.

Mr Goh and Mr Lim are also directors of Orange Valley Healthcare.\n\nGK Goh, which completed its acquisition of Domain Principal through its indirect subsidiary Allium Holdings earlier this month, told BT that it went ahead with the deal because it is not a shareholder of Orange Valley, nor is it a party to the 2006 agreement containing the non-compete clause.\n\nIn addition, it said the claims relate to a dispute between some shareholders of Orange Valley Healthcare, and the dispute does not involve GK Goh.\n\n\"Prior to being notified of the dispute, GK Goh had been in negotiations to acquire the Domain Principal stake for many months, and the shareholder approvals at the EGM were the last step to completing the transaction,\" a GK Goh spokesman told BT.\n\nAfter reviewing the suit and considering legal advice, all directors of GK Goh, including the independent directors, reaffirmed that the Domain Principal purchase was in the best interests of GK Goh and its shareholders, he said.\n\n\"Since our lawyers have advised us that the case against GK Goh is without merit, postponement of the vote would not have been in the best interests of our shareholders, especially in view of the potential penalties for delay in the sale-and-purchase agreement.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking declarations from the High Court that completion of the Australian deal would be a breach of a non-compete restriction in relation to Orange Valley Healthcare.\n\nGK Goh majority shareholder GKG Investment, by publicly committing to vote in favour of the deal, and Mr Goh and Mr Lim, by recommending that shareholders vote to approve the deal, would be liable for \"the tort of procuring and/or inducing breach of contract\", they alleged.\n\nThe plaintiffs are represented by Senior Counsel Lee Eng Beng of Rajah & Tann LLP.\n\nBut GK Goh, in a statement to the Singapore Exchange, said GKG Investment had said it will \"vigorously defend the legal proceedings\", and that it will \"fully indemnify GK Goh from losses, damages and costs (if any)\" incurred in the proceedings.\n\nGK Goh funded its A$136.7 million acquisition of a 47.62 per cent stake in Domain Principal from two trusts managed by AMP Capital with existing liquid assets and bank debt. GK Goh and AMP Life, a subsidiary of wealth management company AMP Ltd, will each have equal 47.62 per cent stakes in Domain Principal. Both companies will invest a further A$25 million to finance further investment in Australia's aged-care sector.\n\n\"Demand for aged-care services will continue to rise for the next few decades in Australia. Domain Principal fits well into our portfolio of long-term investments,\" Mr Goh said.\n\nMr Goh started GK Securities in 1979 and went on to build it into one of the most respected stockbroking firms in South-east Asia before selling it in 2005 to Malaysia's top investment bank, CIMB Bhd, for $239.1 million in cash.\n\nGK Goh retained its businesses in futures and foreign exchange broking, as well as private-equity investments.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The last time the monthly data had a bigger gain was in April 2012, when it rose 82 per cent.\n\nMore apartments are being offered to capture last-minute buying demand before the government increases the rate of sales tax to 8 per cent in April 2014 to tackle the nation's swelling debt. The supply of new apartments in Tokyo this year will rise to as many as 55,000 units, the highest level since 2007, after five straight months of increase in supply, according to an estimate by the institute.\n\n\"The consumption tax rise is one of the reasons for the increase in supply,\" Akio Fukuda, a manager at the Real Estate Economic Research Institute, said at a press conference in Tokyo yesterday. \"Homebuyers are also expecting that prices will start to gain.\"\n\nAmong the developers that offered units last month was Mitsubishi Estate Co, Japan's second-largest developer. It introduced the 49-story Parkhouse Harumi Towers, where units are priced from 49.8 million yen (S$626,810) to 83.9 million yen, according to the company's website. The Tokyo-based industry researcher increased its forecast for new supply for the year by 10 per cent to 55,000 units from 50,000 units, the manager said.\n\nHomebuyers' tax exemptions will be increased to as much as four million yen per transaction for residents who are moving in from April 1, according to the National Tax Agency. That compares with a tax break of two million yen for residents who are moving in from Jan 1 this year till March 31, 2014 according to the tax agency's website.\n\n\"We expect the favourable market condition to continue because of the government's tax exemption plan,\" said Mikio Namiki, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Co in Tokyo.\n\nThe Topix Real Estate Index, a measure of 44 property-related stocks, gained 0.3 per cent at the close of trading in Tokyo. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM", "images": []}

The White House Kitchen Garden, planted with great fanfare by the First Lady and the National Park Service in April 2009, is now gangly and weedy.\n\nThe garden's unruly state was first reported by Eddie Gehman Kohan, who blogs about White House food policy and has posted day-by-day updates of the garden during the shutdown. Wild mushrooms have begun to grow, she wrote. Weeds have sprouted. Sweet potatoes are unpicked. It is not the usual state of the picture-perfect garden, which had its own spread in Better Homes and Gardens two years ago.\n\n\"National Park Service employees are only watering the kitchen garden as needed,\" Jennifer Mummart, a spokeswoman for the park service's National Capital Region said in an e-mail. \"And, yes, this is consistent with how we are caring for other managed landscapes during the shutdown.\" (Apparently, watering the garden is \"essential\", weeding is not.)\n\nThe partial government shutdown has also effectively shut down Michelle Obama's public schedule. Glimpses of the First Lady outside the White House have been rare in the past 15 days. Her team, cut to the bone along with the rest of the White House staff, has announced no events. On the residential side, the team of ushers, butlers, housekeepers, chefs and maintenance staff who care for the 132-room mansion is down from 90 to 15.\n\nAs for the White House's weedy garden, it might be a blessing in disguise, said Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University. \"It now maybe looks more like a lot of other people's gardens,\" she said. \"If the purpose is to try to get Americans to grow their own healthy food, maybe a garden that doesn't look pristine is not such a bad thing.\" - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

They are for metro lines - that is, non high-speed trains.\n\nMidas chief executive Patrick Chew said in a statement that the China wins \"underpin the railway industry's growth story, and is reflective of our continuing leadership position in the PRC\".\n\nThe Europe wins increase Midas' year-to-date orders from the international market to more than 50 million euros, he added.\n\nWith the China contracts, they are expected to contribute positively to Midas' financial performance this year through to 2017, the company said.\n\nThe contracts are for the supply of aluminium-alloy extrusion profiles and certain fabricated parts.\n\nFor the Chinese contracts, Midas will supply aluminium profiles and/or parts for the following rail projects:\n\nDelivery of profiles for the Wuxi Metro Line 2, Dongguan Rapid Railway R2 Line, Hangzhou Metro Line 2 and Nanjing-Gaochun Intercity Rail projects will take place between this year and 2016.\n\nAnalysts expect Midas to benefit from a China railway construction boom, which is coming two years after a deadly high-speed train crash in Wenzhou hurt the railway industry.\n\nThe first high-speed train car tender since then came last month, though Midas did not win anything from there.\n\nThe company was named in August as one of DMG's top 30 small-cap companies. Analyst Lynette Tan said the outlook for the industry remains positive and Midas has a market share of 66 per cent in the aluminium alloy profiles segment in China.\n\nOCBC Investment Research analyst Andy Wong, maintaining a \"buy\" call with a fair value of 65 cents in a Sept 11 note, said he expects Midas to win some high-speed contracts in the last three months of the year.\n\nThe bulk of purchases for the current Chinese five-year plan to 2015 are expected to take place next year. \"We expect order wins to be a re-rating catalyst,\" he said.\n\nMidas closed unchanged at 45 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And it's free\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Oct 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[NEW YORK] IN AN ideal world, a master class available to everyone would reveal all the secrets to retirement planning, telling you how much to save, where to invest and what to do when the stock market crashes.\n\nAfter all, there are few entirely conflict-free places where investors can educate themselves on the topic, and there's little to no money-related guidance offered within the public school system, which is where the financial groundwork should really be laid.\n\nJoshua Rauh, a finance professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, is acutely aware of that. And it's why he felt compelled to open his graduate-level course on the finance of retirement and pensions to the masses (https://novoed.com/rauh-finance).\n\n\"My goal is to try to empower people to make better decisions about their finances with an eye toward retirement and for retirees who are thinking about managing their money,\" Prof Rauh said, \"whether it is buying an annuity or having a spending rule.\" The course, which is offered free online, began on Monday. I sat for nearly half of his online video lectures - on topics like \"saving for retirement\" and \"making smart decisions as a stock market investor\" - this week. Watching remotely means you won't be party to the discussion that will emerge from the Socratic method Prof Rauh uses in his traditional classroom on campus. And there are already 13,000 students, so it's hard to expect any personal attention.\n\nBut there's plenty that students will take away from his lessons, which you can watch any time after the lecture is released, much as you might watch any series on your DVR.\n\n\"A person that would really benefit is someone who is 40 and realising they really need to start putting together a plan for retirement and haven't thought much about it,\" he said, though he says he believes that it will be equally helpful for people of all ages.\n\nThere aren't many other places to turn, particularly where it costs nothing but your time. When I informally polled financial literacy advocates, financial planners and other experts if they knew of any other comprehensive retirement courses, they couldn't come up with any, though one person mentioned the instructional videos at Khan Academy.\n\nA good place to start\n\nWithout any instruction manual, \"people have to be their own chief financial officer,\" said Annamaria Lusardi, a financial literacy advocate and economics professor at the George Washington University School of Business, who teaches a class on personal finance. \"The large majority of the population lacks the knowledge of basic but fundamental concepts, from the power of interest compounding, to the effects of inflation, to the workings of risk diversification.\"\n\nThis course may be a good place to start. Each of the 10 video lectures is about 45 minutes long, but they're broken into bite-size segments, all of which were well produced and relatively engaging. As Prof Rauh explains each concept, animated visuals and colourful graphs appear alongside him, which helps make the concepts easier to grasp.\n\nEach lecture includes a mix of financial theory and prescriptive advice, some of which people with a reasonable base of investment knowledge may already know: actively managed mutual funds aren't worth the money, so buy index funds. Don't time the market. Stocks don't become less risky the longer you hold them.\n\nBut the illustrations that accompany the advice - how retiring in 2009, for instance, would have resulted in a nest egg 28 per cent smaller than one resulting by retiring in 2012 - are instructive.\n\n\"It's not a rocket science idea, but people don't see it without having it illustrated for them,\" Prof Rauh said.\n\nAll of the lessons are rooted in what he calls \"the economist's view\" of personal finance, which is built on the idea that there are no free lunches in financial markets, and that you can generate potentially higher returns only if you take substantial risk as well. It's a message woven through his lectures. At times, it almost seems as if there should be a red blinking sign behind him that reads, \"Proceed with caution. Stocks ahead!\" He clearly wants the lesson to linger long after you leave his virtual classroom and find yourself in a commission-based stockbroker's office.\n\n\"Too often, people just budget on the basis of an 'expected return' on their assets without thinking about the range of possible outcomes,\" he explained.\n\nHe also explains why economists also believe that more people - not all, but more - should buy annuities. Not the high-priced complex contraptions sold to unwitting seniors, but the plain-vanilla immediate annuities, where you pay a giant pile of cash to an insurance company in exchange for a guaranteed stream of income for life.\n\nHe breaks all of this down in a lecture about making your money last, which offers the kind of practical advice that will be of particular interest to people in their late 50s and older who are wondering why annuities feel so expensive: As he points out, for US$100,000, a 65-year-old woman can expect to receive about US$450 a month. But he also explains another alternative that is about a tenth of the cost, known as longevity insurance. (You buy this annuity in advance and it begins paying income a decade or two later, when you're in your 80s and may have spent all of your other savings). In the same lesson, you'll be expected to sit through perhaps more than you may want to know about the inner workings of the mortality tables used to price annuities.\n\nAs Prof Rauh points out, it's a university-level class. There will be moments where you may feel a sudden urge to check your email (like when the first mathematical equation with a sigma symbol appears on the screen). Indeed, a basic understanding of statistics is helpful, and you shouldn't be easily intimidated by a simple spreadsheet.\n\nThe course ends with two lectures that explain the basics of pensions, the trouble erupting within the US public pension system and how it affects taxpayers and municipal bondholders. Students are then tasked with a pretty serious group project: analysing a state or local pension plan's solvency - whether it's the New York State Teachers' Retirement System or Calpers, the big California public pension plan - and coming up with ways to make it stronger. The five teams with the most promising ideas will get to present their proposals in January, all expenses paid, at the Stanford Graduate School of Business to a panel of faculty and experts.\n\n\"We are sitting on the likelihood that there will have to be very large tax increases to pay for public employees' pensions and that is a very important aspect of our portfolios as well - how much we will be taxed,\" said Prof Rauh, who has written several research papers analysing public pensions. That's likely to incite much debate in the forums, where most of the interaction among students will take place.\n\nAs much ground as this course covers - from asset allocation to the investing in different types of tax-deferred accounts - there's still plenty of material that needs to be explained. Should I pay for advice? If so, what sort of adviser should I work with? How do I figure out my risk tolerance for stocks? Should I take Social Security now or later? And what should I make of all of these guaranteed return products that my brother-in-law keeps talking about?\n\nAt the end of some of the lessons, you may still be left with your own questions, but that may be Prof Rauh's point: now, at least, you know what to ask.\n\n\"There is some, 'Do this, not that,' \" he said. \"But that doesn't give them the complexity to operate in life.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Easier said than done, of course, but investors need to overcome the urge to make rash decisions just because they cannot stand the antics of one side or the other. Beyond this, it makes sense, in the fog of a Washington crisis, to survey the investment environment just before we went into the fog, make some assessment of how this crisis could end, and then consider an appropriate strategy during the crisis.\n\nOn the first task, some important data releases due while the government is shut down, like last week's employment report, will very likely be postponed in the absence of a quick reopening. However, our expectations, which are based at least in part on private sector numbers or previously-released government numbers, show an economy growing at a moderate pace. Furthermore, with the global economy exhibiting quite balanced growth (according to last week's PMI data), and third-quarter S&P 500 earnings expected to set a record high, prospects for stocks looked quite promising entering the fourth quarter. And then the government shutdown ...\n\nStalemate in Congress\n\nFirst, as background for those who have not been following the saga, throughout the last two weeks there has been stalemate in Congress as the House Republicans have attached provisions to defund or delay parts of the Affordable Care Act to a continuing resolution (CR) needed to run the government. The Senate, controlled by the Democrats, have stripped these provisions from the bills. Over the weekend, Speaker of the House of Representatives\n\nJohn Boehner insisted that the problem could not be resolved without a \"conversation\" with US President Barack Obama.\n\nIn addition, Jack Lew, the Treasury Secretary, has said that the government will run out of borrowing authority on Oct 17 and could run out of cash shortly thereafter if the debt ceiling is not raised. Mr Boehner has said that the Republicans will not vote to raise the debt ceiling without negotiations on government spending. The president, meanwhile, has said that he will not negotiate with a gun to his head on either the CR or the debt ceiling.\n\nThe shutdown of the government is clearly damaging the economy, in part because of the reduction in federal dollars spent, and in much larger part, because of the uncertainty caused by the crisis in leading businesses to delay hiring and spending decisions. With each day the crisis continues, this problem will get worse.\n\nMoreover, if the government were, for example, to delay social security cheques due on Nov 1, or, worst of all, default on Treasury debt for the first time in US history by delaying interest and principal payments, the damage to the economy would be enormous.\n\nThe president is not up for re-election and is in no mood to surrender, particularly because the White House believes that this crisis is hurting the Republicans more than the Democrats. The Republicans in the House, however, are also in no mood to retreat given that most of their members are from very safe districts and given their visceral dislike of the Affordable Care Act and their desire to make the White House capitulate. It would be hard for them to back down and still save face.\n\nIn fact, the only logical way out of this impasse is to agree to a \"cooling-off period\" of a few months. Under this scenario, a clean CR would be passed and the debt ceiling would be raised for a specified period - perhaps six weeks or three months. Once this has been done, the president and Congress could begin serious talks on what is and what is not on the table in order to achieve a budget agreement and debt ceiling increase for the rest of the year and possibly beyond the next election.\n\nWhat's likely to happen?\n\nSadly, it is possible that this crisis could drag out for a few more weeks before such an agreement is reached. Both sides want to prove to their supporters that they did not blink first. Politically, the White House may believe that the longer this drags out, the more pain the American people will feel and blame on the Republicans. Some Republicans may believe that the longer it drags out, the more people will blame both sides equally for the mess.\n\nIf this does drag out, it must be said that it is still very unlikely that the US will default on its debt. Such a default could push up US borrowing costs for decades to come and could precipitate a new global financial crisis and recession. A move such as delaying social security cheques could generate much more short-term political heat with less long-term economic damage, which would make it the logical first step for the Treasury. It is also possible, that both sides will recognise the futility of the current situation this week and pass a clean, albeit temporary, CR and debt ceiling increase this week with negotiations to follow.\n\nEither way, for investors, the longer this drags out, the more damage it will do to the economy and the more it will likely delay any Fed tapering into next year, making it short-term positive for bonds and negative for equities. However, for individual investors, the great danger in any short-term move is that any agreement could cause markets to bounce in the opposite direction. Once agreement has been reached, the economy will likely lick its wounds and resume its growth path while interest rates will resume their move up from artificially low levels. Because of this, for investors, the best advice for the weeks ahead is probably to worry less about Washington and stick with their own long-term investment strategy.\n\nDr David Kelly, CFA, is managing director, chief global strategist, JP Morgan Funds\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The oil producer missed a US$44.5 million bond interest payment this month and, analysts say, risks going bankrupt within weeks.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Trafigura and investment fund Mubadala Development Co, Mr Batista's largest single creditor, will get a 65 per cent stake in MMX Porto Sudeste Ltda, a port under construction that is slated to start operating by mid-2014.\n\nMubadala, which also owns a stake in EBX, and Trafigura had entered exclusive talks for the asset with Mr Batista and the group's mining unit MMX Minera\u00e7\u00e3o e Met\u00e1licos SA last month. MMX will keep the remaining 35 per cent stake in Porto Sudeste.\n\nTrafigura and Mubadala plan to pump US$400 million into the company to finance the completion of the port and iron ore terminal and will assume 1.3 billion reais (S$739 million) of debt taken on by MMX Sudeste Minera\u00e7\u00e3o SA, a MMX unit linked to the port project, a filing said.\n\nMr Batista's EBX group was worth as much as US$60 billion at the start of last year but the value of its companies collapsed after missed production and profit targets, mounting debt and a weaker outlook for Brazil and other commodities producers.\n\nIn July, Mr Batista ceded control of power company MPX Energia SA to German utility E.ON SE. MPX has since been renamed Eneva SA. In August, he agreed to sell LLX Log\u00edstica SA to US-based investment firm EIG Global Energy Partners LLC for US$559 million.\n\nThe port, which is located in the southeastern state of Rio de Janeiro, will initially have the capacity to ship up to 50 million metric tonnes of iron ore annually.\n\nThe completion of the Porto Sudeste deal is subject to regulatory approval and the conclusion of a debt refinancing plan.\n\nTrafigura and Mubadala will also pay holders of special MMX unit shares a royalty for iron ore shipped after the port makes a profit. The unit shares, which do not convey ownership in the company, were given to holders of Mr Batista's LLX when it sold the port project to MMX in 2010. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/pain-managed-futures-gains", "site_title": "Pain of managed futures 'gains'", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nPain of managed futures 'gains'\n\nFees paid to brokers and fund managers wipe out profits and investors incur a loss instead, writes DAVID EVANS\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Oct 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[LOS ANGELES] THE pitch was enticing. At a time when the Standard & Poor's 500 Index had suffered a decline of 41 per cent in the previous three years, Morgan Stanley was offering its clients the possibility of some relief. In a prospectus, the New York securities firm invited its customers to put their money into a little-known area of alternative investing called managed futures. \"If you've never diversified your portfolio beyond stocks and bonds, you should know about the powerful argument for managed futures,\" the bank wrote. \"Managed futures may potentially profit at times when traditional markets are experiencing losses.\" Morgan Stanley presented a chart telling investors that over 23 years, people who put 10 per cent of their assets in managed futures outperformed those whose investments were limited to a combination of stocks and bonds, reports Bloomberg Markets magazine in its November issue.\n\nClients jumped in. During the decade ended in 2012, more than 30,000 investors entrusted Morgan Stanley with US$797 million in a managed-futures fund called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Spectrum Technical. The fund already had US$341.6 million invested during the previous eight years. Top fund managers speculated with that cash in a wide range of asset classes. In that period, the fund made US$490.3 million in trading gains and money-market interest income.\n\nInvestors who kept their money in Spectrum Technical for that decade, however, reaped none of those returns - not one cent. Every bit of those profits - and more - was consumed by US$498.7 million in commissions, expenses and fees paid to fund managers and Morgan Stanley.\n\nAfter all of that was deducted, investors ended up losing US$8.3 million over 10 years. Had those Morgan Stanley investors placed their money instead in a low-fee index mutual fund, such as Vanguard Group's 500 Index Fund, they would have reaped a net cumulative return of 96 per cent in the same period.\n\nIn the US$337 billion managed-futures market, return-robbing fees like those are common. According to data filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and compiled by Bloomberg, 89 per cent of the US$11.51 billion of gains in 63 managed-futures funds went to fees, commissions and expenses during the 2003-2012 decade.\n\nThe funds held US$13.65 billion of investor money at the end of last year, according to SEC filings. Twenty-nine of those funds left investors with losses.\n\nThe US$8.3 million loss in Morgan Stanley's Spectrum Technical fund over a decade pales in comparison with an aggregate deficit of US$1 billion in 29 Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc managed-futures funds in the four years ended Dec 31, the filings show. Those funds charged investors a total of US$1.5 billion in fees.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Citigroup merged their funds' management in 2009; Morgan Stanley bought out Citi's share in June.\n\n\"The big news here is, the fees are so outlandish, they can actually wipe out all the profits,\" says Bart Chilton, one of five members of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Even though the CFTC oversees managed futures, Mr Chilton says he hadn't been aware of the effects of the high costs for investors.\n\n\"We absolutely need to do a better job of letting consumers know in plain English what's going on,\" he says. \"Those numbers tell a story. It's astounding.\"\n\nThe impact of high fees on investors has escaped the notice not only of regulators, but also industry executives.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley Spectrum Technical fund was opened in 1994 under the leadership of then-chief executive officer Philip Purcell. He was succeeded in 2005 by John Mack, who had spent most of his career at Morgan Stanley. James Gorman, who replaced Mr Mack in 2009, joined Morgan Stanley from Merrill Lynch & Co in 2006.\n\nThe prospectus pitching the Spectrum fund, issued in March 2003, said the firm would accept investments as low as US$2,000 for individual retirement accounts.\n\nBrokers have an incentive to keep clients in managed- futures funds because they receive commissions annually of up to 4 per cent of assets invested, prospectuses show. Investors pay up to 9 per cent in total fees each year, including charges by general partners and fund managers.\n\nPeople put money into managed futures because their brokers recommend them, says Thomas Schneeweis, a finance professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who was a futures-fund manager from 2004 to 2010. \"Everything is marketing,\" he says.\n\nBroker pitches that don't clearly tell investors about the drastic effect of fees should be considered fraudulent, says James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nBecause the managed-futures market is opaque and poorly understood, otherwise sophisticated investors often don't realise how pervasive the profit-eating fees are. The firms marketing the funds are at times also left in the dark. The industry refers to the computers programmed with trading algorithms as black boxes. Some banks say they can't see into the boxes of the traders they hired.\n\nStrategy changes\n\n\"Particularly given the black box character of many managed-futures strategies, it is virtually impossible for the manager to detect strategy changes,\" Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch says in an August 2010 SEC registration for its Systematic Momentum FuturesAccess LLC.\n\nThe 7,752 investors in that fund faced losses of US$135.3 million, after fees, from 2009 to 2012, according to data from Merrill's SEC filings. Merrill spokesman Bill Haldin declined to comment.\n\nHigh fees and black boxes are just part of the story. Some funds also allow their managers to make undisclosed side bets by trading ahead of or opposite to the fund's trades. Chicago-based Grant Park Futures Fund LP, which is marketed by Zurich-based UBS AG, says on page 90 of a 180-page, April 2013 prospectus that David Kavanagh, president of the US$660.9 million fund's general partner, may place such personal trades. \"Mr Kavanagh may even be the other party to a trade entered into by Grant Park,\" it says.\n\nThe Grant Park Futures Fund reported a net investor loss of US$68.6 million during the decade ended Dec 31, after fees and commissions of US$427.7 million.\n\nWhen financial advisers promote managed-futures funds, they often rely on charts produced by a small company in Fairfield, Iowa, called BarclayHedge Ltd. The firm, which has no connection to London-based Barclays plc, reports a 29-fold gain through 2012 for managed futures overall since 1980. Those numbers can mislead investors.\n\nBarclayHedge does not deduct billions of dollars of fees charged by funds. It uses only information volunteered by managed-futures traders. Traders can stop providing data if their system starts to lose money or collapses, says BarclayHedge president Sol Waksman. The BarclayHedge data, even with its flaws, Mr Waksman says, is the industry benchmark. Investors need to look at more than just his index, he says. \"They've got to accept some of the blame for going into something without any knowledge,\" he says.\n\nManaged-futures funds are a subset of hedge funds. They're run by so-called commodity-trading advisers, or CTAs, who these days invest largely in financial futures. While hedge funds typically charge a 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent of investor profits each year, a managed-futures fund often takes 7 to 9 per cent of assets invested annually and 20 per cent of any profits.\n\nAsk questions before investing\n\nThe National Futures Association, a self-regulatory group, doesn't require managers to disclose the effects of fees on investor profits over time, says Mary McHenry, an associate director in the NFA's compliance department. \"We can't just give investors all the answers,\" she says. \"It's important that they ask questions before they invest.\"\n\nMs McHenry says she knows that brokers pitch managed futures as protection from stock market declines - and that fund risk disclosures say there's no correlation. Like hedge funds, managed-futures funds haven't been required to file with the SEC as a matter of course. However, an SEC rule has mandated that any partnership with more than 500 investors and US$10 million in assets - even a hedge fund - must file quarterly and annual reports.\n\nThe SEC has no category listing managed-futures funds, as it does for mutual funds or corporate filings. Bloomberg Markets culled through thousands of filings in several categories, including one called \"SIC 6221 Unknown,\" to identify 63 managed- futures funds that reported to the SEC.\n\nEven the managed-futures funds that file with the SEC don't have any obligation to disclose how fees in recent years ate up all trading gains.\n\nThe Grant Park Futures Fund filed a prospectus in April to raise US$927 million from investors. Although it included the boilerplate language saying substantial fees could offset trading profits, the document doesn't say that the US$25.6 million the fund had gained since 2009 was obliterated by fees. Investors suffered a US$223.6 million loss over that period.\n\nKen Steben, who runs a fund, says managed futures can be confusing to both investors and advisers.\n\nKeith Stafford, an accountant who specialises in auditing hedge-fund and managed-futures data, says he and his colleagues are constantly amazed by the poor performance of managed futures for individual investors.\n\n\"We look at each other all the time and say, 'Why would anyone invest in this?'\" says Mr Stafford, the member in charge of performance analysis at Arthur Bell, Certified Public Accountants, based in Hunt Valley, Maryland. \"It's a racket.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Another popular European brand, Volkswagen, is run by the manufacturer itself as a direct dealership.\n\nBut why would anyone here want to take on a new brand during such tough times?\n\nSingapore's car market has been languishing since 2009 when the government began cutting the certificate of entitlement (COE) quota sharply.\n\nLast year, 27,899 new cars were registered, and this year's total market is set to be even smaller - up to 15 per cent smaller. The last time annual new car sales have been this low was in the mid-1990s.\n\nAs car sales plummet, so have car dealers' profits, and many have downsized their operations while some have even closed shop.\n\nThe source explained: \"The brands in question have a lot of potential growth, and if those who take over can hang on long enough, they should be able to see the rewards.\"\n\nHe added that many people who run dealerships are \"driven by passion and commitment because of the brand heritage\".\n\n\"Of course, it is wonderful to make money, but some of these brands are really special, and representing them is a privilege,\" he said. \"And who knows? Maybe Singapore's transport policy will change for the better.\"\n\nHe said that with a larger number of COEs expected to come onstream in a few years' time, things should brighten up for the motor industry.\n\nThe managing director of a luxury dealership agreed.\n\n\"It is hard to predict government policy but I believe it will change, although not so soon,\" he said. \"Anyway, many dealers and consumers expect the COE supply to increase in the latter half of 2015 and 2016, based on the likely increase in vehicle deregistrations.\"\n\nAs for brands changing hands, he said that it is only during \"bad times\" that there is \"an opportunity\" to grab a new franchise.\n\n\"A downturn causes the industry to go through significant changes because some companies won't be able to ride it out,\" said the managing director.\n\n\"It is especially tough for those companies that sell only one brand, especially if it is a second- or third- tier brand.\"\n\nHe explained that multi- brand franchises are bigger, with economies of scale in terms of staff and showroom space.\n\n\"And it's not even necessary to have particularly deep pockets because during bad times, you don't have to do much or invest a lot. No one really expects you to sell that many cars during this period.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They were found to have engaged in bribery, bid-rigging, fraud and other wrongdoing related to World Bank-funded projects.\n\nFreshfields Bruckhaus Deringer's publication, The War On Corruption, a compilation and analysis of this year's debarments, said: \"The World Bank is fighting back.\"\n\nThe international law firm noted that as much as US$40 billion worth of aid is estimated to have been stolen from some of the poorest nations in the world in the last seven years.\n\nThe World Bank has invested over US$200 billion to finance projects in developing countries around the world over the past five years. In that time, it concluded more than 600 investigations into suspected fraud, corruption and other misconduct.\n\nTim Coleman, Freshfields' Global Investigations partner in Washington, said: \"The World Bank means business. Its ramping up of activity levels in 2013 is a clear signal that it will not tolerate corruption or fraud affecting its programmes.\"\n\nFreshfields' report named North America as the region with the highest number of blacklisted entities, followed by Latin America and the Caribbean, then Europe and Central Asia.\n\nBy country, Canada topped the list with 119 debarments. The United States was next with 46.\n\nIndonesia - the only Asian nation in the list of top offenders - came third with 43 entities debarred, followed by the United Kingdom with 40.\n\nData from the World Bank website noted that within Asia-Pacific, China had 18 debarments, India and Vietnam had nine each, while Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand had four each. Australia had three entities debarred, and Japan and Korea, two each.\n\nJane Jenkins, Freshfields' Global Investigations partner in London, noted the impact of such debarments: \"Major contractors implicated in such activities can suffer severe reputational damage and stand to lose large contracts as well as the ability to bid for future ones for years to come.\"\n\nHowever, the Bank introduced a mechanism for negotiated resolutions in 2010, and since then, has announced settlements with several major corporate groups. These settlements are similar to deferred prosecution agreements employed by regulators in the US and elsewhere.\n\nTypically, they include a term of debarment, cooperation obligations and monitoring of compliance.\n\nCanada's biggest engineering group, SNC Lavalin, is party to one of the largest corporate settlements.\n\nThe World Bank had debarred the multinational company and more than 100 of its affiliates for a span of 10 years from April, for misconduct in relation to Padma Bridge, a US$3 billion road-rail bridge project in Bangladesh; the project had been mired in corruption allegations.\n\nThe World Bank Sanctions Board began publishing some of its decisions in mid-2012, which Freshfields said could give an idea of the outcome of future cases.\n\nFor example, in most cases, entities are debarred for three years, and settlements tend to be in the range of 2-3 years.\n\nLooking ahead, the Freshfields report said it expected the Bank's activity in the use of debarments and other sanctions to increase \"as it seeks to put a stop to the misappropriation of its resources and the resulting weakening of its programmes\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This old joke, provoked by the 1974 prize that went to ideological antagonists Friedrich August von Hayek and Gunnar Myrdal, is proving relevant again. Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller all worked on financial markets efficiency and drew separate, if not opposing, conclusions. This is a welcome reminder that the dismal science has few absolute truths to offer - mostly questions to explore.\n\nHansen's merits are methodological. His key innovation, the Generalised Method of Moments (GMM), is a popular econometric technique with applications in micro and macro-economics, used to uncover relationships between variables in uncertain, complex economic environments - such as asset markets.\n\nUnlike Hansen, Fama and Shiller are mostly known for the conclusions they - or often, others - draw from their academic work. Fama is one of the founding fathers of the \"efficient market hypothesis\", which roughly holds that financial markets always send the right price signals. Shiller, on the other hand, seems to have spent decades debunking the EMH, collecting empirical evidence that markets are prone to bubbles and irrational exuberance.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Last week the Global Shippers' Forum (GSF) officially raised its concerns over the proposed P3 Global Alliance among Maersk Line, CMA-CGM and Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) by submitting detailed questions to the European Commission Competition Directorate in Brussels.\n\nAt the same time Drewry Maritime's latest Container Market Annual Review and Forecast 2013/14 highlights the fact that while there is a good deal of excessive market behaviour resulting in weak freight rates, ocean carriers are \"getting half of it right\". The half Drewry believes the lines are getting right is cutting costs.\n\nThe shippers believe, rightly, that consolidation of services will tend to restrict capacity and that will consequently put upward pressure on freight rates. Drewry's review is the latest in a long succession of industry reports that essentially point out that it is almost impossible to make long-term profits that reflect the level of investment required.\n\nAll this is depressingly familiar. What is happening now is quite simple. We are paying for the abolition of the tried and tested conference system.\n\nMore or less at the same time as container ships replaced general cargo vessels the liner shipping conference system started a gradual slide to oblivion.\n\nThe conference system is largely remembered for its complex tariffs which were primarily based on the value of cargo and its strict imposition of freight rates, including the loyalty discounts which kept shippers from using non-conference lines.\n\nDespite the elaborate pricing structures of the many conferences, the system was not primarily about price but supply. From an early stage following the introduction of steamships it became clear that regular liner services and unregulated competition were incompatible concepts. Unrestricted competition would always lead to oversupply which would keep prices low and prevent companies from making sustained profits at levels sufficient to justify continued investment. The key element in conferences was the agreement of member lines to limit the number of vessels each put on a particular trade.\n\nBetter option\n\nThe conference system had its flaws but it served global trade well for over a hundred years. Can the same be said of the current free-for-all? Clearly the answer is \"no\".\n\n\"Sustainable\" is today's politically correct buzzword. The current situation in the liner trades is not sustainable. In the long term there will be much more consolidation or alliances will be operated in a way that puts a sufficient brake on over-ordering of tonnage.\n\nSo either container shipping will increasingly be dominated by monopolies or the alliances will become the liner conferences of the 21st century, ensuring a \"sustainable\" balance between demand and supply.\n\nAn effective system of alliances would be the better option. Shippers, though, will bristle at this.\n\nLast week GSF secretary-general Chris Welsh said: \"We have raised these questions with the European competition authorities on behalf of shippers from all over the world because they are rightly concerned about the market impact of the P3. The question on every shipper's mind is: 'What will be the impact on my rates and the quality of services'.\"\n\nGSF describes the proposed P3 Global Alliance as a recognised industry \"game-changer\" that will fundamentally change the structure and competitive state of the global container shipping market.\n\nMr Welsh continued: \"Shippers are rightly worried about the potential of the P3 to eliminate effective competition in the world's main liner trades. We therefore need an in-depth assessment of the P3. That's why we are asking the European Commission to provide us with the essential details of the P3 and to confirm whether they have started a formal investigation or intend to do so. We need information and answers so that the GSF is in the position to protect the commercial interests of shippers internationally.\"\n\nHe added that GSF members will be bringing P3 to the attention of national competition authorities worldwide, and especially in Asia and in the US where the Federal Maritime Commission \"is uniquely positioned to assess the potential competitive impacts of this never-before-seen aggregation of market share\".\n\nIt remains to be seen whether P3 can overcome shipper hostility. I wouldn't put my money on it.\n\nThe half of the Drewry report that is bad news for container shipping lines is that over-tonnaging is still the big problem. The introduction of the new ultra large ships on the main East-West routes has actually eased oversupply there but made the situation worse on North-South trades as tonnage has been redeployed.\n\nIn the red\n\nDrewry predicts global fleet growth next year of 7.4 per cent , \"which will continue to challenge carriers' stability\".\n\nSignificantly, Drewry believes that the formation of the P3 alliance is \"one way of stabilising operational supply, but much more work is needed\".\n\nNeil Dekker, Drewry's head of container research, stated: \"Pouring too much capacity into the system means that at some stage it will overflow and we would argue that this has already happened to some extent. Although 2013 will turn out to be an OK year for the industry and the main stakeholders should make a small profit, many carriers will still be in the red.\"\n\nAn industry with some players just keeping their heads above water and many others slowly drowning is an industry ripe for consolidation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A number of ad hoc investor-state disputes seated in Singapore have also taken place.\n\nAs at June 30, four cases involving South and East Asian governments have been registered with ICSID, Chong Yee Leong, a partner with Allen & Gledhill LLP noted. That compares with five cases each in 2011 and 2012, and just one or two cases annually from 2000 through 2010, he said, citing data from ICSID, which was established under the auspices of the World Bank.\n\n\"As more of the ICSID cases involved South and East Asian governments, it is only natural and appropriate that the seat of the investment arbitration should be in South and East Asia,\" Mr Chong explained.\n\nHe added that Singapore was considered a natural seat, given its reputation as a preferred choice for international commercial arbitration in Asia in the past decade. The SIAC handled 235 new cases last year, up from 188 in 2011. The total sum in dispute for new cases also hit a new high of $3.61 billion in 2012 - almost three times the previous year's $1.32 billion.\n\nThe SIAC, which is handling more than 600 active cases, has been involved in arbitrations involving state parties, but to date hasn't been called upon to act as the administering institution in an investment arbitration. But the SIAC is able to administer any investment arbitration arising under the 2009 Asean Comprehensive Investment Agreement.\n\nThe very factors that made Singapore a pre-eminent commercial arbitration hub also make it an ideal choice as a seat for ad hoc investment arbitrations or a venue for such disputes administered by ICSID.\n\nIn the Philip Morris Asia case, the company pointed out that since 2004, arbitration judges have been \"specifically designated in the Singapore High Court to deal with any applications under the International Arbitration Act (IAA) and that the quality of jurisprudence which emanates from those three judges (from the Court of Appeal) is of the highest order.\"\n\nIt described Singapore as a \"modern and cost-efficient arbitration centre, with the costs of hotel accommodation and other facilities lower than in London\". Furthermore, Singapore is more convenient for the parties to travel to since Philip Morris Asia is based in Hong Kong, its executives are in Australia, and most of its counsel are based in either Australia or New Zealand (with some lawyers here at Maxwell Chambers). A number of its witnesses are also based in the Asia-Pacific region, it said.\n\nThe case, which is still ongoing, will set a landmark precedent on whether a state can demand plain packaging for cigarettes, said Michael Pryles, a former SIAC chairman and who has sat on several investor-state disputes as arbitrator.\n\nRecent Singapore court decisions on applications by parties for relief under the IAA also illustrate the judiciary's strong support for international arbitration, party autonomy and the finality of arbitral awards.\n\nRecently, an Ernst & Young partner in Singapore was compelled by the High Court to produce documents for investment arbitration proceedings between the Lao government and two casino investors over US$23.8 million in taxes they were forced to pay allegedly because of an improperly conducted audit.\n\n\"This decision is illustrative of the judicial support of arbitration, and further endorses Singapore as an ideal forum for international investment arbitrations,\" said Koh Swee Yen, partner of WongPartnership, who represents the two casino investors.\n\nAs for the economic impact, Mr Bull said that arbitration cases tend to involve a significant number of lawyers and many days of hearing. \"This translates into more expenditure in Singapore, as lawyers, arbitrators and witnesses spend time here, using legal and other services based here. Singapore law firms will also benefit in that they will have more opportunities to do complex and interesting work.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even so, the question of compensation for the telco's corporate customers, which include banks and other large businesses, remains an open one.\n\nOn the residential end, all 60,000 of SingTel's affected broadband customers will get three months' worth of free speed boost, the telco said yesterday. At the same time, the 44,000 affected mio TV customers will have a whole month of free channel surfing across all of the pay-TV service's channels. The affected customers on the telco's fixed copper line network, who may also be SingTel's fibre customers, will have a month of free local calls for their troubles.\n\nAll the affected residential customers will be contacted within the next two weeks. The other shoe - what the telco will do about its corporate customers who experienced service outages last week - has yet to drop.\n\n\"For business customers, we will be contacting them individually to better appreciate how they were affected and address their needs separately,\" said Yuen Kuan Moon, SingTel's CEO Consumer Singapore. Asked about the possibility of compensation for its corporate customers, Mr Yuen said: \"We will have to go back and look at our service agreement.\"\n\nIn response to SingTel, a StarHub spokeswoman said yesterday: \"As a corporate customer of SingTel, we look forward to such a discussion with them. . . The service disruption caused by the fire at SingTel's exchange has inconvenienced our customers.\" StarHub itself is due to make it up to its own customers with a \"gesture of goodwill and appreciation\", and will provide details soon.\n\nLast Wednesday, the fire that started inside one of the fibre chambers in SingTel's exchange burnt 149 fibre cables which then disrupted services for homes and key businesses. About two-thirds of the burnt fibre cables had belonged to OpenNet, which also meant disruptions for customers of StarHub and M1.\n\nAlready, DBS Bank, which was affected by service disruptions last Wednesday, is working with the telco to find out why the network contingency plan had not worked for some of its branches. As SingTel convenes an internal inquiry panel that will report to the group's board, additional costs are bound to follow, from the implementation of more measures to avoid a similar event, to the possibility of a fine by the regulator. Already, the telco is considering adding more fire-suppression systems and installing more spare fibre.\n\nEven as the costs mount, the telco's sheer size will help it shrug off the financial fallout. SingTel said that the fire and service disruptions will not have a material impact on its earnings. \"A tsunami could wash over Singapore, and SingTel wouldn't feel a thing,\" an analyst told The Business Times yesterday. Another analyst said that the impact of giving affected customers free services will be negligible. \"A free month here, a free month there, that's not going to change anything financially,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, complaints from pockets of customers persisted, even though the fibre strands had been reconnected last week. Yesterday evening, M1 estimated that about 300 of its fibre customers were still affected. \"While OpenNet informed us on last Friday morning that all affected fibres have been re-connected, some of the connections are still not working as intended,\" said an M1 spokeswoman. On StarHub's end yesterday afternoon, about 500 of its fibre broadband customers continued to have problems with their service. While the fibre cables might have been fixed, the resumption of service might be held up by hardware on the customers' end, according to SingTel's Mr Yuen.\n\nCompounding matters, while SingTel has \"visibility\" on its own customers, it says it does not have the same access to other service providers' customers. \"I do not have the visibility of their network. It's their customers. They have their own electronics...(If) they...tell us that this is not working, we can troubleshoot with them,\" Mr Yuen said. According to him, while the core network had been robust, it was the last-mile connection - the infrastructure coming out of the fibre chamber - that had been impacted by the fire. Replicating this last-mile connection entirely, Mr Yuen said, is not feasible. \"It's tantamount to having two stacks of water pipes from your home from two different sources,\" he said.\n\nYesterday, the Infocomm Devlopment Authority of Singapore urged operators to cooperate and step up efforts for service restoration.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What it doesn't have is the US paperwork needed to sell the plane.\n\nThe partial government shutdown entering its 11th day last Friday is keeping the purchasers from closing a deal with Rome-based Eni valued at about US$5 million, said Bob Nygren, a founder of aircraft broker AeroSmith Penny in Houston. Eni has stashed the twin-engine Falcon at a suburban Dallas airport.\n\nExecutive jets aren't the only ones being sidelined. Hundreds of sales from vendors as varied as Airbus SAS and individuals are stalled as the Federal Aviation Administration's aircraft-registration office remains shuttered. Titles for US$2.5 billion of jetliners, small planes and helicopters may be in limbo if the shutdown continues.\n\n\"This is a mess,\" said William King, a vice-president at Cirrus Aircraft, which installs parachutes on its planes so they float to the ground in an engine failure. \"Even if they settle this out quickly in the next 10 days, we could still be in a position of not meeting our delivery numbers by Jan 1.\"\n\nThe snags are part of the economic ripple effects from the first government shutdown in 17 years. Five US senators urged FAA administrator Michael Huerta in a letter last week to reopen the Oklahoma City-based registry because it's \"inflicting unnecessary hardship on aviation industries\".\n\nNone of the about 800 officials now being recalled to ensure air safety will be assigned to the registry, according to the FAA. During the shutdown, US law prohibits the FAA from running the registry and other operations that aren't protecting \"life and property\", the agency said in a statement last week.\n\nTitle work for planes of all sizes flows through the office, which is tucked within a sprawling FAA campus and usually operates \"locked down like Fort Knox\", said Clay Healey, owner of AIC Title Service in Oklahoma City, referring to the US gold reserves stored in Kentucky.\n\nSeated at rows of desks in a documents room, title-company workers download aircraft information unavailable outside the registry's walls, Mr Healey said in an interview. A bank-teller-type window allows users to slide in paperwork for time-stamping by an FAA official, he said.\n\nWithout the FAA's permission, US$514 million of Europe-built jets from Airbus can't be brought into the US for carriers including US Airways Group Inc and AMR's American Airlines.\n\n\"This is a very unfortunate situation,\" Maryanne Greczyn, a US spokeswoman for Toulouse, France-based Airbus, said by email. \"We are hopeful for a rapid-as-possible solution.\"\n\nMore than 30 companies, including Airbus, Boeing and units of General Electric and Bank of America, sent a letter last Friday to Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx, requesting the registry be reopened on security concerns. The FAA, among other things, provides the Transportation Security Administration and law enforcement agencies with aircraft-related information, they said in the letter.\n\nThe companies also said they're concerned that the increase in an already large backlog for new registration applications, combined with the expiry of temporary authorisations, will cause \"enormous delivery delays\".\n\nAt least two planes from Canada's Bombardier with a list value of about US$75 million, one of them for Delta Air Lines, are also in limbo, and Brazil's Embraer said this week that its US regional-jet deliveries may be affected \"in the coming weeks\" if FAA offices stay shuttered.\n\nBoeing has been making deliveries to US customers that submitted registry paperwork before the shutdown and to international airlines that list planes with regulators in their home markets, said Doug Alder, a spokesman for the Chicago-based planemaker.

That compares with a 3.5 per cent average gain in overall Chinese notes in the greenback and 1.2 per cent for debt in the currency globally, according to BofA indexes.\n\nHome sales in China have increased as the economy shows signs of a rebound and the government refrains from adding to market cooling measures. Country Garden Holdings, controlled by Yang Huiyan, the nation's richest woman, said last week it had already exceeded its 2013 property sales target by the end of September. Premier Li Keqiang plans to build homes as an estimated 260 million migrant workers need to move into cities to meet demand for labour.\n\n\"With almost half of China's population still living in rural areas, housing demand will rise as the nation continues its urbanisation,\" said Ken Hu at BOCHK Asset Management in Hong Kong, a unit of China's fourth-largest lender. \"Developers are getting lower profit margins but turnover has increased, which is positive for bondholders. We prefer those with strong cash flows and continue to buy property bonds on a selective basis.\"\n\nNew home sales in Beijing almost doubled in the first six days of the National Day holidays from a year earlier, while business in Shanghai increased as well, China Securities Journal reported on Oct 8. Average daily transaction volumes in the Oct 1-7 period surged 50 per cent in 12 of 32 major cities monitored by Soufun Holdings, owner of the country's biggest real estate website.\n\n\"On average, companies in the sector have achieved 70 to 80 per cent of their full-year targets,\" said Manjesh Verma at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities in Hong Kong. \"Over the next month or so, the bonds will hold up well, given sales have been pretty strong for a majority of developers in the year to date.\"\n\nBOCHK's RMB High Yield Bond Fund, all of whose top 10 holdings were Chinese property developers as of the end of September, has put 5.7 per cent of its money in Shanghai-based developer CIFI Holdings Group's 12.25 per cent five-year dollar notes. The fund has invested another 5.5 per cent in Kaisa Group's 12.875 per cent US currency-denominated debt maturing in 2017.\n\nThe yield on Kaisa securities due 2017 has fallen 383 basis points to 8.92 per cent on Oct 11 since reaching a record 12.75 per cent in November 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate on CIFI's debt was 9.94 per cent, compared with an all-time high of 12.25 per cent.\n\nThe rally may halt in the short term as the government is likely to roll out measures to cool the property market when Communist Party leaders meet in November to set economic policy for the coming years, according to Eric Liu at Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore. \"There could be measures to cut speculative demand, for example mortgage and housing price restrictions, particularly in cities with high property price appreciation,\" said Mr Liu. \"I see property taxes being implemented in cities beyond Chongqing and Shanghai.\"\n\nIncreased supply of property bonds will also limit gains, Mr Liu said. Franshion Properties (China) sold US$300 million of five-year dollar bonds at 5.375 per cent on Oct 9, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Greenland Hong Kong Holdings raised US$700 million from a three-year bond sale priced at 4.75 per cent on Oct 10, while China Taiping Insurance Group (HK) Co and Wynn Macau sold a combined US$1 billion of debt.\n\n\"Issuers would rather lock in a relatively lower rate now instead of waiting for later,\" said Mr Verma at Mitsubishi UFJ. \"Demand is still strong for sector names due to robust sales reported by a majority of developers, and their adequate liquidity levels.\"\n\nThe average yield on Chinese dollar debt has dropped 55 basis points to 5.78 per cent on Oct 11 from the end of June, BofA Merrill Lynch indexes showed. The yield on China's 10-year government bonds climbed 51 basis points to 4.03 per cent in the same period, according to Chinabond data.

Thus, given our weaker earnings outlook on the counter, we think the cut in payouts could remain,\" said OSK DMG, which lowered its target price from $4 to $3.60.\n\nOCBC Investment Research, however, in its report on SPH, said it sees SPH management's twin initiatives for growth and cost savings to be key positives and would look for execution and preliminary results over the first half of the new financial year. It set a fair value of $4.14 for the stock.\n\nOn the external front, the main issue confronting markets is that US lawmakers have not been able to reach a compromise on a federal budget and the raising of the government's borrowing ceiling to enable the Treasury to pay its bills.\n\nIn its Global Daily Insight yesterday, ABN Amro said it believes a deal will be struck between the GOP and Democrats at the eleventh hour but added that any Senate deal would need to be approved in the House of Representatives, where it will most likely arrive not far before the Oct 17 deadline.\n\n\"Although the dynamics of the debt ceiling debate have changed considerably over the weekend, it is clearly positive that both parties are still trying to find a way out off the fiscal impasse,\" said the bank.\n\n\"As such, we think that markets will hold their nerves (on Monday). That said, the Oct 17 deadline is nearing and we increasingly would expect to see more financial market unrest if no deal is in place just before or after that date.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Though a seasonal pickup was expected, analysts had expected inflation to remain under 3 per cent.\n\nThe NBS said a sharp rise in food prices was mostly responsible for the unexpected spike due to a major typhoon which hit the eastern and southern coasts last month. China was also on holiday in late September and for one week in October, generally a time when price pressures increase.\n\nFood prices in September jumped 6.1 per cent year on year, accelerating from the 4.7 per cent rise in August. Fresh vegetable prices rose 18.9 per cent in the month.\n\n\"The higher consumer price data may have been due to a (temporary) food supply shock,\" said Tim Condon, economist at ING. \"But there is nothing from this data that suggests a policy response is needed.\"\n\nAnalysts don't expect any policy action unless inflationary pressures continue. China's economy has just bottomed out after growth fell to 7.5 per cent last quarter. Though it is showing some signs of recovery after the government implemented a small stimulus over the summer, the rebound remains uncertain.\n\nAugust economic data was mostly positive but the HSBC PMI in October was substantially lower than expected and exports published over the weekend fell, questioning the strength of the recovery in China and overseas.\n\nAnalysts say a high inflation rate could limit more measures to support future growth as September's CPI is just above the 3 per cent guideline rate set by the central bank for deposits meaning that lowering interest rates further would harm savings.\n\n\"Even though CPI inflation could trend up further for the remainder of this year, overall inflation pressures will likely remain modest. Relatively accommodative monetary conditions are expected to stay in place,\" Qu Hongbin, economist with HSBC, said.\n\nLooking forward, analysts say CPI should stay below the government target of 3.5 per cent as factories continue to destock and PPI remains weak, limiting upstream price pressures.\n\nProducer price deflation, prices at factory gates, continued to decrease: -1.6 per cent in August to -1.3 per cent in September, as domestic demand shows signs of strengthening, albeit slowly.\n\nThe PPI figure \"shows that market demand is becoming more active and the macro economy is stabilising and rebounding\", National Bureau of Statistics analyst Yu Qiumei said in a statement. But analysts estimate PPI to remain in negative territory through the rest of the year as domestic demand has yet to pick up substantially. The government is scheduled to release GDP growth for the third quarter on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Their investments crept up from US$24.21 billion in 2011 to US$26.24 billion in 2012, behind those of Japan (US$308.25 billion) and Australia (US$42.69 billion), among the Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nAnd Singapore's investments in the US stayed profitable, yielding returns of US$1.16 billion in 2011 and US$0.74 billion in 2012.\n\nGlobally, US direct investments increased from US$4,084.66 billion in 2011 to US$4,453.31 billion last year - with Europe (US$2,477.04 billion) accounting for over half of the investments. The single largest US investment was in the Netherlands (US$645.09 billion).\n\nLatin America and other countries in the Western Hemisphere (US$869.27 billion), such as Barbados and the Dominican Republic, have the second biggest chunk of the US investments by region. The Asia-Pacific region (US$651.31 billion) accounted for the third biggest share.\n\nUntil two years ago, the US MNCs' biggest investment in the Asia-Pacific region was in Australia (US$137.26 billion), followed by Japan (US$126.03 billion) and then, Singapore. US investment in Australia fell to US$132.83 billion in 2012, bringing it below Japan with US$133.97 billion.\n\nA big chunk (US$79.18 billion) of the US investments here, however, were in holding companies, compared with US$39.16 billion for Australia. The bulk of US investments (US$78.66 billion) in Japan were sunk in the finance and insurance industries, excluding banks.\n\nUS direct investments in China rose from US$54.07 billion in 2009 to US$58.99 billion in 2010. But they then fell to US$55.30 billion in 2011 and US$51.36 billion last year.\n\nUS MNCs' global income slipped from US$456.52 billion in 2011 to US$448.88 billion in 2011.

Nam Cheong expects to use the premises for its corporate office in Singapore, after existing leases at the three lots expire between Sept 14 next year and Jan 15 in 2016.\n\nThe consideration of $30.3 million accounted for the current market conditions, location of the premises and property prices in the surrounding area, Nam Cheong said. No valuation report was commissioned for the acquisition.\n\nNam Cheong Offshore has paid the option cost of about $303,000 and is expected to exercise it by paying a deposit of $2.7 million by 4pm on Friday. These two payments work out to 10 per cent of the purchase price of the property, with the remaining 90 per cent to be paid within 10 weeks of exercising the option.\n\nThe acquisition will be funded through internal resources, and is not expected to have any material impact on the consolidated net tangible assets and earnings per share of the company for the current financial year ending Dec 31.\n\nShares in Nam Cheong closed 1.8 per cent higher yesterday at 28.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Newer models from Boeing and others that Airbus itself is building mean the economics of the A380 need further improvement, Tom Williams, Airbus executive vice-president for programmes, said in June.\n\nSales will pick up because there is a strong trend for ever larger aircraft, particularly in Asian countries and markets in the Middle East, Mr Enders later said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. \"There's quite a lot of potential,\" he said.\n\nThe size of the aircraft, which carries up to 525 passengers, means carriers have to push harder to make flights profitable, Mr Williams had said. The A380, with an average list price of US$403.9 million, is powered either by Rolls-Royce Holdings turbines or ones built by a joint venture between General Electric and United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney.\n\nAirbus, the world's second-largest planemaker, surpassed its 1,000-order annual sales target with three months to spare. The company won 1,112 orders in the first nine months before cancellations after securing deals for 170 planes in September alone. Boeing said on Oct 3 that it had booked 1,023 gross orders.\n\nThe European planemaker has exceeded 1,000 orders only four times in its history, setting a record total in 2011, when it secured 1,608 gross sales.\n\nEADS booked 820 million euros (S$1.39 billion) in charges last year, with the wing-rib fixes on the A380 consuming 522 million euros. The planemaker struggled for orders for its flagship model last year after cracks appeared in wing components.\n\nThe A380, which entered service in October 2007 through Singapore Airlines, also suffered a blow in 2010 following an engine explosion on a Qantas Airways superjumbo. The Sydney-based carrier grounded its fleet of A380s for more than three weeks following the accident.

Within weeks of moving in, he got a bid that topped the \u00a31.75 million (S$3.5 million) the property cost.\n\n\"Somebody called offering a significantly higher sum,\" said Mr Hudson, a 55-year-old manager at a publishing company, who in August swapped his home in Clapham, a London district favoured by young bankers and lawyers, for Dorset, the farm-dotted county 202 kilometres south-west of London that was the setting for Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles. \"It looks like we caught it just at the right time,\" he said.\n\nCountry homes are coming back into fashion, after lagging behind urban locations such as London's West End since the 2007 financial crisis when banks cut off mortgages. Prices for manor houses, farmhouses and cottages valued at more than \u00a3750,000 climbed at the fastest rate in more than three years in the third quarter, Knight Frank said in a report yesterday, as Prime Minister David Cameron makes reviving the housing market central to his efforts to pull the economy out of recession.\n\n\"It's UK economic growth and broader housing market confidence,\" said Liam Bailey, global head of residential research at the London-based property broker.\n\nThe government last week introduced the second phase of its Help to Buy programme, which offers mortgage guarantees that allow purchases with down payments as low as 5 per cent. The first phase, which began in April, provided interest-free loans for buyers of newly built homes. The programme has contributed to the strongest housing market since the financial crisis, even as two thirds of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg described it as \"bad\" policy.\n\n\"Help to Buy has obviously been a catalyst that has encouraged people,\" Mr Bailey said. \"It's stimulated appetite to get into the market and that's not only the lower-end first-time buyers - it's right through into the prime sector.\"\n\nIn July, homebuyers took out 3,900 loans of \u00a3500,000 or more, the most since September 2007, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. There's also more willingness to lend at higher loan-to-value ratios, according to Henry Knight, managing director at mortgage broker Springtide Capital.\n\nTwo years ago, Barclays unit Woolwich, Nationwide Building Society and Lloyds Banking Group's Halifax \"stopped agreeing mortgages for more than about \u00a31 million, but now they've moved up to \u00a32 million and some have gone to \u00a33 million,\" Mr Knight said. \"There are just more lenders playing in that market now.\"\n\nKnight Frank's prime country-house index, based on data from the firm's UK branches, shows that prices rose 0.8 per cent in the third quarter from the previous three months. Gains were led by Virginia Water, Berkhamsted and Cobham, just outside London. Prices climbed 0.4 per cent on an annual basis.\n\nThe measure includes manor houses, defined by Knight Frank as a large property standing in extensive grounds; farmhouses, which typically have six bedrooms and several acres of land including garden, paddock and barns; and cottages, which normally have four bedrooms and about an acre of land.\n\nWhile demand for properties within commuting distance of London was strongest, prime country homes in every region of England climbed for the first time in two-and-a-half years during the quarter, according to a reported published by Savills plc last week.\n\n\"This is your last chance to buy before stock goes down and prices really start to rise,\" Yolande Barnes, director of residential research at the London-based broker, said.\n\nCurrent offerings from Savills include Park Place, an eight-bedroom period house on the edge of Windsor Great Park with cottages and stables on about 15 acres. The property, about an hour's walk from Queen Elizabeth II's Windsor Castle and close to English private school Eton College, is priced at \u00a320 million.\n\nSavills, along with Hamptons International, is also selling Bayfields Farm, a country house in Hampshire, about 48 km from Highclere Castle, where TV show Downton Abbey is filmed, for \u00a32 million.\n\nThe value of UK luxury homes had plunged in the wake of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings and the ensuing credit freeze and recession. Average prices of homes in London's most expensive neighbourhoods fell 25 per cent in 2008, while those in the countryside fell 20 per cent, Knight Frank's Mr Bailey said.\n\nMortgages of more than \u00a3500,000 to home buyers dropped by almost 50 per cent between 2007 and 2008, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.\n\nLondon's property market began to recover in 2009, in part because of affluent foreigners seeking a haven from turmoil in the Middle East and the wider European debt crisis.\n\nThese buyers, attracted by mansions a short walk from Harrods and Buckingham Palace, helped push the price of luxury homes in central London up 23 per cent since their last peak in Autumn 2007. Prices of prime country homes remain down 20 per cent, according to Knight Frank.\n\nNow the recovery is spreading beyond London. The number of homes sold in the UK reached the most in nearly four years in July, according to the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. That helped push the value of prime country homes up for the third consecutive quarter, Knight Frank said.\n\nHouse prices in affluent areas about an hour from London climbed 1.6 per cent during the three months, while those in the remainder of the south of England climbed 1.2 per cent, according to Savills.\n\nUK's homebuilders have been among the biggest beneficiaries of revived housing demand, with an index of the companies gaining 47 per cent this year, compared with the 10 per cent advance for the FTSE 100 Index. Persimmon plc, the largest UK builder by market value, rose the most in almost two months on Oct 9 after Goldman Sachs Group said the stock may increase by 70 per cent within six months.\n\nHomebuilders are increasing productivity to satisfy new demand, which may be a mixed blessing for country estates.\n\n\"Prices are moving up against a background of four years of low supply in the country house market,\" Mr Bailey said. \"If this positive sentiment pulls in more supply, that will hang a question mark over the sustainability of this growth.\"\n\nFor Mr Hudson, waiting to sell his London home proved fortunate as prices rose in the capital, while he said they fell last year where he was looking.\n\n\"You'd see a house listed and a few months later it would still be on the market and the price had dropped,\" Mr Hudson said. \"When we finally bought it was more of a lifestyle choice, we were never sure it was going to be a good investment.\"\n\nAfter selling the home in Clapham for \u00a31.3 million, with an extra \u00a3475,000 he could afford the six-bedroom country house with a cottage, swimming pool and eight acres of land.\n\n\"I had a feeling the time was right and London's housing market was coming to a peak,\" he said. \"Maybe I was wrong on that point, because in fact that peak seems to go on getting higher and higher.\" Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

However, companies will need to evolve their mobility strategies to a \"choose-your-own-device\" (CYOD) one in order to have a more controllable, secure network environment.\n\nAccording to Charles Reed Anderson, Asia-Pacific head of telecom practice and mobility lead at research agency IDC, BYOD is fast spreading as workers eschew company-issued notebooks and laptops, for personal devices that tend to be lighter and have better battery life.\n\nHowever, this then brings challenges to the corporate backend because these systems are not configured to cope with secured access by myriad devices and users, he noted during a briefing session held by the research firm last week.\n\nAvneesh Saxena, group vice-president of domain research at IDC Asia-Pacific, added that, based on the company's latest C-Suite Barometer 2013 study, the top priorities among business leaders are to build a more secure IT environment - which garnered 15 per cent of the total response - and to simplify existing IT.\n\nMobility-based\n\nThis is corroborated by projected IT spending, with mobility-based investments topping the list among the executives polled, while security, business continuity and disaster recovery came in at second spot, Mr Saxena pointed out.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of increased demand by business users to have simpler IT and a concurrent focus on securing corporate networks and data, enterprises need to consider moving away from the end-user-driven BYOD model to a more corporate-led CYOD strategy, suggested Mr Anderson.\n\nExplaining, the analyst said the CYOD strategy means companies get to decide on what operating systems (OSes) and devices they want to support on the backend. \"So if an employee goes to IT and asks for a device with a specific OS, IT can point to a range and let them pick from there,\" he noted.\n\nThis then helps move the company from simply opening up the network to all its employees - a move that is nothing but a cost to the organisation since employees will just make use of the access to stream videos or other such non-work-related activities that offer no benefits, he added.\n\nFor many organisations in Asia-Pacific, however, they remain rooted in the first three stages of IDC's Mobile Maturity Model, Mr Anderson revealed.\n\nStage one, for instance, is when companies adopt ad hoc mobile device management (MDM) solutions from smaller vendors, and this was the stage where 57.3 per cent of polled companies were at when the study was released this July.\n\nThe other two stages - described as \"opportunistic\" and \"repeatable\" - account for 11.4 per cent and 3.8 per cent of companies, respectively.\n\nNotably, 21 per cent of the companies polled scored too low to even make it on the chart, said the analyst, who pointed out this is an opportunity for enterprise mobility vendors to capitalise on.\n\nStrategy\n\n\"Vendors should tailor their offerings to assist these companies who have yet developed an enterprise mobility strategy, and provide them solutions that are aligned to their needs and not piecemeal deployments,\" he said.\n\nIn terms of markets that are savvier in deploying enterprise mobility initiatives, Mr Anderson said Australia, New Zealand and Singapore are leading the way.\n\nBy comparison, markets such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Taiwan remain in the first stage of the model, he pointed out.\n\nFrom a verticals perspective, the financial services sector in markets such as Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong are being forward-looking in their mobility strategies, while healthcare is also driving more mature, well-developed initiatives, he said.\n\nThat said, the analyst pointed out some of the challenges hindering organisations' efforts to implement sound mobile strategies.\n\nThese include having to account for the different stakeholders and their varied needs, the confusing number of vendors and partners in the market right now, and having the capability of putting all the pieces together and making the backend work, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After Oct 17, the US will have US$30 billion plus incoming revenue and would start missing payments sometime between Oct 22 and Oct 31, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nSenate Republicans on Saturday blocked Democrats' plan to suspend the debt ceiling through 2014. Talks between House Republicans and President Barack Obama were at an impasse and rank-and-file House members headed home. Senate Democrats rejected a proposal from Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine that had been gaining momentum.\n\nThe hurdles remain the same ones that have bedevilled Congress for a month. Democrats insist that policy changes shouldn't be attached to a debt-ceiling increase and stopgap spending bill. Republicans, internally fractured over strategy, say spending cuts and revisions to the 2010 healthcare law must occur.\n\nThe Reid-McConnell talks, between two veteran deal makers, represent the best chance for an agreement, said Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican.\n\n\"It's very evident that the White House is not going to be involved in negotiations, or at least at this point they're not,\" he said. \"The centrepiece is Reid and McConnell, so I think all of us want to support those efforts.\"\n\nDemocrats prefer raising the US$16.7 trillion US debt limit for as long as possible and with no policy conditions attached. Republicans on Saturday blocked Mr Reid's plan to push the next debt-limit fight into 2015. The 53-45 vote fell short of the 60 needed to advance the measure.\n\nMr Reid then rejected a proposal from Ms Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia. That plan would push the next debt-limit fight to the end of January, extend government funding for six months to March and give federal agencies more flexibility under the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. The plan also would have set a mid-January deadline for longer-term budget talks.\n\nThe proposal would make two changes to the president's healthcare plan. One would delay a tax on medical devices for two years and make up lost revenue through pension-rule changes. The other would require the Obama administration to verify income levels for enrolment in health benefits.\n\nDemocrats said the debt-limit increase is too short to provide certainty and the funding extension at Republican-preferred levels is too long.\n\nFor two days, the prospects for a potential deal had focused on talks between House of Representatives speaker John Boehner and Mr Obama that would push the lapse of borrowing authority to Nov 22 from Oct 17. Republicans also wanted to attach policy conditions to a separate spending bill that would end the government shutdown.\n\nMr Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said talks between the White House and House Republicans were \"done\". A White House official described the Collins proposal as constructive. Still, the administration shares the concerns of Senate Democrats, who object to the spending levels set by the plan and some of the changes it would make to the healthcare law, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the plan.\n\n\"Every offer we've made they just flat turned us down without any counter-offer,\" said Representative John Fleming, a Louisiana Republican. \"Our level of expectations for the president has gradually dropped over the years to a point where we don't expect anything from President Obama.\"\n\nAny prospective deal faces questions, including whether Mr Boehner will allow a vote on a proposal that most Republicans would oppose.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/prepare-internet-things-gartner", "site_title": "Prepare for 'Internet of Things': Gartner", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nPrepare for 'Internet of Things': Gartner\n\nWeb-aware apps will swamp the consumer market\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Oct 13, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBY 2020, expect to have a home full of Web-aware appliances and you'll be wearing a couple of them at all times as well, say Gartner analysts.\n\nIn less than 10 years, we will see manufacturers flooding the market with gadgets in order to satiate unpredictable consumer tastes, and the load of these gadgets will tax data centres and networks heavily, said Jim Tully, chief of research, semiconductors and electronics for Gartner.\n\nThis scenario, dubbed the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT), describes a network of interconnected gadgets and systems, all talking to each other through the Web. This includes \"smart\" appliances like Web-connected refrigerators, to wearable smartwatches connected to mobile phones, and so on.\n\nThe concept first came about at the turn of the century, but has only recently come to mainstream attention because of the proliferation of small gadgets and sensors which are making the idea of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication possible.\n\nMr Tully, speaking at a Gartner summit, said that in the year 2020, about 7.5 billion mobile devices are expected to be in the market. But this number will be dwarfed by the 26 billion interconnected devices that will be in the market at the same time.\n\n\"Expect many devices to be connected, from toys to vending machines, to smart meters for your home and even running shoes,\" he said, adding that manufacturers have been making shoes with microprocessors in them for almost 10 years.\n\nBack in 2004, Adidas unveiled its \"1\" shoe, which includes a chip that automatically softens or firms the heel based on the surface that the user is running on. This is accomplished with sensors that work almost instantly, as the shoe makes contact with the ground.\n\nThe shoe failed in the market due to its high price and some reliability issues.\n\nAmy Teng, Gartner principal analyst, pointed out that 10 years on, prices for components are far cheaper, and sensors are getting smaller as well, meaning designers can embed them in a far wider variety of objects.\n\n\"There are clear indicators that the market for sensors will grow,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to hardware prices coming down, the software ecosystem across the Web is bending to accommodate IoT, she noted.\n\nToday, there is a framework for location-based services, and voice recognition continues to improve. All of these factors continue to contribute to better human-to-machine interaction, and make the gadgets more usable in daily life, she said.\n\nIn particular, phone manufacturers and app developers should sit up and pay attention to this trend because they're going to be directly impacted by intelligent gadgets. \"The small size of the gadgets means they probably won't have screens. They'll rely on our smartphones to pull and display data to the user,\" she said.\n\nThere currently exists no \"killer application\" nor is there an intuitive design out in the market yet to justify the added cost of wearable electronics, so the market is ripe for the picking, she said.\n\nSome of the top manufacturers are trying to get a headstart in the wearable game. Amid rumours of an Apple smartwatch on the horizon, Samsung made the first move and last month showed off its Galaxy Gear watch. The device pairs with smartphones to make calls, and captures photos and video on its strap.\n\nShe recommended that companies start by clearly identifying their business opportunities in the wearable market, and ensure that they pair well with smartphones.\n\n\"For now, wearable electronics can't replace smartphones. So make sure you interconnect with the open ecosystem, as well as with Apple systems, in order to be part of the future,\" she said.\n\nMr Tully added that the ability for many upcoming devices to stream and capture video opens the risk that networking infrastructure may not be able to cope with the load.\n\n\"Because the cost of technology will be so low, putting a communications chip in the devices will be a standard expectation. Just like we expect micro controllers in many items such as shoes, putting an extra Bluetooth chip in there will be expected,\" he said.\n\nThis issue won't just affect developed markets. With the prices of chips coming down, expect connected devices to be in emerging markets as well.\n\n\"One should be developing infrastructure now, in anticipation of that inflection point in 2020,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that in the near future, we will end up with a few very high-volume categories of connected devices, with a very long tail of thousands of categories, adding up to significantly large volumes.\n\nManufacturers for the long tail would be advised to try to set up deals with factories where you pay less of an upfront, and more later if it's successful, to mitigate the risk of products failing in the market.\n\nHe used the example of global manufacturer Procter & Gamble. More than 75 per cent of its products fail, in spite of its US$2 billion annual investment into R&D.\n\n\"It just goes to show that no matter who you are and what you spend, you won't be able to predict what consumers want,\" Mr Tully said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The virtuous circle gave work to Japan's heavy industrial companies and helped Boeing keep Airbus largely out of the Japanese market.\n\nBut last Monday, Japan Airlines (JAL) appeared to shatter the alliance by ordering 31 Airbus A350s to replace 31 Boeing 777s that it will retire this decade.\n\nThe US$9.5 billion JAL deal is considered by some industry experts as likely to prompt Boeing to award less supply work to Japan in the future. Boeing would send that work to other countries, including the United States.\n\nJapanese airlines were big buyers of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, which helped justify the large investments Japanese companies made to set up production of major components, said Ron Epstein, an analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nThe 777X, the next generation of Boeing's popular wide-body jet, is supposed to have its design and building launch this year and enter service by 2020.\n\nThe 787 Dreamliner is the company's latest state-of-the-art wide-body aircraft. It has been in service for two years but has encountered numerous technical problems.\n\nSince Japan airlines are so far not big buyers of the 777X, \"why would industrial policy follow the same plan?\" Mr Epstein said.\n\nMany people assumed that Japan's \"heavies\" would be involved in the 777X, he added. \"Maybe they're not going to be as big players on this.\"\n\nBoeing said that it is considering all options on where to build the 777X, but declined to discuss whether the JAL decision would affect its thinking.\n\n\"We have built a strong relationship with Japan Airlines over the last 50 years and we look to continue our partnership going forward,\" the company said last Monday.\n\nThe launch is widely expected at the Dubai airshow next month, where industry sources say that Emirates Airline plans to order 150 wide-body planes, most likely the 777X.\n\nHowever, at Mitsubishi, which is responsible for the 787 wing and would be most affected if Boeing brought wing assembly to the US, a spokesman suggested that the contract is up for grabs.\n\n\"It's a decision that Boeing will make,\" he said. \"If we are asked to build the wing, we will do our best; if not, we will still work our hardest.\"\n\nBoeing has limited options for where it can build the 777X plane and its components since only a handful of companies have the scale and certification to take on such a project reliably.\n\nAmong those considered as possible: Spirit Aerosystems in Wichita, Kansas, a former Boeing facility that already makes wing parts and fuselages for Boeing, and Triumph Group, headquartered in Berwyn, Pennsylvania, which makes wing, fuselage and structural pieces for planes, as well as composite structures, though not those used for airframes, according to the company's website.\n\nBoeing also could bring the work in-house, either at its massive factory in Everett, Washington, or at the assembly plant in Charleston, South Carolina, where it builds some 787s. Boeing is buying land to expand that factory.\n\nSpirit said that it is interested, and noted that it is a significant supplier to the 777, making wing, fuselage and underwing components.\n\nSouth Korea and China also have been mentioned as possible sites for production of at least part of the 777X.\n\nA person close to Boeing with knowledge of the matter said that a global cost-cutting initiative by the company would likely force suppliers in Japan to look for low-cost manufacturers in China and India, pointing to a rise in the Chinese portion of the supply chain and a reduction for Japan.\n\nBoeing's \"Partnering for Success\" cost-cutting programme, launched in 2012, requires 15 per cent cuts over three to four years from all suppliers including the Japanese \"heavies\", this person said.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing's former home state of Washington is making a big push to win the 777X, after 787 work went to Japan and elsewhere.\n\nWashington State governor Jay Inslee, whose state touts itself as home of the world's largest cluster of aerospace companies, recently proposed extending lucrative state tax breaks for Boeing until 2040 if the company builds the 777X and its wings in Washington. Boeing already builds the 777 in Washington, so the logic of putting future production there is strong, state officials say.\n\nIn addition, the extended breaks would apply to all Boeing production in Washington, giving the state an edge against competitors such as South Carolina and Kansas, where Boeing's production is much more limited, said Alex Pietsch, director of the Washington state governor's office of aerospace.\n\nPart of the state's pitch: The 777X's composite wing will be large and difficult to transport, so it makes sense to fabricate it near the site of final assembly, Mr Pietsch said.\n\nState studies show that current 777 production supplies US$20 billion of some US$76 billion in annual economic activity from the state aerospace industry.\n\nA state task force is working on a proposal that could be put forth as early as next month, if a special legislative session is called in Washington, he said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Four Singapore-based operators share their experiences. By Nicholas Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 11, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nINCREASINGLY savvy travellers looking for one-of-a-kind experiences have been able to find them by trawling the Internet or checking out travel websites. It's also spawned fertile ground for enterprising individuals to offer specialised travel services that cut through the clutter of the Web and zero in on what people want, ie a customised itinerary that takes into account all their needs.\n\nBespoke businesses and websites offering everything from short-term stays in the homes of locals to designer holidays have proliferated in the West, but Singapore is fast catching up. A quick search online reveals that there are at least 10 such businesses based here, with four of them founded in the past year.\n\nSimon Cameron is the founder and managing director of Lightfoot Travel (www.lightfoottravel.com), founded in 2009, which specialises in luxury customised holidays. Mr Cameron says sales for the third quarter of 2013 have increased almost 70 per cent year on year, boosted by their heavy investment in a digital strategy.\n\nMr Cameron, who has also seen more competitors popping up in the market, notes: \"A lot of our clients are very well-travelled and therefore are looking for holidays that are all about the experience, the hidden elements that make the trip. That's what we provide with our insider knowledge as we send our team out to experience the destination and give our clients the little tips such as which is the best room for viewing the sunset, or where to find a gem of a restaurant.\"\n\nOne entrepreneur who has capitalised on this demand for special experiences is Clement Wong, the founder of Be My Guest (www.bemyguest.travel), which offers authentic local experiences in Asia and beyond. These range from cooking and massage classes in Bali, to a radiation survival course in Chernobyl. Customers have the option of booking multiple day land packages - for example, a nine-day tour in North Korea starts from $3,355 - or specific experiences provided by small travel suppliers.\n\nMr Wong, who used to do travel research and strategy, came home last March after a decade spent working in Europe, to set up the company. He notes: \"Different sectors like accommodation and flights have all been aggregated and digitalised, and tours and activities are the final frontier.\"\n\nHe adds that companies like his are just the tip of the iceberg: \"People are getting increasingly tired of the mass package tours, but at the same time, they don't really want to take the independent route like backpacking.\"\n\nBT Weekend checks out four such enterprising Singapore-based entrepreneurs, who have turned their passion for travel into a business.\n\nPandaBed\n\n3 Canton Street, #02-01, S'pore 049745\n\nTel 9374 3550 |\n\nwww.pandabed.com\n\nThe dream of setting up a bespoke travel business began when, as undergrads in the US in 2002, James Chua and Lester Kang became best friends and started travelling together.\n\n\"We didn't have much money,\" recalls Mr Chua. \"We wanted to see more places, but didn't want to pay too much for the hotel.\" And it was while on holiday in Europe that they were struck by the quality and value for money of bed and breakfast establishments, and the idea for a possible business first struck them.\n\nMr Chua says: \"We didn't have the money or the experience at the time, but PandaBed eventually came out of that experience.\"\n\nThat was 11 years ago. Last August the duo started PandaBed (www.pandabed.com), which is essentially an Asian version of Airbnb. The online service allows travellers to do short-term rentals in service apartments, villas, bed and breakfast establishments and private homes, often at rates comparable to or cheaper than hotels. PandaBed has an office in Boat Quay and currently employs five staff.\n\nPandaBed now has almost 2,000 listings in cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong and Bangkok, including about 50 homes in Singapore. Room rates can range from as little as US$25 for a single room, to more than US$1,400 a night for a five-bedroom villa that accommodates 10.\n\nMr Chua notes that Asian travellers have a very different mindset from those in the West: \"The idea of staying in someone else's place is still very foreign, even for people who are open-minded. Being able to verify the quality of the place they are staying in and the integrity of the owner is something that people are very concerned about.\"\n\nPandaBed therefore has what it calls curated properties, where staff are sent to meet the owners and inspect the property. These are advertised on the website as properties which have been \"personally reviewed and handpicked\" by PandaBed. Unsurprisingly, the verified properties are the most popular.\n\n\"They like the verification thing, because they don't need to worry that they are staying with a serial killer,\" Mr Chua deadpans. \"People who are older - in their 40s or 50s - need that reassurance.\"\n\nQuotient Travel Planner\n\nVertex Tower B, 33 Ubi Ave 3, #06-04\n\nTel 6435 0922 |\n\nwww.travelplanner.com.sg\n\nTHE six-year-old Quotient Travel Planner is the brainchild of Lim Hui-Juan and Javiny Lim, also frequent travellers who met in university. The company arranges private customised holidays - everything from land tours in South-east Asia to safaris in Africa.\n\n\"In our younger days when we travelled quite frequently, our friends would often ask for help in their own travels,\" says Javiny, adding that many of their peers were growing out of the need for package tours. \"Then we thought, let's try and make money out of it.\"\n\nIt started in 2007 with, as former aerospace engineer Hui-Juan puts it, \"an uphill task of educating the public about a new market that didn't exist then.\" But as Javiny, who used to sell cars, says: \"It was always a dream to build a cool travel business.\"\n\nToday, the company employs 14 staff and is engaging two more. It covers every continent in the world, and its packages consist of fully customised tours that fulfill every item on the traveller's wishlist, as well as predetermined itineraries that can be adjusted. The latter plans, started earlier this year, are available on the Quotient Travel Planner online store, which offers the \"most economical solution\", says Javiny.\n\nA typical package consists of a 10-12 day European tour that starts from S$4,000 per person.\n\nJaviny notes: \"Everyone has his own definition of a good holiday. Some people like to spend time in museums, others want to do foodie trails, while some prefer to take photos.\" But whatever your interest, they'll find a way to turn it into a memorable experience.\n\nEquipe Nomad Cycling Holidays\n\nTel 8399 9181 |\n\nwww.equipenomad.com\n\nIT isn't just Singaporeans who are chasing the dream of setting up a bespoke travel business - British expat and full-time musician Greg Lyons started organising biking tours to Malaysia last May, under the auspices of Equipe Nomad Cycling Holidays. At least one tour is held each month, and can last from two to seven days. Groups range in size from one to seven, and typically set off from Kuala Lumpur. The cost of each tour ranges from S$680 to S$2,418.\n\nAn avid cyclist who moved from Malaysia to Singapore seven years ago, Mr Lyons still maintains a house in Kuala Lumpur, where he often returns to cycle in the hills and countryside. He got the idea to start the cycling tours when he started getting enthusiastic responses on Facebook to photos he posted of his best biking moments, asking how to get to these places.\n\n\"I realised how few people actually had access to the kind of knowledge I had of the roads of the region, especially in Singapore which has a large - and expanding - population of avid cyclists,\" says Mr Lyons, who also saw it as a chance to diversify his business portfolio. He runs Equipe Nomad with his wife and two part-time drivers, while his daughter and brother-in-law also help out as extra drivers and photographers.\n\nMr Lyons, who has invested a five-figure sum in the business so far, says: \"We have a lot of return customers, which is perfect, and we've made a lot of good friends. There's so much great cycling to be had in this region.\"\n\nNext month, Mr Lyons will lead the company's first cycling tour in Thailand, starting in Chiang Mai and taking a six-day loop that will include Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest mountain.\n\nWok 'n' Stroll\n\nTel 8338 3571 |\n\nwww.woknstroll.com.sg\n\nISRAELI Karni Tomer is another expat who has made a business out of a big Singaporean passion - food. Ms Tomer organises food trails and culinary tours under Wok 'n' Stroll, which was set up earlier this year.\n\nShe personally leads up to three tours of six to 20 people per week, which consist of private and corporate events, sometimes employing part-time guides licensed by the Singapore Tourism Board. Her tours typically last two to three hours, taking in spots such as Tekka Market and Geylang. Most of her customers are expatriates based here. The tours start from S$60 and include snacks.\n\nMs Tomer, a mother of three, came to Singapore in 2009 when her husband was relocated here for work. She quickly discovered the delights of dishes such as chicken biryani and chilli crab, and realised that she was coming to a \"gastronomic paradise\".\n\nMs Tomer, who previously worked as a chef specialising in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine, set out to educate herself about Singaporean food: \"I started going to the markets with local friends who guided me on all the vegetables and fruits, then I bought all the books in the store and read hundreds of articles and blogs.\"\n\nShe often helps to recreate her first discovery of local cuisine for new arrivals to Singapore, via group food orientation activities: \"I support companies when they bring in new employees for relocation, and usually take the whole family upon arrival to learn the basics of Singapore's wonderful kitchen.

If you are someone who is anyone, it is quite likely that you have already jumped on the social media bandwagon. The blue bird known as Twitter is one of the most popular and prolific social media networks available and is frequented by users across the globe.\n\nIn 2012 alone, there were 2,561,240 users on Twitter in Singapore. That is almost 50 per cent of the population. With such a large chunk of the market represented on the network, companies can ill-afford to neglect such a valuable avenue of customer interaction.\n\nThe Internet places quite a bit of importance on the number of followers a Twitter account has. The Pope has nearly three million followers, Coca-Cola has 1.6 million followers, and Justin Bieber has 43 million people following his every Tweet.

Further crimping the group's bottom line were factors such as lower other operating income, higher distribution expenses and a swing to losses for its share of results of associates.\n\nOther operating income fell 63.4 per cent to $995,000 in Q1 compared with a year ago due to a fall in dividend income.\n\nDistribution expenses jumped to $3 million from $220,000 the previous year, due to higher selling and marketing costs incurred in relation to the sale of Spottiswoode Suites and The Midtown.\n\nLian Beng also took a loss of $1.6 million in the share of results of associates in Q1, from an $8,000 gain the year before. This was also due to higher selling and marketing costs, from the sale of NeWest, KAP Residences and Eco-tech@Sunview.\n\nNo dividend was recommended for the period.\n\nThe company said it is \"cautiously optimistic\" about the construction industry, after the authorities upgraded its forecast for total construction demand for 2013 to $28-34 billion, from $26-32 billion, and to $22-30 billion for each of the next two years from $20-28 billion.\n\nMr Ong said he also looks forward to Lian Beng's 55 per cent-owned industrial development, M-Space, receiving its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) so as to recognise the revenue from it. M-Space is fully sold and is slated to get its TOP this fiscal year.\n\nShares in Lian Beng closed unchanged yesterday at 53.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After all, he's been in the storytelling business - in one form or another - for much of his life, starting from his first job in an advertising agency, through a career as an award-winning film producer and more recently as a leading educator and advocate for learning technologies.\n\nThrow in a supporting role as a life peer and roving ambassador for the British government and it's easy to see why Puttnam doesn't have much time to potter around his garden at home in West Cork, Ireland.\n\nPuttnam was in town recently to address the British Chamber of Commerce. His connection to Singapore extends further, thanks to an ongoing association with Lasalle College of the Arts, where he is patron of The Puttnam School of Film.\n\nHis appointment book is filled, and that's the way he likes it. \"I am continually finding excuses to say why I work so much and why I'm not kicking back, taking time off,\" he says. \"It's simply because I really love what I do.\" At 72 years old however, Lord Puttnam does allow himself one or two little luxuries. \"The fruits of my labour are the relative freedom to do the things that interest me - it's the luxury of only working with people I like, not with people whose values I don't share,\" he says. \"At this point in life you don't have to - especially in the movie industry. I didn't want to feel permanently compromised.\"\n\nPuttnam made his mark on the industry with films such as Midnight Express (1978), Chariots of Fire (1981) and The Killing Fields (1984), but it was an ill-fated tenure as studio head at Columbia Pictures in the late-1980s that left a bitter aftertaste. \"Accepting the offer to go to Columbia was my biggest mistake,\" he says. \"I have no problem making mistakes, but I don't want to be a victim of other people's mistakes.\"\n\nAs a result, he doesn't miss the industry at all, but he does stay involved by teaching filmmaking courses at several schools around the world (including Lasalle), often without having to leave home - thanks to state-of-the-art video conferencing technology.\n\n\"I teach film but I don't teach how to - I teach the story of how.\" He's seen a few Singapore movies over the years as well. \"My only concern is that they don't inform me more about the Singapore experience,\" he says \"What's it like to fall in love in Singapore for instance, and how will it play to an international audience?\"\n\nIt's probably no surprise that sporting metaphors sit well with David Puttnam, who describes himself as a big cricket fan (and long-suffering supporter of the Tottenham Hotspur football team). \"The sweetest thing someone said to me was, 'You've got enough runs on the board',\" he says. It was a reference to Puttnam's successful career.\n\n\"I also adore track and field; that's why I made Chariots of Fire, it was a way of putting together something I really love with a story I loved - a perfect fusion.\" He adds, \"In hindsight, I realised that at the core of my films was how men behaved towards adversity - they were about male relationships under stress.\" The awards and the critical acclaim were feathers in his film producer's cap, of course, but Puttnam prefers to look ahead these days. \"Looking forward feels much better than looking back,\" he says. \"I don't have time to miss it - my life is enormously satisfying now.\"\n\nAs for the movies he wishes he had made, he names Raging Bull, The Godfather Part II and West Side Story at the top of his list. \"I'd like to dump one or two of my own movies as well,\" he laughs.\n\nIn the past, he'd read about something and be inspired to make a film about it - which is exactly what happened with The Killing Fields, about the experiences of two journalists during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia. \"It was a great story but I also wanted an excuse to work in this part of the world,\" he says.\n\nLord Puttnam first came to Cambodia in 1966 and still returns to Indochina on a regular basis - representing the United Kingdom as a trade envoy. \"My job as trade ambassador is very simple - it's to create relationships that will last,\" he says. \"The message is simple: this is a highly competitive part of the world - what are the conditions you need to be successful?\" When asked what the hypothetical title of a film of his life or a biography would be, Lord Puttnam ponders for a few seconds before he offers: \"Whatever Happened to Real Life?\"\n\nAs a member of the House of Lords, he commutes frequently between home in southwest Ireland and London, and wishes he had the luxury of a private jet at his disposal to cut down on travelling time.\n\n\"That's the one luxury I'd wish for,\" he says. \"Heathrow to Cork, and then a 75-minute drive home. That's where real life is - because the House of Lords sure as hell isn't real life.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And it's easy to see why. At 23 and just out of National Service, the confidence of his abstract art belies his youth.\n\nWhether he's painting multi-hued spectral beings soaring through a cold black space, or evoking moods through fine translucent colour blocks, the works are complex, nuanced and absorbing. The 20 paintings and sculptures for his upcoming solo show at Chan Hampe Galleries are more proof of that.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the young Pang - no pun intended - is a genuinely social creature who talks to almost everyone as if he or she is his new best friend. Conversations are peppered with hip movie, music and literary references - not because he's name-dropping to impress but because pop culture informs so much of his art.\n\n\"This work is inspired by a scene in Tarantino's Natural Born Killers,\" he says, pointing to a vivid melange of yellows and greens. \"Remember that scene where they're going to buy snake juice and the pharmacy is lit completely in neon green? I call this The Pharmacy.\n\n\"This other one was painted after I watched Drive starring Ryan Gosling,\" he says of a psychedelic work fusing pinks and greens titled Are You An Empty Eye. \"They had opened the movie with a Kavinsky song called Nightcall. I thought, 'There's no way they can make that work.' But they did!... That song stuck in my head and it kind of bled into the painting.\"\n\nThe high energy and extroversion that ooze from his lanky frame are reflected in the shimmering works. But their careful control of light, colours and strokes also hint at a perfectionist who works and reworks his images persistently.\n\nAs pointed out by his curator Loredana Pazzini-Paracciani, some of the works make unconscious references to masterworks by famous painters such as Francis Bacon and Hieronymus Bosch - but transposed into abstract forms.\n\nPang paints using his hands as often as his paint brushes and does so on aluminum panels instead of canvases, because they allow him to fuse colours and forms more spontaneously. But that also means the aluminum works are much heavier than your standard canvas paintings.\n\n\"I once dropped a big work, and it cracked the floor,\" he says, as he starts cracking up too. \"But having experimented with different surfaces, I still think aluminum presents the best possibilities.\"\n\nBorn to a visual merchandiser father and lecturer mother, he grew up in a creative household where his parent's bedrooms \"are messier than mine\". His parents gave up two-thirds of the living room to turn it into his workspace and say nothing when paint drips on the floor.\n\n\"Paint on the floor I can clean. But paint on the ceiling is the hard part.\"\n\nPang first attracted the attention of the art scene when one of his works appeared in a Singapore Art Museum showcase of young artists in 2009. Subsequently, he was twice nominated for the Sovereign Art Prize award in 2010 and 2011. And a few of his early student works have also - somewhat prematurely - appeared in auctions.\n\nEarlier this year, he held a solo exhibition in Lugano, Switzerland, for Primae Noctis Art Gallery where all his paintings were snapped up. And several of the works for his upcoming exhibition at Chan Hampe - priced reasonably between $1,700 and $7,000 - are already sold or on reserve.\n\nNow that he's done with NS, Pang plans to paint full-time. Eschewing the standard Singaporean route to success, the fine art diploma holder says he sees no need to obtain a bachelor's or master's in fine art for now.\n\nHe says, \"I've been weighing my options, but it's come to a point where furthering my studies would just hold me back from doing all the things that I could do with my time - painting, experimenting and exhibiting.\"\n\nFew would disagree.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nRuben Pang's solo exhibition The New Energetics: Inverting the Process will open at Chan Hampe Galleries on 18 Oct and run till Nov 2.

One reason for this is that security is treated as an afterthought, he said.\n\nMr Wagner noted that many software providers and project managers do not factor security into an application or device from the earliest stages. \"It's difficult enough to close off possible attack paths during the design phase, and it is nearly impossible after deployment - particularly since the product will typically be maintained and updated by personnel who did not participate in the product development and may not fully understand its underlying architecture and design principles,\" he explained.\n\nProblems also arise when trained security practitioners are not involved in the design and implementation.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Technology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The top bid by Reclaims Enterprise Pte Ltd works out to $5.33 million. The 54,329.71 sq ft land parcel, dubbed Plot 28 on Tuas South Street 7, drew five bids. The lowest offer, from Soilbuild Group Holdings, was $40.49 psf ppr.\n\nThe other plot, Tuas South Street 6 (Plot 4), attracted 10 bids. The highest - $2.88 million or $88.14 psf ppr - was from Derman Aluminium (S) Pte Ltd. HP Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd was the lowest bidder, at $46.44 psf ppr, for the 32,686.74 sq ft plot.\n\nEach land parcel has tenure of 21 years and nine months, and was put up for tender by JTC Corporation under the confirmed list of the Industrial Government Land Sales Programme.\n\nStrata subdivision is not allowed in the first five years after the projects receive Temporary Occupation Permit. Both sites are zoned for Business 2 development, which allows for heavy industrial use. They have a 1.0 plot ratio (ratio of maximum gross floor area to land area).\n\nMeanwhile, a local engineering company is selling its premises at 158 Gul Circle comprising a two-storey building with office and production space; three adjoining single-storey factories; and a large open yard space - with a total gross floor area (GFA) of 61,827 sq ft on land of 120,062 sq ft. The site has balance lease tenure of about 17.5 years and is zoned for Business 2 use with 1.4 plot ratio. This means that additional GFA of 106,259 sq ft can be built.\n\nThe property is being offered for sale with vacant possession. The seller plans to move to smaller leased premises.\n\n\"Properties with multiple single-storey factories and a huge open yard are rarely available for sale and we believe that it will be well received by Business 2 end-users, which are typically involved in heavy industries,\" says Nicholas Ng, local director of investments at Jones Lang LaSalle. \"The site is currently under-built and has the potential to be redeveloped to maximise its plot ratio.\"\n\nThe company is marketing the property through an expression of interest exercise that closes on Nov 21. The pricing expectation is about $16.5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, Catalist-listed food catering company Neo Group is on an expansion trail. It is buying a row of five terrace factories at the corner of Jalan Boon Lay and Enterprise Road for $12 million.\n\nThe factories - Nos 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 Enterprise Road - are on sites with balance lease terms of 22 to 29 years and their sale is subject to approval by JTC Corporation. The properties are being sold by International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF), which had previously used them as its factory. IFF last year opened a new plant along Chin Bee Drive in Jurong.\n\nLocated within JTC Corp's Chin Bee Food Zone, the properties have a combined land area of 75,018 sq ft and are zoned for Business 2 use under Urban Redevelopment Authority's Master Plan 2008. The five factories have an existing GFA of 57,112 sq ft, just slightly over a third of the maximum allowable 159,591 sq ft. This means there is substantial redevelopment potential for Neo Group.\n\n\"The food manufacturing industry in Singapore is doing very well. All the 20 prospective buyers I dealt with in the course of marketing this property are looking for space to expand,\" says Darren Wang, associate director of capital markets at Cushman & Wakefield, who brokered the sale through a private treaty deal.\n\nNeo Group will not be redeveloping the site in the near term. Instead it will embark on addition and alteration works with a view to making the premises operational within a few months for food preparation and manufacturing.\n\nSet up in 1992 by Neo Kah Kiat, the group also operates a chain of Japanese convenience food retail outlets under the \"Umisushi\" brand and supplies food ingredients and Japanese food products to third parties in addition to its food catering business.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, no film has the pull of Gravity when it comes to conveying what it might be like to float un-tethered in outer space - alone and adrift among the stars.\n\nIn Gravity, director Alfonso Cuaron has made a visually stunning and emotionally stirring movie about astronauts lost in space, harnessing the fear and fascination associated with a place that represents a Great Unknown for most mortals. It's a feat that should earn him a place among the celestial bodies of the cinematic world.\n\nAt its core, Gravity is a simple tale about a routine shuttle mission to make repairs to the Hubble Space telescope - until things go horribly wrong, of course.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/pursuit-barolo-perfection", "site_title": "In pursuit of Barolo perfection", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nIn pursuit of Barolo perfection\n\nBarolo's wines, which date back to the early 1900s, possess meticulous attention to detail, writes NK YONG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Oct 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNO one seriously interested in fine wine would be unfamiliar with the names Giacomo Conterno and Barolo Riserva Montfortino, the legendary and almost mythical Barolo made by Giovanni Conterno and now by his son Roberto Conterno in the little wine village of Montforte d'Alba. It goes without saying that for Barolo enthusiasts, Barolo Riserva Montfortino would carry the same weight and importance as Petrus to Bordeaux-lovers and Romanee-Conti to Burgundy enthusiasts.\n\nWhen one is studying something totally new, one looks for landmarks and reference points, so as to better evaluate what one is encountering for the first time. Just as Lafite and Latour serve as reasonably authenticated reference points for Bordeaux, so I learnt that Barolo Monfortino Riserva would serve similarly for Barolo.\n\nAll this led to my standing on the top of the slope of the hill of Serralunga one ice-cold day in January 1985 (after visiting Bordeaux) with my friend Pio Boffa of the Piedmont family wine company Pio Cesare, looking down at the most famous vineyard in Barolo, Giacomo Conterno's wholly owned Cascina Francia.\n\nGiacomo Conterno goes way back it is believed to the time when Giovanni Conterno's son Giacomo came back after World War I to San Giuseppe near Montforte d'Alba where the older Giovanni had a tavern. He began the production of Barolo, the first one being bottled between 1912 and 1920.\n\nGiacomo broke with tradition by (a) producing a Barolo with vast ageing potential, and (b) by purchasing his own vineyard, Cascina Francia in Serralunga, thus breaking with the traditional practice of using bought-in fruit. To this day Giacomo Conterno continues to use the old traditional method of Barolo production, ageing in large casks (botti) for periods of up to seven or more years.\n\nA visit to Giacomo Conterno's Azienda in Monforte d'Alba has been a standard fixture on the itinerary of my visits to Piedmont - every one or two years.\n\nFrom our first visit in the late 1980s we were made most welcome by Giovanni Conterno, accompanied as always by his charming wife. It was old-fashioned Italian hospitality with a capital H! I take the opportunity in this column to pay tribute to and to express my admiration of Giovanni Conterno and his wife who always received us with great warmth and generosity all those years before his death in 2004.\n\nHis son Roberto continues his father's tradition, warmly welcoming us a few days ago in spite of being heavily involved in extensive renovations to the winery. Instead of leading the way into the reception and tasting room, he excitedly led the way into the winery to show us his latest acquisition.\n\nThose who drink enough fine wine will have experienced the disappointment of a \"corked\" bottle. The average inevitable incidence of \"one corked bottle per case of 12\" has left producer and consumer frustrated at being unable to reduce this incidence, leading to the advocacy of screw-caps and other alternative closures. Not any more will Azienda Giacomo Conterno remain helpless - it has taken positive steps to totally eliminate \"corked\" bottles of its wines.\n\nConterno does not take the cork suppliers' guarantees of specified quality for granted. In addition to the supplier's certifications, Conterno's staff manually examine every single cork used for their wine-closures regardless of the price or quality of the wine, from the least to the most expensive.\n\nTo enable accurate and complete tracking of each and every cork, the winery has additionally put in place a specially designed cork-labelling machine which laser prints specific identifying details on the corks. The coded details imprinted include name of supplier, batch number, and delivery number, thus enabling accurate tracking of each and every cork used. Thus when a bottle is reported as \"corked\", examination of the cork enables complete tracking of the origin and life-history of that cork!\n\nAll this attention to detail would be to no avail if the wines were not of exceptional quality. This they are, from the simplest Barbera Cascina Francia through the regular Barolo Cascina Francia to the exceptional and rare Barolo Monfortino Riserva, produced only in exceptional years.\n\nThe production of Barolo Montfortino Riserva is so tiny, the wine itself so precious, that even an incidence of one corked bottle in 12 must be reduced or eliminated. It is worth emphasising again that this treatment is applied to ALL the bottles of wine produced regardless of retail price of bottle. We drank a Giacomo Conterno 2011 Barbera d'Alba Cascina Francia at lunch after the tasting. It cost all of 40 euros (S$68) in the restaurant and its cork had been laser-printed.\n\nBarbera Cascina Francia 2011, Giacomo Conterno\n\nBlack red colour, with sweet fruity nose; dense very concentrated, very sweet with very ripe fruit, beautifully balanced, a light touch of ripe tannin on the medium-length finish. Alcohol 15.0 per cent by volume, but so well integrated and so well balanced was the wine that it was totally unnoticeable.\n\nI checked later in a wine store in Alba town and this bottle retails for 28 euros. If only it were available in Singapore at that price!\n\n(More of Giacomo Conterno's wines next week.)\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The key challenge with these renewable sources is that they are intermittent,\" said S Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade and Industry at the launch yesterday.\n\nGrid systems must be able to accommodate such variable electricity supply while maintaining stability for the users at the same time, he added. \"So this micro-grid is an example of the kind of efforts we're taking in order to see how we can tap into this wider option of renewable energy.\"\n\nThe micro-grid, first announced in 2009, was built by a consortium comprising renewable energy solutions provider Daily Life Renewable Energy Pte Ltd and OKH Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of mainboard-listed industrial property developer OKH Global.\n\nThe $10 million cost for the 10-year project is split between the Energy Market Authority (EMA) and the consortium. The biodiesel generators use recycled cooking oil supplied by Alpha Biofuels.\n\nThe 330-kilowatt micro- grid allows Pulau Ubin residents, long reliant on their own diesel generators, access to cheaper and more reliable electricity supply.\n\nAbout 30 residents and businesses have signed up for electricity from the grid.\n\nSolar energy is one of the more promising renewable energy options for Singapore, said Mr Iswaran.\n\n\"The general estimates are that solar could potentially supply 5-10 per cent of our energy needs, which is not insignificant, but it cannot be the source of our baseload,\" he said, emphasising the need for Singapore to diversify its energy supply.\n\nSingapore relies on imported natural gas from Malaysia and Indonesia for about 80 per cent of its electricity requirements.\n\n\"With our liquefied natural gas terminal commencing commercial operations in May this year, we are now able to procure natural gas from regions beyond our immediate neighbourhood,\" he said.\n\nNonetheless, various government agencies have been driving solar energy research efforts as the price of solar PV cells dived in the past few years.\n\nThe Economic Development Board in June awarded $12 million to five solar power research projects.\n\nAt the same time, the Housing and Development Board has been testing solar PV in housing estates such as Punggol under a $31 million, five-year scheme since 2010. It recently called for its largest solar-leasing tender, for a firm to own and operate panels on about 125 blocks in Ang Mo Kio, Sengkang, Serangoon North and Buangkok.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Belly freight usage in passenger aircraft - making up about half of commercial air freight on international routes - has also been taken into account.\n\nOf the 2,700 or so planes, 870 planes worth some US$234 billion are estimated to be factory-built and 1,860 are expected to be converted from passenger aircraft.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific, which holds a 36 per cent share of global cargo traffic, will account for 42 per cent of the pie by 2032. China - the single biggest driver of growth - will hold a 22 per cent share, up from 15 per cent.\n\nIn contrast, the European and North American markets, which hold a 51 per cent share of the global freight market, will see their market share slip to 45 per cent by 2032, Airbus said.\n\n\"Looking forward, after a difficult few years, world trade is showing improvements and diverse emerging markets will call for increased flexibility in air cargo transportation - for which mid-size freighters will be the primary means to achieve this,\" said Andreas Hermann, vice-president of Airbus and head of freighters. \"This is why Airbus forecasts that the core of future freighter requirements will be in the mid-size category, where modern-technology freighters will play a large part in future fleet replacement and long-term growth.\"\n\nMid-sized freighters are expected to account for 45 per cent of the freighter market with more than 1,290 units, up from 744 as at end-2012, as they enable airlines to adapt to changes in demand. Large freighters, typically used for long-haul operations between the US, Europe and Asia, will hit over 1,000 units by 2032, representing 34 per cent of the market, up from 32 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, small freighters will see their proportion in the global fleet shrink from 23 per cent or 380 planes in 2012 to 21 per cent even as the absolute number climbs to more than 600 aircraft by 2032.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Since the FAIR panel convened last year, there was much speculation on whether Singapore would go the way of Australia and the UK to ban product commissions altogether. The regulator's response to public feedback is measured, clearly seeking to strike a balance between maintaining the viability of an industry where thousands of advisers rely on commissions for their livelihood, and yet seeking to protect retail investors' interests. The fact that not all the FAIR panel's recommendations were accepted testifies to just how challenging the balancing act has been - and remains so.\n\nAdviser remuneration from insurance sales is surely one of the knottiest issues. On the surface, product commissions potentially drive unsavoury hard-sell behaviour. The UK and Australia chose the fee-only model as a more transparent way to reflect advisory costs and align the interests of advisers and clients. In this respect, MAS's concession - to retain the first-year cap on insurance sales commissions at 55 per cent - is significant as this is already the industry practice. The FAIR panel recommendation was a first-year cap of 40 per cent. Instead, it is hoped that a balanced scorecard framework to evaluate advisers' performance and influence remuneration will help to drive the right behaviour and penalise errant advisers. A \"significant proportion\" of the adviser's remuneration is expected to be based on how well he or she stacks up in terms of non-sales indicators.\n\nConsumers must be wondering if the measures will result in lower cost products. After all, many were dismayed by the revelation last year that insurance advisers may be paid as much as 160 per cent of a year's premiums in commissions. But while MAS appears to have kept to the status quo on commissions for now, the impact of other recommendations - in particular, a web aggregator to facilitate product comparisons and provisions for direct online sales - cannot be underestimated. The aggregator is a big step in transparency and should ultimately drive insurers to put their best foot forward, not just in terms of pricing but also in product benefits.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

For example, he would claim for 250 boxes of pineapple tarts when, in actual fact, none were used for the trip, or he would make a claim for 200 boxes when only 50 were used.\n\nHe allegedly did the same with bottles of wine bought for such trips.\n\nHe reportedly submitted many such false claims over a four-year period - from February 2008 to May 2012. Lim was said to have claimed amounts, over and above what was actually used, totalling $88,997.\n\nThe bulk of this came allegedly from the false pineapple tarts claims, which made up over two-thirds of the amount.\n\nAs the highest-ranking protocol officer at MFA then, Lim was in a position to make such claims; for about a decade, he was in charge of the MFA directorate responsible for organising ministerial and presidential visits, and oversaw policies on diplomatic privileges and immunities.\n\nWhen asked yesterday if Lim still holds a position within the ministry, an MFA spokesman said: \"When MFA discovered that there was evidence suggesting misconduct, Mr Lim was suspended from all duties and a police report was made. This is as per the standard practice for all public service officers. Whether he remains in service or not depends on the outcome of his case. As the case is before the courts, we cannot comment further.\"\n\nLim was charged in Court 26 of the Subordinate Courts yesterday on 56 counts of cheating the MFA and four counts of cheating Vital.Org, a government agency involved in the claims reimbursement process. He is being charged under Sections 417 and 420 of the Penal Code, which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years' jail and a fine.\n\nDeputy public prosecutors Kelvin Kow and Gregory Gan, who are representing the state, allege that Lim used falsified receipts for the pineapple tarts claims.\n\nFor the wine, they claim Lim used genuine receipts but stated falsely in his claims the amount of wine used for official purposes.\n\nLim, who was seen walking to and from the courts with the help of a walking stick, is represented by Philip Fong, managing partner of Harry Elias Partnership. Mr Fong asked the court for time to make representations on behalf of his client, and the case will next be heard at a pre-trial conference on Oct 25.\n\nLim is out on $100,000 bail and his passport has been impounded.\n\nThe Business Times reported in June 2012 that Lim had been suspended over allegations of improper claims for expenses incurred during overseas visits. A ministry spokesman told BT then that Lim had \"served MFA and Singapore very well for 38 years\", but that it had \"referred this matter to the CAD (Commercial Affairs Department) for a full investigation . . . (as it) takes all allegations of improper conduct seriously\".\n\nThe ministry subsequently announced that it was reviewing its internal procedures for claims reimbursement to determine whether additional safeguards may be necessary.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said in August last year that an internal audit had uncovered the irregularities involving Lim.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Although sentiment could be lacklustre for mid-cap stocks, we think the indiscriminate selldown is a buying opportunity for investors with a medium-term investment horizon,\" UOB Kay Hian wrote.\n\nBut not all was rosy in the market, especially with the stocks at the centre of the tremors.\n\nEarly last Friday, sharp price declines in a number of stocks prompted Singapore Exchange (SGX) to query six companies on their trading activities, then suspend trading in three of them - Asiasons Capital, Blumont Group and LionGold Corp - before those companies could reply.\n\nTrading in the three stocks resumed on Monday, but not before SGX declared them as \"designated securities\" that had to be settled in cash upfront and could not be shorted.\n\nTwo of the three designated stocks had yet to hit bottom yesterday. Asiasons, an investment firm, fell 22.7 per cent to close at 11.6 cents, while gold miner LionGold shed 24 per cent to close at 19 cents. Blumont, an investment and mining company, ended flat at 13 cents.\n\nSGX did not reply to questions about when it might lift the \"designated\" status of those stocks.\n\nIn the meantime, losses from the open positions that were caught by the restrictions have been coming home to roost. Almost $9 billion in market value had been lost for those three stocks between last Thursday's close and yesterday, but it remains to be seen how much of that will be realised as the industry's three-day settlement deadline for Friday's trades arrives today.\n\nRegardless of the overall amount, on the individual level, those losses hurt.\n\nOne trader said: \"I'm picking up cheques of contra losses, seeing people lose $250,000, $60,000. It's very painful to pick up those cheques.\"\n\nRetail investors advocacy group Securities Investors Association (Singapore) yesterday called on SGX to immediately activate mechanisms designed to temper the pace at which stock prices can change, in addition to current restrictions.\n\nSaying circuit breakers were \"an important safeguard\", SIAS president David Gerald told BT that SGX had announced that it could implement a circuit breaker by year-end, \"but we would like it immediately\".\n\nOne trader, however, felt that the damage may already have been done.\n\n\"For this, it's too late already,\" the trader said. \"For the future, down the road, why not? But for now, it's too late.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company has a portfolio of about eight million sq m in China, he said.\n\nLogistics properties are \"the most attractive real estate opportunity\" in China as consumers buy more from e-commerce companies including Alibaba and Amazon, fuelling demand for storage space, according to a report released last month by Jones Lang LaSalle.

It is not yet decided whether the expansion will be organic in nature, or through acquisitions, or a combination of both.\n\n\"For Legg Mason to continue to maintain leadership, let alone to expand that position, we do need to grow substantially in Asia. In many respects we're a relatively new entrant ... We've made a commitment to Asia. We will continue to accelerate and expand our investments, certainly in Singapore but also in Taipei, Shanghai and Hong Kong.\"\n\nLegg Mason manages a total of about US$645 billion in assets. Its model is somewhat unusual in that investment management is done through wholly owned affiliates, which are run independently.\n\n\"We own them 100 per cent, but allow them to run completely autonomously from an investment and operations standpoint. We think that's a great model because it drives greater innovation, creativity and entrepreneurialism,\" says Mr Sullivan.\n\nThe largest of the affiliates is fixed income manager Western Asset with assets under management (AUM) of some US$410 billion. Also in the group are fixed income, equity and balanced asset manager Brandywine, equity manager ClearBridge Investments and fund of hedge fund manager Permal.\n\nTo date, Asia accounts for roughly US$120 billion in assets.\n\nIn Singapore, managing director and regional head (Asia) Lennie Lim says the investment capabilities are driven mainly by Western Asset, Permal and Brandywine. Western's AUM in Singapore rose 28 per cent over the fiscal year. The flagship product, the Asian Opportunities Fund, has US$896 million in assets.\n\nA number of Legg Mason equity funds here are sub-managed by Havenport Asset Management. The latter, set up in 2010, is run by former Legg Mason executives.\n\nEquity products are understood to be a gap in the group's offerings in Asia. Says Mr Sullivan: \"(Our sales team) say they want more product. It is my number one priority... When you have room to add capability, you have to do it. We can do that organically ... start hiring. There is risk to that because you don't know if it will work; you have to build a track record and it's expensive.\n\n\"Another way - the one way people jump to quickly - is to make acquisitions. There is likewise a lot of risk ... It takes time to build a relationship with a new affiliate, find a partner that's ready to sell with the right products and the right potential to scale and leverage.\"\n\nHe adds: \"Our intent is to expand and grow in a variety of global equity investment capabilities. That would include international equity, emerging market, China, Asia ex-Japan and Europe.\"\n\nOn the investment outlook, he says the US recovery is underway even though it may not be seen as robust. \"We think the economy will continue to grow albeit at a measured pace. We think the Federal Reserve will in a thoughtful and methodical way ... withdraw support as the market and economy can support it. We think rates rise gradually over time.\n\n\"When you get these events - QE tapering, budget impasse or debt ceiling - all these are occasions where the market over-reacts from a long-term investment standpoint. We see these occasions as opportunities. Our managers are typically taking advantage of excessive dislocations as they see them as over-reactions.\"\n\nDespite jitters over the outlook for fixed income assets, Mr Sullivan says a \"great rotation\" out of fixed income is unlikely. Instead, he expects investors to switch out of cash into equities.\n\nTerence Johnson, Legg Mason head of global distribution, believes that while there is a \"constant and secular\" need for income products, interest in equities will pick up. \"... As clients regain confidence, we'll see more moves into US equity, and we can potentially (see) opportunities for capital growth and income.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a commentary on the prospect of a government shutdown, John Bellows, Western Asset investment management strategy analyst, wrote that a government shutdown may not necessarily be a major event for markets, given the potential for a limited macroeconomic impact. In contrast, the prospect of hitting the debt limit is \"uncharted territory with significant downside risks\".\n\nHe said recent events are a good reminder of the importance of diversification. \"Should the tensions in (Washington) DC escalate, diversifying positions - such as an overweight to interest rate risk - would likely outperform and help stabilise overall portfolio returns. In addition, investors should keep in mind that the impasse in DC has likely already been reflected in prices.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Albedo is trying to buy Reflections Oasis, which holds seven land parcels in Gelang Patah in Johor, for $774 million by issuing 34.6 billion shares.\n\nLeong Choon Meng, executive director for corporate finance at Infinite Rewards, pointed to the roping in of well-known names for the RTO deal as a signal of intent.\n\nAmong those that have been or will be appointed are PrimePartners Corporate Finance, Morgan Stanley Asia (Singapore), Deloitte & Touche and Lee & Lee. Representatives from some of these firms were also present yesterday, along with Albedo CEO Tai Kok Chuan.\n\nMr Leong said: \"If we are not serious about it, we would not be spending this kind of money. Trust me, these are good people and they don't come cheap.\"\n\nAgreeing, Mr Tai added that the entire development of all seven parcels will take up to 15 years, which is a show of commitment.\n\nTheir comments came amid a broad sell-down of penny stocks in recent days after regulators moved to curb what they saw may be speculative activity. Albedo fell from a high of eight cents on Sept 19, the day before the RTO was announced, to close at three cents on Monday. But the counter surged yesterday, gaining 40 per cent to end at 4.2 cents.\n\nMr Leong is confident of securing the permissions and development orders (DOs) required to convert the land parcels, currently designated for agriculture, for residential, industrial and commercial use, within a stipulated timeframe.\n\nThe parcels' valuation of $774 million is based on the DOs being approved.\n\nMr Leong said the plots have already been earmarked for conversion and that the company is experienced in the field. Infinite Rewards is backed by Malaysian tycoon Danny Tan, who owns Bursa-listed developer Tropicana Corporation.\n\nIf all goes well, the first parcel will get its DO in January, and the RTO is expected to complete in March after a shareholders' meeting. Development can then start on that first plot.\n\nBy March 2017, the DOs for the six remaining plots should have been obtained.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Business sentiment has risen strongly across a number of emerging markets, such as in Central Europe and Mexico, boding well for growth going forward.\n\n\"While growth rates are unlikely to return to previous highs, the period of EM growth deceleration is likely to end, at least at an aggregate level.\"\n\nThe IIF said the rise in US Treasury yields has been halted for now, at least temporarily, and EM bond spreads have declined from their recent highs, helped by the Fed's decision to delay the tapering of asset purchases.\n\n\"We expect capital inflows to gradually recover starting in the current quarter, albeit on a lower trajectory than projected in our June report,\" it said.\n\nCapital flows to emerging economies have been highly volatile recently, the report noted.\n\n\"A surge of inflows starting in the middle of last year was followed by a sharp reversal from mid-May 2013, prompted in part by a shift in market expectations towards an earlier normalisation of US monetary policy. But in the past several weeks, portfolio\n\ns have picked up again and in the immediate future, flows look set for a rebound, in part because the Fed has delayed its tapering of asset purchases.\n\n\"We project that this recovery will be sustained through 2014, barring any major shift in market views about the course of Fed monetary tightening,\" the report added.\n\nMeanwhile, external asset accumulation by emerging markets is projected to be quite robust this year at US$1,340 billion - about three-quarters of which are private-sector investments as opposed to official reserve accumulation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is reaching for the highest standards of all,\" he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak felt that the end of 2013 would be a \"very tight timeline\" for the TPP.\n\nSingapore Business Federation chief Ho Meng Kit said that a more realistic deadline would be a year from now, although much would depend on the \"political will\" to push through or reach a compromise on the outstanding issues.\n\nAt the end of their meeting, the TPP leaders will release a joint statement that is likely to say that they are \"on track\" to complete their work, with \"significant progress\" made in various fields such as tariff negotiations. A draft of the statement, seen by Japan's Kyodo News, also said that the final TPP agreement should take into account \"the diversity of our levels of development\", which hinted that emerging economies could be given some leeway in meeting targets in certain areas like investment rules.\n\nThe statement also said that TPP countries are open to the idea of allowing more countries to join them. China and South Korea are among those that have previously said they were studying whether to join the TPP talks. \"We are encouraged by the growing interest in this important negotiation and are engaging with other Asia-Pacific countries that express interest in the TPP regarding their possible future participation,\" the draft said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Rates still won't be high enough for owners to break even.\n\nShipping companies will demolish 23 very large crude carriers this year and scrapping will stay at about that level for the next three years, according to EA Gibson Shipbrokers, a brokerage in London. Daily rates will average US$22,000 in 2014, the mean of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News shows. While that's almost three times more than current earnings, it's still below the US$25,000 that Frontline, which operates 31 of the vessels, says it needs to cover costs.\n\nRates plunged as much as 97 per cent from their December 2007 peak of US$229,484 a day as the surge spurred the most orders for new ships since the 1970s, just before the global recession began. That generated the biggest capacity surplus since the mid-1980s and drove Overseas Shipholding Group and General Maritime to seek bankruptcy protection.

In the north of England, the country's most-volatile housing market, it's about one in five, according to property appraisal firm e.surv Ltd.\n\nHigh loan-to-value lending is poised to grow as Prime Minister David Cameron's government this week introduces mortgage guarantees designed to allow people to buy a home costing as much as \u00a3600,000 (S$1.2 million) with a down payment as low as 5 percent. That increases the risk of a borrowers' home value falling below the amount they owe if prices fall, or that they could default if interest rates rise.\n\n\"The UK banks are already sitting on mortgage lending that exposes them to great interest rate risk and default risk,\" according to Ismail Erturk, a senior lecturer on banking at Manchester Business School.\n\n\"Current government policy of Help to Buy, as well as quantitative easing by the Bank of England, make things worse because they both encourage banks to lend to an overvalued market.\"\n\nMr Cameron made reviving housing a centrepiece of his government's economic policy with the introduction of the Help to Buy programme this year.\n\nThe proposal has drawn a warning from the International Monetary Fund for its potential to stoke home price inflation, and it has been described as \"moronic\" by Societe Generale SA global strategist Albert Edwards for encouraging Britons to add to already high debt levels.\n\nThe first phase, interest-free loans for buyers of newly built homes, began in April and has already contributed to the strongest housing market since the financial crisis.\n\nThe second phase allows applications for mortgage guarantees to begin this week. Borrowers will only require a 5 per cent deposit because as many as 15 per cent of the purchase price will be jointly guaranteed by the lenders and the government. The guarantee is valid for seven years and lenders have to pay the government a fee for each mortgage it includes.\n\n\"There will be tough checks to make sure buyers can afford their mortgage payments and the borrowers income will be verified,\" the UK Treasury said on Sept 29.\n\nThe guarantee will be available to lenders until January 2017 and the government probably will cap its liability at \u00a312 billion, according to a March filing by the Treasury.\n\n\"These mortgages may well be affordable now, but interest rates have to go up at some point and peoples' circumstances could change,\" said Rob Wood, chief UK economist for Berenberg Bank.\n\nIt potentially increases the volatility of the market as and when this scheme is taken away and increases the risks people are taking, he said. \"The market is recovering anyway, it doesn't make any sense to have it recovering any faster than it already is,\" he said.\n\nUK lenders are already targeting the weakest housing markets with riskier loans as the London market is dominated by cash buyers. About 35 per cent of homes bought in the UK this year were paid for entirely with cash, according to data compiled by broker Savills plc. In London, it's as many as 60 per cent, with demand driven by purchasers from abroad who view the city as a safe haven, according to Richard Sexton, a director at e.surv, a unit of LSL Property Services plc.\n\n\"The London market is like a different country almost,\" Mr Sexton said. \"That's a lot of foreign cash coming in.\"\n\nGareth Hill, a spokesman for the Council of Mortgage Lenders, a trade association, declined to comment.

Despite a sputtering global economy, business sentiment remains positive for the final quarter of the year, said Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) Singapore's latest Business Optimism Index (BOI).\n\n\"Despite potential downside risks and uncertainties over the tapering of quantitative easing in the US, the outlook for Singapore is on course to remain positive for Q4,\" according to the BOI released yesterday.\n\nIt said all six leading business indicators are in the expansionary region for Q4, compared with five in the previous quarter.\n\nThe six indicators are net profits, volume of sales, inventory levels, selling prices, new orders and employment.\n\nFor Q3, five indicators were in expansion mode with selling prices unchanged, said Eugene Tan, D&B Singapore's marketing communications and product manager.\n\nThe BOI is a measure of business confidence in the economy, released quarterly, based on a business sentiment survey designed to capture business expectations. Each quarter, 200 business owners and senior executives representing major industry sectors across Singapore are asked if they expect increases, decreases or no changes in their upcoming quarterly sales, profits, employment, new orders, inventories and selling prices.\n\nThe industries polled are agriculture, construction, finance, manufacturing, mining, services, transport and wholesalers.\n\nThe positive sentiment for Q4 gels with a poll of economists conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore last month which indicated that the economy will expand 2.9 per cent this year, up from its forecast in June of 2.3 per cent.\n\nThis quarter, local firms remained most optimistic about the volume of sales and net profits as both indicators surged to 50.8 percentage points and 44.1 percentage points, respectively, said D&B Singapore.\n\nThis represents more than twice the increase compared to the previous quarter when net optimism levels for volume sales and net profits registered 18.3 percentage points each.\n\nInventory levels have also risen sharply to 29.2 percentage points, compared to a mere 2.5 percentage points in the third quarter.\n\nFollowing the recent government measures to give priority to local residents in the recruitment process, local firms have anticipated an increase in hiring over the next three months with a net optimism level of 30 percentage points.\n\nSelling prices also increased substantially to 16.7 percentage points after remaining unchanged in the third quarter, it said.\n\nMeanwhile, manufacturers have anticipated a marginally higher increase in new orders from 25 percentage points to 26.7 percentage points. Indeed manufacturing, which contributes about one-quarter to the economy, is the weakest sector.\n\nWhile factory output rose in August, industrial production fell by 1.4 per cent month-on-month.\n\nSingapore's purchasing managers' index (PMI) read 50.5 for September, unchanged from August's reading, but fell short of the market's consensus forecast for a reading of 51.2.\n\n\"While expected new orders are in the expansionary region this quarter, we are still cautiously optimistic about the coming months as growth within the sector is likely to remain modest. The PMI reported by the Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management last month is a sign that the manufacturing sector may not be regaining momentum any time soon,\" said Mr Tan.\n\n\"(Local) manufacturing seems to be the weakest link in terms of the outlook for the entire economy,\" said DBS economist Irvin Seah. Most other industries are relatively more buoyant, including transport and wholesalers, which while manufacturing-related, are growing stronger due to intra-regional orders, he said.\n\n\"Manufacturing is losing competitiveness, facing higher labour costs and profit erosion,\" he said.\n\nA year-on-year analysis further revealed that business confidence has improved significantly over the past year with five of six business indicators in the expansionary region, said D&B Singapore.\n\nWith the exception of new orders, all business indicators have risen over the past year. The most marked improvements were seen in the volume of sales and net profits as they increased by 40.8 percentage points and 34.8 percentage points, respectively.\n\nInventory levels, employment and selling prices have also increased slightly compared to a year ago by 21.3 percentage points, 19.1 percentage points and 15.1 percentage points, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, new orders contracted by 23.3 percentage points from the same quarter last year.\n\n\"Corporate optimism has remained strong despite the troubling signs of a sputtering economy globally. However, we should be mindful that while pessimism is relatively low, a large proportion of firms are not expressing optimism. Whether it is the volume of sales or hiring prospects, we are witnessing a status quo for many businesses here for the fourth quarter.\" cautioned Audrey Chia, D&B Singapore's chief executive.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is down from the initial offer price of up to 23.38 pesos per share.\n\nResorts World Manila, which opened in August 2009, features a casino, three hotels, a shopping mall, cinemas and a performing-arts theatre. The IPO proceeds will be used to fund more casino-related developments and for general corporate purposes.\n\nTravellers plans to raise 18.7 billion pesos through a share sale of 1.57 billion shares. But that excludes a greenshoe option or an overallotment option of up to 236 million shares, which, if taken, would lift the total issue to 21.5 billion pesos, according to the company's term sheet. The company will set the final pricing of the listing on Oct 17.\n\nOf the 1.57 billion share offering, up to 1.1 billion shares are being offered in an international offer outside of the Philippines, and up to 471.9 million shares are being offered in the Philippines to PSE brokers and the general public.\n\nTravellers is planning to use the IPO proceeds to finance capital and project expenditures for its Phase 2 and 3 expansion projects at Resorts World Manila. Phase 2 will involve construction of the Marriott Grand Ballroom and the Marriott West Wing, while Phase 3 will involve expansion of Maxims Hotel as well as the construction of two new hotel properties - the Hilton Manila and the Sheraton Hotel Manila - to address room supply shortage. According to its IPO prospectus, Travellers expects that these additional rooms will allow it to increase the number of table games, slot machines and electronic table games (ETGs) by 285, 1,710 and 1,710, respectively.\n\nAs at June 30, Travellers has 5,116 full-time employees, including 1,868 dealers at Resorts World Manila's gaming areas.\n\nThe Genting Group, through its affiliate Genting Hong Kong, has a 50 per cent effective interest in Travellers (prior to the completion of the IPO) and owns other leisure and gaming developments in Asia and worldwide.\n\nAfter the IPO is completed, Genting Hong Kong's effective interest in Travellers is expected to be diluted to 45 per cent (if the overallotment option is not exercised) or 44.3 per cent (if the option is fully exercised). Each of the existing shareholders in Travellers holding at least 10 per cent of its outstanding shares before the IPO, will, under PSE rules, be subject to a lock-up of 180 days after listing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Lee has had some 27 years experience in the investment management industry, including stints at GIC; Morgan Grenfell; and Commerzbank Asset Management Asia as managing director and chief investment officer.\n\nThe buyer is Azimut Group which manages roughly 21 billion euros (S$35.5 billion) in assets. Subject to regulatory approval, Azimut, through AZ International Holdings SA, will own a majority stake in Athenaeum.\n\nIn a statement, Athenaeum says the partnership aims to maximise the potential of Athenaeum's existing funds and develop an internal sales structure to service international and high net worth investors in South-east Asia. The partners will also leverage on Azimut Group's international presence to offer Athenaeum's investment management expertise to international clients.\n\nMs Lee declined to be specific on Athenaeum's assets under management, saying only that it is \"under US$100 million\".\n\nAthenaeum's flagship Asian Equities Fund was incepted in June 2008.

Seah Kian Peng, CEO of NTUC FairPrice, said that besides premium products and services, the outlet will also provide daily groceries at the same prices offered at all FairPrice supermarkets.\n\nThe 99-year leasehold Seletar Mall has a total of four shopping levels above ground and two basement levels, with about 390 carpark lots. It sits at the junction of Sengkang West Avenue/Fernvale Road and has a net lettable area of about 188,000 sq ft.\n\nThe mall will be connected to Fernvale LRT station and will serve about 750,000 residents and 47,000 workers within five kilometres, including those from the Seletar Aerospace Park which is also expected to be completed next year.\n\nSPH and UE's 70:30 tie-up, Earth Holdings, beat 11 other bidders for the site last January after putting in an offer of $328 million, or $1,156 per sq ft per plot ratio, which was 20.5 per cent higher than its closest competitor.\n\nAfter its completion, the mall is expected to be sold to SPH Reit, the real estate investment trust sponsored by SPH that currently holds Paragon and Clementi Mall in its portfolio.\n\nSPH chairman Lee Boon Yang had said at SPH Reit's listing ceremony in July that The Seletar Mall was identified as the first pipeline asset for the trust, so as \"to provide investors with clarity of growth\".\n\nSPH Reit closed 0.5 cent higher yesterday at 97.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It ended at 13 cents, down 75 cents or 85 per cent lower. More than 115 million shares were traded.\n\nGold miner LionGold, which requested that trading in its shares be halted pending an announcement, resumed trading only at 2.45pm. Its shares ended at 25 cents, after falling 62.5 cents or 71 per cent; a total of 45.7 million shares changed hands.\n\nUntil the SGX suspended their trading last Friday, the three counters had had strong run-ups in their stock prices this year; the regulator said it believed that the market might not have been fully informed of the companies' circumstances amid the plunge in their share prices.\n\nOn Sunday evening, SGX declared shares of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold designated securities, barring investors from short-selling the stocks and requiring them to pay for the transactions upfront with cash.\n\nIt allowed the counters to resume trading yesterday.\n\nTraders The Business Times spoke to cited the SGX curbs as the reason for the sharp fall in prices. A broker who requested anonymity said: \"There are not enough buyers in the market. Even though there are people who want to buy, they are prevented (from doing so) because they have to put money upfront with the brokers.\"\n\nHe said the SGX should have halted trading for a few more days to give these investors time to secure cash, as banks are usually closed on Sundays: \"At the very least, (SGX) should have given a day or two for people who are willing to buy to deposit funds with the brokers and get the funding in place.\"\n\nAt broking firms, many were unclear about whether cheques received for trading in the affected counters could or should be accepted, said the head of the dealings team at a listed brokerage. Clients were told to rush to banks to withdraw cash instead.\n\nIn the backroom, officers were nervous about the huge amounts of cash they were handling amid the uncertainty over the counters. \"It's very ridiculous because we're dealing with such large amounts of cash, like $100,000 or $200,000,\" he said.\n\nRemisiers and brokerages were also worried over the losses they could be saddled with if clients with unsettled contra positions on the suspended stocks could not or refused to pay for their stock purchases.\n\nBT understands that UOB Kay Hian, the largest stockbroking firm here, had on Sept 26 restricted the online trading of 14 stocks and covered warrants, which included some of the stocks suspended by SGX.\n\nThe fear now is that broking houses which had not put curbs on the affected stocks could face sizeable defaults if clients cannot or do not want to pay up. These losses could end up on stockbrokers' laps.\n\nA trader at a local brokerage said: \"Someone's got to lose.\n\n\"Take Blumont for example. Its market capitalisation fell from $6 billion to less than $500 million. Just on the surface, there are at least $5.5 billion of losses out there.\"\n\nThe panic triggered by these counters caused a sell-down in small stocks such as Albedo, CNA Group, EMS Energy and Mirach Energy as investors turned skittish. \"The general sentiment has been badly hit,\" the trader said.\n\nEMS Energy, which is riding the crest of rising demand for offshore oil-and-gas equipment, finished about 25 per cent lower at 5 cents; CNA Group fell about 24 per cent to 12.3 cents, and Mirach Energy, about 28 per cent to 27.5 cents.\n\nShares that suffered in the wake of the suspensions included Innopac Holdings, which lost 29 per cent in trading yesterday; ISR Capital dropped 30 per cent and ISDN Holdings, 13 per cent.\n\nBefore its trading resumed yesterday afternoon, LionGold announced that it was at \"an advanced stage of negotiations\" to acquire Minera IRL, a gold explorer in Peru, Argentina and Chile; it said that there is no certainty the acquisition would proceed. It had said last month that it was in talks to buy three gold mining assets.\n\nBlumont also wrote to SGX yesterday morning to request for a trading halt to \"help in the maintenance of an orderly market\". Noting that the SGX had announced only on Sunday evening the resumption of trading, it said that this had not given investors enough time to top up cash in their accounts, or given the company a chance to explain its position to shareholders.\n\nThe regulator turned down its request.\n\nBlumont has called for a press briefing at 2pm today.\n\nThe ripples have spread to Australia, where LionGold has spent the last 11/2 years acquiring some of Australia's \"most marginal gold assets\" in exchange for its own shares, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nLionGold's preference for scrip transactions has given many Australian investors exposure to the Singapore company, the paper said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The firm commitment has a value of US$9.5 billion at list price, while customers typically secure rebates. Japan Air also has an option to purchase 25 more.\n\nAirbus's biggest A350 order so far this year gives the European manufacturer a break into Japan, where the fleets of ANA Holdings Inc and Japan Air, the country's two biggest carriers, are dominated by Boeing. Japan Air choosing Airbus comes after the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was delayed by years and grounded globally early in 2013 after battery malfunctions.\n\n\"This is the blue-chip order Airbus was hoping for,\" said Will Horton, an analyst at CAPA Centre for Aviation in Hong Kong. \"The order certainly opens the door for follow up orders at Japan Airlines. If ANA orders Boeing, it will have to stress why the Boeing deal was better - the market will now be sensitive to who you order from.\" Airbus was negotiating with ANA and Japan Air, also known as JAL, to sell its A350-1000, three people familiar with the talks told Bloomberg News in May. The order announced yesterday is the largest yet from a Japanese carrier for Airbus, and entry into service will commence in 2019, according to Airbus.\n\n\"Achieving this breakthrough order and entering a traditional competitor market, was one of my personal goals and I am very proud to be leading the team who has accomplished this great success,\" Mr Bregier said.\n\nANA, Japan's largest airline, said last month it's pitting the new jets of Toulouse, France-based Airbus and the US planemaker against each other, and will make a decision on an order soon.\n\nAirbus's A350 had its maiden flight earlier this year and the first variant is set to enter service by in 2014, with the largest model slated for late 2017. The planemaker has said the A350-1000 will offer 25 per cent better operating economics than Boeing's 777-300ER. The aircraft has logged more than 300 test flight hours to date, Mr Bregier said.\n\nThe A350-1000 has a list price of US$332.1 million and the 900 has a price tag of US$287.7 million. Airbus also offers a smaller variant, the A350-800, which together with the 900 version is targeted at the 787 Dreamliner, while the largest type is a competitor to Boeing's successful 777 wide-body.\n\nAirbus has been gaining market share in Japan recently as low-cost carriers lease its planes. Both Peach Aviation Ltd and Jetstar Japan Co use Airbus planes.\n\nJAL had 166 of the Chicago-based company's jets, or 78 per cent, of its fleet of 214 planes, as of the end of June. The carrier also had 25 Bombardier Inc aircraft, 12 jets from Empresa Brasileira de Aeronautica SA, and 11 made by Saab AB. ANA, whose fleet is also dominated by US-made planes, had 199 Boeing jets, or 84 per cent of its fleet of 238 planes, as of Sept 20, according to ANA.\n\nJapan remains an anomaly for Airbus. Sales chief John Leahy called Airbus's shortcomings in Japan \"my only failure\", and chief executive officer Tom Enders also said in 2011 he's been \"frustrated\" with business in the country.\n\n\"It's a landmark deal if Leahy pulls it off as Japan is one of the least-penetrated markets for Airbus, mostly due to politics than airline economics,\" Shukor Yusof, a Singapore-based analyst at Standard & Poor's said in an e-mail. \"It's a significant blow to Boeing and the 787 and reinforces our view that the A350 will be a gamechanger. I expect ANA will be tempted to get the A350s and possibly even A380s.\"\n\nJapanese carriers flew 43 Airbus jets at the end of 2012, up from 36 a year earlier, according to the Japan Aircraft Development Corp. ANA and its affiliate Peach Aviation are the main carriers using the European planemaker's aircraft. In comparison, domestic carriers had 409 Boeing planes, excluding MD-90s, up from 397.\n\nSkymark Airlines Inc, Japan's biggest discount carrier, is the only Japanese airline that has agreed to buy Airbus wide-body planes, with an order for six A380s. The airline is due to start operation of its first double-decker next year.\n\nBoeing's stumbles on its 787 Dreamliner jet will drive Japanese customers to Airbus and help win the endorsement of local subcontractors that traditionally shunned Airbus as the risky upstart, Stephane Ginoux, Airbus's head of Japan, said in 2011.\n\nBoeing's ties to Japan stretch back to the country's post-World War II reconstruction, and local manufacturers have traditionally played a major role on aircraft for the US planemaker. Japanese companies designed and supplied 35 per cent of the 787 structure, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd supplying the wings and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd and Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd building part of the front fuselage section and centre wing boxes. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c2f3e946ef71051d178f3c91aa759b7e90741288039b0dfea357ba231339f600?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Score: Fabrice Bregier, CEO of Airbus, with Yoshiharu Ueki, president of JAL, at a press conference announcing the deal in Tokyo yesterday. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

Such conflicts invariably arise because different political parties to the President control part or all of Congress. At present it's the Republican-controlled House against the Democrat-controlled Senate and President Barack Obama. Such conflicts seem worse lately because the GFC and the response to it seems to have polarised many politicians to extreme positions.\n\nThe current dispute is around the failure to pass a new budget for the financial year beginning Oct 1 (hence the shutdown) and the need to raise the US government's debt ceiling (which is expected to be reached by Oct 17). It has its origins in the Republican dislike for President Obama's health care reforms (Obamacare) and the failure of the fiscal cliff resolution early this year to embrace a \"grand bargain\" reducing America's long-term budget deficit by closing tax loopholes and cutting back on the growth of entitlements. Obviously the consequences of the US not increasing its debt ceiling and defaulting on its debt would be bad - and many have said, catastrophic. Failure to make a debt servicing obligation will see the US sovereign rating lowered to \"Selective Default\" (according to Standard and Poor's) as Greece was recently. Such an event would most likely see a sell-off in US government bonds, a flow on to the borrowing costs of all US corporates and a stigma that may take the US years to recover from - as Argentina and Russia have found. And, of course, not increasing the debt ceiling would mean the budget deficit of 4 per cent of GDP would have to be eliminated immediately resulting in massive fiscal drag. All of which would affect confidence and hence, economic growth.\n\nHowever, the odds strongly favour a solution being found and a debt default being avoided, but the next few weeks could be uncertain. US government shutdowns are far from new and arise when Congress fails to pass laws funding government spending. In fact, there were 17 shutdowns between 1976 and 1996, lasting an average 7.4 days, with the median shutdown lasting 4 days.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/heavy-signalling-traffic-may-be-bane-telcos", "site_title": "Heavy signalling traffic may be a bane to telcos", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHeavy signalling traffic may be a bane to telcos\n\nAn overload can lead to poor performance or a network crash\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Oct 6, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] As fourth generation mobile communication technology (4G) gains momentum across Asia, telcos will struggle with not just heavy traffic demand from smartphones and tablets, but also signalling storms that can crash their networks, warns Robert Pizzari, F5 Networks' director of Service Provider Sales for Asia-Pacific and Japan.\n\nThe heavy traffic comes with mobile devices making multiple connections to the network, such as when accessing applications, downloading data, roaming and even when switching between an idle and an active mode; these connections, especially social networking updates that constantly poll the network, generate a lot of signalling traffic.\n\nAnd, as revenue generating services increase, the need to track the data usage of simultaneous applications, manage policies and enable real-time transaction and authorisation bumps up the signalling volume. An overload can then lead to poor performance or a network crash.\n\nMr Pizzari points out that, while signalling storms have plagued 3G networks before, they are expected to worsen with 4G networks generating about 20 times more signalling traffic.\n\nFor example, Japanese mobile phone operator NTT Docomo reportedly experienced an outage last year due to smartphone signalling, leaving 2.5 million customers in Tokyo without service for about 4.5 hours.\n\nJoe Hoffman, research director at ABI Research, says that a network outage at a top-tier operator could put some US$300 million of revenue at risk.\n\nHe notes that a number of network operators are turning to solutions such as Diameter signal routing, which he likens to a traffic cop routing signals properly and ensuring they do not overwhelm any particular network element. In LTE (Long Term Evolution), Diameter is a protocol used for signalling across all core network elements, and is crucial to billing, traffic and subscriber management, subscriber authentication, roaming and mobility management.\n\nSingapore's mobile and fixed communications services provider M1 - the first operator in South-east Asia to offer nationwide 4G - has turned to F5's Traffix Signaling Delivery Controller (SDC) Diameter system to ensure consistent network reliability and tight control, as well as high quality LTE roaming services.\n\nAccording to F5, the SDC provides context-aware routing, load balancing and seamless connectivity to legacy 2G/3G network elements. Its scalability allows LTE services and applications to support up to hundreds of millions of subscribers. With subscribers now interacting with different types of networks (3G, 4G LTE) and protocols, the SDC also offers network visibility and centralised management for immediate identification and prevention of service issues.\n\nResearch and consulting firm ARCchart estimates that, given the rising demand for Diameter signalling control solutions, the market for such solutions will reach almost US$500 million by the end of 2017, representing a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 90 per cent over the next four years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This raised the unit's energy orders to above $140 million.\n\n\"The $140 million in energy orders so far significantly surpasses the value of energy orders secured for the whole of FY2013,\" said Wong Yu Loon, Boustead executive director responsible for the division. \"The outlook for this division remains bright as we actively pursue enquiries globally to provide our specialist expertise in process heater systems, waste heat recovery units and process control systems.\"\n\nBoustead - a global infrastructure-related engineering services and geo-spatial technology group - said that the latest contracts are for the design, process engineering and construction of waste heat recovery units, and process heater system installation services for upstream and downstream oil and gas developments, primarily in Norway and Russia.\n\nThe group's order backlog now stands at $523 million.\n\nThe latest deals are not expected to have a material impact on the profitability, earnings per share and net asset value for FY2014.\n\nIn August, the group reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $128.7 million and net profit attributable to owners of the company of $17.7 million, a year-on-year increase of 14 per cent and 45 per cent respectively. The energy-related engineering unit posted revenue of $34 million, up 38 per cent. The division's revenue growth was generated by the upstream and downstream oil & gas businesses, said Boustead.\n\nThe group said then that it expected profits in FY2014 \"to remain satisfactory but unlikely to match the record level achieved in FY2013\".\n\nBoustead shares closed trading yesterday 0.5 cent lower at $1.345.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It made $447.3 million in revenue last year, and currently has about 850 outlets in 15 countries,\n\nThe bold ambition puts to shade the earlier goal of having 1,000 BreadTalk bakery outlets by 2014, a plan announced just in September last year.\n\nOf the 2,000 proposed outlets, 1,800 will be accounted for by the BreadTalk brand alone, said its chairman George Quek in an interview with BT. And China will be a key part of the expansion strategy. \"China will be the most important place for us to deepen our presence. To reach 2,000 outlets, China alone will have 1,000,\" Mr Quek said in Mandarin.\n\nThe group is now present in 49 cities in the country, with only one to five outlets in some cities. \"So we have a lot of room to grow in terms of expansion,\" he added.\n\nThe firm runs Din Tai Fung restaurants, Carl's Jr burger outlets and Food Republic food courts in China, where it first set up shop in 2003.\n\nEven so, not all has been smooth sailing there. In its most recent second-quarter results, BreadTalk recorded an impairment loss of $1 million from the closure of three Carl's Jr stores in Shanghai.\n\nMr Quek explained: \"While managing Carl's Junior in China, we discovered that over there, you have to offer a smaller, lower value type of breakfast. But Carl's Junior is about juicy and big burgers.\"\n\nThe slow process of applying to Carl's Jr in the US to make the necessary changes proved a hassle for the group as it was managing so many other brands at the same time.\n\nAfter discussing with Carl's Jr, it was agreed that BreadTalk would trim its stake in the franchise from 60 per cent to 40 per cent, and hand over the management and operations of the outlets.\n\n\"They have put a lot of resources in China. BreadTalk is unable to focus on Carl's Jr, hence we gave the control back to them to develop the brand,\" said Mr Quek. \"Our role (now) is to open the way for them with the relationships we have established in China.\"\n\nBut even as it looks to entrench itself in China, the group is not forgetting its roots.\n\nIn Singapore itself, another core market for the group, it plans to double its current count of 100 BreadTalk outlets - in sharp contrast to many food and beverage firms which have cited the current manpower crunch to put their expansion plans on hold.\n\nTo this, Mr Quek said: \"I think people have a very strong ability to adapt ... I can't say that the manpower crunch hasn't been a problem for us.\n\n\"It has indeed caused some concern for BreadTalk, but I tell my staff that I don't want to listen to the problem, I want to solve the problem. The government's policy on foreign labour is very clear ... This policy won't change, so we'll have to adjust to it.\"\n\nThe group has therefore spent $8 million on machines that can make dough and fold croissant rolls in its central kitchen in the new headquarters. Productivity has increased: while five people could make 100 frozen portions of dough in the past, two could make 300 now.\n\nMr Quek reckons that there are also other benefits: \"With fewer staff, you have more resources to improve their salary.\"\n\nInvestors seem to like what Mr Quek is doing, as shares have climbed 33.8 per cent so far this year to 91 cents on Friday. The stock hit $1.16 on April 3 amid speculation of a possible privatisation. Thai hospitality and F&B player Minor International - which owns the ThaiExpress chain in Singapore - had been raising its stake in the firm progressively since January. It now holds 11 per cent of the stock, making it the third largest shareholder after Mr Quek and his wife.\n\nBreadTalk chief financial officer Lawrence Yeo then told BT that both companies had not been in contact. Both have since started discussions, Mr Quek revealed.\n\n\"Minor group has vast resources in Thailand - restaurants, property, F&B brands. So of course they hope for a brand to cooperate with them. We are still exploring that possibility with them,\" he said. \"If Minor group can add value, I don't rule out the possibility of a joint venture to expand even faster there.\"\n\nMr Quek was, however, quick to dispel speculation of a possible takeover. \"We frequently get a lot of people knocking on the door to ask if we want to sell the company or give up part of our stake. As the majority shareholder and founder, I've never thought of selling my stake,\" he said unequivocally.\n\nFor the next three to five years, the firm will focus on deepening and improving its current brands and to increase efficiency and profit. This, of course, will be underpinned by its philosophy of staying different.\n\n\"If you go to China you'll see a lot of first generation 'BreadTalks'. What we do, people follow. But we can push ourselves to keep learning and moving forward,\" said Mr Quek. \"They can copy your first or second generation outlets, but not the newest generation. Every three to four years, we come up with a new concept. So BreadTalk keeps innovating, learning, trying, creating.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Among those with policies, 24 per cent make exceptions for executives, who may handle even more sensitive data.\n\nAs the use of mobile devices and the need for easy file sharing and access continues to rise, Acronis is among a growing number of vendors offering solutions aimed at reducing enterprise vulnerability to data loss and serious compliance issues.\n\nThe data back-up and recovery solutions provider, which added secure file access and file sharing solutions to its portfolio through the acquisition of GroupLogic last year, estimates the mobile file management market to be at US$0.9 billion.\n\nIt has just launched its latest mobile file management solution that allows users to securely access content on corporate file servers, SharePoint and network attached storage with their Apple or Android devices just as they would via their laptop or desktop.\n\nThe solution includes free in-application editing tools for Microsoft Office so there is no need to purchase separate, potentially insecure applications that might compromise the integrity of sensitive data.\n\nIt also provides an enterprise solution for employees to sync and share their own individual work files between their own devices (desktop, laptop and mobile devices), and share and collaborate on their individual files with colleagues and with external parties.\n\nAcronis is looking particularly to the Asia-Pacific and Japan (APJ) region for accelerating its growth, where it expects to generate half of its total revenue by 2014, said its Russian-Singaporean chief executive officer Serguei Beloussov, who is also its co-founder and board chairman.\n\nCurrently, the region contributes to a third of its global revenue. Singapore, which serves as the APJ headquarters, makes up about 20 per cent of sales in Asia.\n\nTo achieve its ambitious growth target, Acronis is also targeting medium-sized businesses which Mr Beloussov said are beginning to realise the importance of having a full back-up and recovery solution.\n\n\"In the past, especially in Asia, the mid-sized businesses typically used just point solutions for backing up only certain parts of the data. They were not backing up data in all end points, servers and applications, not that often, and sometimes not in a sophisticated fashion. But they are starting to have company-wide data protection policies,\" noted Mr Beloussov.\n\nAcronis' offerings provide back-up and recovery for Windows and Linux machines, files and application databases, across physical, virtual and cloud environments.\n\nIt is also providing cloud solutions for managed service providers and system integrators to offer back-up and storage as a service to medium-sized companies. Mr Beloussov expects that cloud solutions will drive 80 per cent of Acronis' total business in 10 years' time.\n\nMr Beloussov is not forgetting the consumer market, where Acronis first established itself with its True Image back-up and recovery products for personal use, before expanding to selling business products.\n\nIt is injecting more engineering and marketing resources to strengthen its consumer brand, which currently makes up some 15 per cent of its overall revenue.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Thai capital's luxury district is the inplace to be. By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Oct 4, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nUNLIKE Singapore, trees in Bangkok are an elusive bunch. So much so that the Asian Green City index measured just 3 sq m of green for each person in the metropolitan area last year - against an average of 39 sq m for other cities and 66 for Singapore alone. What few trees you do find are straggly and weak - no match for the relentless spew of traffic fumes, and not much for shade either. So they stand alone and ignored, kind of like the city's stray dogs - dusty, unkempt and unloved.\n\nBut there is a flip side to this scenaro. You can find pockets of green in the Thai capital if you know where to look - prized finds in quiet residential sois, small lovingly-tended parks or, in the case of the Royal Bangkok Sports Club, a sprawling 18-hole golf course smack in Central Bangkok.\n\nYou can see it while on the BTS Skytrain running from Siam Station to Silom - an unexpected swathe of green amidst glitzy malls and concrete detritus that give Bangkok its pulsating, squalor-chic heart. Already impressive from a distance, it's worth scoring an invitation to visit by a club member - so you can enjoy the view over a languid lunch of home-style Thai cooking at its outdoor cafe. The club itself is an institution - the Thai version of Singapore's SICC - steeped in old-world charm and privilege, playground of the city's elite that sits on prime royal-owned land; and probably a sore point with the less well-connected masses who live and work beyond its landscaped boundaries.\n\nUnderstated elegance\n\nYou can see just how big the club is from the upper floors of the Hansar Hotel - a trendy all-suite abode on Rajdamri Road, designed by Singapore architects WOHA as an eco-friendly tropical structure that works plant life, natural lighting and ventilation into a streamlined space that doesn't compromise on comfort or amenities. It's all understated elegance in boutique surroundings - no noisy tour groups congregating in the lobby here - while at the same time offering a fresh twist to a conventional hotel stay.\n\nBy the same token, it prods regular visitors to Bangkok to look at this oft-visited city in a new light. Hansar, for one, is poised on the edge of Central Bangkok that is steadily shaping its own identity as the luxury district of the Thai capital. Most people are already familiar with the teeming, steaming streets of Yaowarat - Bangkok's Chinatown and source of street food delights/hygiene challenges; the fast fashion hotspot of Siam Square; the bars of Sukhumvit or the myriad temples in Rattanakosin. But the near perfect square formed by the roads of Ploenchit, Wireless, Rama IV and Rajdamri offers within its perimeter a compact destination for subscribers of an upscale lifestyle.\n\nEven if you fail to enjoy the greenery of the sports club up close, there is more than enough to compensate at Lumpini Park on Rama IV, between Rajdamri and Witthayu Road. Most people know it as the home of Suan Lum night bazaar, without realising it's actually attached to a 57ha green lung complete with a man-made lake and occasional natural-born monitor lizard. The night market is long gone but the park's appeal is strong with both locals and health-conscious expats who jog regularly from one of the numerous luxury condos in the vicinity.\n\nThese expats and the growing well-heeled travel market are fuelling the demand for upscale products and services in Central Bangkok, and both hotel and retail operators are quick to ramp up supply. Central World - the mega-shopping and dining complex which was once devastated by fire, has come back swinging with enough retail options to boggle the mind. For the happening crowd, Heaven is where it's at - perched atop the Zen World Tower which houses the coolest collection of restaurants and cocktail bars high enough to offer a panoramic view of the city. Every taste from international dining to Japanese is catered to, and Shintori is shaping up to be a favourite with its modern take on Japanese/Asian cuisine. The fusion is fun and tasty -the Peking duck roll, for example, is a successful deconstruction of the classic Chinese pancake, morphing into a bite-sized wrap of tender roast duck slices rolled into Vietnamese rice paper, artfully drizzled with sauce and complemented by cubes of tender ox tongue.\n\nIf you're staying at Hansar, which boasts its own compact kitchenette, the option of in-room dining takes on new meaning when you bring home culinary delights from Central Chidlom department store's massive food hall.\n\nIndigenous flavour\n\nThe entire world is represented in this award-winning food emporium housed in the newly renovated department store that has swopped its previous old-fashioned demeanour for a tricked out tribute to urban tastes. The fast food options attached to the supermarket are not worth your while, but the fresh food, fruit and vegetables - including a comprehensive take-out section comprising local curries, snacks and condiments - are worth staying in your hotel room for.\n\nIf you fancy local handicraft to take home with you, ignore the myriad makeshift stalls that line the streets around Erawan and grab a tuk-tuk to DoiTung Lifestyle's new flagship store and gallery on Rama IV Road. It's a well-stocked repository of intricately woven scarves, apparel, ceramics and home accessories made under the auspices of the Mae Fah Luang Foundation which was started by the late Thai Princess Mother in the 1970s to offer opium farmers in the Golden Triangle an alternative trade. Not only did her work transform the way of life for these farmers and craftsmen, it's created a line of products acclaimed for their quality and design. You can spend a couple of hours here exploring the history of the foundation as well as browsing the comprehensive range of products from DoiTung coffee and macadamia nuts (in addictive flavours like wasabi and seaweed) to lovely table runners and rugs.\n\nAs an additional reward for making the short trip, there's afternoon tea at the new St Regis hotel for sustenance, or a spa treatment. Or if you're smitten with the lifestyle on offer in the area, you could even make an appointment to view one of the hotel's residential apartments that start at a mere 99 million baht (S$3.9 million). If that sounds pricey, think about what it would cost to buy a similar property in say, Central London, or even Hong Kong's Central district.\n\nBesides, where else can you find happy, well-adjusted trees, co-existing with luxury hotels, malls and upscale condos all in one compact neighbourhood? Bangkok is a city of surprises but maybe the biggest one is to discover a distinctive neighbourhood taking shape right in front of our eyes.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There were also several significant corporate shareholder trades in the Sept 30-Oct 4 week with insider buys in Innopac Holdings, IEV Holdings and Neo Group. As for fund managers, FMR LLC made purchases in Sino Grandness Food and Matthews Capital in Ascendas India Trust.\n\nGenerally, the week's filings on Singapore Exchange showed a rebound in directors' buying while selling fell. A total of 14 companies recorded 22 purchases worth $9 million versus five firms with seven disposals worth $64.47 million. The number of companies and value on the buy side were up from the previous week's 11 firms and $4.58 million. The number of purchases were not far off from the previous week's 24 acquisitions.\n\nOn the sell side, the number of firms and trades were down from the previous week's eight companies and 14 disposals. The sell value was sharply up from the previous week's $4.2 million. The higher value was due to sales by non-executive director Yu Kebing in commercial vessels producer Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings of 55.2 million shares worth $61.8 million.

The 33-year-old left the St Regis earlier this year and opened the 40-seater Fleur de Sel three weeks ago on Tras Street.\n\n\"It's been a dream since I started cooking at four years old,\" laughs the chummy and instantly likeable chef whose family runs a food manufacturing business in France. It helps, perhaps, that Paris-born, Antibes-raised Mr Lozachmeur cooks with a strong Mediterranean flair, so it spares his dishes from falling into the butter and cream-laden French food stereotype.\n\nClassic recipes from the South of France take up 80 per cent of the menu, such as the mackerel with capsicum lightly sauteed with olive oil, garlic herbs, or the monkfish with bouillabaise and fennel salad. Even the conventionally lobster bisque gets a lighter hand: the lobster broth is only seasoned with cream and butter at the end, rather than reduced with a heavy cream as traditional recipes decree, Mr Lozachmeur reveals.\n\nThe menu will evolve seasonally, and dishes will always be created to showcase a prime ingredient, which is why you get a menu that reads like a French language novice's vocabulary chart, with listings such as \"The Mushroom\", \"The Lobster\" or \"The Duck\" in French.\n\nThe influence is something he picked up from Alain Ducasse, says Mr Lozachmeur, who trained with the revered Michelin-starred French chef for six years before moving to Singapore in 2005. Mr Lozachmeur later helped to set up the At-Sunrice cooking academy, before moving on to stints at Dolce Vita in the Mandarin Oriental hotel and at Hilton Singapore's now-defunct Harbour Grill. He also headed Dempsey restaurant, Au Petit Salut, briefly before working at The St Regis, which he left in March this year.\n\nFleur de Sel is solely owned by him and his Indonesian-Chinese wife, Feronika. They have two children, aged two and eight months. \"Running your own business is always risky, but it's less risky if I do it now than in two or three years, when I have to start paying school fees. Everyone knows raising children in Singapore is expensive,\" laughs Mr Lozachmeur.\n\nThe couple christened the restaurant Fleur De Sel as \"it's the finishing touch to any dish, and it's a widely recognised term that's easy for most Singaporeans to understand and pronounce,\" he explains.\n\nInteracting with guests is the whole aim, he says, which is why he's plugged in an entirely open 30 sq m kitchen by the back of the restaurant, with five counter seats alongside for those who want to get up close to the action.\n\nIn the main dining area, a small crew of wait staff - all former colleagues from his various hotel stints - are so attentive, they'll ask for feedback when plates are returned unfinished. Mr Lozachmeur himself can be seen personally serving dishes and shaking the hands of guests as they depart.\n\nLooking around the homely dark brown space bathed with sunlight from an airwell above, he quietly beams with the pride of a new father: \"Opening his own restaurant is every chef's ultimate dream, and this place is exactly how I imagined mine would look like.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A full-service long-haul rival, typically part of a big alliance, could have called for back-up from its allies.\n\nThe Nordic carrier this year became the only European budget airline to take on long haul, arguing that the Dreamliner, with a 20 per cent fuel saving, made it possible. Others, including carriers which have made a success of low-cost long-haul in Asia, doubt the business model for Europe, and are waiting to see how the experiment turns out before following suit.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

However, it maintained its \"hold\" rating as it plans to continue monitoring the global economic recovery, the rate of the consolidation among Chinese yards and signs of further monetary tightening in China that may hit the financing terms offered by the yards.\n\nMacquarie was a little more bullish, upgrading its rating to \"outperform\" and raising its target price to S$1.45 from S$0.85 on the prospects of a stronger pipeline of new orders to the tune of US$2.3 billion for this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A handful of cocktail bars and top ex-hotel chefs are slowly trickling in to build an up-and-coming dining community on the sleepy Chinatown lane. By Debbie Yong\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Fri, Oct 4, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSLEEPY Tras Street is waking up.\n\nOnce home to a string of bridal shops, blink-and-you'll-miss-it corporate offices and KTV bars that keep all their unmentionable activities indoors, the shophouse-lined Chinatown lane has been stirring with new activity in recent months. Shortly after former St Regis Hotel head chef Frederic Colin broke out to set up Brasserie Gavroche and Cafe & Bar Gavroche on the street 18 months ago, a string of former fine-dining and hotel chefs have gradually streamed in to set up shop, too.\n\nAmong them are Stephan Zoisl, formerly of modern European fine-dining restaurant Novus, who now runs private cooking school, My Private Pantry; Stephane Istel, formerly head chef at DB Bistro Moderne in the Marina Bay Sands who set up Bar-Roque Grill in the Amara Hotel in July; and Sushi Mitsuya's Ryusuke Harada, who used to head Sushi Sora in the five-star Mandarin Oriental Tokyo. \"When I first opened here, everyone asked me why I picked this street that has no other restaurants around, but I fell in love with the street and I trusted my feelings,\" says Colin.

A fare war has escalated with the entry of Malindo Air, a joint venture between Indonesia's Lion Air and Malaysia's National Aerospace and Defense Industries (Nadi), which debuted in March and has grown its fleet to nine aircraft.\n\nThe yield numbers for the two older airlines are telling: The regional average yield fell 3 to 4 per cent for the second quarter, but for MAS, the dip was 8.4 per cent, and for AirAsia, 7.8 per cent.\n\nMaybank-IB, predicting that the remaining months of the year will be as grim from a revenue and cost perspective, said yields will continue to be weak as the airlines battle for market supremacy against a backdrop of intensifying cost pressures.\n\nThe bank's aviation analyst Mohshin Aziz, in a sector report yesterday, said air fares on routes such as that between Kuala Lumpur and Kota Kinabalu, Kuching, Miri and Penang are the lowest he can remember. \"We think they are priced below cost.\"\n\nPassenger traffic in Malaysia grew by 15.5 per cent in the first eight months of the year to 51 million - second in the Asia-Pacific only to Thailand where it grew 16.8 per cent. The growth came on the back of legacy carriers MAS and AirAsia raising their capacity, and also from Malindo Air's entry.\n\nMr Mohshin said the yield declines of MAS and AirAsia are reminiscent of the shrinkages recorded during calamities of the same magnitude as the Sars epidemic or the global financial crisis.\n\nThe Malindo Effect notwithstanding, MAS has pursued a \"load active, yield passive\" strategy - even at the expense of yield compression - because it believes it is the key to returning to the black.\n\nThe national carrier is now cashflow positive, but, as Mr Mohshin noted, much of its success comes from fare dumping to spur traffic growth and raise its popularity profile.\n\nAnd because staying power is crucial, AirAsia - the most robust airline in the country because of its cost-efficiency and strong balance sheet - is more likely to endure and prosper when the dust settles. However, its profits may suffer in the interim, he said.\n\nThe analyst added that AirAsia's sister unit AirAsia X, which listed on July 9 and is now trading at a 12 per cent discount to its RM1.25 offer price, is least affected by the ongoing price war. The airline is benefiting from the strong market demand for long-haul, low-cost travel and is on track to post a profit this year.\n\nThe aviation sector is down 5.4 per cent year-to-date compared to the benchmark Composite Index's 5.7 per cent gain. In addition to rising fuel costs, the sector also faces a weakening ringgit and rising interest rates, making aircraft financing more expensive. Competition for skilled labour has also boosted wage inflation.\n\nGiven the cut-throat competition, it has become tough to pass on the cost increases to customers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite deep pockets, HNW buyers often seek the maximum loan to take advantage of current low interest rates, say agents.\n\nHowever, a year-end pick-up in deals is seen, led by purchases by Singapore permanent residents (PRs).\n\nNewsman Realty associate director Steve Tay said: \"Viewing activity started to pick up about one to two months ago. I believe we should see a few more deals before the year ends.\"\n\nSome agents say owners have generally softened on asking prices to factor in ABSD. However, Mr Tay said that asking prices for properties facing the sea or a golf course remain around $3,000 psf.\n\nLionel Loo, senior sales director at DTZ Resale, says that with the ongoing Golden Week holiday in China, agents have been busy showing homes in the upscale waterfront locale to high net-worth individuals from China. Sentosa Cove is the only place in Singapore where foreigners who are not PRs are allowed to buy a landed home, albeit subject to government approval.\n\n\"Hopefully, we'll seal a few transactions soon,\" says Mr Loo, who notes that the bungalow market in Sentosa Cove has generally been quiet since the start of this year. He adds, however, that this mirrors the pattern in the same period of last year, but there was a spurt of activity in the last few months of 2012, helped by the rollout of QE3 in the US.\n\nRecent bungalow transactions at Sentosa Cove include a house sold on Paradise Island for $15.5 million or $1,898 per square foot on land area of about 8,170 sq ft. The six-bedroom property, spread across two storeys and an attic, was bought by a European who is a Singapore permanent resident. A caveat has also been lodged for another house in the Kasara project along Ocean Drive on about 9,666 sq ft of land at $19.5 million or $2,018 psf. The buyer is believed to be a Singapore PR. Newsman Realty's Mr Tay is believed to have represented both the sellers.\n\nThere is also talk of a transaction done lately for about $16 million on Pearl Island.\n\nBuyers these days are mostly Singapore PRs with their business and family based here. Mr Tay says: \"Their motivation for looking for a bungalow on Cove is a house to live in, not for investment. Because they have a genuine reason to live in Singapore, they are able to justify paying the ABSD as part of their property cost.\"\n\nOn the other hand, a foreigner investing around the world but not based here, may baulk at having to pay ABSD and find better value in other property markets like the US and Australia, suggests Mr Tay.\n\nEffective Jan 12, 2013, non-PR foreigners pay 15 per cent ABSD for any Singapore residential property purchase - up from 10 per cent previously. PRs now pay 5 per cent ABSD on the first purchase and 10 per cent on subsequent ones. (Singapore citizens are spared ABSD on their first home purchase but pay 7 per cent on the second purchase and 10 per cent on subsequent purchases.)\n\nCBRE's analysis shows that PRs accounted for 54.5 per cent or six of the 11 caveats lodged so far this year for bungalow purchases on Cove. This is up from a 22 per cent share, or five of the 23 caveats last year, and 21 per cent share of the 24 caveats for 2011. In 2010, when bungalow deals on Cove peaked at 54, the PR share was 22 per cent.\n\nOne reason the PR buying share has risen is that the government no longer allows them to purchase landed homes in Good Class Bungalow Areas (GCBAs) on mainland Singapore. Prior to this rule change, said to have taken place sometime in second half 2012, PRs could buy a landed home in a GCBA with up to 15,000 sq ft land area.\n\nThere have also been anecdotes of foreigners becoming PRs prior to buying a landed home on Sentosa Cove to qualify for a lower ABSD rate, although market watchers add that criteria for obtaining PR status have been tightened in recent years.\n\nTransactions this year have been mostly below $20 million. According to CBRE's analysis of URA Realis caveats data, only four of the 11 caveats lodged for Sentosa Cove bungalow purchases so far this year have been at prices at or above $20 million. For the whole of 2012, 12 of the 23 deals were in this price band.\n\nThe latest transactions at above $20 million were for two nearby bungalows along Lakeshore View, facing Serapong Golf Course and a lake. One changed hands in June at $26 million or $2,922 psf and the seller is said to be Bioskin Holdings founder Mathilda Koh and the buyer, a mainland Chinese who is a PR.\n\nThe other transaction, in May, was at $24.8 million or $2,952 psf. It involved a sale by a Malaysian to an Indonesian who is a PR here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Her age, or her art?\n\nArt, of course, one can imagine her muttering under her breath, with a likely roll of her eyes. \"Once people recover from the shock of finding that I am not absolutely moronic at the age of 91, but totally normal, I trust I shall be judged on my art, not my age,\" she replies drily. Because she is a little hard of hearing, she chose to reply by email.\n\nBut it's hard not to be awed by the fact that she still exhibits in her age. Ms Malcomson moved to Singapore just last year because of family, but visited Singapore back in the 1950s. She has exhibited mostly overseas, in London especially, and this is her first solo exhibition in Singapore.\n\nA self-taught artist, she started painting only after an interesting career - which included army service in Britain, Canada and Germany, raising sheep in Australia and commercial interior design - and raising a family.\n\n\"Working life was too exciting and fulfilling to contemplate painting as well. It never crossed my mind to indulge!\" she relates, of her early years.\n\nMs Malcomson didn't pick up painting until 1980 - at the age of 58. She was accepted into the Royal Academy Annual Exhibition five years later.\n\nShe is \"still sufficiently old-fashioned\" to appreciate the works of Ivor Hitchens, Turner, Cotman, Vasarely, Francois Granet, Fred Cuming, Nicolas de Stael among so many others apart from contemporary artists such as Gerhardt Richter and the like.\n\nAs for contemporary art, she doesn't fully appreciate Tracey Emin's unmade bed, or Damien Hirst's pickled shark or bejewelled skull, \"other than from the point of capital financial appreciation\", she observes. \"To me it smacks more of commercialism or the power to shock rather than art.\"\n\nShe notes of course that art changes continually, and so does one's appreciation of it.\n\nThis current series is entitled Rebirth: Recent Works by Doris Malcomson, marking her transition from oils to mixed media.\n\nFor these works, the initial material she brought wasn't suitable for the Singapore weather. But then she had a large pack of photographs of pictures she had sold, posted to her from England. \"So I decided to try applying oils on the photographs. To my surprise it turned out to be a delightful surface!\"\n\n\"Sometimes I totally obscured the original painting, sometimes I left sufficient of the original to show through, whichever I thought appropriate.\" She let loose with her colour juxtaposed with land or seascapes.\n\nTo her, painting is like retreating into a little plastic bubble away from the stress and irritations of the world.\n\n\"I get totally absorbed in what I'm doing. I let the saucepans boil over, the telephone ring. When you start, it may take hours. And you may be dismayed at the outcome. It's really hard work, but not relaxing as it is frequently claimed!\"\n\nBut she clearly gets joy from it as evident from the colour on the canvas, and she is no less pleased with her success in using mixed media. With the mixed media, you don't think age but can only appreciate the contemporary use of colours and textures.\n\n'Rebirth: Recent works by Doris Malcomson' will be on show from Oct 4-12 at iPreciation Gallery, HPL House, 50 Cuscaden Road. Twenty per cent of the proceeds of her art works will be donated to the Autism Association. Gallery hours are 10am-7pm from Monday-Friday, and 11am-6pm, Saturday\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Daily average turnover for the quarter, however, dipped 0.4 per cent to $1.3 billion.\n\nOn the derivatives front, average daily trading volume for futures and options rose 27 per cent year-on-year in September to 462,293 contracts. For the quarter, the daily average rose 35 per cent to 415,397 contracts.\n\nTotal open interest for futures and options was 10.2 million contracts in the latest quarter.\n\nIt remains to be seen how these numbers will translate into dollars and cents at SGX, which will report its fiscal first-quarter results for the three months ended September on Oct 17.\n\nAt OCBC, head of research Carmen Lee noted that the average value per traded share of about 37 cents during the latest quarter is close to recent lows.\n\n\"Obviously, this would mean that despite the sharp spike in trading volume, interest was largely centred on the second and third liners on the exchange,\" Ms Lee said.\n\n\"As such, securities revenue should come off for quarter, and hopefully this is partially mitigated by slightly better listing fees (more IPOs). Overall, this muted mood looks likely to persist into the October to December quarter.\"\n\nAt Phillip Securities, however, analyst Ken Ang looked at contract values and noted a shift towards smaller contract values of less than $1.5 million. While the proportion of uncapped trades was just 54 per cent a year ago, in the latest quarter ended September that proportion was 65 per cent.\n\n\"Therefore despite the lower SDAV, year-on-year securities revenue should be higher, and this is for the short term,\" he said. \"For the long term, we are positive because we see equities as a strong asset class that will gain more interest, while acknowledging that markets might be quieter in the near term relative to the start of this year.\"\n\nMr Ang said more interest in equities will also benefit SGX's derivatives business, given the popularity of equity index futures and options. \"They will be affected by the performance of equities in certain key markets, such as Japan, China, Taiwan and India,\" he said.\n\n\"Those derivatives will do well when these equity markets gain more interest.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He also adds his own input - usually in the form of a mechanical gadget or toy as part of the drawing.\n\nCats, toys and nature are the three things which inspire his work, shares the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts graduate who runs a small graphic design company when he's not painting. This year, for his third solo exhibition at Utterly Art, he's focused on nature. \"Because there are so many (species) around us which are interesting but hardly anyone takes notice of them.\"\n\nFor him, though, it's not at all about scientific observation. So he's taken creative licence with his botanical drawings even though they do - at first glance - hark back to the Victorian tradition. \"It's really about happiness, and admiration of the plant by highlighting its details and beauty,\" he explains.\n\nHappiness is in fact key to his drawings; hence labelling his art collection Happiness Travel Unlimited. His pictures are in fact embedded with hidden meanings, such as reminders for viewers to spend time with loved ones and family.\n\n\"Singapore is such a driven society, but I want to encourage people to appreciate the little things in life and not to take them for granted,\" shares the 46-year-old.\n\nBesides graphic design and art, Sim's other passion in life is breeding American Shorthair cats. He chuckles: \"When I reached 40, I wanted to devote more time to painting. So my friend and I opened our own design firm, so that we could be more relaxed about things.\n\n\"Breeding cats itself is like an art - because you're looking for the right proportion, structure and colour. I also try to promote responsible ownership,\" he says.\n\nSim started exhibiting in fairs and group exhibitions about 10 years ago, and garnered enough collectors to warrant a solo show annually for the past five years.\n\n\"Collectors have come to identify my works under Happiness Private Limited, so I exhibit under that name. I label myself as a merchant of happiness, in fact,\" he grins.\n\n'Garden of Perennial Delights' will be showcased at Utterly Art Exhibition Space, 20B Mosque Street (Level 3), from Oct 11-20. Open by appointment from Mon-Sat, 2-8pm, and Sunday, 12-5.30pm. Contact Pwee Keng Hock at 9487-2006.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The weakest economic growth in a decade, the need to contain the budget deficit and a dip in trade are leading to the spending cuts, undermining Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's efforts to improve infrastructure that is ranked below Kazakhstan and Guatemala by the World Economic Forum.\n\n\"When the mega terminal project was conceived, the scenario was different from what prevails today,\" Chennai Port's Mr Misra said. \"Container volumes are shrinking and there's competition.\"\n\nMr Singh had approved the expansion of Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru Port, the nation's biggest container facility by volume, and Chennai Port in 2010 when exports jumped 37 per cent and imports surged 39 per cent. Two years later, inbound shipments grew 6.5 per cent and exports shrank 2 per cent, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThe delays in augmentation have added to congestion at state-controlled harbours including Chennai and Jawaharlal Nehru Port, while driving customers to alternative facilities run by private companies including Mumbai-based Larsen and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.\n\nThe average turnaround time for ships at Indian ports was about 4.2 days in April to August, compared with as quick as six hours in Singapore and Hong Kong, according to data provided by the Indian Ports Association. About 90 per cent of India's international trade by volume is carried through sea, according to the shipping ministry.\n\nThe long turnaround time at state-owned ports is increasing the appeal of private operators. Maruti Suzuki India, the nation's biggest carmaker, uses billionaire Gautam Adani- controlled Mundra Port on India's western coast, which boasts a 64 km private railway line and a four-lane flyover within the port to move cargo.\n\nIn contrast, choked facilities prompted Hapag-Lloyd AG, Germany's No 1 container shipping line, to levy a US$100 per TEU congestion surcharge on shipments to and from Chennai in 2011.\n\nShipments handled at Mundra more than doubled to 1.74 million TEUs in the five years to March 31. During the same period, traffic at Jawaharlal Nehru Port grew 8 per cent.\n\n\"If you have the right infrastructure, traffic will flow to you like water from the highland to lowland,\" said Anand Sharma, a director at Mumbai-based Mantrana Maritime Advisory, which advises shipbuilders and shipping lines.\n\n\"The government's plan didn't take the new private terminals into account. There's far too much supply than is needed today.\"\n\nOn the east coast, Navayuga-controlled Krishnapatnam Port started operating a facility in 2011 that can handle 1.2 million TEUs. In April, container vessels started calling at Larsen's facility at Kattupalli, 40 km north of Chennai.\n\nWith growth in the US$1.8 trillion economy slowing amid pressure to rein in the budget deficit at 4.8 per cent of gross domestic product and avert a ratings downgrade, Mr Singh's administration is cutting back the spending needed to improve its ports. The government slashed its planned expenditure that includes funds for roads, ports and power plants by 18 per cent in the financial year to March 31.\n\nShares of Adani Ports have risen 4.5 per cent this year, compared with a 1.8 per cent gain in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex, while Larsen, the nation's biggest engineering company, has slumped 24 per cent this year. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

These were purchases and sales of shares of Ipco International Ltd and Goldtron Ltd which did not involve any change in beneficial ownership.\n\nThe case for MAS was that the wash trades were intended or likely to create a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for, or the price of, the shares in the two corporations.\n\nMr Ong had also engaged in the wash trades to push up the last traded price of the shares to his desired target selling price, with the intent to induce other buyers to purchase the shares from him at that price.\n\nMr Ong had contravened sections 197 and 198 of the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), which prohibit false trading and market manipulation respectively.\n\nThe matter was referred to the MAS by the Singapore Exchange, and MAS commenced civil penalty court action against Mr Ong for a sum of $100,000 for the contraventions.\n\nMr Ong did not contest the action.\n\nA civil penalty action is not a criminal action and does not attract criminal sanctions. The civil penalty regime, designed to complement criminal sanctions and provide a nuanced approach to combat market misconduct, became operational at the beginning of 2004.\n\nMAS takes into consideration the degree of seriousness of the misconduct, the extent of impact of the misconduct on the market, the need for effective deterrence and other relevant characteristics of the case when deciding to undertake civil penalty enforcement action.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They must also comply with the laws and requirements that govern en bloc sale transactions.\"\n\nUnder the CEA's Code of Ethics and Professional Client Care, an estate agent is required to protect the interests of its client, be unaffected by its own interests, and not put itself in any position of conflict.\n\nWhen contacted yesterday, HSR declined to comment on the matter.\n\nLawyers for Thomson View CSC told BT that it will not be appealing against the High Court's decision to disallow the collective sale. As the CSC is unable to get court approval, it has informed the buyer, a joint venture between Wee Hur Development and Lucrum Capital (Wee Hur-Lucrum), that it will not be proceeding with the en bloc sale.\n\nReferring to the case, KhattarWong partner K Anparasan noted that even though it is not expressly stated that estate agents owe a fiduciary duty to the owners, it would appear that they do, at least, owe a duty of care to them.\n\nIn an earlier case, the Court of Appeal disallowed a $33 million en bloc sale for Harbour View Gardens after finding that its agent's offer of incentive payments \"with the knowledge and acquiescence of the CSC is conduct that is commercially unacceptable\". Justice Belinda Ang ruled that CSC members have a higher level of accountability and cannot \"enter into engagements in which their personal interests conflict... with the interests of those they are bound to protect\".\n\nInterestingly, in 2009, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by majority owners of Regent Garden who had opposed a $34 million collective sale to Allgreen Properties because they were unhappy that Allgreen made $2 million in incentive payments to six minority owners.\n\nIn its judgment, the court found that there was nothing in the agreement between buyer and seller, or the law, that prohibits Allgreen from making additional payments to minority owners. And, on whether the Regent Garden collective sale was done in good faith, it ruled: \"A purchaser does not owe any duty of care, much less duty of good faith, to a vendor of property in relation to the price of the property.\"\n\nIn response to BT, former Supreme Court judge Warren Khoo, who is leading the landmark Gilstead Court collective sale, said: \"The root of the problem is not who makes such payments or in what capacity he makes it - the purchaser, the marketing agent in his own right or as agent, the sale committee, etc. Regardless of who makes the payment, it is the receipt by a few owners itself and the natural sense of unfairness and inequality felt by the non-recipient owners that is the root of the problem. It is this sense of being discriminated against that have made these owners challenge such payments in court.\"\n\nHe added that legislation is the only way forward. \"It is not possible for the courts alone, circumscribed as they are by the narrow approach of the present law, to develop a coherent and intelligible jurisprudence to deal with such behaviour.\n\n\"It is necessary to outlaw such behaviour as a form of corruption, with possibly criminal as well as civil sanctions. Until corrective legislation is enacted, owners can help themselves by inserting appropriate provisions against such practices in their collective sales agreement, in their tender terms and conditions, as well as in their marketing agent employment contract.\"\n\nSome lawyers are hoping that the appellate court's written judgment on Harbour View, which is yet to be issued, will clarify the laws governing the estate agents' duties. They also raise the question of whether en bloc sale rules should make clear when incentive payments are allowed.\n\nArguing that this isn't necessary, Norman Ho of Rodyk & Davidson said that it would be \"difficult to have an all-encompassing provision detailing the prohibition against incentive payment as the issue on such payment arises from the fiduciary duty and bad faith, and not on the payment per se.\"\n\nInstead, Mr Ho suggested that additional provisions could be introduced to the Estate Agents (Estate Agency Work) Regulations 2010, prohibiting agents from making incentive payments to minority owners.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The sci-fi fantasy musical took shape at warp speed - making it to the stage in about six months, when similar shows usually take much longer. The director attributes the fast turnaround time to a smooth creative process, good chemistry among the cast members, and being in good favour with the theatre gods.\n\nIn the Resorts World context, a live show that is performed on a nightly basis in a 1,600-seat space should evoke a Broadway-like persona, appeal to the masses and entertain on multiple levels.\n\nLightSeeker will achieve that and more, says La Fleur, 57, who has been director-in-residence at Resorts World for the past two years. \"This is the first locally-produced show from scratch - a complete book musical,\" he says. \"It's got a story, a score, special effects, fantasy costumes - we're doing a lot of groundbreaking stuff, a blending of sounds and skills.\"\n\nAudiences can expect spectacular stage sets, high-wire stunts and even some martial arts action. Principal performers have been recruited from London's West End and cast members - numbering about 40 - come from all over the world, including Singapore. \"Almost across the board, everyone we wanted was our first choice,\" says La Fleur. The show, about the quest for a mystical source of energy called The Light, features songs composed by Dick Lee and contains a deeper philosophical message.\n\n\"We've tried to avoid the clich\u00e9s - it's very simple to put on a boy-meets-girl type of story, but we wanted to have a real connection to the world we live in,\" says La Fleur. \"It also has a spiritual foundation, about the inner life within all of us - we're delving into serious territory in a very entertaining way.\"\n\nLa Fleur, who hails from a small town in Wyoming, has been involved in the entertainment business from a very young age - he sang on the radio at age three and went on to perform and direct on bigger stages. He has also taught college-level theatre and drama classes at Florida State University.\n\n\"There's something about directing and getting people to see things in a different way,\" he says. \"I've always been fascinated by that need to share - I call it soul touching - and I'm able to help people to find that 'ring of truth' in a performance. We all have a story to tell, a need to communicate - it's really about finding that spark of sameness we all have.\"\n\nWhen a performer sings on stage and succeeds in striking a chord with someone sitting in the back row of the theatre - that's the most exciting aspect of putting on a show, says La Fleur. \"That's what we're striving for in LightSeeker - we have the humour and the emotion, the fun factor and the powerful Broadway singing, but what can we do to make it a new experience? We're taking many different styles and fusing them into something new.\"\n\nAs the opening date approaches, the mood backstage at the Festive Grand Theatre was positively upbeat earlier this week, with seasoned performers and relative newcomers rehearsing with enthusiasm while working on every nuance and detail of the show. \"There something magical about the process,\" says La Fleur. \"I have absolute faith in the show - this really is a big deal.\" He adds, \"The show has to be able to play to the world. The good news is that the work is flowing naturally - they really believe in the product.\"\n\n'LightSeeker' opens on Nov 24 and is scheduled to run until March 23, 2014. Tickets from $48 to $148 are on sale at the Resorts World Theatre, the RWS website and Sistic\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One of the largest fines in recent memory is the $2 million one dealt to train operator SMRT last July, but that figure was split evenly between breakdowns on the North-South Line on two separate dates in December 2011.\n\nM1's financial penalty this time around was levied under the Service Resiliency Code, which carries a fine of up to $1 million or 10 per cent of a licensee's annual turnover, whichever is higher.\n\nAt $1.5 million, this fine represents 0.14 per cent of M1's last full year of operating revenue, which stands at $1.08 billion.\n\nResponding to IDA's decision yesterday, an M1 spokesman said: \"IDA did not agree with our reconsideration request to reduce the quantum of the fine in light of our strong mitigating factors including our view that the incident was unexpected and beyond our reasonable control.\"\n\n\"We are accordingly evaluating the decision,\" he added. At this stage, M1 has the option of appealing to Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim.\n\nFor the industry, more compliance hurdles might loom. Following a review of the network resiliency for all three operators - SingTel Mobile, M1 and StarHub Mobile - IDA noted yesterday that while they generally met international standards, there was \"room for improvement\". It will implement a new audit framework to review network resiliency regularly, IDA added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Taking on American playwright Neil Simon's Rumors would be a welcome change from teaching and directing school productions.\n\nBut what he didn't know at that time was that his friend Christina Sergeant, a well-known theatre director and educator based in Singapore, would die this February after a heart attack.\n\n\"Her passing was very unexpected, and I still don't know the reason why she gave it to me. She just said she didn't think she would be able to do it,\" says 39-year-old Othman, who is currently teaching at School of The Arts (Sota). \"I guess it was just coincidence but I'm glad I took the job, otherwise she might have passed on without knowing who was going to direct her play.\"\n\nRumors tells the story of a dinner party originally set in New York City, where the deputy mayor and his wife have invited guests to their home to celebrate their 10th wedding anniversary. Things go awry when the guests arrive and find the man upstairs with a bullet-hole through his earlobe, and his wife and servants missing.\n\nThis is not your garden-variety whodunit, as solving the mystery is not the focus of this show. Instead, the spotlight is on the way the guests react to the situation and how they come up with ludicrous schemes to keep it under wraps from the police and local media.\n\nAccording to Othman, his version will be set in modern-day Delhi instead of 1980s New York, as most of the cast members are Indian, and it would make the play much more believable. It would also help bring the play closer to the Singapore context and make it more relatable for local audiences, while maintaining a similar political scene and gun law as that of the United States.\n\n\"The thing is in Singapore you can't have guns at all, unless it's with special permission. But in Delhi, there are ways to get a gun. It's not that there are no laws, but it's just not impossible to get one there. So more work would need to be done if we set the play in Singapore, we'd have to adapt it more,\" he explains.\n\nAnd if there is one thing that Mr Othman wants to minimise, it's the editing of Simon's fast-paced and witty script, which he believes deserves to be staged as close to the original as possible.\n\n\"Neil Simon is famous for the way he writes plays, with a fast-paced comic dialogue. It's like Shakespeare - editing Shakespeare would make it less impactful than it really is. People will want to come and watch his play because of the way he wrote it. So I want to preserve that,\" he says.\n\n'Rumors' will be on at the DBS Arts Centre on Oct 18 at 7.30pm and Oct 19 at 3pm and 7.30pm. Tickets cost $30 and $50, with concession prices available.
