Part-time associate professor Mona Weissmark advises students to learn to think scientifically, seeking empirical evidence and being open to the possibility of being wrong. This approach, advocated by Nobel laureates like Marie Curie and Albert Einstein, can lead to a better society by promoting moral and intellectual strengths. However, providing facts alone often fails, and a more effective approach is to learn to evaluate information critically and be aware of one's own biases and assumptions. By adopting scientific thinking, individuals can make informed decisions and contribute to a more rational and democratic society.", "truncated": false, "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/388f73f794d52ef64f6a4d4436db35eaa1f6fa6601146f7e1ccccca390ebd6cc?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": null}]}
