More extreme elements have used violence.\n\nTaiwan's yellow shirts have remained peaceful and have a clear leadership structure.\n\nThey also stem from a dispute between tax authorities and Tai Ji Men, a religious organisation whose leader was arrested and prosecuted for fraud and tax evasion in 1996.\n\nAlthough the courts have thrown out the fraud charges, Tai Ji Men is still accused of owing the government millions of dollars in back taxes.\n\nTheir first mass rally in 2016 centred around calling for a reprieve of those tax evasion fines.\n\nMore recent demonstrations, including a rally of some 20,000 supporters in Taipei on 19 December, have called for more general tax reforms, especially for poorer households.\n\nBut the movement still accuses Taiwan's authorities of \"persecuting\" religious and political groups with tax probes.\n\n\"Our main goal is for the tax bureau to stop bullying people using tax violation charges,\" Chen Tze Lung, a retired professor and one of the founders of the movement said.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether Taiwan's yellow shirts will see broader success.\n\nWhile they have mustered large rallies their demands have received little political support, even from the opposition and the Tsai administration has so far avoided any major confrontations with the group.\n\nNonetheless Ms Tsai's ruling Democratic Progressive Party received a bloody nose in local polls in November and they face a presidential election in 2020.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nBlackRock hits record US$12.5 trillion in assets amid tariff chaos\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nIndia\u2019s cooling inflation prompts rate-cut calls\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nChinese firms rush to buy Nvidia H20 AI chips as sales set to resume\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nChina\u2019s economy slows as consumers tighten belts, US tariff risks mount\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:25 AM\n\nSuspended Thai PM asks court for more time to respond to ethics case\n\nJul 15, 2025 04:21 PM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s trade growth target achievable despite US tariffs: minister\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:23 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/3ceec42ab2466195d3a09559473c23ac96f57675e62d785a8e80d2cd315efa88?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Taiwanese protesters chant slogans in front of the Presidential Palace during the national flag raising ceremony in Taipei on Jan 1, 2019."}]}

In this peripheral layer of icy bodies and leftover fragments from the solar system's creation, the interplanetary probe will position its seven on-board instruments for the first close-up glance of Ultima Thule, a cool mass roughly 32 km long and shaped like a giant peanut.\n\nScientists had not discovered Ultima Thule when the probe was launched, according to Nasa, making the mission unique in that respect. In 2014, astronomers found Thule using the Hubble Space Telescope and selected it for New Horizon's extended mission in 2015.\n\n\"Anything's possible out there in this very unknown region,\" John Spencer, deputy project scientist for New Horizons, told reporters on Monday at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland.\n\nLaunched in January 2006, New Horizons embarked on a 4 billion mile journey toward the solar system's frigid, faraway edge to study the dwarf planet Pluto and its five moons.\n\nDuring a 2015 fly-by, the probe found Pluto to be slightly larger than previously thought. In March, it revealed that methane-rich dunes were on the icy dwarf planet's surface.\n\nAfter trekking one billion miles beyond Pluto into the Kuiper Belt, New Horizons will now seek clues about the formation of the solar system and its planets.\n\nAs the probe flies 3,500 km above Thule's surface, scientists hope it will detect the chemical composition of its atmosphere and terrain in what Nasa says will be the closest observation of a body so remote.\n\n\"We are straining the capabilities of this spacecraft, and by tomorrow we'll know how we did,\" New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern said during the news conference at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland. \"There are no second chances for New Horizons.\"\n\nWhile the mission marks the farthest close-encounter of an object within our solar system, NASA's Voyager 1 and 2, a pair of deep space probes launched in 1977, have reached greater distances on a mission to survey extrasolar bodies. Both probes are still operational.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/4ee0d065c0414cde86398c785b6bfa47be5073db81beec85b3bfc57cad34d377?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A Nasa explorer is on track to reach the solar system's outermost region by early Tuesday morning, when scientists expect it to fly by a space rock 20 miles long and billions of miles from Earth, the most distant close encounter of its kind"}]}

It trails the main opposition Labor party by 10 percentage points, according to the most recent Newspoll. Should that margin be be replicated at the ballot box, the coalition would lose about 20 seats in parliament and Labor leader Bill Shorten would become prime minister after five years in opposition.\n\nOne of the strongest cards Mr Morrison has to play is his stewardship of the economy. The government says it's on track to return to the black for the first time since the global financial crisis and last month almost doubled the size of its projected surplus in fiscal 2020. The bottom line has been bolstered by higher company profits and commodity prices and falling unemployment.\n\nThat may give the government the fiscal firepower to deliver some pre-election sweeteners when it hands down the budget on April 2.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nBlackRock hits record US$12.5 trillion in assets amid tariff chaos\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nIndia\u2019s cooling inflation prompts rate-cut calls\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nChinese firms rush to buy Nvidia H20 AI chips as sales set to resume\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nChina\u2019s economy slows as consumers tighten belts, US tariff risks mount\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:25 AM\n\nSuspended Thai PM asks court for more time to respond to ethics case\n\nJul 15, 2025 04:21 PM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s trade growth target achievable despite US tariffs: minister\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:23 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM", "images": []}

But Americans may know her best for her frequent sparring with Mr Trump - which has had mixed results.\n\nMs Warren's searing criticisms of Mr Trump's trade policies, erosion of consumer protections, and openness to authoritarian regimes - not to mention her call in September for Congress to use a constitutional maneuver to remove him from office - have drawn his attention, and his disdain.\n\nReacting to her latest move, Mr Trump said he was unsure whether Ms Warren could replace him at the White House. \"You'd have to ask her psychiatrist,\" he quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\n\"We'll see how she does. I wish her well, I hope she does well, I'd love to run against her.\"\n\nAt his election-style rallies, Mr Trump took to mocking her claim to have some Native American heritage by dubbing her \"Pocahontas\", a derisive reference to the 17th century Native American who lived in what is now Virginia.\n\nWhen Mr Trump offered to donate US$1 million to Ms Warren's favorite charity if she took a test proving \"you're an Indian\", she eventually did so, hoping to put an end to his ridicule.\n\nInstead, he seemed to relish the fact that the test showed her with only a sliver of Native American heritage.\n\n'Nevertheless, she persisted'\n\nBut another encounter with a powerful male politician gave Ms Warren a place in political folklore.\n\nAfter she clashed in 2017 on the Senate floor with top Republican Mitch McConnell over the nomination of Jeff Sessions as attorney general and refused to back down, his phrase \"Nevertheless, she persisted\" was quickly adopted by feminists - and turned into T-shirts and bumper stickers.\n\nAs talk of a possible presidential run grew, Ms Warren has worked to build her foreign policy credentials, taking a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. She favours cuts in military spending and a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nHer domestic policies are reliably liberal: She is staunchly pro-choice on abortion, supports gun control and has urged Democrats to go on \"offense\" to expand health care coverage for Americans.\n\nBut her bread-and-butter issue has been the defence of ordinary Americans against abuses by those with wealth and power. She sharply criticised Wall Street after the 2007 financial crisis and helped establish the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\"How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie, and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice,\" she said in her video.\n\nHumble childhood\n\nWith as many as three dozen Democrats weighing possible presidential bids, the road to the nomination will be arduous.\n\nAmong those who have already declared their intention to run are Julian Castro, a former housing secretary in Barack Obama's administration, Maryland Representative John Delaney and Richard Ojeda, a former army paratrooper currently serving as a state senator in West Virginia.\n\nPolls for now show Ms Warren trailing veteran politicians like former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, both in their 70s - as well as rising young star Beto O'Rourke, who is 46.\n\nBut analyst Nate Silver said on Twitter that Warren \"probably has a better chance than Sanders of bridging the gap between the left and the party establishment.\"\n\n\"She's always raised a ton of money. Voters know what she stands for. Women did well in the 2018 primaries,\" Mr Silver added.\n\nMs Warren has built the framework of a serious campaign, with a staff of more than 70 people, US$12.5 million left over from her successful re-election effort, and a nationwide network of contacts and supporters.\n\nAs she seeks to raise her profile, Ms Warren likes to tell how she grew up in the Central Plains state of Oklahoma, in a family she said lived \"on the ragged edge of the middle class\".\n\nAfter her father suffered a heart attack, she went to work at age 13 waiting tables in a restaurant - life experience she says gives her a visceral connection to ordinary Americans.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nBlackRock hits record US$12.5 trillion in assets amid tariff chaos\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nIndia\u2019s cooling inflation prompts rate-cut calls\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nChinese firms rush to buy Nvidia H20 AI chips as sales set to resume\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nChina\u2019s economy slows as consumers tighten belts, US tariff risks mount\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:25 AM\n\nSuspended Thai PM asks court for more time to respond to ethics case\n\nJul 15, 2025 04:21 PM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s trade growth target achievable despite US tariffs: minister\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:23 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n4\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n5\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/2278dfd2d48859df281fa61acb140557aeace061c15dcedf78925df207a3e166?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren - an outspoken critic of Wall Street and nemesis of Donald Trump - entered the 2020 race for the White House on Monday."}]}

In an era when democracy and its associated values are under threat from authoritarian politicians, nationalist parties, religious extremists and general online bigotry and dishonesty, it can be all too easy to overlook the danger from within. That danger arises not so much from the colonisation of its institutions by those hostile to democracy, but from the wavering commitment to democracy of those who wish to defend it.\n\nBritain's narrow vote for Brexit and the rise of intolerant politicians with scant regard for facts, logic or democratic norms - such as Donald Trump in the US, Matteo Salvini in Italy and Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil - have been a shock to many who trusted in the strength of liberal and democratic values.\n\nThey have a sense that the majority of people are too easily misled by deceptive appeals to their worst instincts and that it is regrettable that they should be able to impose their will upon more sophisticated, more tolerant folk. A few even shrug their shoulders and say things such as, \"This is what you get with democracy\", leaving the listener to ponder whether they are voicing a reluctant acceptance of its defects as well as its virtues, or wishing for an alternative.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Machines still beat humans only in carefully constructed environments or at narrow tasks. The good news is that, as the technology progresses, the race for leadership is still wide open, and even Europe, where politicians fret that the continent is lagging behind China and the US, is still quite competitive.\n\nAccording to the Artificial Intelligence Index 2018 annual report, whose steering committee includes leading AI scholars such as Yoav Shoham of Stanford University and Erik Brynjolfsson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI has progressed on all the measures tracked. Some of the metrics, from the number of published papers and conference attendance, to mentions on corporate earnings calls and in parliamentary hearings, measure the hype. Others reflect improving performance. In 2018, AI has gotten more accurate and much faster at image detection. It's also improved at parsing the grammatical structure of sentences, answering multiple-choice questions and translation. Whether this progress brings us closer to truly superhuman AI is a different matter.\n\nOn the translation front, a measure called Bilingual Evaluation Understudy is used to determine accuracy. It compares machine-translated sentences to those rendered by human experts, and last year almost half the machine translations between English and German news articles measured up to the human ones. Last year, Microsoft announced with much fanfare that its AI did just as well as humans in translating news from Chinese into English. But the underlying paper reports much lower scores for the Chinese translations than for the separately published German ones, and accuracy scores from human evaluators of between 50 per cent and 70 per cent. Machine-translation algorithms still produce plenty of gibberish and are really mostly useful, in a limited way, to humans with some understanding of both languages and the context.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As people from all quarters looked in recent days to a brand new year, this line from a play by Alfred Lord Tennyson probably captures the anticipation of only the steadfastly optimistic (and/or quietly defiant).\n\nAfter all, as many a pundit and seer will have us know, the disruptions, turmoil and turbulence seen across the world in 2018 - in global politics, macro-economics and in industry sectors - will continue in 2019, if not come to a head altogether with dire consequences. The chief economist of the World Trade Organization, Robert Koopman, for instance, didn't mince his words when giving his prognosis of the year's economic outlook. \"It's almost like a death from a thousand cuts,\" he said last week, citing leading indicators that \"continue to weaken\" and serving notice that the WTO's earlier forecasts for 2019 global trade growth - already downgraded in September - could yet be cut again soon. Even as US-China trade tensions continue to simmer amid an uncertain truce, the bigger risks lay in the impact on business sentiment, said Mr Koopman, pointing to early signs of business investment being hit and consumers in both the US and China beginning to hold back on purchases. US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell last week also pointed to investor and business fears over trade conflicts and global growth in 2019. Business corporations, meanwhile, have warned of being hit by tariffs-related costs, rising borrowing costs, cooling global demand, and overall slowing economic growth. These big downside risks add up to the uncertainty that has - increasingly and without exception - characterised each and every year over the past decade and more.\n\nFor countries on the sidelines of the global battleground, much of the year's outlook is shaped by the global macro-economic climate and other exogenous factors. Tackling and managing the downside risks is, for Singapore, very much par for the course - and indeed yet another instance when its resilience would be exercised, perhaps its creativity developed too. The official forecast of 2019 reflects a fairly sanguine reading of the external climate and prospects, with economic growth seen as high as 3.5 per cent - roughly maintaining the 2018 pace - but possibly easing to just 1.5 per cent if more of the negative risks materialise. Indeed, Singapore must stand prepared for unexpected pickups in the headwinds - if, for instance, global financial tightening results in disorderly capital outflows from emerging economies. Volatility may yet return to rule, and rue, the markets. But there are bright spots. Notably and encouragingly, while the manufacturing and externally-oriented services sectors may see slower growth, several other service industries are expected to fare well on the back of robust business demand for IT and digital solutions.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This year, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) kept interest rates unchanged at a low of 1.5 per cent - for a record 28 consecutive months. The continued dovish tone in the RBA Statement on Monetary Policy further hints that there was no strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy, which would result in the AUD weakening further.\n\nEconomic numbers have been on the decline in Australia. Its third quarter GDP results indicated further weakness. This is attributed to a slowdown in household spending, which resulted in the weakest quarterly expansion since the third quarter of 2016. This reinforced investors' concerns of muted economic growth despite the recent rebound in employment numbers and continued low unemployment rate. The pestering issues of low wage growth, subdued CPI inflation, and falling housing prices created a disinflationary backdrop. It will prevent policy normalisation for some time. In addition, the 2019 outlook appears to be more challenging, due to potential trade tariffs and protectionism policies, which have lowered expectations of economic growth. Therefore, such factors will deter the RBA from raising interest rates next year, causing more downside risk for the AUD.\n\nLooking at the daily charts of AUD/SGD pair, after recording its year high of 1.0633 on Jan 29, the AUD/SGD had slumped to a year low of 0.9713 on Oct 26. There are three technical signs which support this strong downward trend.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nUOL prices S$225 million notes due 2032 at 2.78%\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:42 PM\n\nChinese carmaker Geely to pay US$2.4 billion to take full control of Zeekr\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:39 PM\n\nSIA, Scoot passenger traffic up 4.5% in June on strong travel demand\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:12 PM\n\nIndia\u2019s cooling inflation prompts rate-cut calls\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nChinese firms rush to buy Nvidia H20 AI chips as sales set to resume\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nECB to test banks' resilience to geopolitical risk in 2026\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:56 PM\n\nSingapore shares rise, tracking regional gains; STI up 0.3%\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:50 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\n4\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n5\n\nDollar-selling is becoming a bubble, which may burst, HSBC says", "images": []}

Two years ago, it seized the home from its long-time owner, Gerlinde Pommer, whose family owned it since before Hitler's birth, except for a short stint during the war when it belonged to Hitler's secretary. Now Ms Pommer wants as much as US$1.7 million for it.\n\nLast week, Deutsche Welle, a German news wire, reported that Ms Pommer's lawyer is seeking a significant amount of compensation for the building after initially receiving around US$355,000 from the government.\n\nThe house and its parking lot were recently appraised at US$915,000 to US$1.7 million, DW reported, and Ms Pommer's lawyer said the Austrian government did not adequately reimburse his client.\n\nAustria had regularly leased the property from Ms Pommer since the 1970s, using it as a space to support disabled people. But Ms Pommer has long refused offers for them to purchase it from her. When the government wanted to renovate parts of the property in 2011, she refused and terminated the lease.\n\nIn recent years, Austrian officials have repeatedly raised concerns that the house has become a gathering spot for neo-Nazis. In July 2016, then-Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said that the government \"would like to prevent this house from becoming a 'cult site' for neo-Nazis in any way, which it has been repeatedly in the past, when people gathered there to shout slogans.\" That was when the government moved to seize the house. Ms Pommer insisted that the move violated the Austrian Constitution, but in 2017, the country's constitutional court backed the government decision, saying it was \"carried out in the public interest\".\n\nThere has been debate over what will happen to the house next. There has been talk of it being used as space for charities or for a Holocaust remembrance museum. But Mr Sobotka made his intentions clear in 2016, when he said that regardless of who occupies it next, \"there shall be no connection with Adolf Hitler because otherwise this legacy around the house will persist\".

Coach's most valuable asset is its leather oeuvre - from iconic handbags to wallets to shoes - and it all evolved from 1941 when its pioneering artisans drew inspiration from how baseball gloves felt after wear and tear.\n\nThe quinessential American luxury brand traces its beginnings to a family-run workshop on 34th Street in Manhattan that made mainly leather wallets and billfolds by hand. In 1946, Miles and Lillian Cahn joined the company. The couple, who embodied the American Dream, were at the time already owners of a leather handbag factory, and had considerable know-how in the leather business. In the 1960s, they hired creative director Bonnie Cashin who revolutionised the brand and made it a household name in the United States. Today, under British fashion designer and creative director Stuart Vevers, the brand spans leather goods, accessories, women's and men's fashion as well as enjoys a massive following online.\n\n\"Great brands are living and breathing organisms, and we're so lucky at Coach to have an authentic heritage,\" says Joshua Schulman, the company's chief executive and president. He's speaking to The Business Times during a visit in October - his first interview outside of North America since his appointment in June 2017. Mr Schulman was in town for the regional Store Managers' Conference where around 800 store managers from close to 60 countries- from Europe, China, Japan, South-east Asia and the Middle East - huddled in Singapore over three days to ensure that everyone is aligned on the latest season's mission statement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is the commonest immunological disease affecting mankind. Despite this, the condition remains poorly understood, diagnosed and treated worldwide, yet it has a profound impact on the quality of life of sufferers.\n\nThe prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the first world ranges from about 10 per cent in the US to 40 per cent in Singapore. These figures have increased over the last few decades and several factors are thought to play a part. These include genetics, environmental factors and possibly economic and industrial development with a corresponding change in lifestyle, social activities, smaller family sizes, urban environments and reduced exposure to infectious diseases.\n\nRhinitis, by definition, is an inflammation of the lining of the nasal passage (mucosa). It presents typically with nasal discharge (runny nose), itching, sneezing and nasal blockage or congestion. Rhinitis can be caused by a variety of factors, allergy being one. It can also be non-allergic, infective or from a combination of factors.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yet that has never discouraged, those of us in the business of studying financial markets, from making pronouncements, particularly at this time of the year.\n\nWith 2018 almost out the door, we can look back grimly, at what has possibly been the worst year, for broad market returns. In the 118 years since the dawn of 20th century, never before have 89 per cent of global assets delivered a negative return in US dollar terms. In local currency terms that figure is still a shocking 61 per cent.\n\nThe sustained expansion of global economy, we had witnessed since the Financial Crisis of 2008, seems to have finally run out of steam. In the past 9 years, all asset classes other than cash, generated positive real returns. The outlook for 2019 does not inspire a great deal of confidence and to produce investment returns, one will have to be very selective with markets and asset classes. Different countries are in different stage of the economic cycle and therefore investing in broad indices will not prove to be prudent in the months to come.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The judge reportedly said that there may be a link between Grab's operations and a loss in revenue for Vinasun, although that may not have been the only factor. In a media statement, Jerry Lim, country head of Grab Vietnam, said that the company will seek a reversal of the court's decision. \"We hope the higher court will study the legal arguments and case documents closer in order to rule responsibly for the best interests of consumers, a fair business environment and most importantly, for the assurance of a civil justice,\" he said.\n\nGrab also said that it is prepared to launch a defamation suit against Vinasun and other parties if \"there is no retraction of the baseless allegations made towards Grab over the past months\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 2016 Budget was revised based on a lower brent crude oil price assumption of US$30-US$35 per barrel from US$48 per barrel originally.

Its founder and chief executive officer Sim Choo Kheng has been in the theme park development and operating business since 1993. He has also worked on the Egypt and Jurassic Park zones of Universal Studios Singapore, and the DreamWorks zone at Motiongate theme park in Dubai.\n\nThe company did not disclose how much it expects to raise, but Mr Sim told Bloomberg in an October interview that a sale of new and existing shares in Singapore could raise about S$10 million to S$12 million. In the interview, he also said that the deal could take place by next January.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
