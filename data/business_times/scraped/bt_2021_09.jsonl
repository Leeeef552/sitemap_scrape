Historians may regard 9/11 as a pivotal moment, similar to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, as it shifted the US focus from isolationism to global engagement. The long-term effects of the US withdrawal from Afghanistan are still unfolding, but President Biden's strategy aims to balance the rise of China and maintain US influence in Asia.", "truncated": false, "images": []}
