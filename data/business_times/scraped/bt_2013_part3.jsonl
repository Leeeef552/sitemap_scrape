This came amid a sudden downward price spiral. In the following weeks, broking houses tightened trading rules on these sub-dollar stocks, including cash upfront for purchases. The regulators are still investigating possible trading irregularities.\n\nNot surprisingly, the net impact has been to subdue sentiment in this erstwhile vibrant segment of the bourse. Much finger pointing and debate about regulatory shortcomings has also ensued over the past few weeks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHEY may lack the flash, sex appeal and superstar names synonymous with luxury marques such as Gucci, Vuitton and Prada, but the latest continental labels to land in our malls make up for it in their stealth wealth cachet.\n\nBrioni, an Italian fashion house specialising in made-to-order men's suits and luxurious tailoring, recently unveiled its first standalone boutique at Marina Bay Sands. The company, which has created suits worn by Pierce Brosnan in all his appearances as James Bond, and Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, has long appealed to the more discerning male customer. As Francesco Pesci, chief executive officer of Brioni, explains, the true pedigree of a Brioni suit is determined by how it feels when worn, and not just by its appearance.\n\n\"The Brioni suit is hand-tailored and crafted using traditional Italian tailoring techniques,\" says Mr Pesci, who was in town for the opening of the 1,720 sq ft store in September. \"And just like how there may be many beautiful cars on the street and the difference between a luxury car and a regular one lies in its engine, the way a suit is crafted on the inside changes its performance. The comfort of a Brioni suit is second to none.\"\n\nIn an era when brandishing brand logos or even an \"It\" bag borders on sartorial vulgarity, understated luxury is the ultimate status symbol. And lesser-known European houses are more than happy to satiate the savvy shopper's thirst for low-key style.\n\n\"Like a private members' club, we are recognised by those in the know,\" says Marco Franchini, chief executive officer of Italian leather goods label Valextra. \"We believe that true luxury lies in absolute discretion and exclusivity as symbolised by our signatures such as our Costa black ink (used to hand-lacquer the edges of bags) and the discreet V-cut detail. It takes a knowledgeable eye to identify our products and only a true connoisseur of style would truly appreciate and value our rich heritage, craftsmanship, innovation and uniqueness.\"\n\nThe 75-year-old house has just opened its 800 sq ft boutique in Paragon, which embodies minimalist chic, from its slate-thin shelves to logo-free products. And the brand's focus on understated classics have found a following among very well-known fans, including Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston, David Beckham and Michelle Obama. And while the Singapore outpost for Brioni is the first in the world to feature the brand's new store concept, it is more about sleek architecture than the ostentatious glamour associated with Italian fashion.\n\nUnderstated elegance\n\nThis recently launched blueprint melds the masculine aesthetics of an old-world gentleman's club with the elegance of a private dressing room. Indeed, one almost expects a coat-tail-wearing valet to stride across the boutique's Navona travertine floors and help a client into a jacket.\n\n\"We don't want to do things that have been done by other brands,\" says Mr Pesci. \"We want to convey luxury in a discreet way and to stand out through the use of details and raw materials. It's tough work trying to communicate elegance without showing off.\"\n\nAnd rather than set up a branch here right away, David Mason, creative director of Savile Row tailoring house Anthony Sinclair, has gone even more insider - flying over to discuss the creation of a bespoke fragrance with a niche perfume house, and offering private fittings to clients upon request.\n\nHowever, the demand for bespoke tailoring in Asia has prompted Mr Mason to view potential sites for a permanent retail outlet while he was in town. \"Asia has suddenly become our fastest-growing market,\" says Mr Mason. \"Consumers here are style-savvy and sophisticated, and Singaporean men are no exception. They want the best products available, and when it comes to tailoring, they know that Britain's history and reputation is unrivalled.\"\n\nFamed for being the tailor to Sean Connery in the James Bond movies directed by Terence Young, Anthony Sinclair certainly boasts the superstar connection required of any luxury label of repute. But he's best known for an understatedly flattering cut: The Conduit, which creates a subtle hour-glass silhouette with a firm shoulder, slightly flared skirt and suppressed waist.\n\nA bespoke, hand-tailored suit takes 50 hours of hand-tailoring over the course of several weeks, and involves a series of fittings, \"each taking the garment through successive stages of production, allowing the client to witness the true bespoke experience of having his clothes built around him,\" adds Mr Mason.\n\nBespoke tailoring also lies at the heart of Brioni, which has been owned by French luxury apparel holding company Kering since 2011. \"Brioni was established as a tailoring shop and the made-to-measure business is in our DNA,\" says Mr Pesci. \"We're the first to introduce a silk lining, the first to introduce colour into formal menswear, the first to hold a men's fashion show in 1952, when it was almost sacrilegious for men to be seen on the catwalk.\"\n\nThe go-to atelier for the likes of Donald Trump and Nelson Mandela employs over 1,000 staff in its Italian manufacturing facility, and it takes from 18 to as many as 48 hours to complete a suit. A rigorous apprenticeship programme helps safeguard the craftsmanship so integral to the brand's ethos.\n\n\"A tailor doesn't just excel in the technicalities of crafting a suit, he should be able to look at a customer and, apart from providing the perfect fit, analyse the way he walks, his posture and the colour of his hair and eyes, to ensure a suit that is flattering in every respect,\" adds Mr Pesci.\n\nStrategic alliances\n\nLikewise, the clean lines of each Valextra creation bears delicate details produced in Italy by a team of 60 craftsmen, who create quiet embellishments like the special hand-lacquered piping, soft, light-coloured leather lining and hardware accents used for its accessories.\n\nAnd our small but discerning shopper demographic offers plenty of potential for brands that eschew showy luxury. The family-owned company has its eye on going public in the long term, and will be opening five freestanding shops in the world's fashion capitals in the next two years, following its partnership with home-grown retail group FJ Benjamin on its boutique here. In fact, Mr Franchini states that Singapore represents \"almost half of the whole South-east Asian market, which grew by a remarkable 24 per cent last year.\"\n\nJohnny Manglani, the president of the Uomo Group, who has been selling Brioni products in his multi-label store and partnered with Brioni to open its monobrand boutique here, has also noticed a rise in demand for accoutrements appreciated by those in the know. While Brioni has been traditionally favoured by greying business honchos and heads of state, Mr Manglani has encountered fans of the brand in their 20s.\n\nThe purveyor of upscale menswear labels here and in Russia adds: \"There are so many young millionaires in Asia and Brioni appeals to a certain discerning type of person who could discover the brand in his 20s, and wear it until he retires.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Here, they are given prime space, and have taken on a fancy term too. Called Social Hubs, these areas are spacious, tastefully done up and, in fact, look more attractive than the actual work area.\n\nAt DBS Asia Gateway in Toh Guan Road, there are four social hubs, each done up with a different colour theme, such as green and purple. \"The staff really embrace these social hubs. Instead of merely gathering at their desks, they come here,\" says a DBS spokesman. \"Rather than head to the meeting rooms, some choose to have their discussions at the social hubs.\"\n\nDBS has three offices across Singapore - at Changi Business Park, Marina Bay Financial Centre and at Toh Guan. Social hubs can be found at all three locations. The bank has about 1,000 employees working at Toh Guan, since September. They span a cross-section of departments from customer service, consumer banking, investment banking to private banking. It is difficult to tell that the office was previously a warehouse space. \"One of the challenges was how to make staff feel they are entering an office rather than a warehouse,\" says Jessi Ong, senior interior designer at HBO+EMTB. The firm also designed the DBS office at Changi Business Park.\n\nThe design team did this by tearing down concrete walls and replacing them with glass ones. Social hubs are placed along the corridor so that staff can look out onto a courtyard and vice versa. Out of the four social hubs, the red themed one is the largest, as this is where the cafeteria is. Here, townhall meetings can be conducted, via video-conferencing to connect with staff at the two other locations. Ms Ong says that red represents flowers, so some of the customised furniture resemble trees, as seen on the table legs. There are also meeting rooms here, that have been designed to resemble houses.\n\nMuch effort was also placed in doing up the courtyard, which the staff frequently use during the cooler times of the day. A pair of white statues from Chinese artist Gao Xiaowu greet staff as they walk past. At night, the courtyard is lit up by cone- and globe-shaped lights.\n\nMs Ong says that when it came to designing the office, the team had to keep in mind DBS's tagline: Living, Breathing Asia. \"So we incorporated Asian elements, such as a water theme for a department's social hub,\" Elsewhere, there are bird-cage-like lights and dining chairs inspired by kopi-tiam chairs. The bank also worked with a social enterprise, Social Creatives, to design a mural. DBS staff also got involved with the painting. The bank's new office has gone down well with its staff. Operations manager Lim Chun Hwa says, \"I don't feel so constrained working here, and I appreciate the spaciousness.\" As a new employee to the company, the social hubs have also come in handy for him. \"There are definitely more opportunities to meet with colleagues from the other departments, unlike in the previous office.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(Hacktivism) is a crime and can affect society in ways (that) we can't imagine . . . it can bring down the power system, telecoms system, affect hospitals . . . so there are implications,\" said Singapore Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim.\n\nDr Yaacob was responding to a question about whether the recent issue of hacktivism was a worrisome one, during a media conference at the 13th Asean Telecommunications and IT Ministers Meeting (Telmin) yesterday.\n\nIn addressing the matter, inter-governmental cooperation would be key, he said. \"Obviously, we need to be able to share certain information. We need that cooperation between countries in order to deal with this in a very decisive manner.\"\n\nAs Singapore grappled with threats to its online infrastructure after various government sites were compromised in recent weeks, other countries in the region have had brushes with Anonymous, a disparate group of hacking activists.\n\nEarlier this month, several government websites in the Philippines were defaced by individuals purporting to be part of Anonymous.\n\nBasuki Yusuf Iskandar, secretary-general of Indonesia's Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, noted that cybercrime had become a \"hot issue\" in his country as well.\n\n\"The government is trying to promote awareness (among) the people, (trying to) get individuals to protect themselves . . . it is not a single-country issue, . . . it's a global issue and a global problem,\" he said.\n\nEven as governments ponder the vexing problem of virtual anarchy, Brunei's Minister of Communications Pehin Dato Abdullah Bakar pointed out that there was plenty to be done by the various countries' citizenry as well.\n\n\"If you're looking at hacking sites and getting information . . . what we're worried about is the weak human element. There are people (who do not) guard their personal information properly,\" he said.\n\n\"So, yes, we are worried, but there are two aspects . . . (The first) is to guard the data itself and (the second) is to have a standard operating procedure for people accessing the data.\"\n\nAs the 13th Asean Telmin drew to a close yesterday, a memorandum of understanding between Asean and China was signed, focusing on cooperation in areas including human resources and infrastructure development, as well as new technologies.\n\nThe mid-term review of the Asean ICT Masterplan 2015 was also issued, in which the masterplan was judged to have \"developed well\". The Singapore Declaration - adopted at the event yesterday - acknowledged the need to start developing a new Asean masterplan for the post-2015 period.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So far it is working.\n\nThe central bank said that domestic demand was the key driver of growth coming in at 8.3 per cent compared to 7.4 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nA mild global economic recovery also saw exports turning around to grow by 1.7 per cent versus a contraction of 5.2 per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nThe ETP has been generating momentum. Private investment grew by 15.2 per cent (12.7 per cent in the second quarter) driven by capital spending in the services and manufacturing sectors, as well as oil and gas projects.\n\nPutrajaya had also assured international investors that there would be no deficit on the country's current account of its balance of payments. It proved to be right.\n\nThe current account surplus in the third quarter rose to RM9.8 billion (S$3.8 billion) compared to RM2.6 billion in the second quarter. Indeed, the surplus for the first nine months clocked in at RM21.2 billion.\n\nEven accounting for a net deficit of RM11.5 billion on the nation's financial account, the central bank said that the overall balance in the third quarter was in surplus amounting to RM11.8 billion from a mere RM1.5 billion in the second quarter.\n\nTotal foreign direct investment for the nine months rose 8.7 per cent year-on-year to RM27.6 billion.\n\nInterestingly, reverse investment by Malaysian firms overseas for the nine months rose 6.7 per cent year-on-year to RM35.7 billion.\n\nMore than 75 per cent of the amount, however, came from the oil and gas sector (Petronas' investment in Canada's shale gas) and the finance sector (Malaysian banks expanding regionally).\n\nMeanwhile, the international reserves of the central bank as at end-September rose to almost US$136 billion, enough to finance over nine months of retained imports.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia, the central bank, seemed to indicate that monetary policy would remain easy. It has maintained its overnight policy rate of 3 per cent for more than 16 months now, a rate that it said \"remained supportive of economic activity\".\n\nBank Negara was bullish on the economy going forward, saying that both domestic demand and the gradual recovery in the global economy would support growth. \"The economy is therefore expected to remain on its steady growth trajectory,\" it concluded.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, most staff do that, judging from the many pairs of shoes placed at the entrance.\n\n\"It is all very cool and casual here,\" says Cherry Bacolod, Roomorama's marketing and public relations manager.\n\nSince April, the 30-strong staff have been working from this office located on the third storey of a shophouse on Amoy Street. The four-year-old company was founded by Jia En Teo and her husband Federico Folcia, and today is Asia's fastest growing short-term rental platform.\n\nIt was Mr Folcia who designed the office. The space is not overly generous but still feels spacious and airy, because of its white walls and an airwell, where natural light streams in. Just like his home in the Toh Tuck area, Mr Folcia recreated a similar look for the office - a mix of modern, minimalist and industrial.\n\nMost of the staff have their workstations in a central area, where a large Roomorama logo is emblazoned on the wall. Roomorama's chief user-experience officer, Josh Kennedy is the man behind the cute graphics seen around the office. For example, in place of a sign that says \"Meeting Room 1\", he has drawn graphics of two talk bubbles. On some of the other doors, are graphics of a bicycle and shoe, indicating the respective use of the storerooms.\n\nThere's a media wall in the office, where framed articles of Ms Teo and Mr Folcia are put up. The couple sometimes bring their dog, Pato, to the office too.\n\nActual cinema seating salvaged from the old Capitol Theatre have found their way into a meeting room. Mr Folcia has more of them in his home. The casual vibe of the office naturally extends into the pantry area, where staff gather for weekly meetings on Monday mornings. \"Breakfast is provided, so we all grab some fruit or yogurt before the meeting,\" says Ms Bacolod.\n\nJust by the side is a foosball table which is actively used. \"Sometimes we hold championship games,\" says Ms Bacolod. On some Fridays, the company holds poker nights.\n\n\"The company is young and hip, so naturally the office reflects this too,\" says Ms Bacolod.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also disappointing was developer City Developments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Straits Times Index (STI) is fairly valued at historical averages with not much upside potential, though this widely followed barometer of the Singapore market could rise by 10 per cent next year in line with earnings growth, analysts said.\n\nAmong market worries are the US tapering of its financial asset purchases, a margin squeeze in the construction sector and a residential market correction.\n\n\"The third quarter does spell out a weaker tone of earnings. The number of misses were double those that were above expectations,\" said Kenneth Ng, head of Singapore research at CIMB. \"For the consumer sectors, revenues seem to be hurt by competition and currency fluctuations in the region. For the industrial sectors, execution of orders seems to be a bit of a problem.\"\n\nAfter a rally that began in 2012 and lasted till May this year before fears of a US rollback of quantitative easing set in, the Singapore stock exchange has been trading within a tight range in the past five months. The FTSE ST All-Share index, which tracks most of the 800 companies listed in the Republic, has been in a 740-780-point rut since June - with the low of 740 points reached at the end of August amid an emerging-market currency crisis scare. Similarly, the STI, an index of the 30 largest and most liquid stocks on the local bourse, has been stuck between 3,100 and 3,200 points for most of the past five months.\n\nAnalysts do not see much growth for the Singapore market in 2014.\n\nSTI's current valuation is around 13.5 times of next year's consensus price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, compared with its five-year historical average of 14.2 times, said Lee Chok Wai, senior equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. \"Valuation looks fair. We are neutral on Singapore with an end-2014 target of 3,590, implying a 12 per cent upside.\"\n\nKum Soek Ching, Credit Suisse private banking and wealth management South-east Asia research head, said: \"It is hard to see a PE re-rating for the market in the next 12 months. While we expect the economy to grow . . . the ongoing economic restructuring presents headwinds.\"\n\nAdded Vincent Fernando, director of Asean research at Religare Capital Markets: \"We remain cautious on . . . Singapore . . . Within Asean, it offers the weakest growth profile, with falling earnings expected for this year. . . . we like banks and telecoms, while we are cautious on industrials, developers and real estate investment trusts (Reits).\"\n\nCiti Research has a 3,278-point target for 2014, slightly above its historical PE average calculations for the STI. Given risks of increasing household debt here and labour cost issues, stocks with external exposure are preferred, it said. Its top picks include rigbuilder Keppel Corp, China-exposed firms Wilmar International and CapitaMalls Asia, DBS Bank and Keppel Land.\n\nDuring this past earnings cycle, local banks outperformed expectations. Loan growth was better than expected, even though net interest margins - a measure of bank profitability - do not seem to be rebounding yet. DBS's total loans grew 19 per cent year on year, OCBC's went up 16 per cent and UOB's loan growth was 15.8 per cent.\n\nStripping out divestment gains a year ago, OCBC's core third-quarter net profit of $759 million was 5 per cent higher than the $724 million a year ago because of higher fee income and better insurance contributions from subsidiary Great Eastern. This handily beat estimates of $658 million in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.\n\nCredit Suisse's Ms Kum said she expected mid to high single-digit earnings growth for banks next year.\n\nShipping and marine stocks, such as Cosco Corporation, NOL and Vard Holdings, disappointed. They also accounted for some of the largest quarterly net profit falls in absolute terms, figures compiled by BT showed. NOL's third-quarter net profit slipped 60 per cent to US$20 million, owing to lower freight rates and volume.\n\nConglomerate Jardine Cycle & Carriage's third-quarter net profit fell 31 per cent, as a result of increased competition in the car market, higher labour costs and lower commodity prices.\n\nSteel producer Sapphire Corp took a $46.4 million impairment hit to its assets in China, causing third-quarter net losses to widen to $52.3 million. The steelmaking industry is facing overcapacity amid a weak market outlook.\n\nThird-quarter net profit for palm oil producer Golden Agri-Resources fell 65 per cent to US$30 million from US$86 million the year before. The counter, however, had surged in the past weeks to more than 60 cents from around 53 cents.\n\nNo such luck for Super Group, however. The instant food and beverage maker saw its shares plunge a third from around $4.50 to almost $3 a share after it surprised the market with a 17 per cent fall in net profit to $18.7 million, cutting its growth story short. The stock has since recovered to around $3.50.\n\nKeppel Corp recorded one of the largest absolute profit gains for the quarter, with third-quarter net profit rising $111 million, or 32 per cent, to $457.6 million. Higher contributions from its property business offset a drop in core rig-building earnings.\n\nLooking ahead, Carmen Lee, head of investment research at OCBC, talked of uncertainty in an environment of potentially higher interest rates once the US starts tapering its asset purchases. Among Reits, the retail rental market should remain steady and Central Business District office rentals should remain positive next year due to limited supply, but the industrial market is \"showing signs of fatigue\", she said.\n\nAll in all, North Asia, notably China, might be more attractively priced than Asean or Singapore. Said Raymond Chan, AllianzGlobal Investors' chief investment officer for Asia Pacific: \"Chinese equities markets, including both onshore A-shares and offshore H-shares, at current levels offer attractive opportunities for long-term investors.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There, the cryptocurrency has become a way to circumvent Chinese capital controls and an alternative form of speculation amid a dearth of investment options.\n\nWhat is more surprising is that the Chinese government has done practically nothing about Bitcoin, for now at least.\n\n\"The Chinese firewall will stop you from going to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter but it doesn't stop you from going to bitcoin.com. In China, they have this fantastic service, BTCChina, that allows you to buy Bitcoins with your Chinese yuan,\" Hakim Mamoni, co-founder of Seedcoin, noted at the Bitcoin Singapore conference yesterday.\n\nToday, China is the second-largest downloader of Bitcoin wallets - a virtual program that stores users' Bitcoins - after the United States. In May, 84,000 wallets were downloaded in China, vaulting it into pole position for that month, according to Zennon Kapron, managing director of Kapronasia, a research and advisory firm for financial services.\n\nIncidentally, since May, the price of Bitcoins has surged from about US$100-US$150 to about US$450. This being a currency that is prized for keeping its owners anonymous, it is hard to pin the spike in price on the Chinese, but all signs point their way.\n\nThe draw of the Bitcoin is dual-fold. High net worth individuals use the virtual currency to get money out of China and at the same time, the same currency controls being circumvented have increased Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative investment.\n\n\"For the average investor in China, there are very few investment choices and that's why we've seen real estate prices skyrocket. Now we're seeing that with Bitcoin as well,\" Mr Kapron said yesterday at Bitcoin Singapore.\n\nThe infrastructure that sprang up to support the burgeoning Bitcoin trade is coming into its own. China's largest transaction platform, BTC China, recently surpassed the transaction volume of incumbent Mt.Gox.\n\nAmid all this activity, the Chinese government has kept an intriguing silence, and might - in some quarters - tacitly approve. Earlier this year, CCTV, China's official network, aired a Bitcoin documentary which caused awareness of the currency to soar.\n\n\"In theory, anything that goes across CCTV is government-approved. (But) the government hasn't said anything about Bitcoin yet,\" Mr Kapron said.\n\nWhat the Chinese authorities ultimately do will have ramifications across Bitcoin markets, including Singapore's.\n\n\"If China makes a move on the regulatory front, the US will almost be forced to follow because there's such a large economic connection between the two of them,\" he said. Singapore will in turn take its cue from the US and the European Union.\n\n\"If the currency is going to take off, China is going to have to be a part of it,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Consider only what by oneself is done or left undone.\"\n\nThe 67-year-old president, after whom the theatre venue is named, is the chairman of the three-day pow-wow, at which Britain is represented by Prince Charles, standing in for Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Commonwealth, in particular, has drawn flak for holding the summit on this Indian Ocean island, given that its government has for years refused to allow independent probes into war crimes and rights abuses allegedly committed during and after a 27-year civil war that ended in 2009; recent reports of reporters being harassed and the continued violation of human rights have also raised alarms.\n\nThe leaders of Canada, India and Mauritius have boycotted the summit, but the Commonwealth and other CHOGM leaders, including Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, defended the meeting as a way to engage Sri Lanka constructively on these issues.\n\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs K Shanmugam, who attended the CHOGM Foreign Ministers' meeting on Thursday, told Singapore reporters that political reconciliation in Sri Lanka cannot be imposed by external parties. Isolating the country will not automatically improve the welfare of its people, he said.\n\n\"Singapore's approach is to support Sri Lanka in its reconciliation process through constructive engagement, as well as by helping with development projects in the north and the east,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIn his opening speech yesterday, President Rajapaksa said the Commonwealth should stay focused on social-economic issues that improve the welfare of its people, and not be \"judgmental\".\n\n\"If the Commonwealth is to remain relevant to its member countries, the association must respond to the needs of its people and not turn into a punitive or judgmental body,\" he said.\n\nResponding, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbot said \"we are here as much to praise as to judge\", and noted that Sri Lanka has made much progress since the end of its civil war. The economy has enjoyed growth rates of up to 8.2 per cent, and a record high of more than a million tourists visited the country last year.\n\nAustralia hosted the previous CHOGM summit.\n\nDuring his impassioned speech, Mr Rajapaksa said his government deserved credit for managing to bring an end to the conflict. \"We asserted the greatest human right - the right to life. In the last four years, there has not been one single terrorism-related incident in Sri Lanka.\"\n\nThe theme for CHOGM 2013 is \"Growth with Equity: Inclusive Development\"; its agenda includes sessions on debt restructuring and climate change.\n\nMeanwhile, Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has given his \"full support\" for an early ratification of the recently inked European-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting with Mr Lee on the sidelines of CHOGM, the two leaders also said they looked forward to expanding their good ties with \"enhanced bilateral cooperation in the areas of training of officials and pursuing new economic opportunities together\", according to Mr Lee's press secretary Chang Li Lin.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For instance, the announcement that the exchange and Monetary Authority of Singapore are looking into the trading of the three designated counters should have been made before trading resumed and not after. But to blame the exchange exclusively is both naive and oversimplistic. Wisdom in hindsight is a wonderful thing, but considering that SGX - whose primary role as a regulator is to signal warnings - can only query, designate and suspend stocks and that all three tools were employed in the case of the three counters mentioned above, it's difficult to see what it could have done differently during last month's sorry penny episode.\n\nSome have asserted that SGX should have sounded a warning much earlier while the three stocks were rising with not much fundamental backing. But so did dotcom stocks during the Internet/Nasdaq boom more than a decade ago, and so did China stocks in 2005-2007. So did many penny stocks during the periodic bursts of activity that drove the old Sesdaq and now Catalist to new highs throughout their life spans, one of the most spectacular being 1998-2000 after the Asian financial crisis.\n\nNobody would reasonably have expected the exchange to step in and warn investors of their folly during those run-ups - if it did it might have been accused of unwanted interference - so why should this have been any different?\n\nSGX is not in the business of passing judgment on the quality of its listings or of warning retail punters to be careful - though it is probably wincing inwardly every time the local bourse is described as being \"nothing more than a penny market\" - it is in the business of running a marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact with minimal friction.\n\nThe truth is that here we have a classic case of SGX being the convenient whipping boy when things go wrong. Or to be more precise, when prices fall suddenly and people lose money, scapegoats have to be found to take the blame. And there can be no easier target than the exchange, given that it labours under an outdated and unwieldy mandate that requires it to balance the pursuit of commercial profit with the performance of regulatory duties.\n\nPundits and letter writers have correctly pointed out that this arrangement (among others) needs urgent reviewing. No argument here. Even though it is inconceivable that SGX would ever sacrifice regulatory ideals for profit, the reality is that as long as a conflict of interest is perceived to exist by those in the market, then the exchange's credibility will suffer and criticism will abound when things go wrong, notwithstanding numerous checks and balances being in place to ensure conflicts are properly resolved.\n\nHowever, to focus on what the exchange could have done better would be to wrongly ignore the part played by the other major actors in the penny drama - retail punters, their trading representatives and the broking firms.\n\nAll are also culpable - retail punters for chasing speculative stocks ever higher into uncharted heights when there may have been no fundamental reason to support this; dealers for not reining in their clients; and broking houses' backrooms for ignoring what must have been increasingly risky exposure over the many months it took for the three counters to reach the levels they did.\n\nThe responsibility for ensuring good governance and for protecting investors isn't solely the SGX's; it rests with everyone connected to the market. The quicker everyone admits this, the better.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With the latest merger, it drops to three,\" he said. \"It is likely we'll be sitting around in 2020 saying, 'I wish we still had eight carriers.'\"\n\nDelta's merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008 led to price increases of more than 10 per cent on four of the routes they dominated, as well as service cuts on another route, according to research by the American Antitrust Institute.\n\nBased on the details on a settlement announced on Tuesday, antitrust specialists said that the consumers who could benefit would be those who use New York's LaGuardia, Reagan National outside Washington DC and other major airports.\n\nConsumers flying outside those markets, for example from Dallas to Charlotte, could be hurt, said Jeffrey Shinder, an antitrust specialist at Constantine Cannon LLP. \"Some consumers will end up being better off,\" he said. \"(But) I think in the long run, because it will take a bit for this to play out, that prices will be higher because of the transaction.\"\n\nHowever, Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust law at the University of Iowa College of Law, praised the decision as farsighted. \"The leg-up that the government has given some of the low-cost carriers, I think, is going to have a very positive impact on the industry,\" he said.\n\nUnder the deal announced on Tuesday, US Airways and American Airlines agreed to sell 104 take-off and landing slots at Reagan National and 34 at LaGuardia, along with supporting gates and ground facilities. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Loss per share was 4.89 cents, against 0.79 cent previously.\n\nThis, it said, was due to $49 million fair-value loss on financial assets, which led its \"other income\" to register a negative $46.6 million for the quarter.\n\nThe financial assets were mostly market securities tendered as consideration for the disposals of its interests in three companies: Industrial Power Technology, Think Greenergy and Think Environmental, it said.\n\nLionGold had adopted the November valuations of these securities (based on their closing price on Nov 8), rather than their value at end-September, because their prices have since seen \"significant declines\" and \"the higher valuations (at end-Sept) are not supportable as at the date of this announcement\".\n\nIts revenue, however, increased 52 per cent to $45.6 million on higher contribution from its gold-mining division and China manufacturing operations.\n\nUnlike LionGold, which incurred huge losses on its financial assets at fair value, profits of Blumont and Asiasons were boosted by substantial gains in their financial assets' fair value.\n\nFor Blumont, its net profit at $33.7 million was 7.6 times the $4.4 million a year ago, even as revenue fell 16 per cent to $1.3 million in its third quarter. The product sterilisation firm's earnings per share swelled to 1.97 cents for the quarter, from 0.29 cent a year ago.\n\nThis was driven by \"other gains\" of $40.9 million in Q3, comprised mainly one-time unrealised fair value gains of $38.9 million on quoted financial assets, which it revealed were \"a portfolio of equities investments in companies listed in Singapore Exchange and Bursa Malaysia\".\n\nInvestment firm Asiasons returned to the black with a net profit of $33.4 million, reversing year-ago net losses of $5.7 million, while revenue jumped fourfold to $1.3 million - barely a fraction of earnings. Its earnings per share swelled to 3.41 cents, against losses of 0.6 cent per share a year ago.\n\nAsiasons explained its revenue surge as financial advisory and media revenue contributed by two units acquired this year, on top of its usual fund management fees.\n\nIts \"other income\" was $34.4 million - against just $37.8 million a year ago - on the gain on dilution of associated company ISR Capital (one of the stocks also queried but not suspended by SGX on Oct 4), as well as unrealised fair value gains on financial assets in its portfolio of mostly quoted securities listed in Singapore. Share of income from its associated companies also helped, it said.\n\nDeputy head of Voyage Research, Ng Kian Teck, said the common huge swings in gains and losses across the fair value of these companies' financial assets is likely related to the fact they supposedly belong to a broader group of penny stocks linked through a web of cross-holdings. Some links such as direct shareholdings are more obvious and others less apparent.\n\n\"Why LionGold incurred losses while Blumont and Asiasons gained from financial assets could be because of the mixture of counters they held. But you can tell that the assets they are holding on to exhibit quite volatile price movements,\" he said.\n\nAsiasons in its results also noted that the prices of certain securities which it has a \"significant stake\" in have declined sharply and if this keeps up, the group is likely to incur fair value losses of $106 million in its next quarter.\n\nOn its move to raise net proceeds of $17.1 million, LionGold said yesterday that it plans to place 98.2 million new shares at 18.3 cents each.\n\nThe issue price carries a 7.85 per cent discount to its volume weighted average price of 19.86 cents for trades done on Thursday.\n\nThe shares will be placed to three subscribers: hedge-fund manager Wintercrest Advisors, financial consultant Stephen Yeo, and Sia Ah Kheng, a businessman with interests in a construction business. Wintercrest is owned by New York-based Platinum Partners' Value Arbitrage fund, which last month also subscribed for US$200 million worth of convertible bonds from Blumont.\n\nLionGold's shares yesterday fell 2 per cent to end at 19.2 cents on the news.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is no definitive evidence that aspirin is effective for those who have never had a heart attack\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH an ageing population and with advances in medicine, more people are taking blood thinning drugs daily for the prevention and treatment of stroke and heart disease. A common question is whether taking an aspirin a day is useful. Before commencing on these drugs, it is important to understand whether blood thinning agents are safe and what the precautions are to prevent bleeding complications.\n\nTypes of blood thinning agents\n\nBlood thinning agents can be broadly divided into two groups. The first, termed anti-platelet drugs, encompasses all the drugs that prevent clot formation by preventing blood platelets from clumping together. When platelets clump together, a biological reaction is activated and a clot is formed. This is frequently the mechanism for a heart attack. In a heart attack, the inner lining of the channel at the site of the narrowed segment of the artery may tear (\"plaque rupture\" ) and the body reacts by activating the platelets to clump together at the site of the tear with subsequent formation of a blood clot blocking the heart artery.\n\nAnti-platelet drugs are routinely given to patients with severely narrowed heart arteries - those with heart attacks, those who have undergone insertion of stents into heart arteries, those with heart bypass surgery and those with strokes due to blocked arteries.\n\nThe second group of drugs, anticoagulant drugs, act on a different blood clotting mechanism which is activated through proteins, called blood clotting factors, which are mainly produced by the liver. This is given to patients who are at risk of spontaneous blood clot formation as a result of abnormal heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), severe damage to the heart pump or artificial mechanical valve replacement.\n\nSigns of bleeding\n\nEarly signs of thinning of the blood include easy bruising on the skin and gum bleeding. More serious bleeding will usually involve the gut. Bleeding from blood thinning agents can arise from the stomach or the small intestine and it can either present as vomiting of blood (which may be fresh red blood or altered blood that looks like coffee) or stools which are almost black in colour (as a result of altered blood). It can also present as passage of dark red or fresh blood in stools as a result of bleeding in the large intestine.\n\nRisk of bleeding\n\nBased on data published by US researchers from Mayo clinic in September in the Circulation journal on patients of age 60 years and above, the overall incidence of stomach or upper small intestinal bleeding with use of blood thinning drugs was about two in 100 patients who were followed up for one year. The overall incidence of bleeding from the large intestine was about seven per 100 patients who were followed up for one year. The risk was highest in those who were on anti-platelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs together. Those on this combination were also most likely to require hospitalisation and to require blood transfusion, especially if aspirin was the anti-platelet agent being prescribed.\n\nFor every 100 patients who are started on a combination of aspirin and an anticoagulant drug for the first year, there will be about two who will have bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine, almost seven who will bleed from the large intestine, three who will require hospitalisation, and about six who will require blood transfusion. The numbers are slightly better if aspirin was replaced with another anti-platelet drug when used in combination with an anticoagulant drug.\n\nThe use of two antiplatelet agents (aspirin plus another antiplatelet agent) is the routine medication for all patients who have just had stents placed in their heart arteries to open up blockages. For every 100 patients started on this combination for the first year, about one will have bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine, about six will bleed from the large intestine, 1.5 who will require hospitalisation, and about two who will require blood transfusion.\n\nHence, it is clear that the use of long-term blood thinning agents is associated with significant risks of bleeding from the gut.\n\nDo all blood thinning agents damage the stomach and intestine?\n\nAspirin, even at a low dose, doubles the risk of a major bleed compared to those given a placebo. Aspirin can cause direct injury to the lining of the stomach and intestines, resulting in bleeding. Unlike aspirin, the other blood thinning agents including the other types of anti-platelet drugs (such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), and anticoagulant drugs (such as warfarin, rivaroxaban and dabigatran) do not directly injure the lining of the stomach and the intestines but will increase the likelihood of bleeding if there is damage to the wall lining.\n\nPrecautionary measures\n\nThere are several precautionary measures to take when taking blood thinning drugs. First, do not take aspirin for prevention of heart attack if you do not have significant heart disease. There is no definitive evidence that aspirin is effective for the prevention of heart attacks for those who have never had a heart attack. This is so even for those with known heart disease but with no prior heart attack.\n\nThere is evidence that microscopic vessels in the wall of the heart arteries can bleed into the narrowed segments of the heart artery and worsen the heart condition. Aspirin can potentially predispose to this in those with pre-existing narrowing of the heart arteries. In addition to the risk of bleeding from the stomach and gut, aspirin can cause serious bleeding into the brain. In a review of the role of aspirin in heart disease published earlier this year in the European Heart Journal, the author concluded that there was no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50-100 mg/day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.\n\nSecond, if long-term anti-platelet drug treatment is necessary, another alternative antiplatelet medication (such as clopidogrel) can be considered in place of aspirin. Third, underlying medical conditions that can predispose to bleeding in the gut should be treated, including gastritis, ulcers, and piles. Fourth, drugs that reduce acidity and protect the stomach and the upper small intestine from bleeding should be given to those who require long-term blood thinning medication.\n\nFifth, for those who have an increased risk of bleeding because of age or underlying medical conditions or may require surgery in the future, when undergoing stenting of their blocked heart arteries, they should consider the use of the new generation of heart stents which do not require long-term blood thinning medication (usually not more than six months) as opposed to older generation of stents which require lifelong anti-platelet medication.\n\nSixth, when starting oral blood thinning drugs, avoid drugs that can increase the risk of bleeding in the gut such as painkillers under the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, anti-depression drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and injectable blood thinners called heparin.\n\nSeven, if you are on warfarin, you will need to understand the multiple food and drug interactions with this drug and the risk of foetal abnormality when becoming pregnant while on medication. Finally, wherever possible, try to avoid having to take anti-platelet drugs and anticoagulants together.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

Whether he eventually prevails over the many opponents to his view could shape China's future growth trajectory.\n\nHis view matters because he was the only scholar from the emerging world to take the top economist job at the World Bank, with the backing of the Chinese government. From 2008 until June last year, he oversaw the bank's research, coming up with economic guidance to help the global communities cope with the fallout of the recent financial crisis.\n\nHis domestic credentials were burnished more than 30 years ago when he defected from Taiwan's army by swimming across a frontline island to the China mainland. An arrest warrant from Taiwan is still out on him.\n\nThose credentials were boosted early this month when he was retained by Prime Minister Li Keqiang as an adviser to China's Cabinet, the State Council. Along with five other fresh appointees, the advisory team is now 64 strong and comprises specialists in fields ranging from art to technology and economics.\n\nCuriously, Mr Lin's expectations of China growing incessantly at 8 per cent seems to have run ahead of what the Chinese leaders are willing to say these days in public. It makes him stand out in Chinese academia, which tilts in favour of a remedy for the country to modify, if not radically alter, its current growth path.\n\nAt issue is not his underlying assumption about China's potential, but whether such a high rate of growth would be beneficial to China and the world, or even feasible to pursue.\n\nBy now, the magical figure of 8 per cent has virtually disappeared from top officials' vocabulary. Premier Li has been sticking to 7 per cent as the government's bottom line for growth in despatches published at home and abroad by the state media. More recently, on Nov 4, he raised the bar marginally to 7.2 per cent, which he said was the minimum needed to cap urban unemployment at 4 per cent and to ensure the creation of 10 million jobs.\n\nMr Li made the comment at a national congress of China's trade union, citing a national capacity to generate between 1.3 million and 1.5 million jobs for every percentage gain in gross domestic product (GDP) now, up from a million jobs in the past for the same pace of growth.\n\nHis prescription for China's economic transition, along with his vision for it to double the size of its economy before 2020, is fundamentally Keynesian, an approach entailing expansionary fiscal policy and public investment along the lines of China's current investment-led growth model.\n\nWhen it is done, China will achieve a per capita GDP of US$12,000 by 2020, almost double the current US$6,100 and possibly catapulting the nation into the league of high-income countries.\n\nMr Lin aired the same optimism in Singapore this week at the inaugural China Forum at the Singapore Management University, and later that same day in Hong Kong to a small evening audience at the Asia Society. This time in Singapore, however, he qualified his view by stressing the need to allocate resources more effectively and remove the distortions and bottlenecks in the official distribution mechanism.\n\nIn Hong Kong, he focused on promoting a global initiative to launch a multilateral infrastructure fund, styled in the spirit of the Marshall Plan for post-World War II Europe, and the invention of a currency called paper gold to replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency. These are ideas proposed in his new book, Against the Consensus: Reflections on the Great Recession.\n\nAt home, Mr Lin, a specialist in development economy, has engaged in heated public debates with economists over China's future course of growth.\n\nAmong his adversaries is Gary Liu, the deputy director of Shanghai-based CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance.\n\nMr Liu said: \"Lin is a radical voice. He is catering to officials' mentality. He provides them (with) an ideological cover. His view poses many dangers (for China). It could mislead officials and cause reform to backtrack.\n\n\"The chance for China of achieving such growth rate is very small. Theoretically, we can continue to grow at 8 per cent, but it would come at a huge cost, environmentally and socially.\"\n\nAnother high-profile opponent of Mr Lin's ideas is the founder of Primavera Capital Group, Fred Hu, a former partner and Greater China chairman at Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the same week the Communist Party issued its communiqu\u00e9 for the next decade, Mr Hu voiced his objection to Mr Lin's proposed use of an expansionary fiscal policy to achieve 8 per cent growth over the next 20 years.\n\n\"I do not agree with Mr Lin. In effect, fiscal and monetary policies are short-term, counter-cyclical policy tools. For example, in 2008, during the global recession, our government offset the negative impact with short-term demand expansion. But regrettably, this short-term counter-cyclical policy became a long-term policy, causing a large expansion in government spending and leading to over capacity and high local debt. It's a very dangerous situation,\" he said on Phoenix TV.\n\nDiscarding the old growth model may be the prevailing consensus, but Mr Lin's opponents are far from carrying the day. The problem is how much political will the leadership can muster from various political factions to implement reform.\n\nCEIBS' Mr Liu said: \"The signal of the current leadership is clear, judging from their statements and official papers that they want structural reform and rebalance away from an investment-dependent model.\n\n\"But the government is still very vague on many things, such as on the reform of state-owned enterprises, an issue of popular concern. My personal view is the speed of reform in China will always lag behind public expectations.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In 2012, bond deals totalled $31 billion.\n\nThe increasing activity by mid-caps is also a sign of the market's growing maturity, as investors gain more comfort with high yield, less familiar names, as well as foreign companies, said Tan Kee Phong, OCBC Bank head, capital markets.\n\n\"From where I'm standing, it's kind of natural development of the market; in the beginning, it's high-grade issuers, the next level normally it's going down the credit curve or extending the tenure,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nEarly last year's three-year $250 million 8 per cent sale by Shui On Land, a Hong Kong company, sparked off interest from local investors for high-yield foreign names, he said.\n\nThere were also many high- yield deals by Indian corporates.\n\n\"Next step, if I can look at foreign names, I can also look at local names,\" said Mr Tan, of investors' growing demand for mid-cap bonds.\n\nMid-cap issues are typically small size, with many less than $100 million, and short tenures like two years as that is what investors are most comfortable with.\n\nThe pipeline for more mid-cap deals in the next two weeks is pretty good, before December, when the market quietens as many go on holidays, he said. \"Generally, interest rates are still low historically, growth wise, it's positive, inflation is benign and liquidity is still available,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gold rose 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more than US$2 trillion into the financial system, fuelling expectations of accelerated inflation and a weaker US dollar. President Barack Obama nominated Ms Yellen, the bank's vice-chairman, last month to succeed chairman Ben S Bernanke, whose term expires on Jan 31.\n\nThe economy and labour market are performing \"far short of their potential\" and must improve before the Fed will consider curbing its US$85 billion of monthly bond purchases, Ms Yellen said at her nomination hearing on Thursday.\n\nWhile gold is heading for its first annual drop in 13 years after some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value, lower prices boosted jewellery, bar and coin purchases. Demand from China, India and the Middle East surged a combined 27 per cent in the 12 months through September, the World Gold Council (WGC) estimates.\n\n\"It's unlikely that Bernanke will do anything at his last meeting if he perceives that his successor would prefer to leave policy unchanged,\" said Nic Brown, head of commodities research at Natixis SA in London. \"The dollar may drop back, too. This is all potentially positive for gold prices in the very short term.\"\n\nBullion, down 23 per cent this year to US$1,282.86 an ounce in London, added 1.7 per cent since touching a four-week low of US$1,261.42 on Nov 12. The Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 commodities dropped 4.6 per cent since the end of December, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 17 per cent. The Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index lost 2.3 per cent.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News on Nov 8 forecast the Fed probably will delay reductions in bond purchases until March. Gold slid earlier this week as the Bloomberg US Dollar Index set an eight-week high on Nov 12, after the US reported more job gains for October than economists forecast.\n\nBullion's 30-week correlation coefficient to the dollar index, a measure against 10 major currencies, is at minus 0.59, with a figure of minus one meaning the two always move in opposite directions.\n\n\"Supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy,\" Ms Yellen said in prepared remarks to the Senate Banking Committee. Through her testimony, she publicly voiced her views for the first time in seven months on the unprecedented monetary stimulus that she's supported.\n\nChina's demand for jewellery, bars and coins rose 30 per cent to 996.3 metric tonnes in the 12 months through September, the WGC said in a report on Thursday. Usage gained 24 per cent to 977.6 tonnes in India and 25 per cent to 225.8 tonnes in the Middle East.

Her comments during the week, widely interpreted as indicating that the Fed will continue pumping money into the system via its QE (quantitative easing) programme, have soothed worries that if the money printing stops, then stocks might actually have to rise or fall on fundamental or economic factors.\n\nNow, thanks to reassurances from the incoming Fed chair that the taps will remain open, it's \"risk on\" again - at least on Wall Street. US indices rose to two all-time highs on Wednesday and Thursday - first because Ms Yellen's thoughts were released ahead of her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee and then again when she actually stood before the committee. In response, the Straits Times Index (STI) gained 24 points or 0.8 per cent over the week, with the index yesterday rising 10.19 points to 3,201.27.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing on Thursday, Ms Yellen said it was \"imperative that (the Fed does) what (it) can to promote a very strong recovery\". Ms Yellen did not sound happy with the current state of affairs, saying that \"it's important not to remove support, especially when the recovery is fragile\" and that the labour market was still performing \"far short\" of its potential.\n\nAt the same time, she strongly set out the case for quantitative easing, saying that while the Federal Open Market Committee was monitoring potential negatives of the programmes, she judged that the benefits still outweighed the costs.\n\nMind you, take a step back and look at the STI's performance for the year and the picture isn't anything to write home about. In almost 11 months, the index's gain is now a measly 34 points or 1.07 per cent. Compare this to a stunning 26 per cent rise in the S&P 500 so far in 2013, the main market benchmark for the country which originated the great financial crisis of 2008 and still remains mired in recession, and investors have an idea of how powerful money printing can be and where fund managers' priorities lie.\n\nBlue-chip underperformance aside, the slump in penny stocks that started last month with the crash in Asiasons Capital, Blumont and LionGold continued this week, manifesting itself in significantly reduced daily volume and only sporadic bursts of interest in low-priced issues. In yesterday's session, only 1.6 billion units worth $1.02 billion were traded, figures which at the height of the penny boom earlier this year could well have been chalked up by a single counter instead of the entire market.\n\nIn the commodities segment, eyes were peeled on Olam International, which on Thursday reported a 5.7 per cent rise in profit for its first quarter ended Sept 30. In response, Olam's shares yesterday added 3.5 cents to $1.53 with 5.4 million units traded, even if the company's figures only stirred lukewarm interest from analysts.\n\nHSBC Global Research, for example, rated the stock \"neutral'' with a $1.64 target. It said Olam was on the right trajectory to achieve the goal of turning free cash flow (FCF)-positive in FY2014. \"However, turning FCF to equity positive will take longer, in our view. For that, overall gearing levels (including inventories) need to moderate further from the current 1.9x,\" said HSBC. \"While below the self-imposed 2x limit, it is not sufficient to improve the comfort levels of investors, in our view.\"\n\nNomura called a \"buy\" on Olam with a $2 target while OCBC Investment Research maintained a \"hold\" with a $1.45 fair value.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tay Suan Chiang checks in on them\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nVillage Hotel Katong\n\nA FAMILIAR icon in the East Coast has returned with a new name and new look. What was once Paramount Hotel and Shopping Centre is now Village Hotel Katong, a five-minute walk away from Parkway Parade.\n\nThe facade of the buildings and the number of rooms have not changed, but everything else is new, following a $30 million refurbishment.\n\nThe design of the hotel, which opened earlier this month, is inspired by its surrounding Katong and Joo Chiat neighbourhoods. The Peranakan theme is clearly put across the hotel.\n\n\"The Peranakan culture is unique to the South-east Asian region and synonymous with the Katong precinct. Since the Village brand is all about giving guests authentic and local experiences, the infusion of Peranakan influences in Village Hotel Katong makes for a perfect fit,\" says Arthur Kiong, chief executive officer of Far East Hospitality, which owns the hotel. Far East Hospitality bought over Paramount in 2011.\n\nAll 229 rooms in Village Hotel Katong come with Peranakan motifs on the mirrored walls, carpets, wallpaper, furnishings and even on the bathroom tiles. Regardless of the size of the room, the Peranakan decor is consistent. What differs are the colour schemes, such as light green, fuchsia and blue.\n\nMr Kiong says the hotel will be popular with guests who have previously stayed in town but now want something different on their subsequent visits to Singapore.\n\nGuests who want something different can opt for the Club Room, which comes with a free standing tub in between the bathroom and sleeping area. The hotel also has eight suites, which come with a kitchenette, laundry and sitting area, which is suitable for long-staying guests.\n\nThose with a keen eye will also notice that even the artworks and decorative items in the hotel carry the Peranakan theme. Some of the rooms have Peranakan tea sets or ceramic jars, and the hotel collaborated with heART Studio, a local private art studio, to create pieces with a Peranakan theme. Some of the artworks were painted by kids as young as five years old.\n\nThe hotel's restaurant naturally has a Peranakan design. Called Katong Kitchen, it serves Nonya, Macanese, Asian, local Chinese and Western cuisine.\n\nNaumi Hotel\n\nMOST hotels undergo a face-lift after more than a decade of operations. But not the Naumi Hotel at Seah Street. The hotel opened in 2007, recently completed a year-long transformation and reopened its door last month.\n\nFounder and managing director, Surya Jhunjhnuwala says: \"We decided on a complete revamp as the trends have changed and what people want today is very different from what they wanted six years ago. Following the revamp, we ensured that we have retained the luxurious feel of Naumi but also provided guests with a more contemporary feel.\"\n\nThe entire hotel was gutted out save for the very popular infinity pool on the roof top.\n\nWith better space planning, the number of rooms has increased from 40 to 73. They are now slightly smaller than before, but with the clever use of lighter tones and space saving features, they don't feel constrained.\n\nRepeat guests to the hotel will notice that Naumi's floral motif has been retained in this face-lift, and can be spotted on the carpet and hanging lights. To give guests that luxury feel, beds come with seven-layer bedding in 400 thread-count Egyptian cotton, and premium bath amenities from organic New York brand Malin + Goetz. Some rooms come with free standing tubs, positioned such that guests can watch TV even when they are in it.\n\nThe new Naumi now comes with two-themed rooms, a black and white room inspired by Coco Chanel, and another in more masculine tones, inspired by Andy Warhol.\n\nLike before, Naumi offers guests a privacy floor to cater to the needs of the female traveller.\n\nTable by Rang Mahal, the hotel's new all-day dining restaurant, extends a holistic dining experience that Rang Mahal Restaurant is best known for. It offers all-day dining and bento sets designed for efficient, speedy lunches for business travellers.\n\nThe hotel also worked with a nutritionist to come up with a healthier breakfast menu. There's still bacon and ham, but these are cooked with less oil. Guests can also load up on specially concocted mixed juices with shots of collagen or vitamins.\n\nThe Westin Singapore\n\nTHE Westin brand was a familiar name when the hotel was in Singapore from 1986 to 2001. After more than a decade's absence, the American brand is making its comeback to Singapore.\n\nBack then, Westin The Stamford was once the world's tallest hotel. This time round, The Westin Singapore boasts the highest hotel lobby in the country, on the 32nd level of Asia Square Tower Two near Marina Bay.\n\nThe Westin occupies levels 32 to 46, making it a first for Singapore to have a hotel within an office building.\n\nSince it is located on the uppermost floors of the building, it only makes sense that the hotel is designed so guests can fully enjoy the view.\n\nThe lobby boasts 11-metre high floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook Marina Bay, and the lobby lounge by the side will leave guests feeling on top of the world.\n\nSimilarly, the hotel's 305 rooms all have floor-to-ceiling windows. Depending on the room category, guests could either enjoy the heritage city view, which looks out onto Shenton Way and Chinatown; the sea view, which has views of the port and Sentosa Cove in the distance, or the bay view, where they can look out onto Marina Bay and the South China Sea. There are only seven rooms which offer the bay view, making them more exclusive.\n\nHotel rooms in the city tend to be on the smaller side, but here they are surprisingly spacious, and decked out in soothing tones. All rooms come with standalone bathtubs, some of which are placed next to the windows, giving guests a bath with a view. The good thing is that the nearest buildings are a safe distance away, so there is no chance of peeking.\n\nThe hotel also has an infinity pool and a spa which will soon open to public.\n\nFood-wise, the hotel offers three options: an all-day dining restaurant called Seasonal Tastes, Daily Treats, a deli located on the ground floor, and Cook & Brew, a gastro-bar on the 33rd level. Cook & Brew serves local food, and offers over 100 different types of beer from 17 countries. This is the first Cook & Brew for the Westin brand, which will be introduced in subsequent hotels later. With its location in the CBD, the hotel expects a majority of its clients to be corporate guests.\n\nChuck Abbott, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide's regional vice president for South-east Asia, says: \"The Westin Singapore will play a significant role in the transformation of the Marina Bay development as we inject a unique and revitalising experiences into this urban oasis.\"\n\nThe Westin is owned by Starwood.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/3-new-models-may-keep-cat-coe-buoyant", "site_title": "3 new models may keep Cat A COE buoyant", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\n3 new models may keep Cat A COE buoyant\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nTHREE new Japanese sedans are expected to shake up the COE Category A market when they arrive early next year, just in time for a recategorisation of the small car segment.\n\nThe launches of the new Toyota Corolla Altis, Mazda3 and Honda City are likely to keep the Cat A COE premium relatively buoyant despite the exit of luxury models, which had been blamed for pushing up prices. Still, most dealers foresee at least a 10 to 15 per cent fall from current certificate of entitlement levels.\n\nFrom February next year, the engines of Cat A cars not only have to be limited in displacement to under 1,600 cc, but their power cannot exceed 97 kW or 130 hp.\n\nThis means 42 models currently in Cat A are affected and will have to move over to Cat B (for cars above 1,600cc), including luxury rides like Singapore's top model last year, the Mercedes-Benz C180, and the BMW 316i. There will be about 100 models in the new Cat A.\n\nWith their bigger profit margins, distributors of high-end cars were said to have driven Cat A COE premiums to an all-time high of $92,100 in January this year. The premium has since slipped to $72,609 now.\n\n\"Next February should see the return of bread-and-butter models from those Japanese and Korean brands which have been priced out of Cat A for over two years,\" said the sales manager of a mass-market dealership. \"There are many prospective upgraders who have been waiting on the sidelines because of high car prices and they should be returning to the market next year.\"\n\nHe added that after the new rules kick in, he expects the Cat A COE premium to drop to the $60,000 level.\n\n\"Also, with the loan curbs still in force, affordability is an issue when the COE premium is high. So when Cat A softens, we will see more people coming back into the showrooms,\" he said.\n\nBut will the influx of these buyers keep the Cat A COE premium where it is today?\n\n\"No, premiums should soften despite the fact that there will be strong demand,\" said the sales manager. \"This is because this group of buyers is not in the same league as those who buy Mercedes-Benz or BMWs. While they are interested in buying a new car, they are not prepared to pay a high price.\"\n\nThe general manager of another mass-market dealership agreed.\n\n\"Those who buy our cars are relatively conservative,\" he explained. \"The moment the Cat A COE goes up too much, they don't want to buy anymore. They can probably still afford it but they just refuse to.\"\n\nIf and when the Cat A COE premium falls, what is stopping those buyers of small Mercs and BMWs from looking at the Japanese and Korean offerings instead?\n\n\"Some of them may consider a Toyota or a Honda, but most of them won't,\" said the sales manager. \"There is this thing called branding and prestige and for them, it does not include a Japanese volume model.\"\n\nThe all-new Toyota Corolla Altis will, however, be a bigger and more refined model than the current one, which costs about $120,000 now. The exterior looks like the present Camry mid-sized sedan, while the brand new interior is said to be very roomy because its wheelbase has been lengthened by 100mm to 2,700mm. The 1.6-litre engine is mated to a seven-step continuously variable transmission instead of the old four-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nThe Thai-made Altis has traditionally been Toyota's best-selling model here. It was the Republic's most popular model from 2002 to 2006. After dropping out in 2007, it remained in the top three until after 2010 as the COE quota contracted substantially. The model is expected to be launched in January.\n\nThe new Mazda3 is slated to arrive in the first quarter of 2014 from Japan. This 1.5-litre model will feature the familiar SkyActiv technology, which combines efficient engines with a smooth transmission in a lightweight but strong body.\n\nAs for the new Honda City, it is scheduled for a Q2 introduction here.

Underlying net profit, at $884 million, was flat but would have been up 5.9 per cent in constant currency terms.\n\nGroup operating revenue fell 8.9 per cent to $4.16 billion, mostly because of the weaker Australian dollar. Independent of currency fluctuation, operating revenue was still down 2.7 per cent. This remained Australia's fault as Optus's mobile revenue took a hit, falling 6.2 per cent to A$1.34 billion (S$1.55 billion) on lower equipment sales and a mandated reduction in the mobile termination rate.\n\nAs a whole, Optus saw operating revenue fall 5.4 per cent to A$2.12 billion for the quarter, but Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) grew 15.1 per cent to A$644 million on \"improved cost structure\".\n\nFor the half-year ended Sept 30, SingTel's group net profit was up 3.8 per cent at $1.88 billion despite a 7.1 per cent drop in operating revenue to $8.46 billion. The bottom line was bolstered by a net exceptional gain of $101 million.\n\nSingTel's mobile customer base in Singapore grew by 84,000 over the quarter ended Sept 30, taking the total to 3.93 million. Mobile revenue stood at $516 million, up 7.3 per cent year on year.\n\nMonthly average revenue per user (Arpu) on the postpaid front stood at $79 for the quarter, one per cent lower. Excluding data-only SIMs, however, Arpu would have increased 2 per cent.\n\nMio TV's residential subscriber base stood at 414,000 - an increase of 8,000 customers over the quarter.\n\nThese 414,000 customers include 8,000 who are on rival StarHub's platform, but are counted as mio TV subscribers by virtue of their subscribing to English Premier League (EPL) content from mio TV through the cross-carriage arrangement.\n\nOf these 8,000, 5,000 are new customers and 3,000 were on the mio TV platform before the EPL season and are now on StarHub's.\n\nSingTel said yesterday that the exposure to the new customers \"presents us with a great opportunity to pipe in mio TV content during commercial breaks\", and that the impact from cross-carriage \"is not significant\".\n\nMio TV's monthly Arpu for the quarter stood at $29, up from $22 in the corresponding quarter a year ago.\n\nIn local currency terms, Indonesia's Telkomsel stood out with growth in its pre-tax profit for SingTel, with a 2 per cent gain year on year.\n\nThailand's AIS posted pre-tax profit in local currency terms that was down 6 per cent for the quarter on higher network expenses for 3G expansion, while Airtel's contribution - down 8 per cent - suffered from network and spectrum expenses.\n\nOperating revenue from the group's digital division grew 44 per cent to $42 million, driven mostly by mobile ad unit Amobee. Even so, the division's loss widened from a negative Ebitda of $31 million for Q2 last year to $40 million.\n\nAllen Lew, SingTel chief executive officer of group digital life, said that these results were to be expected given the \"start-up\" nature of the division.\n\nSingTel will continue to focus on differentiating Amobee from its competitors, he added.\n\nSingTel's counter closed three cents higher at $3.79 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/no-waiter-please-weve-e-menu", "site_title": "No waiter, please! We've the e-menu", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNo waiter, please! We've the e-menu\n\nDeveloped by local tech firms, these automated systems not only help ease manpower crunch at eateries but also eliminate the chances of errors in orders, reports RACHEL LOI\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 14, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBLACK-FACED waiters, disputes over wrong orders and maybe even service charge could all be a thing of the past if the food and beverage industry here decides to go down the automated route.\n\nIt could also solve the manpower crunch that's crippling eateries all over Singapore, with more eateries turning to solutions such as iPad menus and iPhone apps developed by local technology companies to run their operations.\n\nOne of the frontrunners in the business is 10-year-old local company Aptsys Technology Solutions Pte Ltd. Three years ago, it developed its iPad e-menu as well as an iPod touch system that waiters can use to send orders directly to the kitchen instead of having to key it into a separate point-of-sale terminal.\n\nRestaurants simply have to provide their own iPads, and Aptsys will install its customised menu into them. Customers can then browse at their own leisure and place orders without the hassle of flagging a flustered waiter. Using a solution like this also means restaurants no longer have to reprint their entire menu every time they come up with a new dish.\n\nRemoving bottleneck\n\nSays Aptsys founder Ernest Lim: \"This app removes the bottleneck in the entire workflow of the restaurant operation, and hence greatly increases productivity. Waiters can concentrate on serving food and presenting the bill, and customers can now get service easily with just a tap on the iPad.\"\n\nHis e-menu system took about half a year of research and development (R&D) before he could release it into the market, and restaurants can now purchase the app off-the-shelf for a minimum of $28,000 for their first outlet.\n\nThis initial fee covers customisation, installation, as well as commission. Each iPad then costs $1 a day to run, and that is capped at $10 a day per outlet, to cover the service charge incurred when the restaurant needs help with any technical issues such as the adding and removing of items from the menu.\n\nThis bodes well especially for European restaurant Napoleon, which carries 32 different wines that change every one or two weeks as part of their restaurant concept. \"I cannot afford to always be printing a wine list, so this way I can avoid the printing cost,\" says Jean-Christophe Cadoret, one of Napoleon's owners.\n\nThe Aptsys iPad menu has also caught the eye of many other establishments. Currently, over 40 restaurants in Singapore are installed with one of Aptsys's systems, and the number of requests has been rising.\n\nSo much so that Mr Lim has his own manpower issues and can install only about three or four systems a week for now. This is because each process can take up to two months depending on the clients' demands. New applicants would now have to join a three-month waiting list.\n\nMr Lim foresees that about 80 per cent of local sit-down restaurants will eventually have to introduce an e-menu system in order to cope with the lack of manpower and high wages.\n\nIn response to the growing demand for such system, a new start-up company, BigSpoon, is also developing its own e-solution. Fronted by two graduating students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) who managed to get a $10,000 grant from the NUS Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practicum Grant to help kick-start their project, BigSpoon's app shares some similarities with the one Aptsys offers but it also includes additional functions such as the ability to get a waiter's attention.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that restaurants do not have to get iPads to install the e-menus, as it will be downloadable for customers to carry around on their own smartphones.\n\nThink of it as a personal virtual waiter that you can take to any restaurant that subscribes to the service - one that even knows your favourite dishes as well as your allergies. Their app is still in the making, and will be released to the public only after January next year when initial tests with selected restaurants are complete.\n\nTo develop such an elaborate programme is not cheap, however. BigSpoon co-founder Jay Teo reveals that most of the NUS grant has already been used up just to develop this first version of the app and he is mentally prepared to eventually dig into his own pocket for more R&D.\n\n\"We are just at the beginning of changing the delivery of dining services to consumers. The demand for better service will always be there, and to meet these demands, the right tools are required,\" says Mr Teo.\n\n\"To some, it may seem impersonal to interact with a mobile device as opposed to a human. But one of our survey respondents said they would be fine ordering on a device if it knows them better and has more timely service than a human,\" he adds.\n\nBut some restaurant owners see things a little differently and feel a personal touch is still important.\n\nThe Lo & Behold Group's chief operations officer Andrew Ing, who has equipped three outlets with the Aptsys iPod Touch system, says: \"I hated the idea of e-menus at first because I thought where is the interaction between the server and the guest? That's still very important. So I was not keen on iPad e-menus but I thought the Aptsys iPod Touch system was much more efficient and it allows servers more time to interact with guests.\"\n\nGuests impressed\n\nWith the system, customers still use hardcopy menus but waiters punch orders onto their iPod Touches instead of walking back and forth from the POS system. It has also allowed Mr Ing to cut manpower at the rooftop bar Loof, from about 14 staff on a Friday to about 10 or 11, making his investment a worthwhile one.\n\n\"Technology is cheaper now. An iPod Touch is only about $100 each, and of course there's investment in software and programming but that is almost a one-off cost,\" he explains.\n\nAccording to Mr Ing, the system impresses guests with how the company is moving forward with technology. Sometimes there's just a \"mental block\" that needs to be gotten over, he says.\n\nSharing his view is Shaun Markus Lee, owner of Thai barbecue restaurant Moojaa and founder of the mobile dining app Alfred, which is similar to BigSpoon's. His app will be launched next month but it is already in use at Moojaa.\n\n\"So far, using the system has cut my manpower by two,\" says Mr Lee. \"It's between the devil and the deep blue sea, really. Because as much as restaurants might want to keep the human element . . . when it comes to a point where they can't find people to hire, they won't have much of a choice.\"\n\nAs for Timbre Group's establishments, they have an iPad e-menu installed at almost every table of their four biggest and most bustling outlets.\n\nManaging director Edward Chia expresses surprise when customers in their 50s embraced the idea of an e-menu. \"We are lucky because our customers are generally working executives, so they are more tech-savvy. But from time to time, of course, you do get people who still prefer the traditional method for the human touch,\" he says.\n\nTimbre has also digitalised another aspect of their dining experience - feedback it gets from its diners. Using an e-feedback app called triibe, they see between 50 and 100 feedback comments from each of its outlets every fortnight.\n\nUnlike the apps by Aptsys and BigSpoon, triibe is more consumer-driven. Established last year, it attracts diners to give feedback by offering rewards like a $10 voucher for their next visit.\n\nThe app costs between $65 and $130 per month per location depending on what features clients want - such as a consolidated bi-weekly report of the feedback so clients can evaluate their own service performance levels.\n\nAnother specialised app is Ticktok - the brainchild of three Singapore Management University (SMU) graduates who love to eat but hate to wait. It was funded by the Spring Singapore Young Entrepreneurs Scheme for Startups (YES! Starups) grant, which gives young entrepreneurs up to $50,000 to start their own business.\n\nWhat they do is provide busy eateries such as Saveur, Grub, and Wild Honey an automated queuing system where customers just have to key their phone number onto an iPad placed at the door, and they will receive an automated phone call once their table is ready.\n\nSays co-founder Chong Zi Xin: \"Instead of standing aimlessly in front of a restaurant, customers can move around and do some shopping even. And restaurants increase manpower productivity as manual calling processes have become automated. The host can easily call customers with a single tap.\"\n\nBut even with the wide array of digital options in the market, it seems there are still restaurants that are hesitant to jump on the e-solutions bandwagon.\n\nNapoleon's Mr Caboret, for instance, does not intend to subscribe to any of the other technologies even if he expands his business.\n\n\"For the moment the e-menu is enough. We don't want too much technology here as well. Though I am thinking of opening a second outlet, and will definitely keep the e-menu because it's very efficient. But the thing is you cannot survive on just iPads. You still need people because that's still very important,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even so, he vowed that SingTel would \"come up with something that is just as good\", stressing that this was part-and-parcel of coming up with new services.\n\nIt is unclear if this next product will land in WhatsApp territory again, but the telco had ambitions for the mobile messaging space for the best part of the year. LoopMe, an app that allowed free messaging and calling, was slated for launch in August before SingTel scrapped it.\n\nSpeaking at SingTel's quarterly earnings briefing yesterday, Mr Lew said LoopMe had been a stab at creating a superior alternative to other mobile messaging apps in the market. \"We had a partnership with a company based in Israel to do this; it didn't quite work out,\" he added.\n\nLoopMe was developed by New York Stock Exchange-listed Amdocs, which has its roots in Israel. In July, T-Jat - an Israeli start-up that had also worked on LoopMe - accused Amdocs of copyright infringement and breach of a licensing agreement involving the app. This legal dispute - which Amdocs called \"groundless\" - eventually went into arbitration, a process which does not involve SingTel.\n\nCourt documents filed by Amdocs last Tuesday claimed that SingTel had postponed the commercial launch of LoopMe as a result of T-Jat's initiation of the lawsuit. Amdocs also alleged that last month, its supply contract with SingTel was terminated and the launch of LoopMe cancelled altogether after the telco became \"concerned by the allegations\".\n\n\"Despite many months of development, and millions of dollars invested in the LoopMe app by Amdocs (and SingTel), LoopMe has been terminated because of T-Jat's litigations,\" Amdocs told the court.\n\nYesterday, SingTel's Mr Lew said: \"At the end of the day, we're still determined to come up with something that will make a difference and will allow us to continue to engage our customers in what is a core part of our business.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on when this new product would be released, but said SingTel was \"working internally to overcome the setback from LoopMe\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Opening its 11th office in China yesterday, United Overseas Bank (UOB) said increased trade between China and South-east Asia would be one of the key engines of growth in the bank's five-year plan.\n\nEric Lian, UOB (China) chief executive, said at the opening of the bank's latest sub-branch in Shanghai that two-way trade flows between South-east Asia and China have reached record highs. Last year, China and South-east Asia saw US$400 billion in trade between them. By 2020, China and Asean have committed to increase trade volume to US$1 trillion.\n\nMr Lian said that Chinese companies played a central role in trade activities in South-east Asia, particularly in the oil and gas, real estate, food and beverage, and telecommunications sectors. \"Chinese companies are increasingly looking to South-east Asia to fuel their next stage of growth.\"\n\nInitially, the \"going out\" strategy of Chinese companies focused on securing natural resources, he said. \"We are now seeing a new phase of growth arising from the opportunities that South-east Asia offers. The focus has since shifted to catering to the region's rising middle class through offering goods and services or building and infrastructure projects.\"\n\nUOB is aiming for double-digit growth from its China business over the next five years, he said. Annual revenue from China had trebled in the last five years. Over the same period, UOB's headcount has grown four-fold from 236 employees to almost 1,000. Last year, operating profit grew 115.6 per cent to 282.2 million yuan (S$57.8 million).\n\nTo help state-owned enterprises and private companies enter and expand into South-east Asia, UOB set up a Foreign Direct Investment Advisory Unit in China this year. The unit provides assistance ranging from company incorporation to borderless financial services through the bank's regional network.\n\nUOB also said that one of its strategies was to focus on providing banking services to China's growing wealthy segment. The latest sub-branch, which is on the Bund in Shanghai, will provide wealth management advisory to Chinese clients, it said.\n\nSeparately, DBS Bank yesterday opened its renovated representative office in Myanmar to better serve its customers investing in the country. In 2011, bilateral trade between Singapore and Myanmar reached $1.8 billion. Singapore is Myanmar's sixth-largest investor, with cumulative foreign direct investments of $4.4 billion at the end of 2011. Singapore is also Myanmar's third-largest trading partner, after China and Thailand.\n\nThe new office, in Yangon's business district, marks DBS's next phase of growth in Myanmar, where the bank has been present since 1993, the bank said in a statement.\n\n\"This move underscores DBS's continued execution against strategy to grow its presence in Asia and strengthen its banking franchise in the region,\" the bank said.\n\n\"Most of the business activity we are seeing is in trade finance,\" said Chan Weng Meng, DBS Yangon representative office chief. \"We have seen a significant increase in enquiries from our customers for trade finance - double the amount over the last 12 months.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It puts a hilarious twist on popular fairy tales, adding Singlish jokes, topical issues and a very light touch of racy humour for good measure.\n\nIn the case of Jack & the Bean-Sprout!, the 200-year-old fairytale has been duly given a local spin: Jack is recast as a humble boy living in a HDB flat with his beer-promoter mother.\n\nJack's mother, however, loves to gamble away her money at the casinos.\n\nOut of desperation, Jack trades their cow for a bag of \"dream beans\" with the karung guni man. When his mother finds out, she is furious and throws away the beans in the field next to Marina Bay Sands. Overnight, a massive bean sprout grows out of the soil and into the sky, where giants live and gooses lay golden eggs.\n\nIf the localised tale sounds vaguely familiar, it's because Wild Rice had already staged a version of it in 2006 written by Desmond Sim.\n\nA new version, however, has been penned by young playwright Joel Tan, who has also thrown out the original songs and written new ones. \"The new songs are more Broadway and showtune-y, unlike previous Wild Rice pantomimes that used a lot of pop songs and chart-topping hits,\" says Tan.\n\nShowtunes are, of course, the perfect vehicle for lead actor Goh - he spent the past decade perfecting his musical theatre skills: first as a masters student in musical theatre at the San Diego State University, then as a teacher of musical theatre and dance to kids aged nine to 12 at the La Jolla Country Day School, where he also served as the Glee Club director. Now, Goh is completing his PhD at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, while teaching at various tertiary institutions. His dissertation investigates the dearth of Asian-specific roles on Broadway.\n\nIf Goh's presence guarantees the music hitting some high notes, the casting of comedians Darius Tan cross-dressing as the mother, Siti Khalijah as the goose that lays golden eggs, and Karen Tan as the \"golden hits harp\" guarantees some big laughs.\n\nDarius Tan says: \"I get to wear about 5,001 costumes - really. Because as the mother, at first I'm this poor beer-promoter auntie. But when my son gets rich from stealing the giant's gold, I become this ultra tai tai with big hair and different dresses everytime I enter the stage.\n\n\"Wild Rice pantomimes have a long tradition of men wearing womens' clothes - Ivan Heng, Sebastian Tan, Jonathan Lim ... But I dare say I'm the prettiest of them all.\"\n\nJack & the Bean-Sprout! plays at the Drama Centre from Nov 21 to Dec 14. Tue - Fri: 7.30pm, Sat and Sun: 2.30pm and 7.30pm. Tickets from $45 to $75 from Sistic. Wild Rice is also participating in #GivingTuesdaySG, where members of the public are encouraged to donate so that the less-privileged can watch the pantomime.

Debbie Yong looks at a journalists' bar, a cat cafe and two eateries specialising in ribs and wings that are offering fresh dining experiences with their esoteric concepts\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nScoop\n\n19 Ann Siang Hill\n\nTel 6536 2308\n\nHours: 5pm to midnight (Mon-Sat)\n\nwww.facebook.com/theinsidescoop.sg\n\nOpens Nov 20\n\nTHE notion of journalists as beery misfits who lurk in questionable drinking establishments while awaiting their next juicy scoop is rather the stuff of Hollywood imaginings and Hunter S Thompson novels than reality in Singapore; but that isn't stopping F&B entrepreneurs Patrick Fok and Kevin Cheng from starting up a journalists' bar here.\n\nScoop, which opens on Wednesday, takes over the Ann Siang Hill shophouse formerly occupied by apparel store Fred Perry and takes a leaf from the \"flacks and hacks\" bars - slang for public relations people and news scribes respectively - common in Europe and the United States.\n\n\"PR people are always looking to meet journalists, and journalists are always looking for the inside stories to things, and everyone can swap updates on the latest job vacancies in the industry,\" says Mr Fok, 33. But contrary to its main theme, the bar won't be exclusive to media folk. \"You go to any Foreign Correspondents Club in most cities and it's packed with all sorts. Everyone likes to meet with journalists,\" he laughs.\n\nMr Fok himself holds a day-job as a television news presenter. He and Mr Cheng, 32, also own a cluster of F&B outlets such as Bartini, 1980s-themed eatery The Retrospective, and month-old Mexican bar Hombre Cantina in Boat Quay.\n\nWhile the concept of a journalists' bar isn't entirely new to Singapore - an older generation of newshounds may recall the now-defunct Front Page, Next Page and Newsroom pubs in Mohamed Sultan Road started by BT journalist-turned- nightlife tycoon Peter Wong in the 1990s - both Mr Fok and Mr Cheng are recent Hong Kong transplants who say they are starting on a clean slate.\n\nSo expect, perhaps, a more sanitised, circa 2013 iteration at Scoop. The 1,600 square foot bar will screen news and sports programmes from its two televisions all day and serve up comfort food and popular dishes from its other outlets such as burgers, pizza and a mac-and-cheese dish flavoured with truffle paste. All food items will cost under $20 and beers will start from $10, and media professionals will get one-for-one deals on Wednesdays.\n\nIn keeping with the theme, the two men - both printmaking enthusiasts - plan to plug in screen-printing classes when the bar is closed in the afternoons. Attendees can later display and sell their works at Scoop, which will feature distressed concrete interiors accented with newspaper reliefs. A 10m bar counter will span the length of the space.\n\nA small lounge area by the bar's entrance can double as a quiet spot for broadcast journalists to conduct video interviews - something Mr Fok himself has found lacking in his own job.\n\n\"Sometimes, we'll have interviewees from abroad or who have unpresentable offices and don't want to be filmed in them,\" he observes. He has often ended up using other bars and his own establishments as a venue for his interviews. The bar's lamps can double as studio lights, he says.\n\nFancy yourself a bit of a whistleblower? You now know where to hang out and whisper a little too loudly. \"It would be nice to get a scandal out of Scoop,\" quips Mr Fok.\n\nNeko no Niwa\n\n54A Boat Quay\n\nwww.catcafe.com.sg\n\nOpens end Nov\n\nTHE cat cafe phenomenon that originated in Taiwan and sparked a craze in Japan and the rest of the world will soon be upon our shores for the first time.\n\nWhen it opens on the second floor of a Boat Quay shophouse at the end of this month, Neko no Niwa - which means \"cat garden\" in Japanese - will be home to 10 cats, which cafe patrons can play with as they sip their java and take in views of the Singapore River.\n\nCafe owner Tan Sue Lynn, 36, is a cat lover who has visited cat cafes in Tokyo, Osaka, Naoshima and Sapporo in Japan. Says the former marketing executive of an asset management company: \"It has always puzzled me why there isn't a cat cafe in Singapore even though they have been getting a lot of hype recently.\"\n\nPreviously a North Asian preoccupation, cat cafes have sprouted to instant popularity in European cities such as Vienna, Budapest, Madrid, Berlin and London over the last year. Le Cafe des Chats in Paris, for instance, is an entirely crowd-funded project and was fully booked for two months when it first opened in September.\n\n\"Cat cafes are great for people who enjoy interacting with cats and would like to have one at home but can't for whatever reason, whether it's because someone in the family is allergic to cats, or because their parents feel they are too young to be a responsible pet owner,\" says Ms Tan.\n\nBut unlike some cat cafes overseas, Neko no Niwa won't be about showcasing rare cat pedigrees. Ms Tan is working with local animal welfare organisations and independent cat fosterers to adopt the 10 abandoned or stray felines that will permanently reside in the cafe.\n\n\"Part of our social message is to discourage unethical breeding, and show that even cats that are not pedigrees can make just as lovely companions,\" she says. The cats will most likely range from one to four years in age, but will be chosen for their ability to interact with humans and other cats rather than for their age.\n\nThe cafe will seat about 20 to 25 people in a homely space fitted out with sofas, dining tables and scratching poles for the cats. The cats will be free to roam in the 500 sq ft space and will reside there overnight, while the rest of the cafe's pantry and toilet premises will be cordoned off from the animals.\n\nAccess to the cafe will be charged at $12 per person per hour - following the business model of overseas cat cafes, says Ms Tan - and patrons will have to remove their footwear and wash their hands before entering. Food orders are optional and no cooking will be done on-site: only coffee, canned drinks and covered desserts sourced from independent local pastry shops will be served, with prices kept under $5.\n\nThere will also be a small retail corner selling cat accessories, and Ms Tan is working with local designers to introduce cat toy crochet classes in the future.\n\n\"The concept is so new here that there are already some misconceptions about what a cat cafe is about,\" observes Ms Tan. Unlike existing pet cafes in Singapore, where humans can bring in their pets to dine next to them, you won't be able to bring your own cats to Neko no Niwa, nor will the cafe's cats be up for sale or for adoption.\n\nAlluding to the cafe as an educational platform, she elaborates: \"If you are not sure about cat ownership, you can spend more time at the cafe before deciding to take the plunge into cat ownership. And when you do, we can link you up with organisations such as the Cat Welfare Society for guidance on taking care of your cat.\"\n\nRibbery and Wine Co\n\n#01-04, Sixth Avenue Centre,\n\n805 Bukit Timah Road\n\nTel 6463 2830\n\nSO what if the nose-to-tail dining concept is winning over adventurous eaters and environmentalists worldwide? There are some among us who already know which part of an animal we love best, and don't want to spend five minutes winnowing through a menu to get to it.\n\nEnter the Ribbery and Wine Co, a ribs specialist opened by a ribs lover for ribs lovers. Affectionately referred to as RAWC, the two-storey 80-seater eatery in Bukit Timah offers beef, lamb and pork ribs in 12 exciting variants, from lamb ribs braised in Italian Marsala wine, to beef ribs barbecued with Texan barbecue sauce and pork ribs glazed in Marmite.\n\nUninspired name aside - the restaurant has no links to Bayern Munich midfielder Franck Ribery either - the ribs here are actually very good. The five-spiced lamb ribs ($30) are first rubbed with a house blend of five spices before being roasted, resulting in fall-off-the-bone tender meat with a heady, herbal aroma that renders the accompanying dish of mint sauce quite unnecessary. If you don't want to dirty your fingers, order the beef short ribs braised in Shiraz ($32); the slightest prod of a fork is all it needs to separate the meat.\n\nNot one to discriminate against non-ribs lovers who get towed in reluctantly by rib-obsessed friends and family, there's also a small selection of ribs-free mains such as baked chicken or barramundi and sirloin steaks, along with a fairly large section of starters such as calamari, chicken nuggets and cheese and sausage platters.\n\nFood aside, the eatery also doubles as a bottle shop for the neighbourhood's residents, as Malaysian founder, Wong Yin How, also runs the Vintry group of wine shops in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, as well as eight-year-old rib joint, Ribs, also in the latter city. Prices for the mix of Old and New World wines start at an affordable $28 per bottle and go up to $3,000 for the higher-end labels that can be transferred over on request from the Vintry outlet in Clarke Quay.\n\nLike a truly competitive Singaporean, the group's local executive chef Wayne Chan adds that the aim of his game is to have the largest selection of ribs in Singapore.\n\n\"Tony Roma's has about eight or nine types of ribs, and we have 12, so we have a buffer. If they come up with more, at least, we will still be ahead,\" he jokes.\n\nStill, he acknowledges that it will be hard to carve a niche for themselves with such a specialised concept. \"Tony Roma's is already a household name that everyone knows but we have to slowly build a name for ourselves.\"\n\n\"It can go both ways, if you go too niche then nobody wants to come, but if you offer something too generic that can be found everywhere, then no one will bother either,\" says Mr Chan. Though no further Singapore expansion is in the works, the group is planning a new concept in Malaysia next year.\n\nWings World\n\n214 East Coast Road Tel 6247 7477\n\nHours: 11am-11pm daily\n\nYOU know the old wisdom when it comes to picking hawker stalls? The one that says the stall that specialises in Hokkien mee will serve a far better version than the one that sells Hokkien mee, carrot cake and char kway teow all at once?\n\nThe same reasoning lies behind the founding of Wings World, a casual eatery along restaurant-mobbed East Coast Road that serves only, well, wings.\n\nInspired by the ferocious hunger for chicken wings in the United States - more than 1.23 billion chicken wings are consumed in the US during Super Bowl weekend alone - the casual 40-seater is Taiwan-born, US-raised Jimmy Hsiao's homage to them in Singapore.\n\nCiting the popularity of other chicken-centric American fast-food chains such as 4Fingers and Kentucky Fried Chicken here, he adds: \"Once considered just a snack, chicken wings are gradually being treated as a meal. You're starting to see wings everywhere in Singapore, even in places that they aren't traditionally in, like Japanese restaurants and even Ikea.\"\n\nPriced somewhere between a fast food joint and a proper restaurant, Wings World serves up wings that can be customised according to your preference. You order them in servings of six ($5.75) or 10 ($8.95) - or in party platters of 50 and 100 - and you can opt for either just winglets, drumlets, or a mix of both. Top them off with your choice from over 13 different dry seasonings and sauces, including barbecue sauces spiced with imported American chillies such as chipotle and jalapeno.\n\nTheir signature buffalo sauce comes with four levels of heat, while the mango habanero is a familiar tangy, tropical flavour with just the right amount of chilli kick. Not a fan of smothering your wings in sauce? The citrus pepper and Italian herb dry-rubs keep things fragrant and super-crispy. The wings are cooked by the double-fry method, that is, they are first fried at low temperature and again at a high temperature to cause a \"blistering effect\" that creates shatteringly crisp chicken skin, Mr Hsiao explains. Sides such as vegetable sticks with blue cheese dip and fries, coleslaw and potato salad provide a carbohydrate boost, and should you tire of wings, there's also a range of wraps made with chicken breast meat tinged with the same array of sauces.\n\nWings World - named after Mr Hsiao's favourite American comedy, Wayne's World - is also the the F&B veteran's return to the restaurant industry in Singapore. The 46-year-old previously ran a trio of eateries under the California brand and Bobby Rubino's restaurant at Chijmes, which he sold when he left for the US in 2006. He returned to Singapore four years later as an F&B consultant and was drawn back into the front end of things again this year. He hopes to open a second outlet by the middle of next year, and sees regional expansion on the cards.\n\n\"Too many restaurants are being bogged down by high rent and labour costs, and also high food costs from trying to offer too much variety,\" says Mr Hsiao. \"It's all about streamlining to keep your service and operations consistent. We're not a chef-centric restaurant and we'll only expand our food menu if it doesn't take away from our main product, so all these savings can be eventually passed on to the consumer.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's a global hub now and Dubai did this by buying planes and constantly renewing its fleet,\" said John Sfakianakis, chief investment strategist at Riyadh-based asset management firm Masic.\n\n\"Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also investing billions in aviation to be able to connect to the world. These states have to continue to invest if they want to expand.\"\n\nAfter playing cat and mouse with rival Airbus in the market for big twin-engined jets, industry sources say that Boeing is expected to launch the 777X on Sunday with the record Emirates deal and 25 jets for Abu Dhabi's Etihad.\n\nDepending on final negotiations, Boeing could also announce orders for dozens of 777X jets from Qatar Airways and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific during the Middle East's largest business event, which runs from Nov 17 to 21.\n\nThe 777X launch is expected to include confirmation of a tentative 34-plane order from Germany's Lufthansa.\n\nWhether Boeing can reach around 250 launch orders depends partly on uncertainty over whether it can close a potential deal for around 20 777X with Cathay, but the new plane is heading for a haul of above 200 orders, industry experts said.\n\nLeading Gulf airlines have made Boeing's long-distance 777 warhorse and other big jets a spur for growth as they redraw the world's aviation and logistics map around the Gulf.\n\nThe revamped 777X is the largest twinjet yet designed and will come in two versions, seating 350 to 406 people. It is Boeing's response to the Airbus A350-1000, which will seat 350 in three classes or about 380 people in two classes.\n\nThe US company hopes the airshow will also mark a turning point for the 787 Dreamliner after its temporary grounding this year because of melting batteries. Industry sources expect orders to top 1,000 in Dubai as Etihad buys a further 30, while Airbus is in negotiations to sell competing models of its A350.\n\nThe latest medium-haul aircraft will also be in focus as low-cost airline Flydubai places a US$7.8 billion order for 75 of the revamped Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus negotiates to sell A320neos to airlines that may include Etihad, industry sources said.\n\nQatar Airways, which has complained about the reliability of its 787s, has said it may buy more Airbus A330s.\n\nBut Airbus, which outsold Boeing in the first nine months of the year, will be looking to end a dearth of orders this year for its A380, the world's largest airliner.\n\nDoric Lease Corp aims to firm up an order for 20 of the superjumbos \"soon\", its top executive said last month.\n\nThe European company cooperates closely with the largest A380 customer Emirates, which has consistently said it could buy up to 30 more of the aircraft once it unlocks extra capacity in its network to handle the double-decker jets. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Aussie pop princess Lenka, whose full name is Lenka Kripac and who will be performing here at the end of the month, does the same on her latest album Shadows.\n\nWritten while she was pregnant with her son - who's now 20 months old and could be heard trying to get his mummy's attention in the background while she was on the phone from Sydney earlier this week - it marks a departure from the head-bopping pop songs of her first two albums.\n\n\"I was supposed to take a break and have a baby, not make an album, but I was still writing songs because it's quite a nice thing to be writing songs for your baby,\" chuckles the 35-year-old.\n\nCalling Shadows her \"motherhood album\", she compares the slower-paced songs to lullabies but added that there are also darker moments as the reality of becoming a parent hit home.\n\n\"I let myself go to places I've never been before which my pregnancy brought about,\" explains Lenka, who studied acting under Cate Blanchett when she was a teenager and has starred in various Australian television dramas and movies.\n\n\"Things got heavier; for example, I've never written a song about death but it felt like the right time to do it here as life was starting to get more serious (with motherhood).\"\n\nBesides writing the songs for her son, Shadows became a family affair in more ways than one because it features the artwork of her visual artist husband James Gulliver Hancock.\n\nIt also finds her reuniting with a former bandmate from Decoder Ring, the Australian electronic rock group that she started out with before she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a solo career.\n\nLenka's jaunty pop songs have graced numerous film and television soundtracks as well as commercials.\n\nFor instance, her debut single and biggest hit to date, The Show, from her eponymous 2008 debut album, has been used to sell clothes, insurance and phone services all over the world.\n\nShe said that there's a chance she could return to familiar grounds on her next album now that her son is becoming a bundle of energy at his age.\n\n\"I'm beginning to write poppier songs again because he wants rhythm and also just watching him explore the world and growing up is so inspiring,\" Lenka reveals.\n\nHer upcoming gig in Singapore - her third and biggest to date - will be her final major show for this year. It will be the first time that local fans will be hearing songs from Shadows.\n\n\"It will be quite quiet and stripped-down acoustic but we also have the older songs which are quite upbeat so there will be a strong dynamic flow,\" she says.\n\n\"I enjoy having three albums to pick songs from and there will be a few cute surprises which I won't say,\" she coos. \"I want to have a nice connection with the audience.\"\n\nLenka plays at the Esplanade Theatres on Nov 26 at 8pm.

Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had predicted 664 million euros in profit. EADS cut its cash-flow outlook.\n\n\"We achieved good improvement in revenues and profitability over the first nine months thanks largely to our civil aircraft business\" CEO Tom Enders said. Airbus, which contributes more than two-thirds of revenue and the majority of profit, delivered 504 planes through the end of October.\n\nEADS lifted the year-end delivery goal to 620 planes from \"more than 600\". It generated 1,215 net orders in the first 10 months, surpassing a goal of 1,200, and will probably attract further deals at Dubai Airshow starting on Nov 17.\n\nEADS revised its free cash flow guidance for the end of 2013 to negative 1.5 billion euros from breakeven, saying it is incurring higher development costs and feeling the impact from government budget constraints.\n\nAirbus contributed 409 million euros to earnings, up from 281 million euros a year earlier as its sales rose 15 per cent to 9.85 billion euros. It maintained its outlook for Ebit before one-time items of 3.5 billion euros and earnings per share of about 2.50 euros, prior to a share buyback.\n\nEADS will change its name to Airbus after January to benefit from the prominence of that brand in aerospace, and will combine its defence and space businesses into one unit. That move is designed to help the company present its military and space products in international markets and tackle costs.\n\nCosts associated with the change will be reviewed in the fourth quarter, EADS said. Its three businesses will now be known as Airbus, Airbus Defence & Space, and Airbus Helicopters. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The multi-talented Doucette, meanwhile, whom Thomas affectionately referred to as \"The Reverend\", alternated between the drums and rhythmic guitar and stole the limelight at several points with his spritely contributions, particularly during an extended blues jam.\n\nCounter to any criticism of Matchbox Twenty as an ageing band from a music era past, Cook - in keeping with the social media-obsessed times that we currently live in - ran forward to tweet a picture of the 5,000-strong crowd from his mobile phone as the band stood for its final applause. Thomas then apologised for taking so long to come.\n\nOh, not at all, Matchbox Twenty, it was worth every minute of the wait.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It marked a fourth straight quarter of growth, the best run that the world's third-largest economy has had in three years.\n\nFinance Minister Taro Aso indicated that the government will not rule out foreign exchange market intervention to prevent shifts in the yen rate from derailing economic recovery.\n\nHis remarks in Parliament yesterday pushed the yen down to close to 100 to the US dollar, which many Japanese exporters see as a level that will help maintain export competitiveness and encourage business investment.\n\nExports weakened in Q3 as large capital outflows from South-east Asia dented growth, though economists expect export levels to improve going into next year as overseas economies stabilise.\n\nThe success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's \"Abenomics\" this year has hinged mainly on aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which has had the effect of weakening the yen. But a senior BOJ official said yesterday that it was not the object of monetary policy to influence the exchange rate.\n\nMr Aso indicated that the government is ready to assume this role, if needed. Japan no longer faces criticism from other major economies that its \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies are aimed at intentionally weakening the yen and giving exporters a trading advantage, he said.\n\nHe added that as with any other country, Japan needs to ensure that it retains the currency intervention option as a policy tool and be ready to take action when markets are excessively volatile, Reuters reported.\n\nHis comments pushed the yen down to a two-month low against the US dollar and at the same time buoyed Tokyo stock prices, with the Nikkei 225 stock average rising 309.25 points or 2.1 per cent to 14,876.41.\n\nGrowth is expected to accelerate in Q4 on the back of government stimulus and improved external demand in China and elsewhere.\n\n\"Economic growth is expected to accelerate in the final quarter of this year. Despite the soft headline figure today, there's no need to be pessimistic about the outlook,\" Reuters quoted Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities, as saying.\n\n\"The government's stimulus package is likely to help boost capital expenditure. The ball is in the government's court so I don't think the Bank of Japan will come under pressure for further monetary easing any time soon.\"\n\nJapan's minister in charge of economic revitalisation, Akira Amari, also said that the economy continued to look up because of firm domestic demand.\n\nMr Amari said that exports will recover in the current quarter as the US economy recovers and uncertainty over the Chinese economy subsides.\n\nDomestic consumption is also expected to accelerate further in the final months of this year as consumers buy in advance of a scheduled increase in the national consumption tax from 5 per cent to 8 per cent from April next year. A tighter labour market and signs of rising wages should also bolster consumer spending in coming quarters, economists said.\n\nHowever, capital expenditure growth slowed to 0.2 per cent in Q3, well below a median estimate of 0.8 per cent, suggesting that companies remain reluctant to deliver the increased investment needed for a sustained recovery.\n\nDomestic capital investment remains the biggest uncertainty but a government stimulus package is expected to boost overall levels of spending, and the government's determination to maintain a steady exchange rate for the yen should also encourage domestic business investment, economists say.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of a Reuters survey published yesterday showed that confidence levels among Japanese firms rose for the first time in three months in November, and is expected to improve further over the coming three months.\n\nRevised official data published yesterday also showed that Japan's industrial output rose 1.3 per cent in September from the previous month.

The property group said this yesterday as it posted a 76.7 per cent slide in third-quarter net profit to $7.3 million due to lower revenue from property development.\n\nThe Metropolis' Tower 2 received Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) earlier this week while Tower 1 received the same approval in July this year. To date, more than 90 per cent of the space in the development has been pre-committed.\n\nBeyond producing the expected revaluation gain in Ho Bee's next earnings statement, The Metropolis will generate a recurring rental income stream for the group. The process has started to show in Ho Bee's Q3 financial statement, with rental income from Tower 1, as well as from the group's Rose Court office development in London acquired in June this year, helping to boost the group's turnover from property investment for Q3 and the first nine months of 2013 by 200 per cent and 60 per cent to $7.8 million and $13.3 million respectively.\n\nHowever, revenue from property development for Q3 2013 slumped 84 per cent year-on-year to $8.5 million. For the nine-month period too, development revenue was down 69 per cent at $69.9 million from $228.4 million previously. This was chiefly due to higher revenue recognition last year for the One Pemimpin industrial project, when it was completed.\n\nIn all, Ho Bee's revenue from continuing operations slipped 71.1 per cent to $16.3 million for Q3 this year from $56.3 million a year ago.\n\nFor the first nine months, Ho Bee posted net profit of $85.7 million, reflecting a drop of 28.7 per cent. Revenue from continuing operations decreased 64.9 per cent to $83.1 million.\n\nThird-quarter earnings per share fell to 1.1 cents from 4.5 cents previously.\n\nHo Bee's net asset value per share rose to $2.70 as at end-September 2013 from $2.58 as at end-December 2012.\n\nNet gearing rose marginally to 0.19 at end-September from 0.17 at end-December 2012.\n\nThe counter closed one cent higher yesterday at $2.02.

The Fund conducts such assessments of key financial centres every five years.\n\nIts report on Singapore was released last night.\n\nWhile it found much to praise, it also suggested that Singapore needs to enhance its existing frameworks, further develop its crisis management arrangements, and remain vigilant over credit growth.\n\nThe IMF noted that overall compliance with all supervisory standards - banking, insurance, securities, and financial-market infrastructures, notably for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives - were very high compared with other major financial sectors.\n\nFor example, banks' capital requirements are higher than those established by Basel III, and there is a clear legal framework for capital-market activities.\n\nIt said that crisis management and resolution arrangements are generally strong here - with responsibilities being clearly allocated among several public bodies - with the necessary legal framework in place.\n\nHowever, it added that the resolution framework needs to be reviewed and strengthened, to enhance the operational independence and the efficient resolution of issues by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which oversees the entire financial system.\n\nOne weakness it noted was \"the allocation of certain resolution tools to the minister-in-charge (which) may compromise the operational independence of MAS in resolution matters\".\n\nIt also said that Singapore's arrangements for cooperation in cross-border resolution are broadly in line with international best practice, but that it could enhance these and mitigate legal risks arising from conflicts in laws from different jurisdictions.\n\nThe IMF team also noted that, while Singapore is exposed to a broad array of domestic and global risks - especially in the light of its interconnectedness with other financial centres - its stress tests have found that banks and insurers can manage these risks.\n\n\"This reflects banks' large capital and other cushions, and the decisive macroprudential actions taken by the MAS to address the threat of a bubble in the housing sector.\n\n\"Moreover, the MAS has sought to address potential spillovers from other major financial centres by converting large retail branches operating in the domestic market into domestically incorporated subsidiaries, and by pressing in international fora for greater sharing of supervisory information on global systemically important financial institutions.\n\n\"Looking forward, the analysis suggests the importance of continuing to monitor closely cross-border interbank liabilities, and also of continuing to adjust macroprudential measures in response to domestic housing market conditions,\" it added.\n\nIt noted that bank regulation and supervision is of a high calibre, but that there is room for improvement in some areas.\n\nFor example, even though the stress tests proved that banks' funding gaps appear manageable, the IMF said that liquidity shortages in foreign currency could affect some banks under very adverse conditions, and that the MAS should therefore closely monitor liquidity coverage ratios on an individual foreign currency basis.\n\nThe IMF team also said that \"the structure of the MAS board, which includes several government ministers, was considered by assessors to be potentially inconsistent with full supervisory independence, and consideration should be given to addressing this situation\".\n\nAs for Singapore's capital markets, the IMF team said they do not appear to pose material threats to financial stability. It noted that enforcement is effective, but that shareholder protection - in regard to participation in corporate decision making - could be strengthened to meet standards set by the International Organization of Securities Commissions.\n\nAs for Singapore Exchange's performance, in particular, it noted that \"self-regulation by exchanges remains an integral part of the regulatory framework and is subject to effective supervision\".\n\nThe IMF team also noted that the MAS should continue intensive monitoring of the asset management industry, particularly the operations of hedge funds and prime brokers, in order to minimise reputational risks.\n\nResponding to the assessment, the MAS said in a statement that it will review the recommendations and take appropriate measures.\n\nRavi Menon, its managing director, said: \"The FSAP is a rigorous and comprehensive programme. It provided us the opportunity to be independently benchmarked against international best practices and to evaluate policy actions to address any vulnerabilities in our financial system. The assessment is a testament to the MAS's long tradition of prudent regulation and supervision.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its property segment did not record any revenue for the quarter.\n\nHigher revenue at the engineering and construction segment was helped by contributions from the group's subsidiary UE E&C. This segment also registered substantially higher operating profit before interest because of cost-saving from completed projects. Meanwhile, the property rental and services segment also saw increased rental contributions and higher operating profits.\n\nUE's bottom line was dragged down by losses incurred by WBL's listed technology subsidiary, Multi-Fineline Electronix, as well as lower car sales and lower recognition of property sales by WBL.\n\nUE said that it will continue to work on a number of major property developments in Singapore and China, including orchardgateway mall in Singapore and mixed development Orchard Summer Palace in Shenyang, China.\n\nHowever, the property development segment will continue to have an uneven performance because of lumpy revenue accounting. Property cooling measures in Singapore and China will also impact home buyer sentiment. \"The group . . . will continue to adopt a cautious approach when bidding for new property projects in the next 12 months,\" UE said.\n\nUE said that it remained optimistic about its engineering and construction business because of strong construction demand in Singapore this year.\n\nFor the nine-month period, revenue was up 184 per cent at $1.2 billion and net profit was up 18 per cent at $35.4 million.\n\nTotal assets at end-September stood at $6.3 billion. Total debt was $2.7 billion, down from $3.2 billion a quarter ago.

Next in line is a reinvention of the fund management industry. In this respect, two major parallel initiatives are underway in terms of the development of a cross-border funds passport, which would facilitate the marketing and distribution of funds across the region. One is an agreement to get a collective investment scheme framework off the ground for the Asean region. The second is an intent to jointly develop an Asian funds passport, involving Singapore, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand.\n\nThere is a third and arguably even more pivotal proposal: that Singapore should re-examine its legal framework for investment funds to encourage more asset managers to choose to domicile their funds here. The stakes are potentially enormous, as wealth burgeons in the region and more of the wealthy choose to book their assets in Singapore. The MAS annual fund management survey at end-2012 reflected total assets under management (AUM) here of about $1.6 trillion, an increase of 21 per cent from the previous year. The five-year average growth rate in AUM is about 9 per cent per annum. The catch is that most of these funds are likely to be domiciled in offshore centres such as Cayman Islands or Luxembourg because of the inflexibility of the existing structures open to funds in Singapore. At the moment, investment funds that want to be domiciled here have to be set up as trusts, limited partnerships or private companies, which fail to cater to the needs of various types of investors.\n\nIn a paper last week, however, PwC has proposed a change of rules to allow funds to be set up under corporatised investment vehicles, such as open-ended investment companies, which offer a number of benefits. Funds in such structures can benefit from tax treaties, for instance, and provide flexibility in terms of share subscriptions and redemptions. The proposal has come none too soon. Hong Kong has started the ball rolling with the intent to create a similar framework and establish itself as a \"world factory\" for asset managers. Creating an integrated ecosystem here for funds can generate business for various support services such as legal and accounting services, and fund administration, further enhancing Singapore's status as a financial hub.\n\nSo far, based on a PwC survey earlier this year, asset managers have given the thumbs-up to such an initiative. Given the pace of economic growth in Asia and the emerging markets, investment allocations into these regions will grow. Singapore already proffers a favourable environment for investors with its strong financial institutions, tax efficiency, and a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework. In the next lap, it should aim to capture an even larger share of fund flows in ways that also benefit the local economy. Enhancing the funds infrastructure to encourage more firms to base their operations here is surely a must.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the exit from palatial houses in ritzy areas was also seen as reflecting the changing nature of diplomacy, with extravagant displays of nationalism deemed inappropriate in a tough economy and greater security needed.\n\n\"Embassies took over grand houses at a time when diplomacy was serving drinks and eyeball-to-eyeball contact which was the way of doing business then,\" Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell, told Reuters. \"Things have changed and nowadays these buildings are not really fit for purpose.\"\n\nThe US kick-started the exodus after announcing in 2006 it was moving from Mayfair.\n\nIt sold its current embassy to Qatari state property firm Qatari Diar for what the Wall Street Journal said was about \u00a3500 million (S$999.3 million) and it will move in 2017 to a site in south-west London. The embassy declined comment on the figure.\n\nUS Ambassador to Britain Matthew Barzun told a groundbreaking ceremony at the site at Nine Elms near Battersea Power Station that the move would help develop that area of London.\n\n\"We're proud to provide an anchor for more businesses and jobs, bringing thousands of new neighbours to fuel economic revitalisation here,\" he said.\n\nThe US will be joined in the development by the Netherlands and possibly China, lured by the high security made possible by building from scratch on a new site and quick access to Westminster, the seat of the British government.\n\nMr Wetherell said that the embassy exit came amid a trend to revert grand houses in elite London areas back from offices into apartments with residential prices at record prices of up to \u00a35,000 per square foot.\n\nHe said that foreign governments were increasingly aware that they were sitting on property goldmines and opting to sell and save costs or not to renew leases and move further afield.\n\nMr Wetherell this year sold the Brazilian embassy in Mayfair for \u00a340 million and almost all diplomatic properties are snapped up for apartments for wealthy Britons or overseas buyers.\n\nThe Wetherell/Diplomat survey found other embassies relocating or looking to move included Nepal, Greece, Lithuania, Belgium, Tajikistan, Kosovo, Turkmenistan, Gambia, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and the Czech Republic.\n\nReal estate agent Savills last month won the contract to sell the Canadian High Commission in Mayfair which is expected to fetch up to \u00a3250 million and could double that value as flats.

And it's one that photographer Rodney Smith takes very seriously with regard to his beloved craft. That's why he shoots only with film, mostly in black and white, and wears a look of pride when separating himself from the horrors of Instagram and Photoshop.\n\n\"Although digital is probably a good change for a lot of people, it's not definitive that it's better. All that digital offers don't interest me,\" says the 67-year-old Smith who honed his skills under documentary photographer Walker Evans in the early 1970s.\n\nColour in black and white\n\n\"A teacher of mine once said there's more colour in black and white than there is in colour. Colour is about the surface of things. It's about fashion, style, and has a contemporary look. But it doesn't go to the heart of the matter as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nSo at his first-ever exhibition in Singapore, titled Surreal Reality, Smith will be showcasing only a careful selection of black and white set of about 20 photos from his portfolio that best represent him as a photographer. He is a regular contributor to Vanity Fair, and his images have also appeared in various other publications including The New York Times Magazine, Departures Magazine and on the covers of Time Magazine.\n\nHis prints at the FOST Gallery are on sale from US$7,000 and up.\n\nSmith recalls one of the first times he ever held a camera was when he was 16 years old and his father gave him a camera to take on a student trip to Mexico. Their train's route was obstructed by an avalanche for a few days, so some local kids came up to the train to sell food and other items to the trapped passengers.\n\nWhen he got home after the trip, instead of bringing home photos taken with his friends like most other students did, he brought home a roll of pictures of these local kids.\n\n\"My dad was not very happy about it,\" says Smith, with a grin. \"That was the first time I noticed I was interested in the things most people weren't interested in.\"\n\nAnd while his heart ultimately still resides with black and white, Smith now shoots in colour about 20 per cent of the time - simply because technological advancements have given him more appealing options when it comes to the type of paper he can print his images on.\n\nHe is much more insistent on shooting with film, however, and easily comes up with a list of nuances about film that he refuses to give up in exchange for the conveniences of digital photography.\n\nFor instance, there is a grainy texture that shows up only in film photos which he likes, and the detailed atmosphere and sense of perspective that he feels all digital equipment can never fully capture.\n\nFilm and vinyl records\n\n\"I have nothing against digital, and I'm sure for the next generation film won't exist. But right now, film is like a vinyl record. Recently there's quite a resurgence of people liking vinyl records over digital and it's the same thing now with film. I think this will give film a small new life,\" he explains.\n\nNot that he is particularly upset that the art of film photography is going the way of the dodo, because \"I'm going extinct too, anyway,\" he jokes.\n\nIn the meantime all Smith is focusing on is trying to produce something timeless, by creating work that people can connect with.\n\n\"I think what most people respond to is sentiment - an emotion being expressed that they can relate to. Because all the same sentiments that existed 100 years ago, exist today. Nothing has changed.\n\n\"And that's what I want. I want people to connect emotionally to my photos. I would like somebody to like my photos, not because I'm well known or somebody else says they're good, but because they feel something inside themselves and have a connection,\" adds Smith.\n\nSurreal Reality runs at the FOST Gallery at Gillman Barracks, on 1 Lock Road till Jan 5. Opening hours are from Tue to Sat, 11am to 7pm and Sun, 11am to 6pm. Admission is free.

It supports our plan to secure long-term energy supply at competitive prices to meet the need for clean energy in Asia,\" said group CEO Seah Moon Ming.\n\n\"It is also an important milestone for us as we work to develop an Asian LNG hub,\" he added.\n\nPavilion said that recent major gas discoveries off the shores of Tanzania are set to position the country as a key LNG exporter. Currently owned 60:40 by BG Group and Ophir Energy, the Tanzania Blocks 1, 3 and 4 are estimated to hold about 15 trillion cubic feet of gas in moderate water depths.\n\nThe offshore exploration concessions cover a 28,050 sq km area of the Mafia Deep Offshore Basin and northern portion of the Ruvuma Basin, located in water depths ranging from 100 metres to more than 3,000 metres.\n\nBG Group is the designated operator of the Tanzania concession from which first gas delivery is expected in 2020.\n\nBG is also Singapore's initial LNG aggregator or buyer. Singapore is now starting the process of picking a buyer, even possibly two, for its next batch of long-term LNG supplies, beyond the current volumes imported by BG.\n\nPavilion Energy chairman Mohd Hassan Marican said that \"the natural gas developments in Tanzania hold tremendous potential - not just for Pavilion Energy but for Singapore and Asia\".\n\n\"Pavilion Energy looks forward to the partnership with BG Group and Ophir Energy in realising the LNG project. The LNG from the Tanzanian project will provide another source of supply to the Asian markets,\" he added.\n\nThe investment is subject to regulatory, governmental and other required third party approvals, as well as approval by Ophir's shareholders by way of a general meeting. The transaction is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nPavilion's latest upstream investment follows two LNG supply deals reported by the company last month.\n\nThese comprised a 10-year LNG supply deal for 0.5 million tonnes per annum, estimated to be worth US$500 million annually, and with first LNG deliveries into Singapore and Asia in 2018; and a spot deal with delivery to Asia next February. It has yet to identify the sellers for these.\n\nThe company was set up by Temasek Holdings in April to trade and ship LNG, and also to invest in both LNG upstream assets as well as downstream ones, including regasification terminals.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The then vice-minister of construction Qiu Baoxing complained in 2007 of \"a thousand cities having the same appearance\".\n\nTom Miller, a specialist on China's urbanisation, said: \"If you were parachuted in blind to almost any Chinese city, and you were looking around, you would have the same uniform buildings.\n\n\"When you are building at that kind of enormous speed, you don't worry about aesthetic niceties,\" he added.\n\nBut daring new projects from Chinese developers, often employing star international architects, and state-led efforts to renovate historical districts suggest a gradual shift in attitudes.\n\n\"People are realising that it's not good for everything to look identical, and are realising tourists will pay to see something different,\" Mr Miller said.\n\nMr Liu says that he spent more than 100 million yuan (S$20.5 million), some borrowed from friends, on the buildings, which are free to visitors. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

It's written by Billy Ray and helmed by Paul Greengrass, a director who never met a confined space or close-up he didn't like. He did it with plenty of panache in a couple of Jason Bourne films and he does it here with stomach-churning precision with Richard Phillips, the beleaguered title character who for a few terrifying days in 2009 was at the centre of a ship-jacking storm off the Somali coast.\n\nIt's a story that contains the necessary ingredients for a real-life contemporary thriller - far from the world of super-spies and international intrigue - involving a crew of ordinary workers heading blissfully unaware into danger, a handful of angry, trigger-happy desperadoes and an Everyman who is reluctantly thrust into a heroic situation.\n\nWhen it comes to Everyman movie heroes, they don't come any more convincing than Tom Hanks, an actor who has made a career of representing the ordinary-guy- in-extraordinary-situations with ease and grace and sometimes even humour.\n\nHis knack for projecting decency and Zen-like calm serves him well here, when two very different worlds collide and shatter the workday routine of a ship simply transporting goods to Africa.\n\nThe situation may be mundane to begin with - a captain and crew are tasked with delivering cargo from Oman to Mombasa on the Kenya coast - but things quickly escalate when their route takes them into pirate-infested waters, and into the world inhabited by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), a fisherman hit by hard times and lured by the prospect of big paydays for himself and his warlord bosses.\n\nMuse, smart and memorably gaunt, has precious few resources to launch a pirate attack on a giant target but he's determined to the point of desperation. Meanwhile, Phillips is a capable captain who takes his job seriously. When he perceives a potential threat caused by two approaching skiffs, he does all he can to ward off the danger.\n\nThere's an electrifying moment when the two adversaries first lock eyes through binoculars and Phillips realises he's about to face the greatest challenge of his career.\n\nThe movie has the look and feel of a taut and well-structured thriller, a rollercoaster ride filled with alternating moments of excitement, suspense and despair - even though we already know the outcome.\n\n\"I'm the captain now,\" says Muse to Phillips after boarding the ship and shooting his way onto the bridge. There are displays of bravery on both sides but the balance tips when the four pirates leave the ship aboard an enclosed life raft - with Phillips as hostage.\n\nThe tension heightens and the claustrophobic atmosphere inside the raft is palpable - along with a growing sense that a bad situation is about to get a whole lot worse. Phillips' captors know that their mission has not gone according to plan, but they are sustained by bravado and false hopes - even when the US Navy shows up.\n\nThe subsequent showdown, with military ships and Navy Seals shadowing the tiny raft, plays out as a high stakes game of cat and mouse on the high seas.\n\nWatching this film is a bit of an ordeal, which in this case is a good thing and an indication of just how effective the moviemakers were at re-creating reality. \"It was supposed to be easy,\" groans one of the hijackers as realisation slowly sinks in. Captain Phillips is a powerful, absorbing and unsettling movie, and viewers who value its unrelenting commitment will find it to be in ship-shape condition.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While analysts point to several breakthroughs and a clear reform drive, they remain sceptical because several key areas were deliberately omitted. They say this indicates an internal conflict over important issues which have yet to be definitely resolved.\n\n\"As we expected, there are no detailed measures mentioned in the statement, only general guidelines. However, judging from this shortened version, the plenum probably meets our expectations,\" said Wao Yei, an economist for Societe Generale based in Hong Kong.\n\n\"We should learn more in the days ahead, but based on what has been revealed so far, the decisions taken at the plenum fall some way short,\" said Mark Williams, an economist with Capital Economics, a research firm based in London.\n\nInvestors were unimpressed with the outcome, which some Communist Party leaders ahead of the plenum had claimed would be nothing short of a \"revolution\".\n\nShares in Hong Kong and Shanghai tumbled yesterday. The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 1.91 per cent, while the mainland Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1.83 per cent.\n\nThe main takeaway from the Third Plenum remains the role assigned to market forces, which was changed from \"basic\" to \"decisive\".\n\nA change in vocabulary is always closely watched in China and any shift in language is heavily debated within the party.\n\nAlso important is the creation of an agency to oversee reform that will report directly to the top leadership. This could be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's commitment to reform, which he does not want stalled in China's bureaucratic hallways.\n\nThe communique also addressed fiscal and tax reform, which will probably have a good chance of being launched next year.\n\nThe main surprise was the mention of the reform of land rights for farmers. China's leaders said they would \"better guarantee rural residents' property rights\" and \"ensure that rural residents can equally benefit from China's development\".\n\nLand reform is particularly sensitive as change in current legislation will cut local governments from their main source of revenue - land sales. Analysts expect this is a first step in allowing farming land transactions at market prices and granting farmers the right to access healthcare and education.\n\nWhat was lacking though was specific mention of the break-up of the big state monopolies. Ahead of the plenum, analysts had said the issue was too thorny to be directly addressed. Many still question whether China can truly reform itself without dismantling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and granting more privileges to the private sector.\n\nThe fact that the communique includes an explicit call to \"consolidate and develop the state sector\" underlines that reformers have certainly not carried the day\", said Mr Williams of Capital Economics.\n\n\"Indeed, strong backing for the state sector is hard to square with the desire to give markets a much greater role. The party leadership may believe it can achieve both, but as long as state-owned enterprises retain their privileged position, markets will remain skewed,\" he added.\n\nIn the absence of a clear stance on the role of the state, analysts expect reforms to first materialise in the financial sector with interest rate liberalisation and more experiments in the Shanghai free trade zone, which could then be rapidly expanded to other cities.\n\nOther important reforms missing from the communique included reform of the hukou, or household registration, which would grant the same rights to China's millions of migrant workers as their urban counterparts.\n\n\"SOEs, urbanisation and rural land issues are featured in this document, but with language that does not suggest a major breakthrough any time soon,\" wrote Royal Bank of Scotland analysts Louis Kuijs and Tiffany Qiu.\n\nAnalysts will be closely watching how reforms are implemented and whether the new leadership team has the strength and support to bypass interest groups and impose their vision.\n\n\"The fate of (President) Xi's reform is likely to be determined by a detailed policy design and policy execution. The ball is back in the court of bureaucrats, and interest groups will likely try to influence the process,\" said Dong Tao, an analyst at Credit Suisse.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Whether it tapers in December or sometime next year will eventually be (only) a footnote in history.\n\n\"At some point, it's going to have to taper - and it's important for all of us to start preparing for this eventuality.\"\n\nWhat this means is that all countries must, among other priorities, put in place domestic reforms, raise productivity, and liberalise and remove roadblocks to infrastructure investments.\n\n\"The eventual tapering on the Fed's part will, I think, (be) a net positive for emerging Asia - a net positive as long as we respond to this likely outcome, start preparing for it now, have a little more urgency in domestic reforms,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe revealed that Mr Lew had assured that the US was serious about getting a clear resolution of its current budget and debt impasses.\n\n\"Resolving this problem is important not just to the United States, but for the global economy and sustaining the global recovery,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe two leaders also discussed the latest state of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which are now in the final stages after three years of talks and are expected to be concluded soon.\n\nThe US-led TPP talks involve 12 Pacific Rim countries, including Singapore. The TPP is billed as the world's largest free-trade agreement and accounts for about a third of world trade and nearly 40 per cent of the global economy.\n\n\"We are both committed to achieving a high-standard TPP agreement that will ultimately boost trade, boost investment and boost job creation in all our countries. Our negotiators are working intensively to resolve the outstanding issues,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe aim is still to strike a deal by year-end, and Mr Tharman said that every country involved \"should try our best\" to reach a consensus.\n\nThe negotiators from the 12 countries are set to meet in Salt Lake City in the US next week before Singapore hosts the next TPP Ministerial Meeting in December.\n\nSeparately, Mr Lew also met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana, where they exchanged views on international and regional developments, including the global economic and financial outlook.\n\nMr Lew's two-day trip to Singapore, which ended yesterday, was the second leg of his five-nation swing through Asia that began earlier this week in Japan and will wrap up in China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

GLP will seed the fund with land to support 1.8 million sq m of leasable area. In addition, a US$1 billion credit facility has been secured from China Merchants Bank to fund development activity in China.\n\nAs the asset manager, GLP will retain a 56 per cent stake in the fund.

Rent grew 6.9 per cent on renewals while average rental rates increased 5.0 per cent year-on-year.\n\nIn Japan, rents increased 3.0 per cent on renewals while average rents remained stable at 1,081 yen (S$13.50) per square metre per month.\n\nThe lease ratio in Brazil stands at 95 per cent.

He allegedly transferred US$10 million out on March 5 last year.\n\nThe Business Times understands that the judgment will ensure that there are funds available to satisfy any liabilities, should the Commercial Affairs Department's probe end in a fine or a penalty assessed for breaches of the Securities & Futures Act.\n\nJustice Ang also found that portions of evidence given by Mr Huang's daughter, Huang Yiling, and Lau Kam Sze - the alleged beneficial owners of Build Up and the Trony Solar shares - to be \"inherently improbable, strained and unconvincing\".\n\nShe wrote that the pair, named as Mr Huang's business partners, were \"particularly unsatisfactory witnesses\": \"Their ambivalent attitudes towards the opening of the bank account went towards showing that they were nominee directors and shareholders, and were acting on Mr Huang's instructions.\n\n\"Mr Lau's inconsistent evidence is the product of a story that was being made up at each turn. This accounted for his inability to properly justify his decision to set up Build Up with Ms Huang and to jointly invest in Trony Solar. Upon further cross-examination by Mr Bull, Mr Lau blamed the inconsistency on the incompetence of the translators of his affidavits.\"\n\nIn finding Mr Huang to be the true owner of the assets, Justice Ang accepted evidence by MAS' key witness Lillian Liao, a Credit Suisse relationship manager who had handled the account, as \"consistent with the documents\", and that she took instructions almost exclusively from Mr Huang or his Hong Kong assistant, Sunny Hui, on how the account was to be run.\n\nMs Liao gave evidence that Mr Huang had asked the bank to retain executed copies of the account-opening documents because he did not want to carry these physical documents into China; Justice Ang said such instructions were consistent with the sophisticated use of the BVI company.\n\nThe judge also noted that Mr Huang's instructions had not surprised Ms Liao, who had come across such behaviour from high net worth private-banking clients seeking to preserve the secrecy of their private account information.\n\nJustice Ang disagreed with Build Up's contention that Ms Liao had forged Mr Lau and Ms Huang's signatures on the bank's declaration of beneficial ownership, finding it a \"conjecture\" and \"unsupported by the evidence\".\n\nShe added that the failure of both Mr Huang and Mr Hui to turn up as witnesses at the trial (without offering valid reasons) to be cross-examined on the issue of beneficial ownership was \"a factor which the court is entitled to give some weight\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I don't think we can completely forgo the possibility of things turning worse next year.\"\n\nHanjin, South Korea's largest shipping company, and Hyundai Merchant are expected to post losses next year as well, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSTX, the largest commodity-mover and under court receivership since June, may post its first profit in four years in 2014.\n\nShares of Hanjin Shipping fell 1.3 per cent to close at 6,990 won in Seoul. STX Pan Ocean fell 3.9 per cent to 1,115 won. Hyundai Merchant advanced 2.3 per cent after it teamed up with Posco and Korea Railroad Corp to develop a rail project linking Khasan on the Russian border and North Korean port of Rajin.\n\nHanjin Shipping's chief executive Kim Young Min resigned on Monday to take responsibility for the company's losses and a delay in receiving financing from creditors. The company has 1.1 trillion won of bonds due in the next two years, compared with cash and near-cash items of 507 billion won at the end of June.\n\nHanjin has been selling assets and has sufficient cash for payments, said spokesman Kim Young Tae. The carrier will continue to look at financing options, including a perpetual bond sale, he said.\n\nHyundai Merchant has one trillion won to pay in the same two years, compared with 706 billion won in cash. STX owes 900 billion won with a cash pile of 248 billion won in that period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. STX is in talks with its main creditors on maturing debt, according to its response to Bloomberg News.\n\nHyundai Merchant has secured funds to meet payments until the first half of next year, said Lee Jun Ki, a spokesman. Hyundai will look at \"various options\", if the shipping industry doesn't improve, he said.\n\n\"The amount coming due may not seem big, but it's a problem if you have a similar size of loan maturing for three straight years and you are not making enough money,\" said HI Investment's Mr Kim.\n\nThe government holds one of the keys to easing the debt crisis for companies through its Korea Development Bank (KDB).\n\nTo help troubled shippers and other companies pay down the bonds, the government in July put forward a temporary plan in which KDB will help raise 80 per cent of funds needed for repayment. The companies need to bring the rest. That enabled Hyundai Merchant to refinance 280 billion won of maturing bonds last month.\n\n\"We prepared corporate bond market stabilisation steps in July pre-emptively,\" Shin Je Yoon, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, said on Oct 24. \"I don't have immediate concerns about the debt market, but we can review easing the July measure to provide help to a broader range of companies if needed.\"\n\nKDB declined to comment.\n\nThe state-owned bank has played a key role in helping distressed companies restructure in the past. It's taking the lead role in rescheduling debt for STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co and one of its funds became the biggest shareholder of Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co by swapping debt for equity.\n\n\"KDB is very important,\" HI Investment's Mr Kim said. \"If not for them, the circumstances in the shipping industry could be far worse than what they are now.\"\n\nHanjin, which has reported a loss in each of the past 10 quarters, got a loan from affiliate Korean Air Lines Co last month while Hyundai Merchant sold shares this month.\n\nHanjin is considering selling stakes in port terminals, it said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.\n\nA glut of vessels has contributed to the slump in the Baltic Dry Index. The most popular global measure of commodity-shipping rates plunged 90 per cent from its peak to a record low of 647 in February last year. The gauge has since more than doubled.\n\nSpot rates to haul container cargo from Asia to Europe, the world's busiest trading lane, have dropped 12 per cent from this year's high, according to the Shanghai Shipping Exchange.\n\nThe global downturn has claimed two victims in Japan. Last year, Sanko Steamship Co, a Japanese operator of 185 ships, went into bankruptcy protection after failing to reach agreement with creditors on an out-of-court turnaround.\n\nDaiichi Chuo Kisen Kaisha, based in Tokyo, received a bailout from its lead shareholder Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd earlier this year. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Still, shipbuilding and ship repair & conversion continued to be the main profit contributors, with combined gross profit of $14.2 million or 60 per cent of group gross profit of $24 million.\n\nShipbuilding margins, however, weakened to 8.6 per cent (21.4 per cent in 1QFY13 and 10.8 per cent in 4QFY13) on lower margin jobs recognised due to depressed pricing and rising labour costs. However, higher shipbuilding revenue on progressive recognition of more units of offshore support vessels and a dredger narrowed shipbuilding profit decline to 4 per cent, while repair and conversion margins remained firm at 27.4 per cent.\n\nASL Marine's management highlighted that the group's shipbuilding orderbook from external customers stood at $268 million as at Sept 30, with 23 vessels including offshore supply vessels, AHTS, dredgers and tugs and barges.\n\nGross profits at the group's ship chartering business slipped 4 per cent year on year to $7 million, as the group no longer consolidates earnings from PT CNI. Gains from vessel disposals of $1.4 million helped lift earnings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The problem is that properties are measured in hugely different ways around the world,\" said Mr Newey.\n\nUsing residential property valuation as an example, floor space in Spain would include outdoor swimming pools, while in parts of the Middle East it would include the hypothetical maximum number of floors that can be built on existing foundations, said Mr Newey.\n\nIn India on the other hand, there is no standard measurement basis, and residential and commercial property are sold or leased on the basis of \"super area\", said Sachin Sandhir, managing director for Rics South Asia.\n\nGiven that the super area includes common areas and amenities including lift lobbies, terraces and common spaces, there can be a difference of anything between 25 per cent and 50 per cent between the super area and the actual usable area, he said.\n\nThe same problem occurs when measuring commercial property space across countries.\n\nUsing Rics net internal area - the standard used in the United Kingdom - as a base, \"leased area\", depending on where in the world you are looking at it, can vary by up to 24.1 per cent according to Jones Lang LaSalle's global leased space comparison tool.\n\nThis is largely due to the various elements, including columns, floor lift lobby, lifts and other common areas, which can potentially be included in the standard leasing practice of different countries.\n\nLooking at it from a valuation standpoint, this undermines the issue of transparency and introduces a risk element to the valuation, said Mr Newey.\n\n\"This means you have a risk element to whether the financial reporting of companies' assets particularly were correct,\" he added.\n\nIt is for this reason that the IPMSC was created in May this year - to address the creation of international property measurement standards (IPMS).\n\nTo date, more than 20 professional bodies from around the world have joined the coalition and have undertaken to adopt the standards. In addition, Dubai was the first government to officially support the IPMS in September this year.\n\nMr Newey said that he had a \"positive meeting\" with the Urban Redevelopment Authority, to raise awareness.\n\nFollowing the roll-out of office standards, the coalition will look into other commercial assets including retail, warehousing and industrial. This will culminate in the creation of valuation standards for residential property in 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The person the farm is near matters more than the type of farm,\" said Bruce Huber, an Illinois real estate broker who handled a sale in central Illinois last week.\n\nIf the sale of the 217 hectare grain farm in Carlinville, Illinois, for US$14.5 million is any indication, farmland values in the most productive areas of the grain belt will stay steady during harvest, the traditional season for farmland auctions.\n\nThe farm in question, which included grain storage facilities for more than four million bushels, was sold in seven tracts with the top parcel of 200 acres - about 81 hectares - bringing in US$13,600 an acre.\n\n\"We decided US$13,000 was our top dollar. We exceeded our expectations. But I'm glad we did it,\" said David Fullington, a local CPA who organised a partnership of farmers to make the successful bid for that parcel, which will be farmed by one of the buyers' sons in the coming year.\n\nThe sale price was as strong as a year ago when corn was at US$8 a bushel versus the US$4 being paid today. Corn prices have been the catalyst for sky-high US farmland values in recent years.\n\nWhy the strength? The usual reason: the neighbours wanted the farm.\n\n\"We wouldn't have bought this if we didn't own other land,\" said Mr Fullington, who said that top grade land four years ago had been selling for US$4,000 an acre. \"It would have been a poor investment for somebody to go out and buy land for the first time.\"\n\nMr Huber said that he had seen a common theme at this autumn's grain land auctions in Illinois, typically the nation's No 2 corn and soya bean grower behind Iowa.\n\nIf the farm is in the right spot, and the land is good quality, farmers are paying top prices and quickly - the 200-acre parcel, a US$2.72 million sale, was done in 15 minutes, Mr Huber said.\n\nBut if those factors are not present, sales go slow and often disappoint sellers.\n\nThere is a wide audience for farm land prices this season. Federal Reserve policymakers, farm bankers who use land as loan collateral, seed and fertiliser dealers and equipment makers are closely watching land sales as an indicator of future farmer spending at a time grains prices - if not revenues, given higher yields - have fallen back.\n\nJason Henderson, a Purdue University agricultural economist, said that the Illinois auction was in line with what many have expected.\n\nPrime grain land in Illinois, Iowa and other Midwest states rose 20 to 30 per cent last year alone. Soaring demand for corn from ethanol makers, strong demand from China and other importers, and rock-bottom US interest rates have all combined to feed the farm land boom.\n\nBut skyrocketing land values have stirred nightmare memories of the ruinous land bubble of the 1980s, when over-leveraged farmers lost their farms as interest rates jumped. Farmers who lived through those times remember them well.\n\nFor some, the sale was a sober reminder of the bad old days and bitter lessons repeated. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The location is yet to be determined.\n\nAccording to Lori Arpin, GM vice-president for communications, about 40 GM employees from the region will move here to join the existing staff at GM Overseas Distribution LLC.\n\nGM Overseas looks after the Singapore and Brunei markets for the Chevrolet and Opel brands, as well as the distribution of car parts under the AC Delco brand to Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nThe unit, which was set up here in 1972 as a regional distribution hub but has since played a smaller role, is headed by a financial controller.\n\nMs Arpin said: \"We looked at a number of countries and Singapore was the best location in terms of an operational standpoint.\"\n\nThe new HQ will include representatives from GM's regional sales and marketing, product planning, finance, government relations, human resources, IT, legal and communications functions.\n\nIt will oversee key parts of GM's business in Africa, Asean, Australia and New Zealand, India, South Korea and the Middle East, as well as Chevrolet and Cadillac Europe.\n\nWhile GM makes Singapore its new centre of operations, it will retain the China and Korea offices.\n\n\"It makes good business sense to maintain this backbone operation to support these markets,\" said Ms Arpin. \"China is the world's largest vehicle market. Our feeling is that it demands our singular attention and focus to remain a leader.\"\n\nGM is the dominant player in China. But it is facing stiff competition from Germany's Volkswagen, while its compatriot Ford - although still some way behind in the sales stakes - has been making strong progress on the mainland.\n\nObservers say that the relocation to Singapore would split the carmaker's HQ functions and allow it to better focus on both its cash cow as well as the rest of the region.\n\nThey added that while there may also be tax and other considerations, GM's move will let it concentrate on growing the business outside China, especially in fast-rising and consumer-driven markets of South and South-east Asia where incomes and the appetite for cars continue to grow.\n\nGlobally, the US giant was also the biggest carmaker from 1931 up until 2008 when it was overtaken by Toyota. GM reclaimed the title in 2011 for one year when the Japanese giant stumbled over the tsunami in north-eastern Japan and worldwide recalls, before slipping again to No 2 behind Toyota.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

High operating costs and infrastructure limitations are other issues the industry is grappling with.\n\nIndia's emerging middle class, sizeable young population as well as its current low level of trips per capita are driving factors for the airline to participate in the growth market, aside from enabling SIA to diversify its traffic base. Other airlines are also trying to gain a foothold in the market, including AirAsia, which is setting up a budget carrier, also with Tata.\n\nSIA and Tata are aiming for their airline to be operational by mid-2014, although decisions have yet to be made with regard to aircraft type, fleet size, and whether planes will be purchased or leased.\n\nNoting that SIA-Tata has received very good response from both the Indian authorities and the public, Mr Goh said it had no reason to believe the airline wouldn't take off.\n\nOn Oct 24, India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board gave its verbal approval for the joint venture, but the two partners are still waiting for the written approval. Once that is received, SIA-Tata will need to get a no-objection certificate and then an air operator's certificate.\n\nCommenting on potential future synergies between the joint venture and SIA, Mr Goh said: \"We have an extensive network to South-east Asia and when (this venture) wants to reach South-east Asia eventually, it will be able to tap the network much more effectively than if it were to mount its own flights directly to small points in South-east Asia.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the group announced its results for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2013, with net profit rising 78 per cent year-on-year to $160.6 million, boosted by share of profits from associated companies, gains from the sale of aircraft as well as higher operating profit, while revenue increased 2.8 per cent to $3.9 billion.\n\nHowever, yields have been declining - down 3.5 per cent in Q2 FY2013/14 - hit by the effect of the strong Singapore dollar on revenue-generating currencies as well as intensifying competition from other carriers, such as the cash-rich Gulf airlines.\n\n\"With the demand outlook for both the passenger and cargo business still shaky, SIA's best hope for a vastly improved financial performance is for fuel prices to fall significantly,\" reckons DBS Group Research analyst Paul Yong, although he expects the group to post a slight improvement over last year's performance given its interim numbers.\n\nSIA yesterday said it has hedged 60 per cent of its fuel needs for the period October 2013 to March 2014 at US$118 per barrel.\n\nThe counter closed at $10.28 yesterday, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With some US$3.9 billion in its existing orderbook, the group said its China-based shipyards will be operating at close to full capacity up to 2016.\n\nThe containership options in particular bear watching, according to analysts, as these are for Seaspan's outstanding nine 10,000 TEU (twenty foot equivalent units) vessels.\n\nSeaspan has already ordered 16 vessels from Yangzijiang, making the shipyard the first in China to build these mega vessels. The first two 10,000 TEU container vessels were launched at their yard at end September 2013.\n\nThe New York listed Seaspan had declared five options in October with Yangzijiang, with deliveries from 2015, and had said it would sign long-term charters for the newly confirmed newbuilds with a major container line soon.\n\nYangzijiang's management also highlighted that the group plans to move away from building smaller vessels to focus on higher value-added vessels such as Capesize, 10,000 dwt Panamax vessels as well as LPG carriers.\n\nThe China-based, Singapore-listed shipbuilding group posted a 6 per cent decline in Q3 net profit attributable to equity-holders, to 820.7 million yuan (S$168.1 million), despite a 2 per cent rise in revenue to 3.6 billion yuan. EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) was up 2 per cent to 1.24 billion yuan.\n\nAccording to analysts, the better-than-expected earnings were helped by sustained shipbuilding margins. In Q3, shipbuilding margins stood at 22 per cent, slightly below 23 per cent in Q3 the previous year, despite the group recognising revenue from relatively lower value and lower priced contracts during the period.\n\nGroup pre-tax profit was actually up 6 per cent year-on-year to 1.17 billion yuan but management highlighted that Q3 earnings at the net level were impacted by a higher tax rate of 29 per cent versus 22 per cent previously.\n\nFor the nine months of 2013, group net profit is down 15 per cent year on year to 2.34 billion yuan, with revenue down 2 per cent to 10.96 billion yuan.\n\nThe group's held to maturity assets increased to 12.5 billion yuan as at September 2013 (up 10 per cent from Dec 31, 2012), with cash holdings at 10.3 billion yuan and net gearing at 5.8 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The project has drawn owner-occupiers as well as potential investors, given the appeal of the location.\n\n\"Residents will enjoy the prestige of living a short distance from the Chatsworth Park Good Class Bungalow Area and yet enjoy the convenience of amenities in the Redhill area ranging from a wet market and food centre to restaurants and cafes.\"\n\nThe $1,650 psf average pricing for Alex Residences is a tad lower than the $1,700 psf early-bird average pricing for City Developments' launch of the next-door condo Echelon last December. However, the overall project-average achieved for Echelon was $1,795 psf.\n\nAlso, Singapore Land has not minted large units, with the project comprising entirely one, two and three-bedroom units - unlike Echelon which also has four-bedders and penthouses. Three-bedders in Echelon are also generally larger than those in Alex Residences.\n\nThis has allowed about 95 per cent of the 429 units in Alex Residences to be priced below $2 million.\n\n\"Yes, the TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) framework has restricted access to funding for some potential buyers. But for those who can get financing, they find a strong value proposition in our product, which is near the city,\" reasoned Mr Ng.\n\nIn early September, Keppel Land released The Glades next to Tanah Merah MRT Station at an average price of around $1,500 psf. In late June, on the same evening that the TDSR framework was rolled out, MCL Land sold its J Gateway condo near Jurong East MRT Station like hotcakes at $1,480 psf on average.\n\nMr Ng said that buyers of Alex Residences yesterday were predominantly Singaporeans and permanent residents although some foreigners, mostly mainland Chinese, were also spotted buying units.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Interestingly though, the same survey in the 2013 Global Competitiveness Report also had Singapore executives citing \"restrictive labour regulations\" as by far \"the most problematic factor for doing business\", well above \"inflation\" or \"insufficient capacity to innovate\". One should assume that the statutory requirement to pay Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions - and, indeed, wages - for every employee isn't among the onerous labour regulations that employers take issue with.\n\nBut Singapore has this week passed two pieces of legislation to mete out stiffer penalties to employers who fail to pay CPF contributions - and salaries. In May, the CPF Board said that it recovered $293 million in CPF arrears owed to more than 200,000 workers in 2012. Most of the cases involved late payment, but still, 11,000 workers were either shortchanged or failed to receive their CPF dues from some 4,000 companies, to the tune of $9.4 million. Shocking as the $293 million arrears is, the figure covers only the sums that were recovered; a good number of errant employers may well have slipped through the cracks, especially in the past before the CPF Board stepped up its enforcement audits and on-site inspections to deter recalcitrant employers late last year.\n\nWorkers need their CPF and not only for retirement-- the CPF has long evolved from being merely a retirement savings scheme to meeting Singaporeans' home ownership and healthcare financing needs. CPF defaulters, especially repeat offenders, must be taken to task - just like employers who fail to pay salaries. With the amendments to the CPF Act passed in Parliament on Tuesday, first-time offenders can be jailed up to six months or fined up to $5,000 (double the previous maximum fine) or both. Similarly, the Employment Act has been amended to hand out a mandatory minimum fine and much higher maximum fines (up to $30,000 for repeat offenders) for those that withhold salaries.\n\nA case was made in Parliament for employers that default on CPF by \"negligence or honest mistakes\". That concern is misplaced. Try arguing that the firm somehow \"forgot\" to pay CPF contributions that month or is in fact unaware of its obligations; perhaps this should then call, all the more, for the mandatory issuing of payslips, which the government has for now deferred.\n\nThe most probable scenario is that cashflow issues lie behind many of the default cases - which speaks to the separate issues of business health and viability, and rising costs. But things are unlikely to get easier. With companies now looking to hire more Singaporeans than foreigners, and with rising wages in the lower to middle rungs, employers can expect to pay even more CPF contributions.The need for vigilance against those who don't meet their obligations can thus only increase.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue rose 15 per cent to $413.5 million from $360 million.\n\n\"I am happy that we are continuing our turnaround momentum,\" said chairman and managing director Chia Kim Piow, of Rotary's Q3 performance.\n\nIt marks the company's emergence this year from problems encountered at the tail-end of its mega US$745 million tankfarm project for the Saudi Aramco Total Refining and Petrochemical Company (Satorp).\n\nThe group said yesterday that \"the Satorp project has been substantially completed and Rotary has handed over the 62 atmospheric storage tanks and eight bullet tanks\".\n\nIt is currently engaged in two major projects here - a $300 million expansion of a oil terminal on Pulau Busing and another EPC contract, reportedly for around $300 million, for the new Singapore Lube Park in Tuas by Shell, Total and Sinopec. Rotary is also involved in a US$250 million EPC deal for the Fujairah Oil Terminal. All these projects are scheduled for completion in the next two years.\n\nMr Chia said that apart from executing the projects safely and well, Rotary's \"other focus is to stay competitive in times of rising cost\" including labour and other operating costs. For instance, it will make greater use of its Batam fabrication workshop so as to reduce its manpower requirements in Singapore, and has also invested in supply chain logistics to transport the materials here.\n\nRotary said that it remained \"cautiously optimistic\" about its prospects amid the global economic uncertainties, underpinned by its strong order book that stands at $847 million currently, with 60 per cent of this attributed to Singapore projects.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue was down 9 per cent at $587.8 million, due to lower car sales in Singapore and Malaysia as well as lower recognition of China property sales. No dividend was declared.\n\n\"The recent announcement of the refinement of the categorisation to the COE system, the introduction of the tiered system of Additional Registration Fee and the revisions to the quantum and tenure of car loans may have a dampening effect on the Singapore market as consumers adjust to these new changes,\" WBL said yesterday.\n\nWBL had reported increased car sales in its third quarter, though margins were already affected. In the fourth quarter, sales dropped 11.6 per cent to $230.2 million, while net attributable profit dived 84.9 per cent to $1.8 million. Lower car sales in Singapore and lower margins were exacerbated by foreign exchange losses and a reversal of tax overprovision for prior years, the company said.\n\nWBL's other main segment, technology, reported a 2 per cent dip in revenue to $281 million. Its net attributable losses widened to $11.7 million, from $0.9 million a year ago. This was partly due to an inventory write-down for its Nasdaq-listed subsidiary Multi-Fineline Electronix, mitigated by stronger results from its flexible printed circuits unit MFS Technology.\n\nMeanwhile, WBL's property segment reported an 85.6 per cent drop in quarterly revenue to $6 million and an 82.7 per cent drop in net attributable profit to $0.9 million. This was due to lower recognition of sales for its Chengdu Orchard Villa development project and an absence of gains from the disposal of a China property investment holding company last year.\n\nIts engineering, manufacturing and distribution division reported a 27.2 per cent quarterly revenue rise to $61.8 million and a 22.5 per cent net attributable profit increase to $4.9 million. This was due to higher contributions from system integrator O'Connor's and from its liquefied petroleum gas unit.\n\nOn the whole, operational loss was $6.6 million, but exceptional gains of $15.2 million, mostly from the divestment of Californian tech company Amlogic Inc, led to the positive $8.6 million profit for the quarter.\n\nFor the full-year, revenues were down 2.6 per cent to $2.4 billion. WBL recorded a full-year loss of $11.2 million, compared to a $75.3 million profit a year ago.\n\nWBL shares are currently suspended pending delisting following its takeover by UE earlier this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economy class passengers can carry two bags of up to 23kg each.\n\nThe airline said that the adjustment was a result of feedback from customers and aimed at maintaining the strength of its overall value proposition.\n\nNews of the revised allowance limit, which kicks in before the year-end holidays, was well received by customers, judging from comments on the airline's Facebook page.\n\nSpeaking to BT at the sidelines of yesterday's briefing, executive vicepresident (commercial) Mak Swee Wah said the higher baggage allowances were unlikely to have a significant impact on fuel costs.\n\nThe move to increase baggage allowance is perceived as an effort to distinguish itself from rival carriers, amid stiffening competition. In February, Malaysia Airlines introduced an additional 10kg of checked-in baggage allowance for all classes and cut excess baggage fees as well.\n\nSIA has unveiled other changes this year, including the enhancement of its KrisFlyer programme, new designs for its SilverKris Lounges in Singapore and overseas as well as an overhaul of its cabin products for selected aircraft.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It recognises the complexity but it is not going to be without risks. It would be naive to think that this is going to be a risk-less process.\"\n\nChina is still coping with the excesses of the previous stimulus package that was introduced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. The Chinese leaders will also have to deal with the interdependence between the reforms that they want to undertake.\n\n\"It's not possible to have financial sector reform without state-owned enterprise reforms,\" Mr Tharman said. \"It's not possible to have successful urbanisation without reform to the household registration system progressively.\n\n\"Each reform carries risks - economic, social, sometimes political - and the interdependence of reforms does not neutralise those risks. It sometimes compounds them.\"\n\nStill, Mr Tharman said that countries naturally want to be a part of China's transformation because the country is the \"major source of economic growth\" in the world today.\n\nMr Lin, who is now a professor at Peking University, later told the audience that he predicted that China would grow by an average of 8 per cent a year for the next 20 years. As for 2014, he forecasts that GDP growth would reach 7.5-8 per cent at the very least.\n\nMr Tharman noted that China would have to overcome several challenges in coming years. For one, it could no longer rely on its labour market as an engine of growth for the economy, given that the number of young people entering the workforce is already starting to decline.\n\nWhere China can do well, however, is in improving its productivity levels. With a much more diverse and larger economy compared to Japan and South Korea, Mr Tharman said, China's many provinces such as Sichuan had yet to realise its potential in raising productivity.\n\nThere is also much scope for China in terms of urbanisation as more people move to the cities, while the growing connectivity between regions will also help boost demand through greater investment, he said.\n\nSMU organised yesterday's forum as part of its efforts to strengthen and deepen its own engagement with China. The university hopes to hold the event on a regular basis, alternating between Singapore and China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For its fourth edition next January, it has reduced the number of galleries - from 130 this year to just 100 next year. But in their place, there will be eight country or region-based platforms created by top curators around the region.\n\nThe eight platforms are India, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Central Asia and South-east Asia. Possibly controversial is the decision to subsume Singapore - which for the past three Art Stage editions had its own platform - into the South-east Asia platform, comprising also Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand.\n\nArguably, the creation of platforms - especially the Central Asia and Australia ones - will offer a window into these regions' art, which hitherto were either missing or lost in the cornucopia of art on display.\n\nBut it remains to be seen how well the local art community will take to the absence of an exclusive Singapore platform, which were previously supported by the National Arts Council.\n\nA significant 20 per cent, or 2,000 square metres, of the fair's space will now be devoted to these platforms. And their curators include the Who's Who of the art world, such as Mori Museum chief curator Mami Kataoka for the Japan platform, esteemed Chinese curator Huang Du for the China platform, and India's first biennale's artistic director, Bose Krishnamachari, for the India platform.\n\nThe South-east Asia platform, the largest of the eight platforms, will be curated by a team of \"country advisers\" including the legendary art historian Jim Supangkat for the Indonesia segment and top academic Patrick Flores for the Philippines segment.\n\nOddly, for the Singapore segment, Art Stage organisers have decided to curate the works with the help of a few unnamed informal advisers instead of one curator.\n\nBut the final choice of the local artists to be showcased in the Singapore segment - namely Chun Kaifeng, Jane Lee, Sarah Choo and Jolene Lai - is not likely to broker argument. Chun and Lee are well-regarded for their practices, while Choo and Lai are among the most promising young artists on the local landscape.\n\nAt a press conference, fair director Lorenzo Rudolf says: \"An art fair must take the responsibility to inform its collectors, to put art in context, to give a deeper perspective into certain artists, to create a better understanding of each other's art, to inspire curiosity.\n\n\"People usually buy what they know. The Indonesians buy Indonesian art, for example. They're not looking left and right.\"\n\nArt Stage hopes to expand its collectors' horizons through the curated platforms.\n\nMr Rudolf also cites an observation that has been made by many art specialists, that is, the art world has become increasingly divided between commercial art that's fit to be sold in galleries, and non-commercial art that often finds favour in biennales because of its challenging nature.\n\nThe commercial versus non-commercial binary also exists in other art forms such as cinema and literature. But the staggering success of visual arts in the last decade - with high auction prices making headlines - has made the divide more pronounced.\n\nMr Rudolf says: \"Instead of commercial versus non-commercial, we want to focus on what's good art.\"\n\nThe new creation of country platforms and the appointment of curators also avoids the problems that Art Stage faced in its last edition over its controversial Indonesian Pavilion.\n\nBack then, Art Stage had chosen to devote a 1,000 sq m space focusing solely on Indonesian artists. Because many of the Indonesian artists have no gallery representation, Art Stage broke with normal art fair conventions by acting as the artists' agent and claiming a commission for their sales - thereby putting it in direct competition with the galleries that it rents booth spaces to.\n\nAsked how the Indonesian Pavilion did in terms of sales, Mr Rudolf demurs: \"We hardly covered costs . . . we didn't make any profit . . .\"\n\nHopefully, the new platforms will bring about a different outcome. If anything, the presence of strong curators for the platforms almost guarantees a better show.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nArt Stage will be held from Jan 16 to Jan 19 at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Older and more experienced applicants must earn even higher salaries commensurate with their work experience in order to get an EP.\n\nThe minimum monthly salary for the other two EP tiers - P2 and P1 - remains unchanged at $4,500 and $8,000, respectively.\n\nMr Dhinakaran, managing director of Jay Gee Melwani Group, also wanted to know if MOM had received any complaints from multinationals - especially those from the three industries that Mr Tan had earlier cited - regarding the tight labour market in Singapore.\n\nMr Tan said his ministry was in constant dialogue with the various chambers of commerce in Singapore, and both foreign and local employers have expressed their concerns.\n\nWhile Mr Tan said his ministry was \"very mindful\" of their worries about not being able to find enough skilled professionals, he stressed that the government was taking a calibrated approach on the matter.\n\n\"The overall message is consistent. We do need to tighten and we do need to move on to much more productivity-led growth as well as a more manpower-lean approach,\" said the minister.\n\nHe added that the competitiveness that Singapore offered to investors extended beyond having a diverse and open labour market.\n\n\"There are many pluses going our way - rule of law, transparency, flexibility, infrastructure. All these go into consideration of any company operating here,\" said Mr Tan.\n\n\"Obviously, having a diverse and open workforce is beneficial, and it does eventually benefit Singaporeans as well.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All the offences took place over an eight-month period from May 2012 to December 2012.\n\nMarina Bay Sands (MBS) bore the brunt as it was made to pay $337,500 in fines for two breaches, such as failing to prevent locals who did not have a valid entry levy from entering or remaining in the casino.\n\nAs for Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), it must fork out $190,000 for three separate offences. The casino was guilty of, among other things, failing to prevent five minors from entering or remaining in the casino, and admitting people on the government's casino exclusion list.\n\n\"CRA takes a serious view of these lapses as the social safeguard measures have been put in place to protect the vulnerable from the harms of casino gambling,\" CRA said in a statement, adding that it would continue to be vigilant and take firm action against regulatory breaches.\n\nEarlier this year, CRA imposed two separate rounds of financial penalties on the casinos. In January, MBS and RWS were fined a total of $230,000 for various offences that took place from November 2011 to April 2012. In February this year, MBS was ordered to pay $475,000 for three separate breaches, including failing to ensure continuous recording of casino surveillance footage.\n\nCRA did, however, note yesterday that both casinos have continued to put in place a range of measures over the past three years to enhance their compliance with social safeguard measures. These include conducting more thorough checks at the casino entrances before allowing people in, and investing more resources to detect Singapore citizens and permanent residents who have stayed on in the casino even after their entry levies have expired.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Two-bedroom units (from 807 sq ft) are priced upwards of $1,983 psf.\n\nSales are expected to start tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile, a price cut may have aided Singapore Land's (SingLand's) Alex Residences condominium, which will be launching preview sales today - three days ahead of its planned Saturday main public launch - after 550 cheques that have been verified by the developer were received for the 150 units being released in the first phase of sales.\n\nMichael Ng, group general manager of UIC, SingLand's parent company, said that balloting for units will start today based on the cheques it has received over the two preview weekends.\n\nPublic sales will start from Thursday onwards.\n\nSingLand had earlier said that units at the 99-year leasehold development near Redhill MRT, which has a total of 429 units, will launch at an average $1,650 psf.\n\nThis is cheaper than next-door neighbour Echelon, where units were sold for an average $1,795 psf, according to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). Echelon was launched last December.\n\nMr Ng said that units launched in phase two are likely to be slightly higher, \"in excess of $1,700 psf\".\n\nPhase one's average price of $1,650 psf means that about 95 per cent of the 150 units released will cost below $2 million.\n\nThe development has one to three-bedroom apartments.\n\nSaid Mr Ng: \"Alex Residences appears to be quite well received. This could be due to the attractiveness of the location, with Tanglin/Jervois just across the road, the convenience of being located near Redhill MRT and the nearby amenities.\"\n\nThe property is a few \"minutes drive from Tiong Bahru, VivoCity, Orchard Road, MBS, CBD and Sentosa\", according to a fact sheet on the development.\n\nUnder the first phase, the smallest unit at Alex Residences, at 474 sq ft, will cost $760,000, while prices for two-bedroom apartments (657 and 678 sq ft) start at just over $1 million.\n\nThree-bedders (at least 883 sq ft) will cost upwards of $1.3 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This marked the final leg of the group's four-phase departure from Millenia Tower and the next-door Centennial Tower that began in 2011.\n\nPrior to that, Citi had occupied a total of about 440,000 sq ft in the two buildings, which are part of the Millenia Singapore development owned by Pontiac Land Group.\n\nIn 2011, Citibank began its move to Asia Square Tower 1.\n\nAmong those who have leased the 143,000 sq ft at Millenia Tower that Citi is giving up are four tenants who have each leased a floor of 17,000 sq ft - PayPal, Barry Callebaut, Bank of New York Mellon and Dymon Asia Capital.\n\nPayPal has been operating from its new premises on Millenia Tower's 14th floor since the second quarter of this year.\n\nThis represents an expansion of business for the group, which continues to have a presence in Suntec City.\n\nIn September, Dymon Asia Capital, a Singapore-headquartered investment management company, moved into the fourth level of Millenia Tower from Suntec City.\n\nBarry Callebaut Cocoa Asia Pacific Pte Ltd is another new tenant.\n\nIt is expected to move in later this month to the 12th floor, where it will set up its regional headquarters, which is being relocated from Malaysia.\n\nThe Zurich-based group is the world's leading manufacturer of high-quality chocolate and cocoa products.\n\nBank of New York Mellon, which now occupies three floors (Levels 2, 3 and 4) of Millenia Tower, will occupy the seventh floor as well from next month.\n\nThe rest of the space Citi vacated in the building this year has been leased to tenants involved in the financial and commodities businesses as well as a designer eyewear tenant from Italy believed to be Luxottica, whose brands include Ray-Ban and Oakley.\n\nPontiac Land said tenants that have inked leases for the 143,000 sq ft ex-Citi space in Millenia Tower have agreed to pay monthly rents ranging from the high-$8s to $10-plus per square foot.\n\nLast year, BT reported that Pontiac Land took just nine months to fill back all the 129,000 sq ft in the next door Centennial Tower vacated by Citi in November 2011.\n\nPontiac leased the space to existing tenants such as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and McKinsey while clinching a few new names as well.\n\nAll eyes now are on the 55,000 sq ft that Allianz vacated earlier this month on Centennial Tower's Levels 3, 7, 8 and 9 though its lease runs until July 2015.\n\nAgents are busy finding replacement tenants who can sign up fresh leases with Pontiac Land even before the July 2015 expiry of Allianz' lease.\n\nThe German financial services provider has moved to Asia Square Tower 2.\n\nPontiac Land is asking for $13 psf a month, for smaller units below 3,000 sq ft at Centennial Tower, although lower psf rents can be negotiated for bigger spaces.\n\nAccording to Pontiac Land spokeswoman, tenants have been drawn to the two office towers by several factors, including ample carpark space with a total 1,500 parking lots for the Millenia Singapore development, which includes the two office towers, two hotels and Millenia Walk mall.\n\nIn addition, Millenia Tower boasts a concierge facility provided by Conrad Centennial Hotel.\n\n\"Our tenants also enjoy the prestige of being located in a mixed development with museum-quality art pieces,\" added the spokeswoman.\n\nCBRE executive director (office services) Moray Armstrong reckons that after stagnating at $9.55 psf for the first three quarters of this year, the firm's average monthly rental value for Grade A office space will end the year 2 per cent higher than the $9.58 psf at end-2012.\n\nCBRE's Grade A basket covers the best-quality buildings in Raffles Place, Marina Bay and Marina Centre.\n\nFor next year, he predicts a 5 to 7 per cent increase supported by continuation of the \"reasonably strong demand for office space\" seen this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was due to higher gross profit margins, which saw cost of goods falling 12 per cent to $82.8 million. The result was a 9 per cent rise in gross profit to $39.2 million.\n\nThe lower revenue was attributed mainly to lower revenues from the Americas and the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. However, net margins in these regions improved substantially on the back of the lower level of zero-margin revenue in the Middle East and the higher level of more profitable offshore activity in the Americas.\n\nCSE Global subsidiary Power Diesel contributed profit after tax of $0.5 million in the quarter; its newly acquired S3 ID Group, in which it has a 60 per cent effective ownership, was in a break-even position for the group in the quarter after accounting for transaction costs and non-controlling interests.\n\nBasic earnings per share was 2.21 cents in the quarter, up from 2.09 cents in the year-ago period.\n\nNew orders received for the quarter were $115.3 million, a decrease of 9.3 per cent from the third quarter of 2012. Outstanding orders at the end of this year's third quarter stood at $365.4 million.\n\nThe group generated operating cash inflow of $18.5 million in the third quarter, up from S$4.3 million in the 2012 quarter.\n\nNet gearing of the group was 7.1 per cent at the end of the quarter, compared to 6.2 per cent a year ago. The rise in net gearing in the current quarter came partly from the acquisition of S3 ID Group during the period.\n\nFor the nine months ended Sept 30, the group recorded an 18 per cent fall to $36.5 million in profit attributable to equity-holders, from $44.5 million in the year-ago period which had the benefit of a $10.3 million disposal gain.

It's still largely a property play right now, and it has to move towards a better kind of economic integration to benefit both sides better,\" said Dr Nungsari, who is now managing director of Prokhas, a special purpose vehicle wholly owned by the Minister of Finance Inc in Malaysia.\n\n\"But the cooperation and familiarity that has been created in Iskandar actually augurs well for opportunities everywhere else - certainly in the northern areas, in Penang, in Kuantan. Of course it also depends on the sort of industries that Singapore firms are looking for,\" he added.\n\nApart from Iskandar in Johor, Malaysia has carved out four other economic corridors with investment and business incentives. These are the Northern Corridor Economic Region, the East Coast Economic Region, the Sabah Development Corridor, and the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy.\n\nAs power and economic heft continues to shift towards North Asia, Dr Nungsari believes deeper collaboration between Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia needs to be seen as a political and economic imperative, and not merely a nice-to-have prospect.\n\n\"The future of this immediate region will have to be developed along the Malacca straits ... Then we will have a decent chance to be the location for production to feed demand that's going to come from up north,\" said Dr Nungsari, who was previously an executive director at sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional.\n\nHe noted that the Greater Mekong Subregion - comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and China - could become a potential competitor in this respect.\n\nAlthough Dr Nungsari acknowledged that a surplus economy like Singapore should funnel resources towards the ascending region of North Asia, he said that Singapore must think of its immediate neighbours as well.\n\n\"With such growth and size come responsibilities, because your behaviour and non-behaviour actually affects other things. I think given Singapore's advanced standing in development, it should integrate better (with its neighbours) on the non-economic side of things first, which would then lead to better economic integration later.\n\n\"As opposed to always being characterised as the place where the brain drain goes to, things should be the other way around. Singapore can share the brains and be an exporter of talent to the region - it's a possible way of building some bridges,\" said Dr Nungsari.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This amounts to about $88.4 million, and represents a dividend payout ratio of about 35 per cent. The date of the dividend payout will be announced at a later date.\n\nOxley's strong performance was largely driven by revenue recognition, based on the completion of construction method, from its 728-unit industrial development, Oxley Bizhub. Revenue was also recognised, using the percentage of completion method, from progress made in the construction of 10 mixed-residential projects.\n\nOxley has since started looking overseas for its next phase of growth.\n\nIts latest acquisition, which marks its first foray into London and also its most ambitious, is the acquisition of three freehold and three leasehold adjacent parcels of land in London's Royal Docks area.\n\nThe Royal Wharf development site, which was purchased at \u00a3200 million (S$397.4 million), yields an effective gross area of about 363,000 square metres.\n\nOxley has said that it intends to develop the parcels, which stretch about 500 metres facing the River Thames, into more than 3,400 homes, along with a mix of commercial, retail, leisure and educational facilities.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a ramp-up in overseas acquisitions over the quarter. In July, Oxley unveiled separate acquisitions of three plots of land in Cambodia. Taking into account a joint venture to develop another plot, this brings the total number of pipeline projects in Cambodia to four.\n\nIn China, Oxley entered an agreement to acquire a 10 per cent stake in GD Capital, which will ultimately hold the land use rights for two plots of land of 102,506 sqm and 80,599 sqm respectively, in Xuancheng Economic and Technical Development Zone, Anhui Province. Under the deal, Oxley will also be able to participate, with up to 30 per cent interest, in the development of five other land parcels in the same economic zone.\n\nThe company has a further five projects in Malaysia spread across Selangor, Johor Bahru, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. It marked its first overseas acquisition on May 29, when it bought a Malaysia-incorporated company that clinched the rights for a mixed development site in Kuala Lumpur. This brings its total pipeline of overseas projects to 12.\n\nWhile it will continue to seek out local opportunities, Oxley said that it will be adopting a prudent approach towards its local land acquisition strategy for financial year 2014. This is in light of the property cooling measures introduced, which have continued to soften overall demand in the local residential market.\n\nOxley intends to develop its investment properties at Stevens Road and Tampines Industrial Crescent. It will closely monitor the Singapore market for an opportune time to launch its three remaining pipeline residential projects at Oxley Rise, Ang Mo Kio Street 66 and Joo Chiat Road, it added.\n\nAs at Sept 30, total shareholder's equity stood at $524.8 million, compared with $288.5 million as at June 30. Net asset value per share was 16.6 cents, versus 8.1 cents a year ago, and earnings per share were 8.51 cents, versus 0.25 cents a year ago.\n\nThe counter closed two cents lower at 43.5 cents, before it released its results.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was due to increased contributions from both its shipbuilding and vessel chartering segments.\n\nThe shipbuilding segment generated RM319.7 million as a result of progressive recognition of revenue derived from platform-supply vessels, which accounted for 43 per cent of shipbuilding revenue.\n\nVessel chartering revenue recorded a 199 per cent increase to RM21.5 million due to the deployment of two additional vessels.\n\nGross profit rose 125 per cent to RM87.3 million.\n\nEarnings per share came to 2.79 sen, up from 1.65 sen the year before.

This is a leading indicator for Nam Cheong's future performance as its shipbuilding sales are driven by vessels-in-stock, and the build-up hints at strong vessel sales and earnings to come,\" he said.\n\nNam Cheong has a global market share of shallow-water OSVs of about 12 per cent, up from 10 per cent just a year ago.\n\nThe company said that, over the next three years, it saw room to improve on that figure.\n\nMr Lee interpreted this to mean that a healthy growth rate is sustainable over the next 3-5 years.\n\nNam Cheong is one of his top picks in the offshore and marine sector, and he has maintained a \"buy\" on the stock.\n\nCIMB analyst Yeo Zhi Bin said that Nam Cheong's earnings per share beat expectations by 62 per cent and maintained an \"outperform\" rating.\n\n\"Record sales this year should support a bumper 2014,\" he said.\n\nThe company did not declare a dividend for Q3.\n\nTiong Su Kouk, executive chairman of Nam Cheong, said: \"We are delighted with this set of results which marks our strongest quarter since our listing on the Singapore Exchange.

This will push vacancy rates up, especially since population growth is slowing.\n\nMs Chew estimated that vacancy rates could surge to more than 10 per cent in 2015 and 2016 amid curbs on foreign demand, given that the secondary market has weakened following the government's multiple rounds of macro-prudential measures to cool the property market.\n\nOn the demand side, overall home ownership levels have risen to 90 per cent from the 10-year low of 87 per cent at the end of 2010. This suggests that pent-up demand for housing to live in has already been met, Mr Kit added.\n\nBoth economists noted that the risks of rapidly rising household debt in Singapore are ameliorated by the fact that households are not just asset-rich but also cash-rich, but Mr Kit noted that property has accounted for almost 80 per cent of the growth in household net worth since 2006. \"It follows that a fall in property prices in the next few years would also erode household net worth significantly,\" said Mr Kit.\n\nAlso, the distribution of debts and assets may be important: Recent figures from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Credit Bureau show that rising debt burdens among those in their 30s to 50s and debt levels rising past the peak income age of 50 may signal that individuals are borrowing on their assets. If such loans are being used for investment properties, that could amplify the downward pressure on prices, said Mr Kit.\n\nOne participant pointed out that MAS has said that it is prepared to unwind some of the measures introduced when the property market cools, although others, such as the total debt servicing ratio, are longer-term ones to ensure prudent lending.\n\nBut others said that reversing such demand measures, while necessary, may be insufficient. One participant said: \"Once a condo is built, the supply is there. It's not clear to me that investor demand will come back; immigration policies are being tightened.\n\nAnother said: \"I'm not sure how much the government can do to support the market. It's already reached a bubble situation. I'm not sure how much can be unwound.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The ship was released after its cargo was transferred to another tanker.\n\nThe attacks follow three similar ship hijackings and gasoil thefts in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\"Given previous incidents occurred in clusters, this could be the start of a trend,\" said Mark Pearce, director of marketing for international risk consultant Drum Cussac.\n\nA security source with knowledge of previous attacks said it was unclear whether one or several gangs were responsible for the attacks. \"It has to be the work of a syndicate,\" said the source, citing the level of pre-planning and sophistication that went into the attacks.\n\nThe armed gangs could either have links to the crew onboard the hijacking target or inside knowledge about the ship and cargo, according to the Singapore-headquartered Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP).\n\nThese intelligence-led hijackings have involved \"the seizure of tug boats and barges for resale on the black market and the seizure of tankers so that their cargo, often marine gasoil, can be transferred and sold on the black market\", Mr Pearce said.\n\nTom Fulford-Smith, marine divisional director of international insurance at broker Cooper Gay (Hong Kong), said insurance premiums could rise if there were more attacks.\n\n\"If insurers see one or two (incidents), they are going to wonder if it's going to happen again,\" said Mr Fulford-Smith, whose views echoed those of other brokers including Marco Daini, director of marine cargo at Cambiaso Risso Asia.\n\nThe tanker hijacked on Nov 7 was the 3,254 deadweight tonne GPT-21 operated by Singapore firm Global Unique Petroleum, according to anti-piracy sources and ship tracking data.\n\nOne ship broker estimated the gasoil cargo was worth more than US$2.7 million if the Panama-flagged ship was fully loaded and all cargo stolen.\n\nPrevious tanker hijackings and cargo thefts have involved gangs gaining access to information on routings, what the vessel was carrying, origin and destination and possible locations where the oil transfer could be carried out, ReCAAP said.\n\nReCAAP had given details about the latest incident to Interpol because it involved cross-border crime. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

As a whole, we are still very confident of our business especially in tower crane rentals.\n\n\"This is also an opportunity to look at our internal processes and improve our business model.\"\n\nTat Hong's revenue slide was across its main crane rental and distribution segments, as well as its general equipment rental segment, mainly due to subdued mining and infrastructure activities in Australia as well as lower excavator sales in Indonesia caused by weak commodity prices.\n\nA bright spot was Tat Hong's tower crane rental segment, which recorded a 20 per cent rise in quarterly revenue to $22.6 million. The company said this was due to healthy demand for tower cranes from power generation, infrastructure and large commercial building projects in China.\n\nThe company said its results were also due to $5.2 million of mostly unrealised foreign exchange losses from Singapore dollar-denominated intercompany loans and payables for its Indonesian operations. The quarter's results were also up against record profits a year ago.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange effects, net operating profit improved 43 per cent quarter on quarter, management said.\n\nTat Hong, the largest listed crane supplier here, had surprised the market a few months ago with poor first-quarter results, causing a share price plunge. Said Mr Ng: \"People asked why we didn't let the market know earlier. But events caught us by surprise, everything came at the same time.\"\n\nFor the half year, revenue was down 16 per cent at $360.8 million while net profit fell 52 per cent to $16.5 million.

Lenox Hill, your own floor - OK, after Beyonc\u00e9 that's hard,\" he conceded. But a private suite is, of course, no problem.\n\nClients like the ones that Mr Perepada serves were once rare in the upper echelons of the city's real estate. The most expensive buildings were filled with blue-blood Americans, and as for wealthy foreigners, they put their money in securities or Swiss banks.\n\nBut today, foreign capital is a crucial force in the luxury market.\n\nMr Perepada's clients are not after the addresses on Park or Fifth Avenue that previous generations coveted. For one thing, those buildings require a degree of financial disclosure that few Russian plutocrats would ever consider.\n\nInstead, they gravitate to condominiums that are new or still under construction. Many of those buildings actively seek out foreign investors. Some even send representatives to Moscow, among other destinations, to reach potential buyers where they live or play.\n\nEdward Mermelstein, a lawyer who represents investors abroad (including many of Mr Perepada's clients), has advised developers on how to reach their audience in exclusive Moscow lounges and bars.\n\n\"Their attention is typically very short,\" he said. \"If you catch them at the right moment by basically sitting looking at a floor plan, whether it's One57 or 432 Park - typically everyone knows each other in those rooms. They'll sit down for a cup of tea or coffee, and in those few moments you'll get enough attention to get a follow-up meeting.\"\n\nMr Perepada does not represent the oligarchs who grab headlines with their nine-figure purchases. His clients are not quite billionaires, he says, just \"regular millionaires\".\n\nHe knows what they like: high ceilings, at least 3,000 square feet, full service, great views and, most of all, ease of transaction. Their reverence for Central Park has attracted them to One57, the new tower on West 57th Street, though no keys have yet changed hands.\n\nBut he has also broadened their interest to buildings like 75 Wall Street and 60 Riverside Boulevard.\n\nHis iPhone is loaded with images of panoramic penthouse vistas, gracious interiors and Google Map street shots. By 4.30 am, he and the phone are typically in high gear, as he uses Skype and WhatsApp and FaceTime back and forth across time zones, in Ukrainian, Russian, Uzbek, Kazakh or even \"a bissel Yiddish\".\n\nWhen he immigrated from Ukraine in 1990, Mr Perepada took whatever job he could get. He worked at a flea market; he made deliveries; he drove a taxi. Along the way, he helped much of his family immigrate and settle in Brooklyn, where he still lives.\n\nTen years ago, he made his way into real estate, selling ordinary apartments. He liked the work but not the size of the commissions, so he set his sights higher.\n\nHe found the ultrarich to be surprisingly pleasant company. \"How they say in English, communicate?\" he asked. \"I know psychology. I love philosophy. I can talk to them about anything.\"\n\nHe makes himself useful by overseeing not only their real estate purchases, but also all of the secondary needs such purchases generate, like further construction, decorating, furniture and even clothes to hang in the closets. In the process, he becomes an expert in his clients' taste. What is their favourite type of bed linen? Their preferred silverware? Do they want Venetian stucco on the wall? No, wait, paint instead? OK, now change it to wallpaper? No problem.\n\nWhen they visit, he tries to anticipate their desires - not just making them a reservation at their favourite restaurant, but also remembering that they prefer the four-top by the window.\n\nHe collects a commission on apartment sales, split with the seller's broker. As for the deluxe concierge services that go along with them, he declines to say how, or whether, he charges. Discussing financial transactions between friends is uncouth.\n\n\"This is absolutely - I tell you, absolutely normal people,\" he said. \"Someone tells you different, they're lying.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The country accounts for 3 per cent of the world's almond production.\n\n\"Though we will no longer own the land, trees or the farming infrastructure, we continue to retain the production economics of the entire almond harvest from these orchards,\" said Olam.\n\nEarlier in the year, Olam had also conducted a sale and leaseback transaction of 1,940 ha of almond orchards in California, resulting in a one-time capital gain of $18.1 million after tax.\n\nThese are part of Olam's efforts to optimise its balance sheet, among other measures, in a bid to have positive free cash flow from the 2014 financial years onwards - a plan brought forward by a year after its strategic review following the attack by Muddy Waters last year.\n\nOlam shares closed trading unchanged at $1.47 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The police have charged a man with allegedly hacking the Ang Mo Kio Town Council website and rounded up another five suspects for attacking the websites belonging to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and Istana.\n\nFor his alleged defacement of the town council's website, James Raj s/o Arokiasamy, 35, was charged under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act yesterday. A balding and skinny man whose birthday falls on National Day, James appeared in the Subordinate Court yesterday to hear the charge against him.\n\nHe is accused of defacing the town council website with an image of the Guy Fawkes mask and a banner of text referring to himself as \"The Messiah\". The Guy Fawkes mask is a symbol associated with hacktivist group Anonymous.\n\nJames, a Singaporean, is also believed to have been involved in the hacking of the websites belonging to The Straits Times Blog, People's Action Party Community Foundation and City Harvest Church co-founder Sun Ho.\n\nIf convicted as a first-time offender, James faces a fine of up to $10,000 or a prison term of up to three years, or both.\n\nHe also faces three drug charges for offences allegedly committed on May 25, 2011.\n\nYesterday, James's lawyer, M Ravi, told reporters: \"I can't confirm . . . whether (James) really is the Messiah or if he's linked to Anonymous at this stage.\"\n\nA day after the town council's website was hacked on Oct 28, a video featuring a Guy Fawkes mask-wearing man surfaced on YouTube, threatening the government with \"aggressive cyber intrusion\". James allegedly tampered with the website on the same date from an apartment in Kuala Lumpur where he had been hiding out, on the run from outstanding drug-related offences in Singapore.\n\nJames, who was arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Nov 4 with the help of the Malaysian police, claimed yesterday that he was assaulted during the arrest, sustained a concussion and denied medical attention for hours.\n\nFollowing a request by the prosecution yesterday, the court decided that James will be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for psychiatric evaluation. During the evaluation, he will not be permitted access to third parties, including the police or legal counsel.\n\nThe court's decision followed a disagreement about the state of the accused's mental health. The prosecution said that James had claimed to be suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - for which he was taking Ritalin - borderline personality disorder, suicidal tendencies and depression.\n\nJames said, however, that his account of his medical history had been \"taken out of context\" by the investigating officer, and that while he had suffered from ADHD, he had listed the other conditions as examples of what could happen if the disorder were not treated.\n\nIn response, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Tang Shangjun told the court that James was now \"changing his tune to say that he's mentally well at present\". \"He should be assessed by a medical professional,\" the DPP added.\n\nMr Ravi also told the court yesterday that he had been unable to gain access to James, despite the latter having been remanded for more than 48 hours.\n\nIn response, the prosecution cited case law in which individuals could be held for longer than that without access to counsel. Mr Ravi told reporters that he is considering filing an application with the High Court to challenge and clarify the current position on access to legal counsel.\n\nJames's next court date has been set for Nov 26.\n\nSeparately, five other Singaporean men aged 17 to 45 were identified by police as suspects in the cyberattacks on the PMO and Istana websites, which are not believed to be related to one another or to the hacking of the town council website. The police said yesterday that the five men are assisting them with investigations.\n\nApart from the website hackings, five other men, ranging from the ages of 21 to 26, were charged with vandalism of various properties, including the pavement outside Sunshine Plaza, yesterday.\n\nThe group allegedly spray-painted these structures with slogans linked to the Anonymous group. This bout of vandalism is also believed to be unrelated to the cyberattacks.\n\nA statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs yesterday warned that acts that disrupt information communications and technology systems have \"serious security, economic and social consequences for Singapore and Singaporeans\".\n\nIt added: \"We hope that the community will take a strong stand against such anti-social and criminal acts . . . We should not allow the actions of a few to affect our sense of safety and security in Singapore.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was offset by a difference in hedge rates between actual and forecast for the period.\n\nCRT has a policy to hedge at least 80 per cent of the expected cash flow distributions in the forecast period up to June 30, 2015.\n\nIn the meantime, gross revenue for the period met expectations, at 1,998 million yen, 0.4 per cent above forecast. Net property income was 1,269 million yen, or 3.1 per cent higher than forecast.\n\nThis was largely due to property management repair and other property expenses having positive variances, offset by the negative variance of increased utility expenses. Overall, property expenses for the period were below forecast by 4 per cent.\n\nLooking ahead, Jim Chang, chief executive officer and executive director of Croesus Retail Asset Management, the trustee-manager of CRT, said the trust will continue to focus on strengthening its portfolio.\n\nSpecifically, the trust will actively pursue acquisition opportunities, even as competition for acquiring real estate assets in Japan has increased in recent months.\n\nCRT financed its acquisition with a five-year Japanese yen debt maturing in 2018. To hedge its interest rate exposure, CRT has entered into five-year interest rate swaps.\n\nThe trust's distribution policy is to distribute all of its distributable income until June 30, 2015, and at least 90 per cent of its distributable income after.\n\nThe first distribution is for the period from the listing date to Dec 31, and will be paid on or before March 31, 2014.\n\nCRT listed on May 10; the forecast figures are extracted from the prospectus and pro-rated to 144 days.\n\nIts counter ended one cent higher at 87.5 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But you can never be sure.\n\n\"And therefore some measures when you do it, then you have to calibrate the quantum. But . . . so far, so good . . . As you can see, I'm now more relaxed, my hair has even turned black,\" he added, drawing laughter from the House.\n\nHe also said he shared Mr De Souza's wish to \"try and achieve a sustainable, perhaps even boring, property market\".\n\n\"But for a small Singapore market that is plugged into the global system, you know that there are many factors which are quite completely outside, beyond our control.\"\n\nMr Khaw also cited data to show that the cooling measures have had their intended effect of dampening foreign demand and reducing speculation. Since 2011, foreign buying in Singapore's private housing market has shrunk, both in proportion and in absolute numbers.\n\nThe proportion of purchases by foreigners (who are not Singapore permanent residents) has fallen from 17 per cent in 2011 to 7 per cent in the third quarter of this year. Over the same period, the number of purchases by such foreigners has also declined from about 1,400 per quarter to 330 in Q3 this year.\n\nMr Khaw also gave figures on subsales, which are often seen as a gauge of the level of speculative activity in the property market. Subsales as a proportion of all private housing transactions dropped from 7.6 per cent in 2011 to 4.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2013. In absolute numbers, subsale transactions have fallen from about 670 per quarter in 2011 to 181 in Q3 2013.\n\nHighlighting policies reflecting the priority to support home ownership for Singaporeans, Mr Khaw said: \"Only citizens are allowed to buy new HDB flats and provided grants to purchase resale HDB flats.\n\n\"Almost all landed housing can only be purchased by Singaporeans. The private condominium market allows foreigner buying and the cooling measures have moderated their impact. The resultant trend is encouraging but we continue to closely monitor the market and we will not hesitate to act further when necessary.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was largely due to Yancoal, which had reported a loss of A$749.4 million (S$873.8 million) for the six months ended June, due to a weakened Australian dollar against the greenback and impairment of mining tenements. Noble owns 13 per cent of the Australia-listed coal producer. It recorded US$822,000 in share of profits from associates last year.\n\nStripping out the losses from associates, Noble's \"core\" net profit is US$113 million, the highest since the third quarter of 2010, it said.\n\nIts agriculture segment - which has been in the red for the first two quarters - is \"showing signs of recovery\".\n\nThe division turned in an operating income of US$14 million, down 80 per cent from a year ago.\n\nIts Brazilian sugar mills are seeing improved efficiencies as they ramp up volumes, said its CEO, Yusuf Alireza.\n\nNoble's grains and oilseeds business, which had previously suffered from logistics issues in Brazil, also rebounded as the firm re-aligned some of its origination flows.\n\nNoble has completed its new crushing plants in Ukraine, Brazil and South Africa. The first is already operational, while the latter two are going through a \"pre-startup review\", it said.\n\nIn its energy segment, which includes coal, oil, gas and power, operating income rose 55 per cent to US$339.4 million, despite a drop in tonnage.\n\nNoble's metals, minerals and ores (MMO) segment, meanwhile, saw a 22 per cent decline in operating income to US$20.7 million, in spite of a small rise in revenue.\n\nIts initiatives to deepen and broaden its business capabilities are gaining momentum, said Mr Alireza.\n\nThe group in September won a tight contest to replace Glencore as the buyer of zinc in Europe from Nyrstar, the world's largest producer of the metal.\n\nIt is also investing US$500 million in a new mining venture X2 Resources, set up by former Xstrata chief Mick Davis. These mark its efforts to expand its MMO business beyond Noble's core products of aluminium and iron ore.\n\n\"Our relationship with (X2 Resources) would be both as investor but also as supply chain manager for their assets,\" said Mr Alireza in a conference call, adding that Noble expects returns from this investment to meet or exceed Noble's target of 20-plus per cent.\n\nNoble's shares gained 1.5 cent to close at $1.08 yesterday, before the announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Loomis, Sayles & Co says there are attractive returns in fixed income\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nEMERGING equities are generally out of favour at the moment, but Mark Mobius, executive chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group, is optimistic that the current underperformance is temporary. Elsewhere, Loomis, Sayles & Co portfolio manager Elaine Stokes says there are opportunities for \"nice, positive returns'' in fixed income even in an environment of gradually rising interest rates.\n\nIn the year-to-date, emerging market equities have lost 5.9 per cent based on the MSCI index, compared to a 26 per cent rise in the S&P 500 and a 19 per cent gain in the MSCI World index. Most strategists continue to tell investors to underweight emerging equities in favour of developed market equities.\n\nMr Mobius says the Templeton emerging markets group continues to see inflows, and argues that the macroeconomic fundamentals of emerging countries remain stronger than those of developed markets.\n\n\"What I see going forward is a very active and positive equity market globally. A lot of people fail to recognise that in the last two years, the US has been on a very strong bull run... That affects markets around the world and the emerging markets will get their fair share. We're quite optimistic.\"\n\nHe says that in the last 12 years, there were only two when EMs had underperformed - in 2011 and 2007. \"Emerging markets' average economic growth is 4.4 per cent compared to 1 per cent in developed markets. Debt to GDP levels are going down, not up. Foreign reserves are going up and greater than developed markets.\"\n\nEM valuations have generally risen, he says. Dividend yields stand at 2 to 3 per cent, and at about 4 per cent in frontier markets.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch's fund management survey in October found that investors and asset allocators indicate that they see value in the region, but the signals are not all positive. A net 38 per cent of global respondents say emerging equities were the most undervalued. In contrast, a net 63 per cent point to the US as the most overvalued region.\n\nBut views on China worsened, and asset allocators further reduced their exposure to commodities, which are a proxy for emerging market sentiment.\n\nMr Mobius says he is concerned that investors - both institutional and retail - equate risk with volatility, which raises fear.\n\n\"The unfortunate factor in our business is that in their effort to explain performance, consultants to big institutions have defined risk as volatility... If you have more volatility the risk number increases and people shy away, which is not what they should do. They should buy at low points in this volatility.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Loomis, Sayle and Co portfolio manager Elaine Stokes argues that fixed income returns can actually be attractive despite a slow-growth environment. \"Growth is strong enough that we might raise rates, but not so strong that we'd raise them a lot. That environment is actually good for bonds, where if you hold on to the bonds and get the yield, and have some spread compression - because we do have growth, and there are winners - you can still get nice, positive returns.\"\n\nLoomis, Sayles & Co manages about US$189 billion in assets, invested in equities and bonds. It is an affiliate of Natixis Global Asset Management, which manages a total of about US$838 billion. Ms Stokes was a speaker last week at a Natixis symposium on durable portfolio construction.\n\nThe sweet spot for fixed income returns, she says, is in the BBB to B space. But outperformance will need careful research. \"We need to be a lot more selective, patient and disciplined in picking credits... the BBB to B space is where we think you can get the yield you need in a rising rate environment for solid, positive returns.\"\n\nRising rates, she says, are not necessarily bad for fixed income as long as the rise is gradual. This year, 10-year Treasuries have already risen from about 1.6 per cent earlier this year to around 2.75 per cent, even as the market speculates on when QE (quantitative easing) tapering will occur.\n\n\"The bad scenario is when rates spike because you have nowhere to hide. But if rates go up gradually and we have growth, which is usually the reason why rates rise, you can also have spread compression.''\n\nTen-year Treasuries could rise to 3 or 3.5 per cent next year. \"To counter that you need spread compression. Could we get 50 basis points in compression in the bonds we're buying in the BBB to B space if we have growth? Absolutely.\n\n\"So you can still make your yield. It's when rates spike and the Federal Reserve finds itself behind the game, running to catch up and raising rates very fast - that's bad for fixed income.''\n\nShe expects that economic data may not be supportive of aggressive tapering or rising rates. This is because improvements in productivity pose headwinds in terms of unemployment. The latter is a key indicator of the Fed's course of action.\n\nShe believes it is too early at the moment to get heavily into emerging market sovereigns. The emerging markets, she says, are grappling with having to \"reset\" their economies as China restructures to focus on domestic consumption rather than exports. Until recently, most EM countries have thrived on supplying parts and materials to China for export.\n\n\"EM countries need to figure out what to do... When you are an EM country and a large portion of your debt is held externally and you make a mistake, you get punished.\n\n\"We try to identify countries we think are on the right path; we think it's still too early to get back in.\" The firm has reduced its EM weighting from 35 to 5 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He thought nothing of the food and drink and shower and business facilities on tap - until he struck out on his own in 1992 and was compelled to fly economy for the sake of his pocketbook.\n\nIt was then that the Johor-born Malaysian, now 56, began thinking about it seriously. He said: \"It was frustrating for businessmen like me in economy. There was no place from where we could send faxes or to take a shower or to rest. I used to have to steal electricity to charge my computer.\"\n\nHis \"eureka\" moment was tied to a simple truth - that everyone, even economy class passengers, needed an oasis in airports and would be willing to pay for the privilege.\n\nAnd so Plaza Premium Lounge Management (PPL) was born. The firm, incorporated in Hong Kong where Mr Song lives, is a pioneer in the concept of the airport-based, premium service lounge for airline passengers - regardless of airline or class of travel.\n\nIt clearly plugged an area of need: in its 15-year history, PPL has grown into a HK$1 billion (S$161 million) enterprise with a network of 110 lounges in 29 countries. It has offices from Mumbai to Melbourne and from London to Langkawi; it hires more than 2,000 people worldwide and serves more than four million passengers a year.\n\nA clutch of imitators have appeared, but PPL remains the dominant player in retail aviation - it is the first choice in new airport terminals. Heathrow, for example, recently tapped him to run a lounge in its new terminal building.\n\nThe firm has grown exponentially in the last five years, aided by corporate cost cutting after the global financial crisis - resulting in fewer business class flights - and the advent of the Asian budget traveller.\n\nMr Song does not intend to slow down his expansion anytime soon. With more than 700 international airports around the world, he believes he has uncovered only the tip of the iceberg. He is planning for 50 more outlets by 2015.\n\nHe wasn't always in such a \"sunrise\" business. By the time he was 33, he was a senior vice-president with Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong and not seeing much of a way up that corporate ladder.\n\nIn 1992, he struck out on his own, creating instant offices by renting out vacant office spaces, furnishing them and then leasing them out as office spaces in move-in condition.\n\nIt was a good business. Over the next five years, he set up 14 such offices throughout South-east Asia, but once he hit upon the idea of running premium lounges in airports, he sold off this business.\n\nHe said that on hindsight, the business model for airport lounges seemed like a no-brainer. \"Eighty-five per cent of all passengers fly economy, but no one was looking after them. Waiting around, especially in a hub airport, takes a toll on mind and body.\"\n\nIt was 1997 and two new airports - the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok - were opening within weeks of each other. He submitted his plans for both and they were accepted, he said. \"But it was expensive, they insisted on quality. I used all my life savings - the lounge in KLIA cost RM2 million (S$777,000), and the one for the Hong Kong airport, RM4-5 million.\"\n\nWith money invested, he went through nail-biting tension. In nine months, the lounges began turning around. With its success at the two airports, PPL's business became self-generating. Airport managements, seeing the value-added service he was capable of delivering, came a-knocking. Then, airlines began engaging PPL to manage their lounges.\n\nMr Song also got into setting up transit hotels, where passengers are offered small, clean rooms where they can take a shower and rest between flights.\n\nBut ultimately, he said, the business has simply been demand-driven. \"More than half the world's middle class who fly are from China and they have money. That's why we've grown so fast. In the first 10 years, we had 50 outlets. Over the next five, we simply doubled the number.\"\n\nAsked whether he would consider listing his company, he replied: \"I don't need to. Money isn't everything anymore. This - I enjoy it, it's become a process of self-actualisation. I am Malaysian but I am now all over the world.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was due to product revenue going up 10 per cent to US$72.2 million, driven by sales in the company's main heart stent products.\n\nA newly acquired cardiac diagnostic business, Spectrum Dynamics, also brought in US$2.4 million of revenue for the quarter.\n\nLicensing and royalties revenue, however, fell 25 per cent to US$10.8 million - a decline management said was moderating.\n\nDBS analyst Alfie Yeo said earnings are likely to be soft going forward, with sales for the company's main product, heart stents, facing lower selling prices. \"Spectrum Dynamics looks to have good potential for growth but its contribution is still small,\" he added.\n\nFor the half year, revenue was down 4 per cent at US$159.7 million, while net profit was down 62 per cent at US$23.4 million.

After a two-year pause in fare adjustments, commuters will have to get used to higher fares. Moreover, it was revealed in Parliament that the projected fare increase next year may be bigger than usual for full-fare paying commuters. This is in part to make up for the stagnant fares in the last two years, as well as due to enhanced benefits for tertiary students and pre-schoolers, among other groups.\n\nFortunately for full-fare paying commuters, the fee hike next year is likely to be capped at the average of this year's wage rise. The remainder of this will be rolled over to 2015. This cap is aimed at making the fare increase manageable for full-fare paying consumers and not eat into their real incomes.\n\nPublic transport operators are also joining the social bandwagon; it was revealed that they would donate part of the revenue raised from the proposed fare hikes to a fund that would be used to enhance travel vouchers for the poor. While this is admirable, more emphasis should be placed in improving the take-up of these vouchers as opposed to expanding the pool. Only about half of the 200,000 transport vouchers were taken up in 2011.\n\nMore notable is the government's acceptance of the recommendation made last week by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee, that it would introduce two new fare concessions - for low-income workers and commuters with disabilities - and that it would fund these concessions.\n\nThe most notable announcement, however, was the government's acknowledgement that it would be funding these new concessions through its tax revenue. This is the first time that the government would dip into tax revenues to subsidise transport fares. It may signal a reconsideration of how tax revenue may be utilised in the future - to achieve social goals through targeted subsidies, as opposed to the traditional spending on infrastructure and economic plans.\n\nThe use of subsidies is normal practice in many countries, particularly in Western advanced economies, but Singapore has traditionally used them very sparingly - and should continue to do so. However, public transport fits the bill as an area where subsidies, if limited and properly targeted, can help achieve significant social benefits that exceed their cost.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The consortium will then lease the space back to Time Warner Inc.\n\nA source close to the deal said that GIC will be forking out US$400 million, which will give it a \"substantial stake\" of the Grade A office space Time Warner Inc is selling.\n\nThe consortium is said to have fought off offers from interested parties, including a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nEarlier this year, Time Warner was said to be close to selling the space for US$1.3 billion to a group called Related Companies, a privately owned real estate firm headquartered in New York City and the lead developer of the Time Warner Center.\n\nTime Warner was then supposed to have leased the space back for five years, and then to move to a 2.4 million sq ft tower along the Hudson River called the Hudson Yards, which is being developed by Related, said media reports.\n\nThe Hudson Yards is a joint venture between the New York City Department of City Planning and Metropolitan Transportation Authority to encourage business development on Manhattan's far west side.\n\nThe New York Times said in July that Time Warner's brokers, Douglas Harmon and Amy Spies of Eastdil Secured, had lined up a second buyer for its current space in case the acquisition by Related fell through.\n\nGIC declined to comment on the deal, but a source said the location and expectations of an above-average net yield were the lures behind this acquisition.\n\nThe source said: \"It is one of the best office buildings in New York City in terms of the quality of the asset, the amenities and the view. I mean, Central Park is gorgeous.\"\n\nThe source added that the property now housed a group of \"top-notch tenants, so this makes it a very compelling opportunity for GIC\".\n\nThe Time Warner Center, completed in 2004, has a pair of towers bridged by a multi-storey atrium that is home to upscale retail shops such as Armani, Hugo Boss and Thomas Pink; it also houses the three-Michelin starred restaurant Per Se and Japanese restaurant Masa, which is considered one of the world's most expensive.\n\nThe towers have a total floor area of 2.8 million sq ft, housing offices, the Mandarin Oriental New York hotel and residential condominium units. The apartments there are known to be home to an international crowd, including Asia's and Russia's wealthiest families. A unit on the 54th floor was recently listed for US$50 million, or US$13,900 psf.\n\nIf successful, this deal for GIC would follow on the heels of GIC Real Estate's acquisition of a 47-storey, 974,251 sq ft international Grade A office tower in Jakarta's Central Business District for an undisclosed sum.\n\nAn earlier report had put the Jakarta deal at around US$350 million.\n\nThe building is part of a mixed-use project by Greenland Rajawali Utama, which is majority-controlled by the Rajawali Group and its property subsidiary.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a very potent trend that may affect the industry in the medium to long run and the group is hopeful that the government will study this carefully,\" said CDL's executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng.\n\nHe also touched on private housing unit oversupply concerns and highlighted that the property cooling measures are beginning to bite.\n\nThe group has remained more conservative in tendering for land this year. Instead, it has has been focusing on developing its overseas growth engines.\n\nA segmental breakdown of profit before income tax (including share of after-tax profit of associates and jointly controlled entities) showed that profit from property development rose to $88.9 million in Q3 2013 from $76.5 million in Q3 2012.\n\nHowever, pre-tax profit from hotel operations fell to $49.3 million from $55.7 million.\n\nProfit from rental properties at $32.2 million was less than half the $71.2 million in the year-earlier quarter. The decrease was due to lower gains booked on the disposal of non-core investment properties; in Q3 2013, gains were recognised on the sale of only one strata floor in GB Building while in the year-earlier quarter, profit was recognised on disposal of several strata units in Citimac Industrial Complex, Elite Industrial Building II, GB Building and Pantech Business Hub.\n\nGroup revenue dipped 1.2 per cent year on year to $822.7 million in Q3 2013.\n\nEarnings per share fell to 13.3 cents in Q3 2013 from 14.8 cents in Q3 2012. Net asset value per share rose to $8.36 as at end-September 2013 from $8.03 as at end-December 2012. The counter closed one cent higher at $10.08 yesterday. CDL released its results after trading hours.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2013, revenue fell 3.2 per cent year on year to $2.4 billion, though net profit rose 7.7 per cent to $462 million. Pre-tax profit from property development fell to $241.8 million for the first nine months from $273.7 million previously. Notwithstanding the good take-up rate for residential sales launched by the group this year, it was unable to recognise profits as construction of these projects has yet to begin or reach recognition stage. Examples include Echelon, Bartley Ridge, D'Nest and Jewel @ Buangkok.\n\nThere was also no profit recognition for three executive condominium (EC) projects, two of which are fully sold (The Rainforest and Blossom Residences) and one substantially sold (Lush Acres), until completion of construction, in accordance with prevailing accounting treatment. However, nine-month pre-tax profits from rental properties nearly doubled to $252 million from $135.1 million. Profit from hotel operations slipped to $130.3 million from $166.5 million.\n\nIn London, subject to planning approval, the group intends to develop a luxury residential project on a prime, multi-storey car park site at 28 Pavillion Road in Knightsbridge that it bought in September. Located in close proximity to Harrods, the freehold site cost the group \u00a380 million (S$159 million).\n\n\"Though buying land in a rising market in London remains challenging, the group is actively pursuing a few other projects for strategic acquisitions. It is confident that it will be able to secure a few more sites in due course,\" CDL said.\n\nIn China, assuming favourable market conditions, sales will begin next year at Eling Residences in Chongqing and the residential component of Hong Leong City Center in Jinji Lake in Suzhou. Sales in the residential component of the Huang Huayuan project, also in Chongqing, will probably start in 2015.\n\nAt home, the group will monitor the market and not rush into the launch of South Beach Residences. The project remains on track to complete in 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But soon, the process may be as simple as logging on to a website. In an effort to change the way the notoriously secretive industry finds investors, several startups are pitching online matchmaking services to the world's biggest private equity players. The task is daunting. Ever since the industry found its footing in the 1980s, private equity firms have relied on placement agents - essentially, middlemen - to find investors and raise billions of dollars for buyout funds, collecting large fees. The placement agents have become a powerful force, controlling access to the top funds.\n\nStartup companies are eager to capture a share of the business by connecting investors directly to funds. The efforts come soon after a rule change that took effect in September, when the Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed an 80-year-old ban on advertising by private funds.\n\nNow hedge funds and venture capital and private equity funds can let the public know they are looking for money, though they are still allowed to accept money only from those who are financially suited for such alternative investments.\n\nThese sectors have been a bit slow in taking advantage of the new rule, which stems from the Jump-Start Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. One small firm in New York, FF Venture Capital, announced in October that it was raising a fund, seeking US$50 million, but it was the only such firm to do so.\n\n\"No fund manager is going to want to put something on the Goodyear Blimp or billboards,\" said Jeff Berman, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance. \"They are looking for highly sophisticated investors who value discretion - and people who have the wherewithal to honour the commitments they make.\"\n\nMany of the matchmaking services are so new that potential client firms have not had a chance to see how effective they are. Several of the entrepreneurs in the matchmaking game are working with traditional placement agents, rather than in direct competition with them.\n\nOne of these startups, iCapital Network, which is planning to release a private test version to certain clients this month, has backing from some top placement agents, including Eaton Partners and a group at Credit Suisse. For a subscription of US$12,000 to US$100,000 a year, private equity firms will be able to list confidential information about their funds on the platform - including marketing documents and performance data - for prospective investors to browse.\n\nThe Credit Suisse group, which has helped raise more than US$400 billion for clients since its founding in 1994, has a 30 per cent stake in iCapital, said Dan Vene, the firm's chief executive.\n\n\"We can't replicate the 70 people working the phones for you,\" said Mr Vene, who formerly worked at Eaton Partners and the investment firm Fir Tree Partners. \"But what we can do is come up with innovative ways to tell your story.\"\n\nAnd with the rapid growth of private equity, there could be plenty of opportunities. As of January, 1,949 private equity funds globally were seeking capital from investors, compared with 1,845 the previous year, according to data from Preqin, a financial information provider.\n\nAs these services grow, they could bring potential new clients to private equity, said Michael Harrell, co-chairman of the private equity group at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.\n\n\"These online platforms could reach out and pool all kinds of individual investors to invest in private equity funds that historically wouldn't have bothered with large numbers of small investors,\" Mr Harrell said.\n\nThe sites say they vet investors to make sure they are \"accredited\", by the SEC's definition, to remove a potential chore for the private equity firms. But even if individual investors meet the definition of accredited - with a net worth of more than US$1 million or annual income above US$200,000 - private equity still might not be appropriate for them, said J Robert Brown Jr, a professor at the University of Denver's law school.\n\n\"They use dollar amounts as a substitute for sophistication,\" said Prof Brown, who serves as secretary of the SEC's investor advisory committee, a group created under the Dodd-Frank overhaul. \"There will be firms out there that are less than reputable that use this as a way of sweeping in funds from people that are not particularly sophisticated.\"\n\nCompanies that serve the private equity industry see online matchmaking as lucrative. Even Preqin, based in London, sees potential in the sector. It has signed up more than 100 fund managers and more than 3,000 institutional investors for a platform that started in a test version this month, charging the managers a subscription fee but providing complementary access to investors, according to Tim Friedman, who oversees the firm's US operations.\n\nAnother service, Palico, with offices in London, Paris and New York, has been operational since May 2012, with about 1,300 members. Big sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, including the California Public Employees' Retirement System, use the platform to find private equity opportunities they might otherwise have overlooked.\n\nThe trick for firms in the budding sector may be to distinguish themselves from placement agents without alienating them. Though iCapital works closely with placement agents, it is also planning a placement agent service of its own - for smaller investors, Mr Vene said. Those investors would be too small to fall under the purview of a large placement agent, he said.\n\n\"This doesn't cannibalize our core business. I think it can be additive,\" said John Robertshaw, co-head of the private fund group at Credit Suisse, which is invested in iCapital. \"It's going to create, we think, significantly more efficiencies.\"\n\nPalico, too, emphasises that it offers a different service. \"At the end of the day,\" said Antoine Dr\u00e9an, the company's founder, \"Palico is more like a dating service.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Operating expenses rose 16 per cent or $0.95 million but administrative expenses fell 20 per cent or $0.62 million.\n\nDepreciation expense had fallen as certain machinery, equipment and marine lifestock were fully depreciated. A stronger yuan against the Sing dollar also boosted results.\n\nThe company is also involved in the bidding of a project, which it did not name, paying $21.2 million in a deposit. This boosted other current assets to $21.8 million.\n\nThe deposit payment, an investing outflow, cancelled out net operating cashflow of $20.7 million for the period. Cash and equivalents at end-September thus stood at $101.1 million, almost unchanged from a quarter ago. This translates to 12 cents a share.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/would-could-should-fn-default", "site_title": "Would, could, should F&N default?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWould, could, should F&N default?\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFRASER and Neave's (F&N) alleged threats of voluntary default will come into focus this week as the company meets shareholders and bondholders to discuss its plans to list its property arm.\n\nBondholders are up in arms over what they feel is a deeply unfair attack on their rights, while minority shareholders wonder what all of this actually means for the business.\n\nWhat those stakeholders have to do, however, is to look beyond the moralising and focus on more fundamental questions: What will it cost F&N to default, and what will F&N gain if it does so?\n\nAnd F&N on its part can afford to be more transparent.\n\nF&N shareholders meet today to vote on the planned splitting of the business into the Frasers Centrepoint (FCL) property unit and F&N, which will retain the beverage and publishing businesses. Given that Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi now controls north of 90 per cent of the company following his successful takeover of the company earlier in the year, approval for the split is already assured. But a number of minority shareholders have told The Business Times that they still have important questions about the split.\n\nAt the top of the list is the ongoing negotiations with bondholders. Simply splitting F&N's businesses will trigger a technical default on about $808.25 million of the company's outstanding bond issues, so F&N is offering bondholders a deal in exchange for the required waivers and the right to buy back the bonds.\n\nThe problem is that what F&N is offering holders of its 6 per cent and 5.5 per cent bonds is below market value - about 103 per cent of par offered compared with 109 per cent of par on the market - so bondholders of those notes are understandably unhappy with the offer.\n\nBut what has really gotten the pitchforks out is that F&N has allegedly told bondholders that if they do not accept the deal, the company will go ahead with the FCL listing anyway and trigger a default, in which case bondholders will only receive par, which is an even worse deal.\n\nThe reason why F&N's alleged stance is unusual and particularly hard to swallow for noteholders is that F&N is still solvent. A number of news reports this week said that some noteholders have raised the issue with regulators.\n\nBondholders and minority shareholders want to know whether F&N is really prepared to strategically default. Equity holders, in particular, also want to know what a strategic default will mean for the company, because while bondholders only have to deal with the default itself, shareholders have to deal with the aftermath as well.\n\nMinority shareholders at today's extraordinary general meeting therefore need to find answers from management. What will a strategic default mean for F&N, especially with regard to the company's other obligations? Will there be accelerations to contend with? Existing deals rendered invalid?\n\nOn the flip side, what will separating the property and beverage businesses mean for F&N? With F&N's ownership of Myanmar Brewery now at the centre of a separate dispute, does that change the dynamics of the business?\n\nSome of those questions have been asked, but F&N has largely kept mum about the details. Even taking into account tactical reasons for limited disclosures, minority shareholders deserve better transparency to help them understand what is truly at stake, and whether they want to stay in. The point of the questions is to try and figure out whether listing FCL despite a strategic default is worth the costs for F&N.\n\nAnd costs there will be. The reason why strategic defaults are so rarely used is because they are often not worth the trouble.\n\nSome of the costs are more immediate, in the form of cross defaults and other accelerated obligations. Strategic defaults can also have longer-term implications, putting off future creditors and making capital more difficult to access.\n\nA study by scholars at the London Business School in 2007 found that credit spreads tend to be wider - by as much as 20 basis points in extreme cases - for borrowers when the threat of a strategic default is higher. This is something to bear in mind especially when FCL, being a property developer, will probably have to continue to tap capital markets in the future.\n\nBondholders and shareholders should resist the temptation to cast the issue in ethical or moral terms, because defaulting is fundamentally a critical loss-limiting tool.\n\nAnd strategic defaults are just that - strategic calculations of cost versus benefits. Trying to moralise the debate also tends to blur the bigger picture. Would a strategic default hurt bondholders? Perhaps, but perhaps doing so leads to the best outcome for equity holders. Whose interests come first?\n\nStrategic defaults are also not an invention of F&N. During and after the global financial crisis, the United States witnessed a wave of strategic defaults by homeowners as home values tumbled to a point where it no longer made sense to keep paying mortgages. More recently, commodity traders, such as Noble Group and Olam International, struggled with cotton growers and traders who chose to default because cotton prices had fallen to the point where it did not make sense to meet obligations.\n\nIn all of those cases, strategic defaulters calculated that the benefits of default justified its high price. Stakeholders of F&N this week have to solve that equation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the period from listing - Oct 19, 2012, to March 31, 2014 - RHT intends to distribute all of its distributable income.\n\nProviding a portfolio update, RHT said its 13 clinical establishments maintained an average occupancy rate of 86 per cent, compared with the previous quarter's 78 per cent.\n\nThe trust also completed its expansion works in the clinical establishments of Jaipur, Kolkata and Rajajinagar. In May, the launch of Gurgaon contributed to the increase in bed capacity of 551 in the RHT portfolio.\n\nSeparately, the two operating hospitals continued their strong performance; Nagarbhavi and Rajajinagar outperformed its projects, due to higher occupancy rates and operating margins.\n\nFor the quarter under review, RHT registered a net service fee and hospital income of $15.4 million, lower than its projection of $16.5 million. Revenue for the quarter was $26.5 million, a touch lower than its projection of $27.4 million.\n\nGurpreet Dhillon, chief executive officer of RHT TM, said: \"Our policy to hedge for forthcoming distributions has helped protect us against the volatility of the Indian rupee in the recent months. We will continue our efforts to expand our yield-accretive asset base, and look to enhance our existing income-generating portfolio through both acquisitions within India's growing healthcare market and additions of beds and facilities.\"\n\nRHT said it continued to maintain a positive outlook on the largely defensive healthcare sector in India.

Other Blackstone funds own a company hauling fuel between US ports.\n\nThe nation's highest oil and gas production in more than three decades is enticing investors to ships hauling processed fuels because the US bans most crude exports. Demand for the carriers is accelerating at a time when most of the maritime industry is slumping.\n\nMr Fredriksen, the richest shipping investor, is building his biggest-ever fleet. Mr Ross, founder of WL Ross & Co, took control of an LPG carrier in October 2012, about a year after investing in product tankers.\n\n\"They have all seen that shipping has been dragged through the mud,\" said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo, whose recommendations returned 24 per cent in the past year. \"What's going on in US energy makes companies that can export fuels, gas and even chemicals among the industry's more attractive investments.\"\n\nThe boom in US energy production is lowering feedstock prices for refineries, allowing them to ramp up exports of petroleum products to destinations including China, Brazil, Venezuela and Nigeria.\n\n\"The sudden boom in US product exports has been very attractive to investors who have a lot of cash to invest and are looking for assets that will give them returns,\" said Nikhil Jain, an analyst at Drewry Shipping Consultants in New Delhi. \"This is a market that is able to offer much better prospects compared to other markets in shipping.\"\n\nWhile US fuel cargo exports are accelerating, ship owners also need Europe's economy to return to growth. The continent accounts for about 31 per cent of all seaborne oil-product imports and the 20.8 million tonnes of LPG shipments that it would buy this year equate to about 47 per cent of all cargoes.\n\nThe economy of the 17-nation euro area contracted for seven consecutive quarters through September, official data and the mean of 29 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed before third-quarter figures due on Nov 14.\n\nBlackstone is a shareholder of Hafnia Tankers, a Hellerup, Denmark-based shipowner that sold equity in a private placement last month. Other investors include Barclays Natural Resources and Tufton Oceanic, a hedge fund group and private equity firm.\n\nThe largest crude carriers earned US$8,558 a day. Running costs for the ships, including crew and repairs, came to US$10,350 last year, according to Moore Stephens, a UK accountant that tracks industry expenses. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The group has 11 properties spread across China, Japan, Australia and Singapore.\n\nThe higher NPI, together with a lower depreciation and amortisation, helped push profit before tax to $8.1 million, 140.6 per cent higher than forecast.\n\nBut distributable income was hit by higher tax costs, a result of the group generating taxable income in Australia earlier than expected.\n\nFor the half year, distributable income also missed the mark at $25.5 million, 6.6 per cent lower than expected. A-HTrust attributed this to the worse-than-expected operating performance of its hotels, as well as higher tax costs stemming from its Australian properties.\n\nThe DPS for this period was 2.47 cents.\n\n\"It remains a challenge to meet the IPO forecast for FY2013/2014,\" the group said, citing the different economic and foreign exchange environments from when it made the initial predictions.\n\nWhile upbeat on China, Japan and Singapore, A-HTrust expects the performance of its Australian hotels to \"remain subdued\" with the economy set to stay soft.\n\nGearing stood at 35.8 per cent as at end-September, while net asset value was 76 cents.\n\nThe counter closed 0.7 per cent lower at 76.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We will do Singapore proud and we will also keep our shareholders happy,\" he said.\n\nOCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien added that the bank's other sporting commitments such as the annual OCBC Cycle Singapore and the Great Eastern Women's Run would continue as planned.\n\nAs expected, the naming rights to the National Stadium were not included as part of the package in line with the desire to preserve its identity as a Singapore icon.\n\nThe government also revealed yesterday for the first time that the Singapore Indoor Stadium, too, would not be named after a commercial entity for the same reasons.\n\nActing Culture, Community and Youth Minister Lawrence Wong, who was present at the signing ceremony, let on that either stadium could possibly be named after a prominent personality in future in order to commemorate him or her.\n\nThe practice of naming sports facilities is new in Singapore, although many major markets around the world, such as the United States, have been doing so for years.\n\nIn July this year, the Texas-based telecommunications firm AT&T reportedly agreed to pay as much as US$19 million per year to rename the Dallas Cowboys football team's stadium as the AT&T Stadium.\n\nLast year, Emirates Airlines extended its partnership with Arsenal that ensured the English Premier League club's home will be known as the Emirates Stadium all the way until 2028.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will then be up to local government officials to enact the new policy guidelines.\n\nThe statement declared that \"decisive results\" will be achieved by 2020.\n\nExpectations were high for the Plenum, which comes at a time when China is struggling with debt, low productivity, overcapacity and slower growth. After 30 years of double-digit growth, the country is under domestic pressure to shift to a more sustainable model with consumption playing a bigger role.\n\nFor the past year the new President, Xi Jinping, and his Premier, Li Keqiang, have been adamant about the need to reform. This implies dismantling the country's huge state monopolies, granting rights to its millions of migrant workers uprooted from their original home, pushing ahead with the reform of land ownership and letting the market play its role.\n\nThese measures should unleash savings, increase productivity and give bigger spending power to the country's millions of farmers and migrant workers, many of them left out of three decades of growth.\n\nThird plenums have traditionally been used to launch major economic reforms. It was during such a meeting that Deng Xiaoping set China on its \"opening up and reform\" policy. Ahead of the meeting, senior officials including Xi Jinping had said the scope of reform would be unprecedented.\n\nAnalysts will not be looking for big announcements from the plenum, but more for a change of vocabulary and a general reform agenda that will point to the party's commitment to change.\n\nIn previous policy statements, the Communist Party had often described markets as playing a \"basic\" role in allocating resources. In contrast, yesterday's statement pointed to a \"decisive\" role.\n\nMost analysts expect reform policies to first focus on a greater role of markets in the financial sector, including the convertibility of the exchange rate and liberalisation of interest rates and a change in governance of public finances, before the government tackles the sensitive issues of state-owned enterprises and land rights.\n\nThe party said in the statement that while it would encourage private enterprise, the dominance of the \"public sector\" in the economy would be maintained. Many of heads of the SOEs are high party members who were present at the Plenum.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Delta is seeking a yield of 6.9 per cent, compared with 7.5 per cent for its bank loans, she said. That would narrow the gap with South Africa's second-biggest real estate company, Redefine Properties Ltd, which sold 425 million rand of similar-maturity notes at 6.5 per cent in March.\n\nOffice demand from state-owned companies including utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd and Transnet SOC Ltd, the ports and rail operator, will help Delta grow faster than South Africa's gross domestic product, forecast to expand 2.1 per cent this year, Ms Corbett said. Government leases extending until at least 2018 accounted for 64 per cent of revenue for the six months ended August, she said.\n\n\"The 6.9 per cent is achievable,\" Geoff Noble, a portfolio manager at Grindrod Asset Management, who plans to buy Delta bonds, said in an e-mailed response to questions on Nov 6. \"Delta does have a long lease-expiry profile underpinned by government leases, which should assist them in achieving their target rate.\"\n\nDelta had utilised 91 per cent of 2.18 billion rand in existing bank facilities and commercial paper at the end of August, according to an Oct 29 earnings statement. A 180 million rand loan with Nedbank Group Ltd maturing in 2017 carries a fixed rate of 7.55 per cent, the company said.\n\nOut of 271,447 square metres of gross lettable area that Delta owns and manages in South Africa, 55 per cent is leased as office space to the government, the company said in the earnings statement. The average rent paid by the state was 72 per cent higher than by retail clients.\n\nThe company's growth prospects remain on track amid curbs in state spending because the government still needs office space, according to Ms Corbett. The company's fully-black ownership allows it more government opportunities than some competitors because of South Africa's black economic empowerment polices, she said.\n\nThe rand has declined 18 per cent against the US dollar this year, making it the worst performer among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on benchmark government bonds due December 2026 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.31 per cent.\n\nWhile Delta is betting on growth led by long-term government state leases, Redefine is reducing exposure in the area as it restructures its property portfolio. The Johannesburg-based company plans to spin off its 2.2 billion rand government tenant unit into a separate listing in February, according to a statement to reporters on Oct 31.\n\nDelta had assets valued at 4.8 billion rand at the end of August, compared with the 24 billion rand property portfolio value of Redefine. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

If it doesn't, it will give Alitalia and the government the possibility to find an international partner,\" he said in Milan on the sidelines of a motorcycle trade show.\n\nThe comment betrayed tensions over the negotiations between the airlines.\n\nAir France-KLM, which holds a 25 per cent stake in the Italian airline, is being urged to join shareholders in injecting more funds as part of a 300 million euro (S$502 million) recapitalisation plan.\n\nThe Franco-Dutch airline reportedly responded a week ago by telling Mr Lupi it could do so - but only if Alitalia axed 5,000 jobs, ousted its board of directors and came up with a debt restructuring plan.\n\nHowever, Air France-KLM has previously denied making any conditions over job losses.\n\nThe restructuring conditions have made Alitalia and the Italian government bristle.\n\nMr Lupi pushed back on Sunday by saying that, if Air France-KLM \"decides to dilute to 6 per cent\" its stake by not taking part in the recapitalisation, \"I think Alitalia, as a private company, will be forced to find other partners\".\n\nThe Italian airline is handicapped, however, by 1.2 billion euros in debt and Italy's determination to keep it a flag-carrier.\n\nAlitalia was already bailed out by taxpayers five years ago in a controversial operation that handed a consortium of private Italian companies a majority stake, part of which was later sold to Air France-KLM.\n\nThe still-struggling Italian airline is again flirting with bankruptcy, prompting the hasty recapitalisation plan. Italian energy group ENI has threatened to ground its fleet of planes by stopping fuel supplies because of unpaid debts.\n\nAlitalia says Italian banks are lined up to lend it 200 million euros. And the state-owned Italian postal service has been tapped to contribute up to 75 million euros, triggering rivals' allegations of illegal protectionism. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Finance costs rose 27.5 per cent to $3.9 million due to convertible bonds and interest expenses on the bond issued in Q2.\n\nRevenue dipped 3.6 per cent to $52 million, hit by lower contribution from its engineering business, the membrane-based water treatment firm said yesterday.\n\nThis was partly offset by higher revenue from the recurring water treatment business, which jumped 56.6 per cent to $15.5 million, reflecting contributions from its new treatment plants and increasing utilisation rates of its existing plants.\n\nFirst-half net profit fell 7.9 per cent to $12.9 million, despite an 11.7 per cent increase in revenue to $96 million.\n\nUpbeat about the outlook of China's water treatment market, UEL chairman and CEO Lin Yucheng said: \"We shall continue to concentrate our efforts to drive growth in this segment, particularly in securing more industrial waste-water treatment projects in China.\"\n\nThis fiscal year, UEL clinched three investment projects worth 491 million yuan (S$99.7 million) plus another 90 million yuan project to upgrade an industrial waste-water treatment plant in Jiangsu province, China.\n\nOCBC Investment Research analyst Carey Wong said the firm now has enough debt financing to acquire up to $205 million worth of water treatment plants.\n\nIt is now looking at viable transfer-operate-transfer projects in municipalities and textile-related industrial parks, and is tendering for some engineering projects worth up to 800 million yuan.\n\nMr Wong maintained a \"hold\" on the stock at 83 cents fair value, down from 97.5 cents earlier, citing persistent expenses, but he said UEL's margins should improve on more recurring treatment revenue.\n\nThe counter closed unchanged at 87 cents yesterday, after the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

According to data from Dealogic, about 68 per cent, or US$3.27 billion, of the US$4.84 billion raised by the 25 listings on SGX so far this year were accounted for by Reits and business trusts.\n\nThis amount is more than twice the last peak in deal value in 2010, when three Reits and business trusts raised US$1.51 billion.\n\nFor now, Reits and business trusts will continue to feature strongly in the pipeline of upcoming IPOs, according to those that BT spoke to.\n\n\"I see a continuing trend of Reits and business trusts in Singapore,\" said Max Loh, EY Asean and Singapore managing partner. \"Reits and business trusts have always had an advantage in terms of transparent rules, and corporates are increasingly looking to monetise their assets.\"\n\nFollowing the rally in stock markets after the deferment of QE tapering in the US surprised many, a window in the IPO market has opened.\n\n\"The postponement of QE tapering has created a window of opportunity for companies to tap liquidity in the market,\" said OCBC head of corporate finance Tay Toh Sin. \"Investor sentiment, while still cautious, has veered towards being more positive, and this is more apparent in Asian markets which have shown greater stability.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve's QE tapering is now widely expected to take place after March next year instead, giving confidence to many that the current window for IPOs will remain open until then.\n\nThe window is likely to be exploited not just by Reits and business trusts. Market players say the Singapore IPO market remains healthy, although things may slow towards the year-end.\n\nAlready, a few more companies have come to the market.\n\nFigtree Holdings, which designs and builds commercial and industrial facilities, raised $12 million in a fully placed share sale. It made its trading on Catalist yesterday. Offshore oil and gas service provider Pacific Radiance, which hopes to raise net proceeds of $150.6 million, will make its debut tomorrow.\n\nFraser and Neave's (F&N) property arm, Frasers Centrepoint Ltd (FCL), will also be listing by way of introduction, meaning that neither F&N nor FCL will receive cash proceeds. No date has been set yet, though it is expected to take place in either November or December.\n\nInvestors can also expect more companies in the oil and gas and offshore marine sectors to come onto the market, said DBS managing director and head of capital markets in Singapore, Tan Jeh Wuan.\n\n\"A number of these IPOs have decent offering sizes in excess of $200 million,\" he said.\n\nStill, with only one more month to go before the market quietens down for the holiday season, investors craning their necks for more IPOs might have to wait till next year.\n\n\"We remain positive on the outlook for Singapore's IPO market into 2014,\" said Ashok Pandit, Deutsche Bank head of equity capital market in Asia.\n\n\"For the remainder of this year, however, if the deal's not in the market, it's too late now to get the transaction done.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the consumer, they will still have to choose between one of the two networks, so the service that the consumer buys will still not be diversified,\" said Dr Yaacob.\n\nThe minister also said that IDA would implement a new audit framework for mobile operators by the second half of next year.\n\nThe scope of the audit would cover the network design, technical processes, business continuity planning and infrastructure and facilities to support the mobile network.\n\nBased on IDA's findings into the cause of the SingTel fire, the government will review if further policy measures are needed, Dr Yaacob added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This would suggest The Arcade's owners stand to pocket around $800 million.\n\nProperty group City Developments owns nearly 47,500 sq ft of space in the building, according to its annual report. This translates to slightly more than 30 per cent of the building's total strata area of about 157,300 sq ft and 30-plus per cent of share value, making it the biggest owner.\n\nBT understands that owners controlling at least 80 per cent of share value and strata area in the property have consented to The Arcade's collective sale, but verification of one or two signatures is pending. Once this is settled, a tender for the collective sale can be launched.\n\nThe Arcade is on a site with land tenure of 999 years starting April 1826, but some owners have only 99-year leasehold interest (starting October 1979) on their units. CDL, which holds the reversionary interest on the 99-year leasehold title of such units, has agreed to sign off for The Arcade to be sold on 999-year tenure for the 99-year units whose owners agree to the collective sale.\n\nCompleted 32 years ago, The Arcade has significant redevelopment potential. Its existing gross floor area is said to reflect a plot ratio of about 8.0 - significantly lower than the maximum 13.86 allowed for the site under Master Plan 2008, inclusive of bonus plot ratio for the site's proximity to Raffles Place MRT Station. The site is zoned for commercial use.\n\nWhile The Arcade is a rare 999 year-leasehold commercial site in the Raffles Place financial district available for sale, one drawback is the site's small area and narrow configuration.\n\nHowever, if Singapore Land, the owner of Clifford Centre next door, were to buy The Arcade, it could potentially amalgamate the two sites to form a more substantial site for redevelopment.\n\nColliers International is understood to be the marketing agent for The Arcade's collective sale.\n\nThe Arcade's collective sale may also draw potential investors who may not be looking at immediate redevelopment of the property. There is potential to trade the existing strata retail units, which are mostly tiny and can hence fetch high prices of several thousand dollars per square foot.\n\nThe first three levels of the 20-storey building house retail units and offices start from the fifth level. The Arcade has 51 basement car park lots.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This included a $37 million gain on disposal of investments that mainly arose from utilities' gain on its 20 per cent equity interest sold through the IPO of Sembcorp Salalah Power and Water Company in 3QFY13; and almost $80 million primarily due to utilities' fair-value gain on re-measurement of its remaining 40 per cent equity interest in Salalah after the IPO.\n\nMarine's net profit for the quarter was also higher, rising 12 per cent to $78.6 million. This was mainly due to higher operating profit and foreign exchange gain, partially offset by lower contribution from associates and joint ventures.\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, net profit grew 8.8 per cent to $596.7 million from $548.6 million for the same period in 2012. The group's turnover for the January-September 2013 period increased 6.1 per cent to $7.8 billion from $7.4 billion last year.\n\nSembcorp's main profit contributors for these nine months continued to be its utilities and marine businesses, which contributed 59 per cent and 35 per cent of group net profit respectively.\n\nSembcorp's share price closed at $5.32 yesterday, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/hk-homebuyers-hit-tighter-mortgages", "site_title": "HK homebuyers hit by tighter mortgages", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHK homebuyers hit by tighter mortgages\n\nBuyers of high-end apartments are the hardest hit\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Nov 11, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[HONG KONG] Hong Kong businessman Raymond Chiu says that he has perfect credit and is prepared to spend about HK$16 million (S$2.6 million) on a 1,000-square-foot apartment in the city's Mid-Levels residential area. There's just one catch. The government requires a 50 per cent down payment.\n\nThat's \"really putting us off\", said Mr Chiu, 45, who owns an information technology consulting company. \"I run a business so cash flow is important. It's frustrating because this is non-negotiable, though I have perfect credit history.\"\n\nPrices of high-end apartments, defined as those larger than 1,000 square feet or costing at least HK$10 million, have gained less than the broader market since the second half of 2012 as buyers in Mr Chiu's price bracket have been hardest hit after the government raised minimum down payments six times over less than three years as part of curbs to make homes more affordable.\n\nThe slowing price growth in high-end apartments is the first sign that efforts to temper rampant speculation that has fuelled a surging housing market are working even as it stings luxury developers and potential homebuyers.\n\nBroker Cushman & Wakefield Inc forecasts that prices of homes valued at more than HK$10 million will fall about 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, extending a 3 per cent drop so far this year, while those selling for less will be little changed.\n\n\"The luxury segment has taken the first and the most direct hit,\" said Buggle Lau, chief analyst at Midland Holdings Ltd, Hong Kong's biggest realtor by branch numbers. \"The measures were aimed at driving the speculators away and they have certainly achieved that, but many people wanting to buy for their own use are also affected.\"\n\nAn influx of wealthy buyers from mainland China, mortgage rates close to record lows and a financial-services sector that has thrived thanks to fundraising by Chinese companies helped fuel a 250 per cent increase in luxury-home prices from 2003 to the beginning of 2012, outpacing the 150 per cent gain in mass-market homes, according to statistics compiled by Savills plc. The London-based broker defines luxury homes as those with at least 1,000 square feet (93 square metres) or value of at least HK$15 million.\n\nHong Kong home prices are the world's highest in a Savills survey of 10 cities, including London, New York and Tokyo. The value of luxury properties will drop as much as 5 per cent in the second half after a 3.2 per cent decline in the first three months of the year, according to Savills. Prices in the mass market will see no change after increasing 1.7 per cent in the first six months, the broker said.\n\nSun Hung Kai Properties Ltd, a developer of luxury residential projects, plans to build more, smaller apartments because of a change in buyers' appetites, Victor Lui, the company's deputy managing director, said in September. The company, one of Hong Kong's two-biggest developers by market value, reported lower profit from sales for the year ended in June.\n\nThere were about 86,000 luxury homes - or units of at least 100 square metres - in Hong Kong at the end of last year, according to statistics from the government. That represents about 7.7 per cent of private homes in the city. About 24 per cent of the 10,149 new homes completed by developers last year were larger than 100 square metres, government statistics show.\n\nThe gap between the top end of the market and the cheaper bracket narrowed last year as the government's mortgage tightening started to impact the luxury segment. Prices of mass-market homes rose 20 per cent last year, almost double that of luxury homes, according to Savills.\n\nPrices of luxury homes began to decline after the government in October 2012 slapped a 15 per cent tax on all non-resident buyers as it sought to stem the inflow of Chinese capital into the property market.\n\n\"For a while, Chinese buyers were the main driver for luxury homes,\" said Thomas Lam, Hong Kong-based research director at broker Knight Frank LLP. \"When you raise buying costs for them, of course it takes away a large part of the demand.\"\n\nMainland Chinese buyers accounted for an estimated 8 per cent of private home sales in the city, a former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, in the third quarter of this year, down from a record 25 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Centaline Property Agency Ltd.\n\nSince October 2010, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de-facto central bank, has raised the minimum down payment required for home purchases over HK$10 million to as much as 60 per cent from 30 per cent, and to 50 per cent for those from HK$7 million to HK$10 million. The most recent round took place in February.\n\nThat month, the government doubled stamp-duty taxes for all properties over HK$2 million, with new tax rates ranging from 1.5 per cent for properties valued below HK$2 million, to 8.5 per cent for those priced above HK$21.7 million.\n\n\"The extra stamp duties and mortgage rules are like progressive taxes,\" said Vincent Cheung, Hong Kong-based national director of valuation at Cushman & Wakefield.\n\n\"The higher the property value, the higher the tax rates and the tighter the mortgage rules. Of course this would impact luxury properties the most.\"\n\nHong Kong's government won't cut back property curbs until there's a \"steady supply\" of new housing, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said in June.\n\nThere were 607 sales of homes worth over HK$12 million in the third quarter, according to statistics compiled by Centaline. The number is the lowest since the first quarter of 2009, according to the Hong Kong-based realtor.\n\n\"The curbs have frozen transactions,\" said Knight Frank's Mr Lam. \"The drop in prices we're seeing is actually taken from a very small sample. I'd be very cautious about calling this a down market for now.\"\n\nThe average mortgage rate in Hong Kong was about 2.17 per cent in September, compared with about 3 per cent at the end of 2008, according to mReferral Mortgage Services.\n\nMr Chiu, the business owner, who now rents an 800-square-foot apartment in the middle-class Tsim Sha Tsui district on the Kowloon peninsula, wants to move to Mid-Levels because his daughter attends a high school in the area of high-rises halfway between the Central business district and Victoria Peak.\n\nA 1,000-square-foot unit in Mid-Levels would cost about HK$15.9 million on average, according to data from Midland.\n\nAs legacies of Hong Kong's colonial past, the city's most expensive residential areas, including The Peak and Island South, are on Hong Kong Island, one of the city's three main regions and home to its financial district, government headquarters and residences of senior government officials.\n\nOn a hillside below The Peak, where global banks and companies such as HSBC Holdings plc house their top executives, Swire Properties Ltd last year sold a unit in a Frank Gehry-designed building for HK$455 million, a record for Hong Kong.\n\nIsland South, where sea-front mansions stretch along the coastline, is home to many of the city's billionaires, including Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man, and New World Development Co's former chairman Cheng Yu-tung.\n\nPrices in the established luxury areas, such as The Peak and Mid-Levels, are facing less pressure compared with \"the newer luxury districts\", said Antonio Wu, head of investment at brokers Colliers International, referring to areas in Kowloon and further north of the city.\n\n\"The old money is there and they usually have stronger holding power. If you cross the harbour, you'll see more drastic price cuts because you have more supply and more speculators.\"\n\nOne such area is Kowloon West, where apartment projects adorned with extravagant club houses and Olympic-size swimming pools were built over the past decade as the city's tallest building, International Commerce Centre, went up and lured investment banks, including Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG, away from Central.\n\nThe ICC, completed in 2010, sits atop Kowloon Station, which helps connect the city's international airport to the Central business district. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Never before have investors in the US$530 billion market for Danish mortgage bonds faced government intervention in securities funding existing loans, according to the Danish Mortgage Bankers' Federation.\n\nThe government in Copenhagen now needs to convince European regulators the new maturity profile satisfies stable funding rules intended to protect against market freezes. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), which deems funding shorter than 12 months as unstable for commercial banks, says that the EU should accept the new mortgage bonds.\n\nDenmark is waiting for a response from Brussels as lawmakers, led by Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager, say they're willing to do whatever it takes to save the world's biggest mortgage market per capita.\n\n\"The Danish FSA's position in the future EU development of the Net Stable Funding Ratio is that the new one-year mortgage bonds should be considered as stable funding,\" Kristian Vie Madsen, the FSA's deputy director general, said on Friday.\n\nStandard & Poor's, which warned in July that a failure to reduce issuance of one-year bonds could lead to downgrades, said that it is looking at the proposal. Moody's Investors Service, which has also criticised Denmark's short-term mortgage bonds for introducing refinancing risks, is analysing the proposal, it said last week. Investors still need time to decide what the changes mean, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\n\"We are evaluating this development,\" said Kristion Mierau, senior vice-president for portfolio management at the Munich office of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund.\n\nWithout European approval, banks in Denmark will have to slash sales of mortgages with rates that are reset annually. The one-year bonds make up about 40 per cent of the market, comprising the single biggest category of mortgages.\n\nThe FSA may still limit use of the extended maturity one-year bonds when it introduces new guidelines for mortgage bond issuance, recommended earlier this year by a government-appointed committee examining the roots of Denmark's financial crisis. Mr Madsen at the FSA said that the Copenhagen-based agency will unveil its recommendations in the first half of next year.\n\n\"We fear there will be a run on one-year bonds, and that's why we're emphasising that it's still important to have a focus\" on the volume, said Karsten Beltoft, head of the Mortgage Bankers' Federation. The greater the volume of one-year bonds, the more likely it is that the maturity option would have to be exercised, he said.\n\nThough banks had tried to wean borrowers off one-year funding, households resisted those efforts after rates in AAA- rated Denmark sank to record lows. That helped cushion the blow to homeowners of a 20 per cent slump in property prices since their 2007 peak.\n\nYields on one-year mortgage bonds may be as low as 0.55 per cent in auctions this month to refinance loans with a Jan 1 interest reset date, according to Christian Heinig, chief economist at Realkredit Danmark A/S.\n\n\"The FSA will fight for the new one-year constructions as being compliant,\" said Soeren Holm, chief financial officer for Copenhagen-based Nykredit Realkredit A/S, Europe's largest issuer of covered bonds backed by home loans.\n\n\"This really eliminates the refinancing risk and reduces the interest rate risk for the customer,\" Mr Holm said. \"We expected it to be at a reasonable price, five to 10 basis points.\"\n\nEuropean banks are required to ensure by January 2016 they have diverse, stable funding for long-term obligations, according to rules approved by the European parliament earlier this year. A binding minimum standard will be set in 2018.\n\nBusiness Minister Henrik Sass Larsen said last week that the government was forced to push through its proposal, which still needs to be approved by parliament, after industry measures to comply with stable funding rules proved inadequate.\n\n\"The problem was that these various proposals didn't remove the risk altogether, and that's what the government now seeks to do,\" Mr Larsen said.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, an auction failure or interest rate increase of more than five percentage points would trigger conversion of one-year, three-year and five-year mortgage bonds, including index-linked notes, into callable, fixed-rate bonds with a maturity matching the underlying loans. That can be as long as 30 years, minus the maturity of the original loan. Yields would be set at the coupon plus five percentage points.\n\n\"It will always be our job to make sure mortgage finance remains as we know it,\" Ms Vestager told reporters last week.\n\nThe battle for the bonds won't be the first for Denmark, whose mortgage market is more than three times the size of its government debt market. Ms Vestager said in February that the government will \"do whatever it takes to guard it\" after regulators suggested the securities didn't qualify as highly liquid assets. The government ended up winning that fight and now expects the bonds' top liquidity status to be confirmed by the end of the year.\n\n\"Both the Danish government and the members of parliament and the authorities have been very successful and very keen on fighting the battle for the mortgage system,\" Ane Arnth Jensen, head of the Association of Danish Mortgage Banks, said.\n\n\"I hope that we will win this battle as well.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The attack was about 34 miles west of Singapore, according to the co-ordinates recorded by the agency.\n\nThe US Energy Information Administration (EIA) identifies the Malacca Strait, which connects the Indian Ocean with the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean, as one of the world's two \"most strategic chokepoints\" for oil trade along with the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf.\n\nIt is the shortest sea route between the Middle East and Asia with about 15.2 million barrels of oil a day transported along the waterway in 2011, according to the EIA. About 90 per cent of that was crude.\n\nA fishing vessel was the only ship to be hijacked in the Strait of Malacca in all of last year, according to the IMB's website.\n\nTwo Kuala Lumpur-based officials from the organisation were not available for comment when contacted by phone and e-mail yesterday.\n\nThe incident follows the hijacking of an oil-products tanker off Malaysia's Pulau Aur in the South China Sea on Oct 10, about 67 miles northeast of Singapore. Pirates stole the ship's cargo before abandoning it on Oct 15, the IMB's website shows.\n\nThe Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia reported that a vessel called the Danai 4, carrying marine gasoil from Singapore to Vietnam, lost contact with its owners in the area on Oct 10, according to an alert on its website.\n\nThere have been 206 reported incidents of piracy worldwide this year, including 11 hijackings, data from the IMB showed. The number of attacks fell globally to 188 in the nine months to September from 233 for the same period last year. The number of armed robbery attacks on vessels in Indonesia is rising, the IMB said on its website on Oct 17. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Yet it is ironical that in a serious overcapacity situation, some are holding up the potential cost savings from a fleet of new mega container ships that NOL is adding to its fleet as the answer to its earnings woes.\n\nNOL's group CEO Ng Yat Chung described Q3 as \"one of its weakest peak seasons\" the group has seen \"in recent years\". It reported a 60 per cent fall in Q3 net profit to US$20 million on the back of lower freight rates and volume. While the group saw a turnaround to a nine-month net profit of US$61 million (from a loss of US$321 million previously), most of that came from the sale of its flagship NOL Building that netted a gain of US$200 million. NOL also said it expected volatile freight rates and overcapacity to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, seven out of 10 analysts had to cut their FY 2013 full-year earnings forecasts for NOL following the results, and most maintained their \"sell\" or \"underperform\" rating on the company.\n\nBut a fair amount of optimism remained. Macquarie Equities Research for one reiterated its \"outperform\" rating and said \"despite a weaker rate environment, NOL's underlying operating performance had continued to improve due to lower bunker consumption and other cost-saving programmes\".\n\nAlso positive were the likes of JP Morgan and UOB Kay Hian. And the general consensus, even amid the \"sell\" and \"hold\" calls, was that while the shipping group will make an estimated net loss of US$113 million this year, it would see a turnaround to a net profit of US$136 million in FY 2014 and an even more optimistic US$361 million in FY 2015.\n\nA lot of this optimism has to do with big ships.\n\nAs part of its fleet renewal programme, NOL has seen some 14 new and larger vessels delivered this year, with six in the 14,000-TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) category, six in the 9,000-TEU category and two in the 8,100-TEU category. These have replaced seven older and smaller ships, which were sold or scrapped, while another four charter ships were returned.\n\nWith their bigger capacity, the ultra-large container vessels are expected to reduce operating costs per container and help improve market share. This is sorely needed given that average revenue per container unit remains on the decline.\n\n\"We see further cost-savings for 2014 when an additional 10 ultra-large vessels are due to be delivered,\" Macquarie said in a report on Oct 30.\n\nNOL's first 14,000-TEU ship, APL Temasek, was delivered on March 25 this year, following 10 new 10,000-TEU ships which joined the fleet between 2011 and 2012. By the end of next year, the shipping group will have a total of 10 14,000 TEU ships. The mega ships form part of NOL's US$4 billion fleet renewal programme to improve the group's slot costs, as older less-efficient ships are sold or returned to charter owners.\n\nThe big ships do bring some benefits. With its newer, larger and more fuel-efficient ships, NOL has managed cost of sales per TEU down by 7 per cent year on year, while bunker consumption has dropped 15 per cent. Another positive is that five out of the 10 14,000-TEU vessels to be delivered between 2013 and 2014 have already been chartered out to Japan's Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL).\n\nHowever, there is a flip side which investors should not ignore.\n\nOne implication is insurance costs. While big ships are touted as being more environmentally friendly due to their fuel efficiency, the sheer size of these vessels may make them more unwieldy and dangerous in extremely bad weather. The dramatic sinking on June 17 this year of the container ship MOL Comfort at a youthful eight years (the 8,110-TEU container vessel was built in 2005) topped the news and pictures of the ship breaking into two and being swallowed by waves would probably still send chills down any marine insurer's spine. MOL has since pulled out MOL Comfort's sister ships from the same route to strengthen their hulls and ship structures.\n\nBut the most serious issue is excess capacity. The likes of sea-freight forwarder Kuehne & Nagel have criticised the move to mega ships as aggravating the overcapacity that is crippling the sector.\n\nNew orders for mega containerships are being placed at a fast clip, with an estimated 100 newbuilding contracts for container ships of over 8,000 TEUs placed this year alone. Most of these orders have been placed at Chinese and South Korean shipyards, which are offering relatively low prices to fill empty slots. New energy-saving designs, such as the 18,000-TEU ships using liquid natural gas as fuel offered by South Korean yards, have also attracted big shipping groups such as APM-Maersk.\n\nNOL unit APL has outstanding new orders of some 83,200 TEUs, or 13 per cent of its current fleet. This pales in comparison with top-ranked players such as APM-Maersk, whose new orders totalling 292,320 TEUs form 11 per cent of its existing fleet, with Mediterranean Shipping Company's new orders of a hefty 457,029 TEUs forming 19.3 per cent of its fleet. CMA group's new orders account for 13 per cent of its current fleet, while at Taiwan's Evergreen Line, new orders for big ships make up 31 per cent of its existing fleet.\n\nThe consequences are worrying. As the shipping groups continue to out-order and out-build each other, an industry recovery looks more remote, and the unwillingness of major liners to hold back new orders, let alone cut capacity by scrapping and idling ships to address falling rates, could mean even more pain ahead.\n\nUltimately, what this suggests is that NOL's expected turnaround may be weighed down by the very ships which are expected to give it a lift.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Inflation is close to its Q1 highs once again, while pressures on demand and cash flow are up again, ending a full year of improvement.\n\n\"Late payment symptoms, usually more of a problem elsewhere in the world, have reached Singapore. Meanwhile, growth capital has also become less accessible, after supply peaked in early 2013.\n\n\"This is not a trend unique to Singapore but one quite common to the wider region. Neighbouring Malaysia has also seen confidence drop off and businesses are seeing a number of challenges, while a deepening credit crunch in China could have implications for Asia Pacific in general.\"\n\nNegatively tinged perceptions of the broader economy hovered at the same levels of the preceding quarter; 55 per cent of finance professionals surveyed here believe the economy is deteriorating or stagnating, while 35 per cent believe it is improving or about to do so.\n\n\"That perception has not changed significantly since the second quarter of 2013,\" said Leong Soo Yee, head of ACCA Singapore.\n\nDespite the challenging environment, business capacity building continued to recover for a third quarter in a row, having bottomed out in late 2012.\n\n\"This trend, however, may be driven by new restrictions placed on foreign labour and the need for new hires. If that is the case, the boost to overall business capacity may be small and short-lived,\" ACCA and IMA said in their report.\n\nOn a global level, GECS showed the best economic sentiment since the survey began in 2009, marking the first time that the number of optimists have outnumbered the pessimists.\n\nHowever, Q3's good news was \"disproportionately weighted towards Europe\", as the continent showed improved perceptions of a broader economic recovery.\n\nFieldwork for the Q3 instalment of GECS was carried out between Aug 15 and Sept 4, and drew 2,021 responses from ACCA and IMA members around the world, including 154 from chief financial officers.\n\nThe survey was sent out to 7,000 finance professionals in Singapore; 44 of these responded.\n\nSaid the report: \"Fieldwork was concluded before the US government shutdown of October 2013 could become a significant concern.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The increase was due to higher sales volume for both manufactured steel products and vanadium products.\n\nGross profit, however, fell by $1.2 million to $2.6 million, as gross profits margins slipped to 4.6 per cent in Q3 2013, from 11.7 per cent the year before.\n\nIt posted a net loss of 6.45 cents per share for the third quarter, compared to the 0.45 cent loss per share recorded last year.\n\nIn its statement, the group said that it had on Oct 30 issued a profit warning to its shareholders that the level of steelmaking overcapacity remains, while the steel industry is destocking and steel prices are falling. Given that the overall outlook for the industry remains weak, the group told shareholders that it had expected its third-quarter results to be weaker than that reported in the previous quarter, as a result of lower operating margins and additional assets impairment.\n\nThe six-month average steel price for this year has fallen by as much as 21.5 per cent compared to the 12-month average price for 2011, and by 7.3 per cent when compared to last year, the company said.\n\nThe weak market conditions in the steelmaking industry resulted in Sapphire reducing factory capacity plans for various business segments by 30 to 55 per cent, which led to lower utilisation rates and longer investment recovery for the company's plant and equipment. It therefore decided to rationalise its assets and recorded an impairment charge of $57.7 million for the quarter.\n\nSapphire shares closed 0.1 cent down at 10.4 cents on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investment in exploration and production may rise to US$750 billion next year as companies seek to add reserves and expand output, the IFP Energies Nouvelles policy group said last month.\n\nVard, based in Alesund, Norway, won contracts worth 11.9 billion kroner (S$2.4 billion) in the first nine months, 45 per cent more than a year earlier. That boosted its total orderbook to 19.6 billion kroner with deliveries stretching into 2017. In 2007, the company had received orders worth 15.5 billion kroner.\n\nShares of Vard were unchanged at S$0.845 in Singapore on Nov 8. The stock has declined 35 per cent this year, compared with a 0.3 per cent gain in the benchmark Straits Times Index.\n\nThe company's third-quarter net income slumped 67 per cent from a year earlier because of increased costs at its two yards in Brazil. Sales dropped to 2.37 billion kroner in the period.\n\nThe Brazilian yards lost money because the quality of some of the work done by their suppliers fell short of expectations and caused production delays, Mr Dilling said in the Nov 8 interview.\n\n\"We are now scaling back the degree at which we use other parties to supply major sections of a ship. At one time, we had an ambition to grow on the back of such supplier relationships. That assumption didn't go through.\"\n\nThe yards in Brazil are expected to become profitable as early as the second half of 2014 as they reach a \"higher level of utilisation\", he said.\n\nThe facilities have an orderbook worth six billion kroner to build 14 vessels, including eight liquefied petroleum gas carriers and two pipe lay support vessels.\n\nThe company changed its name to Vard from STX OSV Holdings this year after Fincantieri SpA bought it from South Korea's debt-ridden STX Group for 455 million euros (S$761 million). - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In restaurant-speak, that's a euphemism for cheapskate but I beg to differ. I like to think of myself as the conduit for a fascinating, real-life study on human behaviour that's played out every day between 12 and 2pm at any restaurant in Singapore that you care to pick. That is, the psychological game between the set-luncher and the chef: where the former tries to get as much as he can for as little money as possible, while the latter conspires to give as little as he can without bursting the former's bubble or his profit margin.\n\nWhen you've had your fair share of $25 bento sets with sliced watermelon for dessert, or $28 salad and pasta combos with a smidgen of cake to end, it should pretty much dawn on you to give up and shell out for a la carte if you want a real meal.\n\nA three-course set lunch for under $30 is a tough challenge in these inflationary times - but when you're genetically hardwired to seek out a good deal, restaurants can't help but comply or lose out to the competition.\n\nOn the flip-side, there are restaurants that offer the kind of set lunch value that makes you wonder what kind of financial wizardry the chef is cooking up to make money from what he offers, as is the case at the newly re-opened La Strada.\n\nEconomies of scale derived from being part of the Les Amis group may well have helped chef Joon Kian Pow deliver quantity and quality at this cosy Italian trattoria that takes over from the defunct Annam restaurant. Or his experience in the kitchens of both Les Amis and Au Jardin have come in handy when infusing humble ingredients with fine-dining flair.\n\nEither way, La Strada's $28 set lunches hold their own appeal, especially with generous starters such as sauteed mushrooms and spinach topped with a soft cooked egg and shavings of Spanish ham, or squid pieces simply pan-fried with olives and finished with lemon. While a pasta main course of penne in tomato sauce is ordinary, it gets a luxe topping of good-sized grilled tiger prawns.\n\nAlternatively, opt for a juicy roasted half chicken with roasted potatoes and cherry tomatoes. To end off, the wedges of chocolate flourless cake or pine nut tart with scoops of ice cream are baked with pride and in generous servings too.\n\nThat doesn't mean you bypass the rest of the menu, because it's worth exploring the plethora of trattoria-style a la carte items. Tender char-grilled octopus chunks and potatoes do full justice to its Spanish origins, while crabmeat sauteed in white wine is swirled around homemade pasta that's a gold standard for mee pok with its perfect \"rubber band\" chewiness.\n\nCheck out, too, the blackboard specials such as a melt-in-the-mouth char-grilled fresh porcini mushroom ($20) covered with Spanish ham (but sadly the season is over). A creamy butternut squash risotto ($26) with grilled tiger prawns doesn't quite hit the spot with its porridgy-texture and fresh but bland prawns, while burnt edges on skinny baby back ribs ($26) mar the otherwise mellow barbecue sauce that doesn't overwhelm you like the artificial smoke and ketchup pervasiveness of Tony Roma et al.\n\nFall back instead on the salt-baked Italian seabass ($75) - it may seem pricey at first glance until you realise that it serves two, not to mention that it's imported chilled and is fresh enough to get away with just a light dressing of olive oil to enhance the fine-textured flesh.\n\nWhile it's got its pricing strategy right, La Strada needs to flesh out the trattoria concept better if it wants to break the perception that Italian restaurants can only be authentic with an Italian in the kitchen.

The governor said, based on their estimate, 10,000 died,\" Mr Soria said. \"The devastation is so big.\"\n\nWitnesses and officials described chaotic scenes in Leyte's capital, Tacloban, a coastal city of 220,000 about 580 km south-east of Manila, with hundreds of bodies piled on the sides of roads and pinned under wrecked houses.\n\nThe city and nearby villages as far as one kilometre from shore were flooded by the storm surge, leaving floating bodies and roads choked with debris from fallen trees, tangled power lines and flattened homes. TV footage showed children clinging to rooftops for their lives.\n\n\"From a helicopter, you can see the extent of devastation. From the shore and moving a kilometre inland, there are no structures standing. It was like a tsunami,\" said Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas, who had been in Tacloban since before the typhoon struck the city.\n\nMila Ward, an Australian citizen and Filipino by birth who was in Leyte on vacation visiting her family, said she saw hundreds of bodies on the streets.\n\n\"They were covered with blankets, plastic. There were children and women,\" she said.\n\nLooters rampaged through several stores in Tacloban, witnesses said, taking whatever they could find as rescuers'efforts to deliver food and water were hampered by severed roads and communications.\n\n\"They are taking everything, even appliances like TV sets. These will be traded later on for food,\" said Tecson John Lim, the Tacloban city administrator.\n\n\"We don't have enough manpower. We have 2,000 employees but only about 100 are reporting for work. Everyone is attending to their families.\"\n\nMr Lim said city officials had so far only collected 300-400 bodies, but believed the death toll in the city alone could be 10,000.\n\nInternational aid agencies said relief efforts in the Philippines are stretched thin after a 7.2 magnitude quake in central Bohol province last month and displacement caused by a conflict with Muslim rebels in southern Zamboanga province.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it was airlifting 40 tonnes of high energy biscuits, enough to feed 120,000 people for a day, as well as emergency supplies and telecommunications equipment.\n\nTacloban city airport was all but destroyed as seawaters swept through the city, shattering the glass of the airport tower, levelling the terminal and overturning nearby vehicles.\n\nA Reuters reporter saw five bodies inside a chapel near the airport, placed on pews.\n\nAirport manager Efren Nagrama, 47, said water levels rose up to four metres.\n\n\"It was like a tsunami. We escaped through the windows and I held on to a pole for about an hour as rain, seawater and wind swept through the airport,\" he said. \"Some of my staff survived by clinging to trees. I prayed hard all throughout until the water subsided.\"\n\nPope Francis yesterday asked Catholics to provide \"concrete help\" to the hundreds of thousands of people made homeless by the typhoon. More than 60,000 people joined the Pope in his own prayer for the victims during his traditional Sunday mass in St Peter's Square, a day after he had tweeted his solidarity with the Catholic Asian nation.\n\n\"Sadly, there are many, many victims and the damage is huge,\" the Pope said, speaking from a third-floor window of the papal palace. \"Let's try to provide concrete help.\"\n\nMeanwhile, six people were killed and dozens wounded during heavy winds and storms in central Vietnam as Haiyan approached the coast, state media reported, even though it had weakened substantially since hitting the Philippines with winds gusts of up to 275 kph.\n\nVietnam authorities have moved 883,000 people in 11 central provinces to safe zones, according to the government's website.\n\nDespite weakening, the storm is likely to cause heavy rains, flooding, strong winds and mudslides as it makes its way north in the South China Sea. - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

For instance, diesel prices went up by about 90 per cent, while national average wages have gone up by about 30 per cent over the same period.\"\n\nBut some groups still need help, hence the two new concession schemes - one for people with disabilities and the other for low-income workers - which the government will fund, and enhancements to existing concession schemes, which will be borne by commuters. This, according to the minister, is because the FRMC wanted to maintain a \"balance\".\n\nThe exact amount of discounts for the disabled and low-income workers has not been decided yet but the intention is to \"ensure that the discounts given will more than offset any fare increase in the next fare exercise\".\n\nAbout half a million Singaporeans will be eligible for these two new schemes, raising the number of commuters who currently enjoy various fare concessions from 1.2 million to about 1.7 million.\n\nAs for feedback that the issue of service quality was missing from the FRMC report, and that fare increases should be suspended until service levels improve, Mr Lui said that the committee decided that the issue of service level is best addressed separately outside of the fare formula, where the government can regulate and work with the operators to improve service levels.\n\nBut that does not mean service levels are not being raised or that PTOs are getting off lightly. He pointed to efforts to improve the availability and quality of public transport, such as the 20 per cent addition of 800 buses, the extra 100 trains over the next three years and the doubling of the rail network to 360 km over the next 20 years.\n\nOperating Performance Standards are also being raised, with higher penalties and a stricter regulatory framework.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With better information on hand, customers can proactively manage their financial processes and avoid unnecessary penalties for late payments, for example, said Anita Loh, Singapore head of product management for Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions.\n\nCitibank also recognises the need to give senior executives the ability to have a quick overview of the company's financials and reports, as well as the ability to authorise decisions such as fund transfers, while on the move. These are the reasons why it created CitiDirect BE Mobile, which is available on all major smartphone platforms such as iOS, Android and BlackBerry, she said.\n\nThis is also why the mobile app does not come with analytics capabilities - as executives tend not to need that function, she explained.\n\nThe tablet application, similarly, will cater to C-suite executives to make prompt, critical business decisions based on information delivered in easily digestible dashboards and visualisations. It is still in development, however, and will only be available early next year.\n\nMs Loh said that the entire CitiDirect BE platform - Web portal, mobile, tablet and analytics - will first be unveiled in Singapore to local customers, before gradually being introduced to other markets worldwide. Individual components, such as CitiDirect BE Mobile for example, are already available in other markets.\n\nIn terms of the IT investments made, Ms Loh said that the company spent \"tens of millions of dollars per year\" to revamp the existing tech backend. This was for the infrastructure, man hours spent on development and the procurment of licences from partnering tech vendors.\n\nThe existing infrastructure was not \"dumped\", but the new tech introduced was \"wrapped around\" to expand capabilities such as mobile access and real-time analytics, she added.\n\nGiven the extensive investments made for the online banking platform, Ms Loh said that Citibank will eventually charge for the new services introduced. The analytics function, for example, will be free for the first six months to early adopters before charges are levied.\n\nHowever, she could not share the pricing range. It will depend on the individual customer's needs, she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was largely due to lower contribution from its Waterview condominium project, which is fully sold and is now in the later stage of construction.\n\nNoting the effects of past rounds of property cooling measures and the latest curbs on loans announced by Monetary Authority of Singapore in June, Sim Lian said it expects the operating conditions for the private residential property market to become increasingly challenging.\n\n\"The group remains committed to seeking strategic investment opportunities for its continued growth and is focused on building a stable base of recurring income to smoothen its fluctuating development profits,\" it added. It expects to remain profitable in FY2014.\n\nFor Q1, Sim Lian's property development division contributed $107.1 million to group revenue, a 30 per cent fall from last year. Its construction arm contributed $36.8 million, a 22 per cent rise from a year ago. The firm said the higher revenue contribution was due mainly to an increase in percentage of work done compared with last year.\n\nSim Lian's shares fell 1.7 per cent yesterday to close at 86 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Southwest also is in discussions with the Justice Department about adding slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport, one person said.\n\nHaving a market for the slots would clear a possible hurdle as AMR Corp's American, US Airways and the Justice Department explore resolving the antitrust lawsuit filed on Aug 13 to block the merger. A post-merger American would have an unacceptably high 69 per cent of Reagan National flights, the US says.\n\nFor Southwest and JetBlue, the Justice Department's insistence on AMR-US Airways asset sales as a condition to approve a merger creates an opportunity to expand at Reagan National, the only one of Washington's three major airports with federal flight limits.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder said on Nov 4 that divestitures would be required at crucial airports across the US as part of \"any resolution in this case\". If settlement talks don't succeed, the US is prepared to go to trial on Nov 25, he said.\n\nGina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether the department is in discussions with Southwest and JetBlue about slot divestitures.\n\nAmerican declined to comment, said Michael Trevino, a spokesman. Ed Stewart, a spokesman for Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways at Fleishman Hillard Inc, Southwest's Beth Harbin and Jenny Dervin at JetBlue also said that they had no comment.\n\nA merger between American, the third-largest US airline, and No 5 US Airways would create the world's biggest carrier by traffic. Dallas-based Southwest is the largest discount airline and is now in the fourth spot in the US industry, while New York-based JetBlue is in sixth place.\n\nThe Southwest-JetBlue discussions with regulators build on the interest in Reagan National slots expressed publicly by the carriers in the months since Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR and US Airways announced plans to merge on Feb 14.\n\nSouthwest chief executive officer Gary Kelly said on an Oct 24 conference call that he was \"absolutely\" interested in more Reagan National access and \"more slots at LaGuardia as well\". \"I'm reasonably confident that there will be slots that become available and then I am assuming that there will be an opportunity to bid,\" Mr Kelly said. \"So if there is that opportunity, we'll certainly take advantage of the bidding\".\n\nJetBlue wrote to US Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, in March to demand that \"a significant number\" of slots be divested at Reagan National. CEO Dave Barger said in September that American should have to cede the equivalent of all its current flights there, which would leave the merged airline with the 55 per cent market share held by US Airways. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In the first phase, AVA and BCA will relocate to Jem in 2014,\" said an MND spokesman.\n\n\"MND HQ would move in due course, taking into account the market conditions and the pace of developments to relocate other ministries to Jurong Lake District. This will create eventually a strategic cluster of associated ministries at Jurong Lake District.\"\n\nIn 2010, the government said that, besides MND, AVA and BCA, there were also plans for the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources to move to Jurong East.\n\nThe following year, MND revealed that it had inked a 30-year lease for the office tower of Lend Lease's mixed development next to the Jurong East MRT Station, where it, along with BCA and AVA, would move to.\n\nNow, the ministry is seeking to appoint a panel of leasing agents to sublet around 70,000 sq ft comprising three of the 11 levels of office space in Jem, BT understands. The asking monthly rent is said to be around $6.50 per square foot (psf).\n\nMND's spokesman said: \"The Jurong Lake District is one of the key regional growth areas identified by the Singapore government. To help catalyse the development of this new growth region, MND signed a 30-year lease at Jem with the developer, Lend Lease, in 2011. MND also worked to help Lend Lease to design an award-winning green office building.\n\n\"Flexibility was provided for in the lease arrangement so that MND can better manage the stages and timing of its use of the office spaces. This included sub-leasing to other interested tenants.\"\n\nFollowing AVA and BCA's move to Jurong, the vacated space at Maxwell Road will be made available to interested tenants for their short-term lease.\n\nJem's retail component opened in June this year. The buzz quotient around Jurong East MRT Station is set to increase next month, when CapitaLand group opens the mall at its Westgate project. Located next to Jem, Westgate also has an office tower, which is slated for completion late next year.\n\nTalk in the market is that leasing efforts for the 20-storey Westgate Tower, comprising 320,000 sq ft net lettable area of offices, have been put on hold.\n\nCapitaLand is said to have initially planned to find a bulk buyer for an enbloc sale of a huge chunk, if not all, of the office space at a target price of around $2,200 psf. However, it is now open to selling strata units, probably on a whole-floor basis, suggest sources. \"A price of $2,200 psf is more likely to be achieved on a strata basis rather than for en-bloc basis,\" said a seasoned investment sales agent.\n\nIn the past six months, office units at Paya Lebar Square were sold at prices ranging from $1,732 psf (for a 484-sq ft space on the eighth floor) to $2,427 psf (for a 506 sq ft unit on the 13th floor), based on caveats data. \"Paya Lebar is closer to the city, compared with Jurong East. But Jurong East is much more advanced in terms of shaping up as a regional centre than Paya Lebar,\" said the agent.\n\nLast month, 10,097 sq ft on the 41st level of Suntec Tower Three was transacted at $3,000 psf. The building is on a site with balance lease term of about 75 years.\n\n\"Those who buy office units in the Jurong East location may be in businesses that don't require them to travel in and out of the city. For instance, an office in Jurong East may be complementary to their industrial activity in the western part of Singapore,\" said the agent.\n\nFrom an investment angle, buying a strata office in Jurong East may also appeal to those who want to invest in the Jurong regional centre story without being affected by the cooling measures that have been slapped on the residential and industrial property sectors, say market watchers.\n\nAnother source of office supply in the Jurong East locale will emanate from Sim Lian's project on Venture Avenue. In September, Sim Lian bagged the Urban Redevelopment Authority's provisional permission to develop about 625,500 sq ft gross floor area of offices and 69,500 sq ft of retail space on its site. Word on the street is that Sim Lian is looking to strata-title the office component for sale, with a launch expected in the first half next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/wongpartnership-ties-malaysian-firm", "site_title": "WongPartnership ties up with Malaysian firm", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWongPartnership ties up with Malaysian firm\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Nov 11, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Big Four local law firm WongPartnership (WongP) has tied up with Malaysian boutique corporate law practice Foong & Partners (FoongP), building on a decades-long informal working relationship to capitalise on business opportunities across the Causeway.\n\nThe firms have termed the tie-up a \"strategic alliance\", which will see them working almost exclusively with each other on deals as far as their geographical and professional expertise allows. This means that if WongP has a client who wishes to invest in Malaysia, FoongP will be the firm it uses for that portion of the deal and vice versa.\n\n\"This tie-up was driven mostly by the fact that a lot of the work we do today (corporate transactions in Singapore) tends to have a Malaysian component - whether it be an IPO (initial public offering), M&A (mergers and acquisitions) or private equity (PE) deal - because the target may have a business in Malaysia, or the clients may be interested in looking at something in Malaysia, and so on,\" WongP's joint managing partner, Ng Wai King, told The Business Times in an exclusive interview.\n\nMr Ng said that WongP has been collaborating with Malaysian lawyers on such transactions, including the Temasek Holdings and Khazanah Nasional Berhad joint development in Singapore, the IHH Healthcare Berhad IPO and the Khazanah/Fortis competing takeover offer for Parkway Holdings.\n\n\"We find that the need to work and collaborate with strong Malaysian lawyers has become more important now than ever before. Finding the right Malaysian lawyer with the right expertise is very important.\n\n\"We have worked alongside FoongP on a number of transactions, including Tune Ins Holdings Bhd's recent initial public offering, and we found a shared ethos of delivering unstinting high-quality service to our clients,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nFoong Chee Meng, managing partner of FoongP, which focuses on high-end corporate commercial, capital markets and corporate finance work, added: \"There are a lot of Malaysian clients who are expanding, looking to invest not just in Singapore, but in the UK and Australia, and they're very aggressive in their expansion. I find that, in most cases, I've had to help them and also refer foreign law firms to them. I've gone through quite a number of foreign law firms as well and I've always enjoyed working with WongP. It makes sense to work a lot closer than before, to have a formal association, whereby we give each other the attention, the priority and the preference.\n\n\"Instead of just saying to a client, 'Look, I think that law firm is good', I can now say, with a lot of confidence and assurance, that they will get the best service (with WongP). And, if there are any issues, I can just pick up the phone, and so can Wai King; we can call each other and resolve any issues.\"\n\nFoongP's Malaysian clients can also tap WongP's expertise in China, the Middle East and the rest of Asean, where the firm has offices.\n\nBoth partners said that deals in this part of the world are increasingly cross-Asean transactions - suggesting that law firms are best served by having the expertise, or access to expertise, in these markets.\n\nThe main focus for them at this point, however, will be Malaysia.\n\nSaid Mr Ng: \"Our PE clients would love to do more in Singapore, but Singapore as an economy is more mature - and so, high-profile PE buyout deals are getting harder to do here.\n\n\"When the PE clients start looking in the region outside Singapore, they find that Malaysia has a better set of regulations and a better regulatory framework compared to some other countries in the region. The certainty of execution and familiarity of regulations make it easier for PE clients to consider the opportunities in Malaysia.\"\n\nMr Foong added: \"I see a lot of business opportunities and funding issues, which I see Singapore and PE funds fitting wonderfully into; there are still a lot of opportunities in Malaysia that are perhaps not known to a lot of people in Singapore or anywhere else.\n\n\"In terms of funding, in Malaysia, it seems to be concentrated in the hands of a few big banks. Clearly, there's a lot of space for mezzanine funding or even PE funding to come into play. It's just a case of putting the two parties together, making sure that each other's interests are taken care of and all the risks are mitigated. And I don't see anyone doing that at the moment, probably because everyone's busy in their own backyard.\"\n\nAs to why WongP chose to go with a boutique practice rather than a full-service firm, Mr Ng said that the decision depended on the firm knowing and trusting the people it worked with.\n\n\"There was a consensus among the partnership that this is the right thing to do. (It's important to) make sure you can trust that the work gets done by the right people, that the clients are happy with the product, and that the lawyers themselves are the people you want to work with,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/tis-season-not-see-declines", "site_title": "'Tis the season not to see declines", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\n'Tis the season not to see declines\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nA STRONG jobs report on Friday lifted the major stock indices within a hair's breadth of record highs last week, and now US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke is the only potential spoiler to the stock market's best year since 1997.\n\nWhile pundits warn of more budget scares early next year, the latest bull run has too much momentum and seasonal advantages to bet against in the short term. It will soon be time for fund managers to begin \"window dressing\" end-of-year statements by loading up on this year's winners, and for workers to allocate retirement investments for 2014.\n\n\"The closer we get to December, the louder history sings 'Tis the season not to see declines',\" said Sam Stovall, strategist for Standard & Poor's Capital IQ, in a note to clients. \"So, while history says a correction is due, it doesn't say whether it will be on time. As a result, investors will likely get to enjoy their holiday festivities before fretting over the post-New Year fireworks.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Labour Department reported that US employers added 204,000 workers to payrolls in October - far more than the 120,000 economists had forecast.\n\nThe stronger data may have increased the odds of a December \"taper\" from the Federal Reserve. For now, however, the positive implications for a consumer-based economy at peak shopping season trump the likelihood of a reduction in stimulus, which everyone knew was coming within six months anyway.\n\nMarket psychology is also coming into play. Investors are finally shaking off the stock aversion that entered the collective psyche during the portfolio-bruising days of the 2008 financial crisis. For four years, even as economic and earnings reports generally exceeded expectations, steady bond mutual funds drew more money than rising equity funds in the last five years.\n\nThis year, stocks have come back with a bang.\n\nAccording to research firm TrimTabs, investors have added US$277 billion to stock mutual and exchange-traded funds so far this year, the most since 2000. That's largely because rate cutting and quantitative easing by central banks around the world have shrunk bond yields to meagre levels, leaving workers and pension funds little choice but to buy stocks for retirement funds.\n\nThe monetary stimulus kept coming last week when the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut rates, citing growth jitters in the European Union.\n\nThe stock gains kept coming, too. Even a big dip on Thursday did not scare investors away for long. The Standard & Poor's 500 is now up nearly 25 per cent so far in 2013, on pace for its largest annual gain since the 31 per cent advance in 1997 - one of the best years in the more-than-50-year history of the broad gauge.\n\nThere was another echo of the Dotcom boom last week. Twitter Inc's stockmarket debut was one of the strongest of any major company since the financial crisis.\n\nThe micro-blogging service sold roughly US$2.1 billion worth of stock in its initial public offering, and then saw its price almost double on its first day of trading. That was in stark contrast to rival Facebook, which saw its value drop on its debut.\n\nOnce again, the bull market is taking on a life of its own as television and Internet news outlets buzz with reports of tech investors striking gold and indices breaking record after record. Even after the rush into stock funds, many investors and fund managers have less of their portfolios in stocks than they had during the last bull market.\n\n\"The problem for most people is not that they own too much, it's that they're under-invested right now,\" said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. In market psychology, people can \"panic buy\" when they cannot bear to miss out on a rally any longer, just as they \"panic sell\" when they cannot stand to lose any more money.\n\nNor is technology the only sector driving the gains. Last week, two of the strongest groups were bank stocks and commodity stocks.\n\nBoth groups had fallen out of favour during the autumn, as the outlook darkened for the housing market and international demand for raw materials. Now, traders are betting the strong jobs report heralds a new up-shift in US economic growth, a bounty for the economically sensitive areas.\n\nSurveys of industrial production this week will reveal whether that bet is warranted.\n\nEconomic and corporate-earnings growth in the third quarter was relatively modest. The US Commerce Department reported a 2.8 per cent GDP increase.\n\nProfits grew by an aggregate of 4.5per cent for the vast majority of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, according to Barclays Wealth & Investment Management.\n\nThis week, several Fed speakers, including Mr Bernanke, may drop hints on the outlook for QE in light of the slightly stronger economic data of late. Barring departure from their usually cryptic script, the central bankers are unlikely to dampen the new enthusiasm for stocks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those voices on the board can be good for it,\" she said.\n\nShe sits on the boards of insurance giant AXA and Asian Civilisations Museum, among others.\n\nIn order to strengthen board effectiveness and truly drive business value, advisers should be prepared to speak up when they disagree on the board's course of action, and to push for changes, said Richard Emerton, managing partner of the board and chief executive of Services at Korn/Ferry.\n\n\"It's also important for the advice to be received in the right way by the board,\" he added.\n\nThe SIAS conference panel also weighed in on the search for suitable boardroom candidates.\n\nSingTel chairman Simon Israel said a board should first establish the needs of the organisation, and then go about defining the profile of an ideal candidate for the position.\n\n\"It's important to cast as wide a net as possible. Relying on internal networks is insufficient in such a situation,\" he said.\n\nThe entire board should then collectively determine whether the new candidate is the right \"fit' with the needs of the board and organisation, while recognising the challenges around diversity.\n\nFellow panellist Fiona Shand of law firm Shand & Associates said Australia still had a long battle to fight against \"unconscious bias\", despite having a relatively high standard of corporate governance practice.\n\n\"There's still a fear factor - of the unknown, the untested and the untried,\" she said. \"There's a fear that different means bad.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Boeing has said that barring a \"yes\" vote on the contract, it would be looking at other potential locations.\n\nIndustry observers say Washington faces competition from states including South Carolina, where Boeing assembles some of its 787 Dreamliners, as well as Texas and Utah.\n\nJapan, whose heavy industry builds wings for the Dreamliner, is seen as a contender to build the wings for the 777X, the longest wings designed for a Boeing jetliner.\n\nThe tax measure passed the Washington state Senate by a vote of 42-2 last Saturday.

Hong Kong is moving in this direction, which raises the ante in terms of competition as a domicile for funds.\n\nPwC expects to release a White Paper on a proposed Singapore investment fund framework in December.\n\nJustin Ong, PwC Singapore asset management leader, said the current legal structures available for investment funds - such as the unit trust, limited partnership or private company - all have limitations for fund management firms.\n\nAt the moment many firms choose to domicile their structures in the Cayman Islands, for instance, though actual fund management activities may be conducted in Singapore.\n\n\"We're talking about creating another framework, a new infrastructure to cater to the industry to provide more flexibility,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Ong said: \"To compete or even be on par with global investment centres, such as Luxembourg, Dublin and Cayman Islands, Singapore must be able to offer a variety of investment fund platforms beyond the current structures - such as open-ended companies, segregated portfolio companies and even segregated sub-funds.\"\n\nIn the executive summary of the White Paper, which it released yesterday, it proposed a framework of investment fund laws that marry the legislation that governs legal entities (partnerships, companies and trusts) with the necessary laws that govern the business of fund investments.\n\nIt is hoped that a new framework would spur more fund managers to set up operations in Singapore. Said PwC in the summary paper: \"In the bigger picture, the inevitable evolution of asset management and servicing ecosystem around such a change would contribute significantly to the economy in terms of higher employment, enhanced productivity and growth in fund flows through new product ranges created and managed in Singapore, among others.\"\n\nPwC conducted a survey in July and August this year to gather industry feedback. The consensus, it said, is that a new investment fund law \"would be deemed appropriate and would actually be required to gain more share of the global fund market\".\n\nAn example of what is needed is a variable capital structure to enable investors to enter and exit the investment vehicle \"without the current corporatised vehicle pitfall\".\n\nThere is also the need for flexibility in choosing the appropriate reporting framework to cater to the international investment community, investor and investment strategy confidentiality, as well as the ability to access tax treaty benefits.\n\nIn the current funds framework, unit trusts do not allow access to the privileges under double tax treaties. A corporate vehicle also comes with restrictive components which make it investor-unfriendly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is creating a \"nightmare\" situation for CIOs (chief information officers) in terms of securing corporate data on endpoints and networks, and tracking employees' usage of these resources.\n\nThis situation is expected to hit mainstream consciousness by 2015, says Jack Zubarev, president and general manager of cross platform business at virtualisation software vendor, Parallels.\n\nMany organisations will have a combination of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Phone, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android stacks, if not all of them, to support on their infrastructure, he noted.\n\nTo capitalise on this situation, Parallels is looking to beef up its offerings, particularly in terms of enterprise-friendly features to allow for seamless portability of data across multiple platforms.\n\nAlready, it has launched its Parallels Access for iPad - in August this year - to address the increasing use of tablets within the enterprise space. The software modifies existing Windows and Mac applications, which generally rely on mouse and keyboard for use, to make them more user-friendly on a touch interface.\n\nSo, users of Windows Office, for example, would be able to access and edit their documents on an iPad as they would on their desktops and laptops, Mr Zubarev said. One way to do this is to incorporate predictive touch for the scroll bar on the margins, so that people with slightly larger fingers will not be left exasperated by having to aim at a precise point on the thin margin to scroll up and down the document.\n\nThat said, he acknowledged that this version of Parallels Access for iPad is targeted towards \"prosumers\", or consumers who buy the software to use for work-related activities, and is not suitable for corporate use yet. He did say the company is working on producing an enterprise version of the software for the coming year, but declined to mention a release date.\n\nHe also said that the current version allows users to access their apps via its cloud network, but that this is not ideal for many enterprises that would prefer access to be over internal networks. Therefore, Parallels is currently developing the enterprise version to run apps off private clouds.\n\nThe other enterprise concerns that it hopes to address include making sure its product integrates well with internal security tools and policies, and plays well with existing mobile device management (MDM) products.\n\nIt is also looking to go beyond Apple's iOS to other mobile OSes, but Mr Zubarev declined to identify what other platforms Parallels is looking to branch out to and when these variants will be available.\n\nHe did stress that Parallels' cross platform business is not keen on replacing MDM vendors or entering the security space. Rather, he is looking to position this business unit to be known for \"seamless, good experience for users to move from one platform to another\", and not just from Windows to Mac, and vice versa.\n\n\"We are trying to make enterprise adoption easier by creating a super good experience for end users; by doing so, they can become advocates (for Parallels) within their organisations,\" he said.\n\nThe enterprise mobility market for Asia-Pacific is booming right now, and research firm IDC in March forecast that the market, excluding Japan, will reach US$6.9 billion by the end of the year. This figure represents an annual growth rate of 29 per cent, the study stated.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It currently employs some 30 data scientists worldwide, six of whom are based in the Asia-Pacific region, with three of them in Singapore.\n\nApart from the private sector, the company is also applying Big Data analytics to public-sector use in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nIt has collaborated with tax departments on fraud detection, and is working with a city council to enhance traffic control management. Using data collected from various sources, Pivotal detected which underground inductive loops - used for detecting vehicles - had broken down and has since made it possible for the council to do predictive maintenance.\n\nWith data analytics, the council also knows which buses are deviating from their prescribed routes. In addition, it is able to improve scenario planning with models that work out the time needed to traverse each road in different conditions. Very importantly, more people in the organisation can now easily visualise on Google Earth what is happening across the city, a view that used to be limited to those in the traffic control room.\n\nIn order to help organisations that are keen to harness Big Data but have neither the infrastructure nor knowhow, Pivotal recently launched an innovation centre in Singapore to get them started.\n\nPivotal also helps companies to build up their own data science expertise. In India, it worked with a conglomerate to hire and train data scientists, and built models for the customer who is now able to harness Big Data on his own.\n\nSo what are the attributes organisations should look for when hiring a data scientist?\n\nGreg Whalen, Pivotal's chief data scientist for Asia Pacific and Japan who oversees its data science practice across all industries in the region, looks for someone who has technical background and experience in Big Data and analytics in at least one or two verticals.\n\n\"Otherwise, he will look for software development expertise, as many software developers who have worked on Big Data have also worked on machine learning.\"\n\nMachine learning is an area of computer science for studying and designing algorithms (formulae or sets of steps) that learn over time from data. One example is spam-filtering where a single model cannot be used by everyone as spam to one person may not be so to another. With machine learning, a data scientist can look at how each person labels data and, based on that, create a personalised model on what spam means to the user.\n\nIf such a candidate cannot be found, Mr Whalen will look for someone with a good grasp of statistics. \"Sometimes we have to do some training and correct the gaps there, but we find that it is much easier to correct someone who already has a technical background,\" he said.\n\nAs for whether a data scientist needs to be a PhD holder, Mr Whalen does not think that it is necessary. \"Many data scientists have a PhD because there has not been a strong emphasis on teaching statistical machine learning as an entry point to a job over the last 10 years. It is an important part of the skillset required and, typically, the people who have exposure to that have a PhD. But that is going to change and we would not set that expectation for the future,\" he explained. Not all members of Pivotal's data science team have such a qualification.\n\nMr Whalen emphasised that it is just as important for data scientists to have the drive to help businesses transform their product lines. At the same time, there must be a willingness to understand how different kinds of businesses and how things work in general.\n\nBut having a data scientist alone is not effective.\n\n\"It's a team sport. We work in a collaborative model with several roles when we execute a data science project - there are data scientists, data engineers and also people with project management, IT and business analysis skills,\" said Mr Whalen.\n\nA data engineer designs, builds and manages the infrastructure for processing and analysing big data.\n\nApart from finding people with the right skillsets, organisations have to be careful not to confuse data science with business intelligence, said Steve Illingworth, Pivotal's chief technology officer for Asia Pacific and Japan.\n\n\"Data science provides forward-looking insights. It is about forecasts and predictions, whereas business intelligence looks at the past. Being able to do prediction and prevention is way more valuable to any organisation.\n\n\"A problem with business intelligence (BI) is that you start with an assumption and you go looking for the data that proves you right. Data science does not do that; it lets the data give the insights. You write an algorithm and the data can tell you something. The hard thing about data science is figuring out the questions to ask. That's just as important as the answers. But figuring out what you want to know - that's business value,\" Mr Illingworth added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/declouts-vision-cloud", "site_title": "DeClout's vision in the cloud", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDeClout's vision in the cloud\n\nCEO Vesmond Wong is taking steps for the firm to become the leader in vertical domain clouds, starting with gaming, reports LEE MEIXIAN\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT has not been the smoothest first year for DeClout as a listed company since its initial public offering (IPO), what with a languishing stock price and its bottomline in the red.\n\nStill, group CEO of the next-generation technology service provider Vesmond Wong tells The Business Times that the company is continuing to make steady calculated strides towards its vision - to be the leader in creating vertical domain clouds (VDCs) in Asia.\n\nVDCs, a term the company coined, are platforms that use cloud computing technology to serve specific industries or market niches, allowing various stakeholders within these communities to interact, collaborate, even transact.\n\nMr Wong cites professional social network LinkedIn as one good example of a VDC. Its domain, human resources, is integrated with IT to make it a social ecosystem of professional profiles. LinkedIn is then monetised through its hiring services offered to companies and the account upgrade option for users.\n\nThis is as opposed to horizontal clouds, which are generic offerings from big guns in the likes of Google, Amazon and IBM to the broader horizontal marketplace.\n\nDeClout has picked gaming as its first domain to develop. It plans to build a portal where gamers can access a variety of online games, interact with other gamers, and pay using a common virtual currency across South-east Asia.\n\nThis is coming together slowly. The cloud infrastructure is up, with more than 20 game publishers hosting 50-odd games on it in four countries. But the unified payment infrastructure and gamers' community portal will only go live either at the end of this year or early next.\n\nThe VDC segment's very gradual progress shows in DeClout's latest half-year results, where it contributed only 4 per cent, or $1.1 million, to the company's revenue. The segment's gross profit of $332,000 makes up just 6 per cent of total gross profit of $5.3 million.\n\nAfter expenses, however, DeClout incurred net losses of $2.2 million at the group level, versus profits of $272,000 a year ago. Its shares have more than halved from its IPO price of 25 cents to 12.2 cents on Friday's close.\n\nMr Wong says he is concerned. \"Share price is a function of our deliverables, which we have yet to deliver, be it in terms of numbers or the execution of our plans.\"\n\nHe adds: \"As a CEO, I'm supposed to bring value to all the shareholders. But I'd say the share price is not really reflective of our business right now, and it is my job to explain clearly to the community how they should value us in totality.\"\n\nWhat's hardest is having to balance between pushing the VDC strategy and the company's financial health.\n\nMr Wong says: \"I cannot over-invest and create a dent on the company's performance, but neither can I be neglecting it because this is our mid-to-long term strategy.\"\n\nVDCs are but one end of the spectrum of DeClout's business, he says. On the opposite end of the spectrum is its IT asset recovery segment, also its bread-and-butter business, parked under its unit Asvida.\n\nMr Wong terms Asvida a \"reverse logistics\" company. If traditional \"forward\" logistics firms collect parts, assemble them, and sell the finished products, then Asvida's business of collecting traded-in second-hand products to either trade the parts, or re-use them for maintenance or to build another system according to a customer's required configurations, is exactly the reverse.\n\nThis is especially useful for disaster recovery - ensuring that critical business functions such as banking and telecommunication systems stay accessible when disruptive events occur - since this does not require the newest and latest equipment. A refurbished set could as well do the trick.\n\nIt is very profitable business, with low costs and high gross profit margins of nearly 30 per cent, says Mr Wong. The only drawback is that it is often viewed as an unglamorous \"grey business\". That is why DeClout hopes to professionalise this segment by mounting a global expansion plan and escaping the constraints of the small Singapore market.\n\nIt started in April this year with the acquisition of a stake in US-based Procurri, a company also in the business of refurbishing used equipment for re-deployment or resale. This move is already bearing fruit: three months of Procurri's operations have contributed $5 million, or 18 per cent, to the group's revenue of $27.6 million in the first half. DeClout has given itself until the first quarter of next year to complete similar acquisitions in Europe and China.\n\nThere are two other units under DeClout's IT infrastructure division: Beaqon, which provides telecommunications and network infrastructure services; and Acclivis, which provides IT solutions to clients.\n\nBeaqon was the nasty surprise in DeClout's half-year results after its next-generation nationwide broadband network projects reported lower revenue and profit on rising foreign worker wages, as well as lower margins from its new 4G mobile infrastructure rollout projects due to the higher hardware cost component involved.\n\nBeaqon is also trying to move its value chain towards building its own multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) communication lines in South-east Asia. This is a kind of high-speed network that directs data across geographies from data centre to data centre and will be able to help support its VDCs too.\n\n\"Cloud computing is about performance of the communication lines. People don't want a lag-time when they send emails. This is not a public line that we're using; it is a dedicated line that we will own. The assurance of speed will be within our control. It doesn't loop one big round as it might on a public line. Here, it's direct point to point,\" says Mr Wong.\n\nAs for Acclivis, it manages customers' IT systems round the clock against threats, on or off the cloud, and recovers their operations in times of disaster. The latter function is also critical for the ecosystem of clouds because users expect them to be up 24/7, Mr Wong says.\n\nAcclivis is currently leasing and managing \"100 over\" datacentre space for customers and itself. Meanwhile, it is also transforming to become a cloud operator. In July this year, it became Microsoft's first Asian partner to offer hosted productivity cloud solution to Microsoft's customers.\n\n\"What this means is: Microsoft has this Office 365 product hosted on a public domain, which many governmental and financial customers cannot go onto due to the lack of data integrity on public clouds.\n\n\"Now Microsoft has realised it's missing out on a big chunk of this business, so it has invited us to become a partner to host a private cloud environment in Singapore, and it will refer all its customers in the government and financial sector to us.\"\n\nIn the end, everything DeClout does comes down to this - to build a solid base for its VDC business to come onboard.\n\nBut for analysts, seeing is believing. Until something materialises, it is hard to convince the market. AmFraser's Valerie Chan has said that DeClout's gaming VDC \"remains a wildcard\" and will take a while to achieve economies of scale and profitability, with expected small losses for the next two years.\n\nStill, Mr Wong is undeterred, determined even to reward shareholders who believe in the company's vision.\n\n\"To be able to reward these shareholders would be the day we consider ourselves successful. But we are a very high-growth company, so it is difficult for us to pay dividends because we are taking a lot of cashflow back to reinvest in the business.\"\n\nThere is another way to reward shareholders, however, he says.\n\n\"What we are hoping to achieve is, in any of the mature lines of businesses that we have developed, once we are able to unlock value from them, then I think that will be the time that we can reward and thank our shareholders.\"\n\nThis column is an expanded version of CEO Speaks, where views are curated from a wider range of corporate leaders to better capture all that's going on in the business world\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, she described Abenomics as \"nothingnomics\" and as the \"delusion of a backward-looking mind\".\n\nGrowing doubts are meanwhile being voiced about the likelihood of the so-called \"third arrow\" of Abenomics, involving fundamental structural reforms to Japan's economy, hitting its target at any time in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Tokyo stock market and the yen have become range-bound by this uncertainty and the report by Mr Sheard - a former head of economic research at Nomura Securities in Tokyo - could further puncture market expectations.\n\nLike the IMF and others, Mr Sheard gives credit to the Bank of Japan for its bold, growth-supporting monetary policies in recent months, and to the Abe government's fiscal stimulus of Japan's economy. But they raise doubts over whether more fundamental structural reforms can be achieved.\n\nThe S&P chief economist argues that Mr Abe's growth strategy for the Japanese economy is \"more a case of business as usual\" than something truly game-changing.\n\nHe calls for more radical, and politically difficult, solutions, such as raising Japan's retirement age further, encouraging immigration and steps to foster the birth of more children.\n\nGiven Japan's shrinking population and workforce, \"unless radical action is taken to raise the fertility rate and embrace immigration, the target to lift real GDP growth (to 2 per cent) looks like pie in the sky\", says Mr Sheard, touching upon a sensitive nerve in Japan - the issue of encouraging immigration in the way that other ageing societies have done.\n\nGrowth can come only from increasing labour inputs, capital accumulation, and productivity, Mr Sheard maintains. \"To raise its potential real growth rate, Japan needs to address one or more - preferably all - of these three. There is nowhere else that growth can come from.\"\n\nThe Bank of Japan estimates Japan's potential annual growth rate currently at 0.5 per cent. But Mr Sheard argues that \"given the demographic outlook, and assuming there is not a miraculous burst of growth-enhancing innovation, Japan's potential growth is set to decline steadily over the foreseeable future\".\n\nAccording to population projections published by Japan's National Institute of Population and Social Security in January last year, \"Japan is expected to enter a long period of population decline\".\n\n\"A relatively easy way to reverse the decline in the workforce is for society to collectively agree to extend the working life of the average citizen. One way to do this would be to start to index the retirement age to life expectancy,\" Mr Sheard suggests.\n\n\"Extending the retirement age has a doubly positive effect on productivity and fiscal burdens, because not only does it increase the productive capacity of society, it decreases the period of 'dependency' of the aged on the rest of society (or on their own savings).\"\n\nThe biggest driver of the adverse demographics in Japan, however, is the very low fertility rate.\n\nThe replacement fertility rate in Japan - that is, the birth rate that should keep the population stable, neither falling nor rising - is estimated to be 2.07 (births per woman) but the ratio is currently only 1.4.\n\n\"Increasing the female participation rate also has merit, but, if the aim is to promote growth by reversing the decline in labour inputs to the economy, increasing the female participation rate could be counterproductive if it were associated with a decline in the fertility rate,\" said the report.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In 2012, none of the information security professionals surveyed reported to senior executives. In 2013, this jumped to 35 per cent,\" he said.\n\nKen Allan, EY global information security leader, added: \"Cyber-crime is the greatest threat for organisations' survival today. While budget allocations towards security innovation are inching their way up, enabling organisations to channel more resources towards innovating solutions that can protect them against the great unknown - the future - many information security professionals continue to feel that their budgets are insufficient to address mounting cyber risks.\"\n\nGerry Chng, EY's Asean information security leader, added that with all the recent news on cyber-attacks, information leakages, new regulations and emerging technologies, organisations need to start doing more by rethinking how they are dealing with the challenges.\n\nThe survey notes that, despite half of the respondents planning to increase their budget by 5 per cent or more over the next 12 months, 65 per cent cite an insufficient budget as their No 1 challenge to operating at the levels the business expects; and, among organisations with revenues of US$10 million or less, this figure rises to 71 per cent.\n\nOf the budgets planned for the next 12 months, 14 per cent are earmarked for security innovation and emerging technologies.\n\nAs current technologies become further entrenched in an organisation's network and culture, organisations need to be aware of how employees use the devices, both in the workplace and in their personal lives.\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to social media, which respondents identified as an area where they continue to feel unsure of their capability to address risks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He was speaking of Africa, but economists say the same is true of India and others in Asia.\n\nThe US$10 billion that the ADB will lend to India over the next five years pales in comparison to the massive infrastructure financing needs of the subcontinent. But there are also massive domestic savings available to finance infrastructure if these can be tapped, says Mr Hasan.\n\n\"India's insurance and pension funds have a considerable amount of long-term money they need to invest, (but) the regulatory framework under which they work (means that) they can only invest in bonds floated by infrastructure or other projects that are AA-rated,\" Mr Hasan said.\n\n\"They cannot go below AA and that creates a problem because a number of corporate infrastructure groups are able to float bonds and, if credit agencies rate these below AA, this pool of (institutional investment) funds is not available to finance infrastructure.\n\n\"What we have been seeing in India is that commercial banks have freely been lending in a big way to infrastructure and they really can't do more because they have met their group exposure and sector limits.\"\n\nTo overcome this, the ADB and India's Infrastructure Financing Corporation (IFCL) have introduced partial credit guarantees. If a private sector group issues a bond to fund a project which is rated below AA, the ADB and IFCL offer a guarantee up to the point where the project bond qualifies for the AA rating.\n\n\"The moment we do that, insurance and pension funds can move in,\" Mr Hasan said. These scheme was introduced fairly recently and \"we are pushing further on this . . . instead of taking money and putting it directly into, say, into a road project, it is put aside to cover the credit risk\".\n\nIndia does not take concessional loans from the ADB's Asian Development Fund (ADF) for financing its huge infrastructure needs - a concession which allows even poorer (and smaller) member countries of the ADB to benefit from limited concessional funds available.\n\nProject loans to India come from the ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources, where interest rates are based on a margin over the bank's own borrowing costs. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is also a big lender to India, though, again at near-commercial rates.\n\nInfrastructure provision, especially in poorer Indian states, is essential to help close income gaps and reduce poverty, as well as to support overall Indian economic growth, said Juan Miranda, director general of the ADB South Asia Department in a statement.\n\n\"The north-east, for example, is a land-bridge for India to reach fast-growing and lucrative Asean markets,\" he said. \"This will be matched by work in economic corridor development, particularly in southeast India, which provides access to cost-effective shipping routes.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What do you expect to be the top challenge facing your company, and how would you tackle it?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMHC Medical Network\n\nIN a tight labour market, everyone is talking about retaining and getting their hands on a limited talent pool. SMEs face the greatest challenge, compared with large corporations whose perceived prestige and deeper pockets often attract the \"top talents\".\n\nBut \"talent\" is over-rated. You can pay to hire top talents, but if they lack integrity they will bring your business down. Pay alone also cannot keep talent. The staff needs to feel challenged and involved at work; they need space for free play and for making mistakes as they grow with the business.\n\nThis is where SMEs can have an edge over large firms where conformity is expected and failure seldom an option. What businesses really need are passionate staff who have integrity, faithfulness and EQ to work together as a team. These are the true talents businesses should strive to groom and retain, regardless of their academic qualifications.\n\nLionel Lim\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nCA Technologies\n\nSINGAPORE is likely to be a bright spark in the region going by recent economic indicators, and we will have a clearer picture later this quarter. Considering the global economic environment, and the opportunities and growth forecasts for this region, I am cautiously optimistic. Our challenge for 2014 is to deliver greater sales velocity for ourselves and for our customers in this increasingly cloud-connected market.\n\nTechnology offers many answers here, not just to power a company and ensure it can serve customers well, but also to engender significant improvements in productivity and efficiency. Technology solutions that turn Capex into Opex (operating expenditures), eliminate internal inefficiencies and bring products and services more quickly to market are key to how businesses can remain buoyant in the year ahead. 2014 will be a year of leveraging more deeply on our investments and identifying new ways to innovate.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWE look forward to a vibrant and positive 2014. The search for the best talent is a priority for many companies and certainly companies will have to think of innovative and creative ways to attract such people. Dynamic talent mobility is key to sustaining a healthy and vibrant economy and Singapore has one of the best and strongest economies in the region and beyond.\n\nOne of our key priorities would be to continually attract the best talent available and provide the best jobs available.\n\nCK Lee\n\nCountry Director Singapore\n\nKroll Ontrack\n\nWE foresee a growing market for enterprise data recovery as Singapore strengthens its position as the regional IT hub for major tech and cloud services companies. That is why we have doubled the capacity of our Singapore data recovery cleanroom space for the second time in two years to deal with increases in the amount of data recovered, and offer more capabilities for enterprises and government services.\n\nOur major challenge is to attract qualified staff, and changes in storage and device use mean that we need to continually upgrade the skill set of our data recovery engineers. The training process takes many years, so to manage this, we continue to refresh our facilities. This helps to ensure that we continue to offer a positive work environment and continued professional education, as well as establish strong alliances with other tech providers to stay in the forefront.\n\nMark Micallef\n\nArea Vice President, Asean\n\nCitrix Systems\n\nWE look forward to a positive 2014 in view of numerous growth opportunities in the region. However, like other businesses here, intense competition to recruit the right talent will be one of our most pressing challenges. We believe that digitally savvy solutions, such as desktop virtualisation, coupled with a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, can help address this by offering employees a mobile workstyle that will be attractive to the new generation of workers.\n\nA virtual desktop infrastructure gives them the flexibility to work at any time, from any place, and using any device, whether it is their work laptop, personal tablet or home desktop. It will simultaneously eliminate geographical, time and device restrictions, giving businesses the work productivity improvements and cost-savings they need to stay competitive.\n\nFred Schellert\n\nVice-President Asia-Pacific\n\nFNT Solutions Singapore\n\nRECENT macroeconomic data on Singapore inject confidence for an upbeat 2014. While businesses are pursuing growth, we also find that organisations appear to be giving cursory attention to maintaining a robust IT infrastructure, resulting in growing failures of critical telecommunications and banking services to the public.\n\nLooking into 2014, our challenge is to get large organisations to adopt integrated software solutions that document, track, analyse and plan the entire IT network, in addition to aiding in quick recovery.\n\nWhile one would assume that this is a given, recent system failures show otherwise. We would like businesses to better appreciate and understand how to implement IT in a strategic manner, so as to have the necessary information to overcome any crisis and restore services quickly. As an innovative technology player, FNT Solution sees itself playing a pivotal role in supporting organisations to achieve higher resilience, reliability and recoverability.\n\nNick Foley\n\nPresident - South-east Asia & Pacific\n\nLandor\n\nSPENDING time growing a brand's emotional connectivity is a business's best defence during a flat-line economy. Solid branding will have customers seeking to experience the service or product since lists of features and benefits alone are no longer enough as distinctives.\n\nIn this slow economic climate, it is vital to capture the heart first in order to have your competitor lost in the crowd. Take for example, the newly opened Krispy Kreme Doughnuts at Tangs: customers are emotionally invested enough to want to pay a premium and wait in a considerable queue for a bite of the snack.\n\nAs brand consultants, we need to discover new ways for our clients to capture the attention of their potential customers, and make sure that their customers develop positive connecting impressions of the brand. This will in turn help ensure continued buying.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and\n\nCEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nWITH Singapore continuing to be a top wealth, financial services and trading hub, ABN AMRO will continue to leverage our long-standing presence in this region to realise our strong growth ambitions. The outlook for our private banking and merchant banking (energy, commodities and transportation) as well as clearing businesses remains positive.\n\nOur private banking clients are international, highly educated and investment-savvy, who expect high levels of personalised service and access to exclusive products. The key challenge we have is to continually raise the bar in providing holistic solutions tailored to our clients' investment objectives, asset preferences and risk appetites.\n\nOn the merchant banking front, the challenge is to stay nimble and support our clients with relevant solutions and advice in the ever-changing macro environment while attracting and retaining a pool of specialist talent in the industry. The pace of regulatory changes is, of course, an additional challenge that all banks have to reckon with. Finally, we want to become an \"easier\" bank to work with for all our clients, which means simplifying our processes - something that is never easy.\n\nHari Krishnan\n\nManaging Director\n\nLinkedIn Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nGOING into 2014, the lingering economic uncertainties globally present interesting opportunities for both market leaders and challengers. Businesses that invest in two areas - talent to drive their growth and solutions exploiting new technologies to differentiate their products and services and target them to relevant individuals - will be steps ahead of their competitors.\n\nLinkedIn is in a high growth mode. Having the right talent to drive our vision of creating economic opportunities for all professionals will be a game changer for us. We know very well that 80 per cent of professionals are not active job seekers, and hence traditional recruitment methods will be insufficient.\n\nInstead, we will continue to build a strong talent pipeline by investing in a compelling employer brand and leveraging this to engage this group on platforms like LinkedIn. Facilitating internal career mobility is just as critical, as our ambitious employees are constantly looking to take on more.\n\nTan Hak Leh\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAIA Singapore\n\nA TIGHT labour market will be a key issue for businesses and Singapore as a knowledge-based economy must continue efforts to boost productivity levels and maintain our competitive edge. This is why we believe in the importance of hiring and retaining talent, keeping them motivated and looking out for their wellbeing.\n\nIn fact, our 2013 AIA Healthy Living Index Survey found that Singaporeans are increasingly exposed to major health risks including stress, insufficient sleep, lack of physical activity and poor diet. Nine in 10 Singaporeans also feel that their employers have an obligation to help them lead healthier lives.\n\nAccordingly, AIA Singapore introduced all our employees to AIA Vitality, a wellness programme which incentivises and rewards them for leading healthier lives. This programme complements existing staff benefits and insurance packages, responding to the feedback received from Singaporeans. The environment we operate in is continually evolving and AIA Singapore, as The Real Life Company, is constantly seeking ways to introduce innovations to benefit individuals, families and companies alike.\n\nMichael Cornwell\n\nVice-President, Asia-Pacific & Japan\n\nPure Storage\n\nTHE year ahead offers tremendous business opportunities. Asia is a major contributor to Pure's global growth largely because Singapore has quickly become a thought leader as many multinational and financial services companies have relocated their IT leadership and technology decision makers to Singapore. It's clear from our early interactions with customers in Singapore that they are not only making the storage decision for Asia but for the rest of the world.\n\nOne challenge of scaling a global business like Pure is entering emerging markets in the right way. One approach we have seen early success with begins by hiring the best talent in the region to start and grow the business in the local market. It is then important to identify partners and customers that the company intends to have long-term relationships with, and heavily invest in support resources to deliver true enterprise service in that region.\n\nLothar Herrmann\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nSiemens Pte Ltd\n\nCONSIDERING the performance we have turned in for our Financial Year 2013, I'm confident that the business climate ahead will remain positive. The Singapore economy has proven to be resilient in the last few years despite global economic uncertainties. Singapore has also forged ahead with major infrastructure projects, such as the Downtown Line, new public housing and new public hospitals. These ongoing projects, and many other public as well as private investments, will ensure the vibrancy of the Singapore economy.\n\nLooking ahead, Singapore, like many other advanced economies, will face challenges in ensuring the resilience in its urban infrastructure, efficient energy generation and consumption, as well as moving the important manufacturing sector to the next level of technology to remain one step ahead. Siemens will ensure that we remain relevant through our technologies and partner Singapore through this development.\n\nBrad Gray\n\nRegional Director, South-east Asia\n\nPolycom\n\nTODAY'S world is becoming increasingly inter-connected, with businesses functioning on a global scale as they explore new markets and opportunities. The rise of geographically dispersed teams warrants the necessary tools and resources to defy distance barriers and enable human collaboration at all times.\n\nSingapore's investments in developing an advanced communications infrastructure have greatly eased the challenge of cross-country collaborations, leaving the country well-positioned to be as successful as, if not more than, neighbours such as Korea, Australia and New Zealand, all known for applying innovative technology in areas such as telehealth and distance learning. Coupled with rising business momentum, this bodes well for Singapore's business climate.\n\nHowever, many companies may not have harnessed the benefits of technologies such as video collaboration beyond group meetings, while others are unable to eliminate the traditional mindset that physical presence in the office is required as proof of work.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Polycom believes in educating companies on how video collaboration helps in talent management, thereby containing labour costs by creating ease of access to remote experts that are costly to reach otherwise, and meets the cultural need for face-to-face interaction while raising productivity and enabling them to stay competitive in today's globalised economy.\n\nCraig Tegel\n\nRegional President\n\nAdobe Japan and Asia-Pacific\n\nTHE economy has been on an upward trend and on the business front, we have seen great success this year, with the launch of Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud, helping our customers to develop, monitor and measure campaigns through an increasingly integrated creative and marketing workflow.\n\nThat said, we also understand the challenges our customers are dealing with in a fast-changing business environment, and a top priority for us in 2014 is to work with them to facilitate their business transformations.\n\nWe work to continually engage our customers, and equip them with the most up-to-date tools to help meet the needs of their own customers, which are also always evolving due to the emergence of new channels and touch points.\n\n2014 is going to be an exciting year, with many growth opportunities especially in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific region. Regardless of how the industry changes, our focus will always be on our customers, helping them change the world through digital experiences.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nECONOMIC growth for next year is expected to be fairly healthy. I foresee that the demand for manpower will intensify, exacerbated by the spate of curbs to moderate the inflow of foreign workers. Businesses should brace themselves for a tighter labour market as Singaporean and permanent resident workers continue to be a hot commodity, resulting in increased labour costs.\n\nFortunately, this situation works to our advantage as our core business is in supplying talent to the market, and the labour shortage should translate to increased demand for our recruitment services.\n\nThat said, our company may also face the same challenges in finding and recruiting good talent to grow our organisation. As recruitment specialists, we will deploy the talent acquisition strategies that we have honed over the years, to find and hire the right talent for PrimeStaff, as we plan to continue expanding our business in 2014.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA)\n\nBASED on a recent ISCA survey, our respondents who are mainly finance professionals, have indicated a more positive economic growth outlook for Singapore in the coming year.\n\nWhile there is some cheer, our members have also expressed concern over the impact of manpower challenges and rising business costs on their organisations' competitiveness. The manpower challenges include difficulty in hiring and attracting talent, exacerbated by the further tightening of foreign labour. Rental hikes have increased the business cost of organisations, particularly SMEs.\n\nAs such, while organisations make preparations to tap business opportunities elsewhere, they will have to address manpower challenges and manage their rising business costs at the same time. Investing in training can help increase an organisation's attractiveness in attracting and retaining talent.\n\nTo tackle rising business costs, an organisation's finance function can play an important role in managing costs while embracing opportunities. Among other measures, this can be achieved through optimisation of the organisation's capital structure and effective cash management, which will minimise cost of capital.\n\nToby Fowlston\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nRobert Walters (Singapore) Ltd\n\nIN our field of specialist recruitment, we are currently seeing a strong demand for quality Singaporean talent from companies and this will continue into 2014. In this tight labour market, we face the challenge of generating more local talent for our clients.\n\nIn our efforts to do so, Robert Walters Singapore has also reached out to overseas Singaporean talent either via those registered in our global offices or through government bodies. Our clients are benefiting from partnering with an international recruitment firm in order to attract returning Singaporeans to their organisations.\n\nGood talent is not always listed on job boards nor are they always actively looking for new jobs. Recruitment firms with good head-hunting skills have the ability to locate and work with this passive candidate pool.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB (Asean)\n\nOUR business is about providing testing, certification, auditing and inspection services to businesses so our performance in Singapore and Asean is closely tied to the health and wealth of the regional economy.The Asean economy grew 6 per cent in 2012. And with our leaders' commitment to unify the Asean economies by 2015, we have no doubt our business in Asean will grow.\n\nBut we still face immediate challenges. This includes fragmented Asean markets and limited pro-business policies in some areas. Skilled talent recruitment and retention continues to be a problem. To strive ahead, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD will be aligning existing businesses and seeking beneficial mergers and acquisitions. Developing new markets and services will be our key priorities to achieve sustainable growth.\n\nNicholas McGrath\n\nCEO\n\nAIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit\n\nWE are cautiously optimistic for the year ahead. Growth in Singapore's domestic economy is expected to continue to be moderate and the Singapore industrial property market remained steady in the September 2013 quarter, with stable rents and marginal growth in capital values.\n\nHowever, we need to manage uncertainty about the possibility of the US Federal Reserve tapering its quantitative easing policy in the near future. While there is some stability in the financial markets, there continues to be fears of rising interest rates, which will ultimately affect the funding costs of vehicles such as Reits.\n\nAA Reit is well positioned to manage these challenges. Our strong capital structure and ongoing focus on unlocking value within our portfolio through select developments and intensive asset management and potential acquisitions means we are well placed to continue delivering stable returns to unitholders in the year ahead.\n\nJohn Keung\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nBuilding and Construction Authority\n\nSINGAPORE'S built environment sector has always been a backbone of the economy, contributing to a strong infrastructure that is key in making Singapore a distinctive global city. The sector will be kept continually busy with the construction of homes, roads and MRT lines, hospitals, and so on, to meet public demand for many more years to come. Spending on construction in 2014 will remain strong, ranging between $22-$30 billion.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we will need to tackle two main challenges - improving construction productivity and future-proofing our built environment to make existing buildings green and user-friendly. We have been working closely with the industry to help them improve productivity through the adoption of labour-saving construction methods and technologies, and will be refining our schemes in the year ahead to help smaller firms embark on their productivity journeys.\n\nThere's also a need to look at future-proofing our built environment, to mitigate the potential risks presented by climate change and tackle the challenges posed by an ageing population. To this end, BCA will be ramping up engagement efforts with industry firms to improve the designs and work processes for the construction of new buildings and improvement to existing buildings to make them more energy efficient and user-friendly for all.\n\nPeter Hill\n\nManaging Director\n\nSimCorp Asia\n\nMUCH has been said about the growth of Asia and its booming economy, particularly in the development of Asia as a financial services hub. This presents numerous opportunities for businesses related to financial services.\n\nA key priority for financial institutions in the year ahead will be dealing with new and revised regulatory and compliance requirements, especially if they are still operating on legacy systems that were not built to accommodate these changes. SimCorp is poised to enable and equip investment managers with the technology and state-of-the-art systems needed to tackle these obstacles.\n\nLarge financial institutions that have been on old legacy systems for a long time may, understandably, be reluctant to go through what they deem a difficult process of overhauling their current IT infrastructures.\n\nSimCorp's advantage therefore lies in its ability to aid firms, regardless of size, with a simple and seamless solution that takes into account the most important aspects of an investment manager's job - being able to access critical information in real time. As regulatory reforms sweep across the US and Europe, and now Asia, it will be imperative for financial institutions to look at investing in new systems to cope with the latest market developments to stay in the game.\n\nAmmar Hindi\n\nManaging Director for Asia-Pacific\n\nSourcefire, now a part of Cisco\n\nWHILE we cannot predict what the future will hold in 2014, we believe our biggest challenge will continue to be an adversary of our customers - advanced malware and targeted attacks. Businesses increasingly rely on new technologies to enhance productivity, save costs and speed deployment. These new innovations can create the potential for new threats and attack vectors. This represents a daunting challenge for companies and those responsible for defending the infrastructure. It is why security is now a boardroom discussion.\n\nRecent official announcements of a $130 million plan to support cybersecurity research may drive additional security investment, invigorate the industry and create a tighter talent pool.\n\nSome of the security technologies that will continue to shape the IT landscape include those that offer greater visibility to make informed decisions and control to accelerate threat detection and response. Many security solutions in place today are no longer sufficient to combat the rapidly evolving threats. Given the new levels of sophisticated attacks, it is clear that the foundation of any security solution requires a threat-centric approach that addresses the threat - before, during and after an attack.\n\nClement Goh\n\nManaging Director\n\nEquinix South Asia\n\nIN 2014, we expect to see the continued rise of Singapore as a key technology hub for South-east Asia and the wider Asia-Pacific region, with new digital content and cloud providers looking to move their operations here. We are seeing a shift in the approach by many organisations as we enter this new era of the digital industrial economy.\n\nAs local companies across Asia increasingly look to expand in multiple markets, the demand for a central hub from where they can easily access other markets will also increase. With Singapore's robust technology infrastructure and its high demand for connectivity, the industry will inevitably experience a strong demand for data centres and with it a demand for a skilled workforce.\n\nDue to the specialised nature of the job of data centre operators, the shortage of skilled talent is likely to be one of our key challenges moving into 2014. To overcome this, Equinix relies significantly on our global presence of close to 100 data centres for cross border knowledge transfers, to enable global collaboration and the sharing of valuable skills and expertise across markets.\n\nJoe Poon\n\nPresident\n\nXchanging, South-east Asia\n\nSINGAPORE is rapidly gaining international recognition for its status as a business hub, and is enroute to establishing a particularly strong footing in the global market for financial services, real estate and commodities trading.\n\nSupported by strong governance and regulatory measures, advanced infrastructural facilities and an open economy, Singapore is right in the heart of global business activity and has been on the receiving end of a rising inflow of foreign investments. This bodes well for the local business climate, yet also raises the organisational challenge of finding and honing the right talent to support further advancements in these key areas of growth.\n\nPeople are key to organisational success, and it is essential for organisations to invest in recruiting, training and maintaining talent so as to remain competitive in such dynamic times. Similarly, Xchanging faces the challenge of seeking the right talent in support of greater growth. As such, Xchanging continually invests significant time and effort in seeking the best, training them to their utmost potential, and providing opportunities for employees to flourish and grow along with the industry.\n\nRaed S Haddad\n\nManaging Director, Asia-Pacific\n\nESI International\n\nWE are hopeful that the global economy will strengthen its recovery in 2014 to produce an overall positive impact on business momentum in the region. At home, business sentiment continues to be bullish and moderate growth can be expected as we see organisations investing more in employee training with aims to raise productivity and competitiveness for the long haul.\n\nTalent shortages can threaten an organisation's ability to compete. The long-term solution to addressing the talent crunch issue and creating a sustainable workforce requires employers across all sectors to develop a strong culture of talent development by re-examining the ways existing employees are engaged and motivated. With adequate training, new sources of talent, such as the silver generation, can also be tapped to sharpen competitive advantage and improve business performance.\n\nJessie Quek\n\nCountry General Manager\n\nLenovo Singapore\n\nIN line with official forecasts, we expect the Singapore economy to continue to expand steadily in 2014 and are optimistic about our prospects. Even though we are already the world's No 1 PC maker, our biggest challenge in the coming year - one which we are geared up for - would be to grow our market share in the \"PC Plus\" space which consists of tablets and smartphones as well. We will do this through product innovation.\n\nIn 2013, we launched products in various form factors and created new product categories like the Lenovo Horizon table PC, as well as multi-mode laptops and tablets. There's more to come in 2014, as we continue to prioritise product innovation. Our products will help Lenovo stay relevant in a fast-changing marketplace and industry as we address the varying needs of consumers and match their evolving lifestyles.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nTHE business climate will most likely remain the same with no major surprises. Under this premise, the top challenge will still be high business costs. We are always doing our best to manage this problem; one way is to increase the productivity of staff, which is in line with the government's advice. In fact, my company has often sent staff for training and implemented attractive incentives. Of course, these costs are carefully budgeted. We always monitor the company's expenditures and seek to achieve maximum returns on our spending.\n\nWhile thriftiness is necessary, the most effective way to meet the challenge, in the long run, is to increase our income by expanding overseas. This is especially the case since the market in Singapore is too saturated with increasing competition. With these measures in place, there should be no surprises next year.\n\nArvind Agarwalla\n\nCEO\n\nFACT Software International Pte Ltd\n\nWITH economic recovery gathering momentum in the United States and the eurozone, I am confident that Singapore's economy will maintain an upward traction. Despite slowing growth in China and India, we have bright spots in countries such as Myanmar, Vietnam and Mongolia.\n\nSimilar to many other SMEs in Singapore, the key challenge facing FACT is how to attract and retain the right talent to drive business growth, especially in the face of tightening foreign talent regulations.\n\nFACT Software offers a highly competitive and aggressive remuneration to counter seemingly attractive salaries and perks often associated with large organisations. In the software industry, it is vital that employees are provided regular training and up-skilling opportunities to stay ahead of the game. Besides this we encourage the team members to choose their path and pace of growth within the company with new challenges and additional responsibilities.\n\nAs an SME that helps companies improve their productivity through technology adoption, we are constantly looking at ways to boost our own productivity, such as equipping our staff with the best IT hardware and software available to ensure improved efficiency in our workplace.\n\nTom Zack\n\nPresident South-east Asia\n\nEMC\n\nTHE initial outlook indicates a positive 2014 for businesses in Singapore and in the region. However, cost pressures remain and customers would be looking at doing more with less, which sets up a platform for adoption of next-gen technology. We also expect customers to relook their business model. At EMC, we see this as an indication of the ability to do better in the areas of productivity, mobility and better resource management.\n\nOver the years, EMC has made it a priority to move from strength to strength enabling our customers and partners to benefit from the investments in innovations that accelerate the journey to the cloud alongside helping organisations store, manage, protect & analyse information in a more agile, trusted and cost-efficient way.\n\nWe see IT Transformation, Big Data and Security as the stumbling blocks as well as the biggest opportunities. These will continue to be our top priorities in 2014 as we work towards empowering employees with technology that enables mobility, productivity and a better work-life balance in a collaborative and safe environment.\n\nWe also see ourselves leveraging the benefits of big data analytics through economic insights that can help our customers and partners grow. Innovation continues to remain a core of our strategic focus in 2014, and EMC will continue investing heavily in R&D as part of our global growth strategy.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nWITH the slow but gradual recovery of the United States economy and continued growth in China and India, I believe the business climate in Singapore will be largely positive in the year ahead. Companies will be looking to expand operations and grow service offerings. In a tight labour market, this means some challenges on the hiring front, especially for companies in niche sectors, where demand for talent often outstrips supply.\n\nOur company, Fircroft, a UK-based leading provider of engineering professionals for some of the world's largest technical industries, opened our Asia-Pacific office in Singapore last month. With energy demands in Asia increasing, companies in the energy and resources sectors in the region are stepping up their recruitment of specialists who have the requisite skills. In trying to fill the gap for these companies, our key challenge is identifying talented candidates and offering them incentives to encourage them to join the companies. A bigger challenge is to encourage young talent to remain working in the industry. To do this, companies will need to innovate and implement processes that will improve their talent retention.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group\n\nI BELIEVE the economy will grow modestly in the next year. Europe and the US will be slow off the blocks and is likely to cause the Asian economies to putter along in the low single-digit climb. Top challenges in 2014 will include human resource acquisition and recovery of the Western economies.\n\nHuman capital in Singapore is still one of the most pressing concerns of business leaders. Talent search will continue to be extremely challenging. Optimal deployment of staff, utilisation of talent and retention requires concerted strategy. The labour market is expected to remain tight and companies will be forced to accelerate outsourcing activities and keep only key functions inhouse.\n\nIn order to combat this situation, Ademco is exploring using non-traditional search methods, including social media platforms. We are also taking advantage of the increased desire of companies to outsource and absorb clients' spare headcount. The European Union and the US does not show promise of surprising us with a strong turnaround. Inevitably, Asian economies will feel the currents. Foreign direct investment in these regions seems likely to remain lukewarm.\n\nAs a significant percentage of Ademco's business is derived from American and European clients, this is certainly likely to affect us. Hence, over the course of the last two to three quarters, we have been retweaking our client mix not just in Singapore but in all regional offices.\n\nGeorge Chang\n\nVP, South-east Asia & Hong Kong\n\nFortinet\n\nWE are cautiously optimistic about the business climate in 2014. While uncertainty exists in the macro economy, our industry - IT security - is projected to grow rapidly, as organisations fight increasingly sophisticated threats and incorporate IT security into their overall risk management strategy. Enterprises have no choice but to invest in IT security to protect themselves and their customers if they want to keep and grow their business.\n\nIn our industry and others, opportunities in Singapore still exist. Business leaders just need to look harder and respond better to customer needs. Fortinet, for example, surveyed the market recently and found opportunities in application security, as the Web becomes an increasingly important conduit for companies to do business. We will be focusing on this area in the new year.\n\nMore generally, firms should leverage technology to reduce their reliance on manpower. In cases where it does not make financial sense to own the technologies inhouse, they should consider managed services providers. Lastly, Singapore firms should explore developing markets in the region, such as Indo-China, to diversify risk and take advantage of opportunities there.\n\nGurpreet Dhillon\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nReligare Health Trust\n\nWE are upbeat about the outlook for Religare Health Trust, as well as the wider healthcare sector in which we operate. There have been recent challenges in our current operating environment in India with regard to its macro economy and currency movements. Further, money supply and interest rate tightening is also likely to have an impact on the Singaporean Trusts space.\n\nHowever, our business model is based on solid fundamentals and an industry that continues to grow despite ongoing volatility in the economy. Foreign exchange risk remains a concern for our investors, but we mitigate this risk through a firm policy of foreign currency hedging. This policy has helped us to ensure we meet our projections and deliver on our promises to unitholders. We are excited about 2014 as we continue benefit from the next stage of growth within the healthcare sector.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman\n\nHTwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nIN my view, the local business climate will be steady in the next 12 months. Though industry competition is a real challenge, competitors in the same field will have to be creative in ensuring their services have an edge over others. Hiring and retaining staff is a challenge in the current tight labour market. Some benefits like adopting family-friendly policies within the company have proven to be an effective and productive approach. Employment of skilled foreign talent is another option to address the manpower crunch but this is limited due to regulatory constraints.\n\nAs part of our business expansion strategy, we will tap on the growing economies of our neighbouring countries and in China to set up outlets there while maintaining a steady business activity locally. We will continue with our efforts to ensure professionalism and good standards of service provision through ongoing staff training, research and development and upgrading programmes and tapping on various schemes to enhance productivity and innovation within the organisation.\n\nLam Kok Wah\n\nRegional Sales Director, Asia\n\nVeeam Software\n\nVEEAM has seen tremendous expansion in the virtualisation market, particularly in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific region. With a reputation as a thriving hub for business activities to live up to, Singapore cannot afford to miss a beat. Despite advances in infrastructure robustness, many businesses still face database, hardware and software downtime. As a result, businesses suffer a grave loss in revenue and need to double the hard work in getting back on track.\n\nAs companies look to move businesses into the cloud, protecting the privacy of information, fast and effective backup and recovery of data to reduce downtime will be of paramount importance. Developing innovative technologies and constantly improving solutions that are easy to use and hassle-free to upgrade are some of Veeam's core strengths. Providing multi-tiered data protection capabilities to address the evolving virtualisation market will be a cornerstone of Veeam's business and continued success.\n\nTerry Smagh\n\nVice-President South East North Asia\n\nQlikView\n\nOUR main objective in 2014 will be to sustain the growth momentum which we achieved in 2013. Part of ensuring that success is to continue to hire bright analytics specialists who will help drive the company forward.\n\nWhile we are excited at the prospect of a steady economy in 2014 and continue to ride on the exponential growth of the Big Data industry, we are cautious of the manpower crunch. The current growth is not supported with enough professionals and the manpower crunch will not just be a problem that affects us but many other companies that also rely on interpreting chunks of data to formulate business decisions.\n\nTo make sure we stay ahead of the pack, we launched the QlikView Academic Programme in July 2012. The programme aims to allow institutions to use QlikView in their curriculum and hopefully creating new opportunities that use analytics to help tackle complex business and societal challenges. This was our way of giving back to the industry and to ensure a steady pool of professionals entering the industry to help ease the manpower crunch. Beyond that, we look forward to another spectacular year in 2014.\n\nAng Swee Meng, Allen\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE current positive performance of electronic manufacturing should cascade into 2014 and the momentum of the external trade performance will be sustained to Q1 2014. Beyond that, our prospects for 2014 will depend largely on the sustainability of recovery in the US and EU and the successful soft landing of the Chinese economy.\n\nDomestically, the challenges are enormous. The labour crunch, rising pressure on wages and rents will bite deeply. We have been making adjustments to our human resource, operations practices and productivity improvement. The process had been painful; however we have no option but to continue the effort into next year.\n\nWe expect the semiconductor industry to perform at a similar pace as 2013, driven mainly by increased demand for tablets and mobile smart devices. In addition, our improvement projects may kick off next year. As such we are cautiously optimistic that our business volume will be at least similar or slightly better than this year.\n\nCharlie Foo\n\nAPAC Vice-President\n\nBrocade\n\nIT spending across Asia-Pacific will remain strong in 2014 as enterprises and the public sector look set to transform their businesses and critical infrastructure developments for the digital economy. We are bullish that technology will continue to serve as a critical business driver into the new year to create a strong competitive edge for enterprises in areas of new customer acquisition, cost optimisation and financial performance.\n\nTalent shortage is an ongoing challenge for the IT industry. At Brocade, we take pride in investing and constantly empowering our employees with new technical and business skills. Innovation is also our hallmark whereby employees are encouraged and rewarded to contribute fresh ideas to make a difference.\n\nWong Heng Chew\n\nPresident\n\nFujitsu Singapore\n\nRECENT analyst reports have forecast growth in IT spending among Asia-Pacific businesses, especially cloud computing, where growth rates are expected to outpace IT spending growth. Within this opportunity, lies the challenge of increased competition which requires finesse in maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring continued evolvement with customers.\n\nBased on customers' feedback, Fujitsu learnt that CIOs prioritise faster innovation, better governance and control as key factors when implementing a new IT solution in their organisations. Fujitsu addresses these priorities and delivers based on three key philosophies - Collaboration, Innovation and Localisation.\n\nClose collaboration with customers enables Fujitsu to understand problems from the customers' perspective and facilitate the development of innovative solutions that meet business objectives. Our global network and standard portfolio of solutions means organisations can benefit from the economies of scale regardless of their size or region. Leveraging our intimacy with local market conditions and needs, we are equipped to understand, innovate and deliver customised solutions.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nManaging Director\n\nDHL Express (Singapore)\n\nECONOMISTS predict that global economic growth is likely to pick up towards the end of 2013 and into 2014, driven by industrial countries. In line with these forecasts, we believe the outlook for the logistics sector remains stable in 2014.\n\nThe logistics industry will remain competitive. In order to maintain our leadership position, DHL will continue to innovate and enhance our strengths in networks coverage, service quality and product offerings. In 2013, for example, we started to offer the complete range of DHL Medical Express services in Singapore to address the need among life sciences companies for reliable transportation of sensitive goods and to strengthen our leadership position in setting the highest industry standards.\n\nIn 2014, we will continue to invest in our people, operations and technology. The training and development of employees, as well as improvement of our systems and expansion of our global footprint, are important pillars for our success.\n\nDeepak Mathur\n\nSenior Vice-President, Commercial\n\nSES Asia-Pacific and the Middle East\n\nTHE announcement earlier this year that Singapore would begin to strengthen its capabilities in satellite technology and manufacturing was extremely interesting for us. We believe that the development of a complete ecosystem - which includes service companies, satellite operators such as ourselves, satellite insurance and finance - is a vital step in the development of a comprehensive space policy framework, and could pay significant long-term dividends for Singapore.\n\nWhile we do not operate in the manufacturing segment but focus on designing and operating our global fleet of 54 geostationary satellites, we believe that Singapore's leadership in this area will benefit the region.\n\nOur biggest challenge next year will be to keep pace with the demand for satellite capacity in Asia. Along with other emerging markets such as Latin America and Africa, we expect Asia to continue to experience strong growth next year.\n\nThis will be driven by the increasing affluence of young, urban populations in emerging economies such as Vietnam and Myanmar, coupled with the continued demand for access to quality programming enabled by satellite television in mature markets such as India and Indonesia.\n\nMaritime and aeronautical satellite communication applications will also be a focus, as airlines and ship operators begin to leverage the growing desire to stay connected.\n\nStevan Hoyle\n\nPresident for Asia and Africa\n\nVodafone Global Enterprise (VGE)\n\nTHIS has been an exciting year in the development of our enterprise business globally. Asia and Africa continue to be key growth markets as the region develops and more global MNCs, our target customers, continue to invest in these markets, given the expanding opportunities.\n\nOur key challenge in the region is to transform our business from a primarily mobile-focused one towards one that is able to offer our customers an integrated communications service ranging from mobile and fixed connectivity to cloud-based services and M2M solutions. Our customers need to identify and adopt innovative ways to meet constantly changing market demands, and Vodafone can help by addressing their strategic priorities while transforming their business and differentiating them in the market.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nTAKING a macro view of major economic trends, it is quite certain that the United States Federal Government's Quantitative Easing (QE) programme will end by next year, following the postponement of the decision to taper it.\n\nWith regards to China, the world's second largest economy, I believe that China will successfully avert a hard landing under the leadership of Xi Jinping, and forge ahead with growth of 7 per cent and above. This will spell good news for the rest of Asia.\n\nBased on the various economic indicators, Japan seems to be progressing well with its Abenomics programme, and the countries in the European Union are also showing improved numbers. The only countries to watch now are Spain, Italy and Greece.\n\nWith the major economies on the right track for recovery, the global prospects appear much brighter.\n\nHowever, the question that people are most concerned with is when the bubble will burst, and how the global ecosystem will be affected, once the US federal government decides to stop printing money. But in the short-term, I believe 2014 will be a brighter year compared with 2013.\n\nAs for Singapore, we are a very open economy that is susceptible to the economic waves of the major markets. That said, the outlook is good, with the unemployment rate hovering at around 2 per cent. Being in the recruitment business, this signals good business prospects for us, as we provide professional talent acquisition services to help other companies grow. There will be opportunities for growth for us, as companies expanding in the Asia-Pacific region will need our services.\n\nThe top challenge that most companies will face is in the area of human resources. The expected economic growth, coupled with the tightened employment laws, will prompt businesses to expand their workforce but it will be harder to find local and permanent resident talent.\n\nOur business is in hiring the right people for our clients so I foresee that my top challenge will be to find the right talent for our customers. The Achieve Group holds a very prominent position in human resource circles as we have been in the market for so many years. I believe our strong branding and strong database of candidates will enable us to help our customers find the right people. We intend to pump more resources into marketing next year, to build a bigger presence within the employment market and capture more candidates to meet our customers' needs.\n\nPascal Lambert\n\nChief Country Officer, Singapore and Head of South-east Asia\n\nSociete Generale CIB\n\nFOR Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking, we are optimistic of our business performance in Asia, particularly for South-east Asia, in the coming year. Our group's financial strength is strong but we continue to adopt a cautious investment mode, taking into consideration important factors such as regulatory and compliance risks. While we are confident of the business outlook, we remain conscious of the fragility of the global economy and the rate of its recovery, in particular, the impact of a possible Fed tapering on some of the markets in Asia.\n\nWe expect volatile market conditions, with risks of further depreciation of certain emerging markets currencies and challenges on the credit markets. Important political milestones in some of the countries in the region next year do add to this uncertainty.\n\nFinally, global structural reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act and European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) are transforming how businesses operate.\n\nApart from the macro aspect, we have to factor in challenges that are present at a local level, such as Singapore's population dilemma, immigration policy, increasing cost of living, all of which will affect international firms like ours. However, Singapore remains one of the top financial centres in the world and one of the best countries to run a business.\n\nSociete Generale is a strong global franchise with leading expertise in a number of core areas including commodity trade finance, project finance, investment products and corporate derivatives. In the coming year, we expect to continue growing our business and increasing our market share, by focusing on retaining key talents, being innovative and developing more new products to meet the different needs of our diverse client base.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nTHE three major continents collectively show positive directives - the US demonstrating healthy growth momentum, Europe inching out of the doldrums and China with her promising new leadership reflected in recent higher PMI. General sentiments are reasonably bullish. Global movements have a direct impact on Futuristic Store Fixtures as we work closely with international retail industries with global deliveries.\n\nWe are expecting slow but steady growth in the next 12 months, with the global outlook faring better post-crisis. The retail store fixtures trade is a specialised industry with a limited ready pool of talent. Coupled with increasingly more players in the market, creating stiffer competition, the labour shortage becomes intensified. And the aggression in securing businesses is evident in cut-throat price cutting measures which are not sustainable in the long run.\n\nWe continue to innovate our business operations and solutions to enhance our competitive edge. Flexibility and value integration are key to customising packages that demonstrate our core competencies to complement the retailing environment, and stay ahead of the competition. We ensure constant reviews of recruitment and retention policies to reinforce our talent strengths and keep turnover to a minimum. Good HR practices are critical in our industry.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nWITH the recovery of the US and European economies gaining strength, Singapore and Asia should have a slightly more bullish economy as compared to 2013. The unemployment in Singapore will still probably be low. Hence, talent management and retention remain the No 1 challenge for my company.\n\nIn order to retain our good employees, continual engagement and development for them is very important. I will provide more resources in training and improving the productivity of the organisation. Therefore, I strive to build a platform that provides equal opportunities to high performing staff to achieve their career goals. In a service industry like ours, manpower costs constitute a high percentage of the total expenses. With a tight labour market in Singapore, manpower costs have certainly shot up over the last three years. Managing the spending to protect the bottom line becomes key for us. I plan to do this by creatively packaging the total remuneration of employees in line with individual and company performance.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nI WAS one of four participants in the American Express Business Momentum Media Roundtable, organised by American Express in conjunction with the announcement of the poll results. I agree with the generally cautiously optimistic outlook of the CFOs. Their optimism in the current lacklustre global economic environment is a positive sign, as generally CFOs are conservative.\n\nHong Kong CFOs were generally more upbeat than their Singapore counterparts. This is primarily because of China as their hinterland. Indonesia can be Singapore's hinterland but more will have to be done to exploit this in the year ahead and beyond. However, this will depend to a large extent on government-to-government cooperation and relations.\n\nThe CFOs' top concerns of industry competition, currency volatility, labour costs, as well as the need to improve or develop new products and services are valid. It is not unexpected that currency volatility was cited, given that it was a poll of CFOs. I think Singapore companies will have to be more strategic in managing their businesses. As there will always be industry competition, cost challenges and the need to introduce new products and services, businesses should not just do more of the same. Companies should subscribe to the philosophy of not allowing themselves to be shackled by the past and the present, but to believe that everything is possible for the future, so as to survive in both good and not so good times.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nWE are optimistic about business prospects for 2014. Singapore is often considered as a gateway to successful business ventures and developments. We use this to our advantage to sustain, expand and grow our business. The education sector is constantly evolving in Singapore; this creates inroads for healthy competition.\n\nA top challenge faced by all stakeholders in the pre-school sector - educators, providers, and policy-makers - is how can we attract a quality workforce of early childhood educators. And how we can create sustainable change within the sector for the benefit of teachers and early childhood providers, given new ideations in our economy. With each brand new year the plausible solution seems to be to review, re-group and re-focus our efforts to meet the changing dynamics of the economy and the needs of our consumers.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nLABOUR is a scarce resource in Singapore and one which we have to manage with certain sensitivities. With fewer labour inputs partly due to official control of supply, growth is expected to be mild and tepid at best. The business climate will remain only optimistically cautious. The exuberant party is over. The prior years of quantitative easing of labour supply is over.\n\nOur demographic profiles with an ageing trend will not support growth and our vibrancy. Singapore will not have any demographic dividends on our own merits - without import of talents and labour. The government is slowing the growth of foreigners while advocating productive use of human resources, indigenous or foreign. Apart from this challenge, the manpower ministry is also adding pressure by making sure Singaporean workers benefit from its recommended Fair Employment Practices. These compliances add to the woes of employers.\n\nEmployers must learn to cope with less manpower and to manage that factor of production for the short to medium term as the government is unlikely to make any policy U-turn. Personally, I think this is our growing up pains and employers have to learn to produce more with less.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\nJobsDB Singapore & Malaysia\n\nThe optimistic economic outlook for Singapore and the wider region tallies with jobsDB's own survey findings that more companies will be hiring in the final quarter of 2013, and into 2014. With this optimistic outlook, the market will be candidate-short - unemployment rates in Singapore sit at a low 1.8% and the Ministry of Manpower is becoming stricter in issuing foreign work passes. At jobsDB, improving job matching and therefore delivering relevant candidates to employers, and relevant opportunities to job seekers, is our top priority. In the coming year, we will introduce innovations around the changing habits of the job seeker, improving our ability to match the right jobs to the right candidates. A focus on mobile platforms is crucial, as is engaging the jobseeker at every stage of the job-seeking journey. We are also focused on reducing the time - and therefore cost - required to attract the right candidates via our employer branding offering.\n\nSaw Ken Wye\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nCrimsonLogic Pte Ltd\n\nWe are optimistic about 2014. Our early investment in markets such as Africa, Middle East and Latin America is paying off and we expect our overseas revenue to exceed local revenues by next year. The portfolio of local and overseas business helps mitigate short-term risks and uncertainties. Against the backdrop of continuously intense global competition, winning people is the key success factor to winning customers. The biggest challenge would be the need to attract and retain talent and be employer of choice in this tight labour market. We will need to create a carefully-crafted people strategy that nurtures and inspires people, a culture that enriches and resonates with people, and a leadership team that cares about and values people.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Closed on Sun\n\nSOMETHING old, something new. That seems to be the premise of Truffle Gourmet - a new Italian eatery that still bears a strong resemblance to its previous incarnation as Spanish tapas bar La Cicala, from its high tables right down to its Japanese chef.\n\nWhile a new identity is understandable, naming itself after the most expensive mushroom in the world could pose more challenges than it needs in this difficult market. First, Truffle Gourmet sounds more like a fancy deli than a full-service restaurant. Yes, it's got an interesting display counter full of truffle-related products but don't forget that the people who patronise Club Street are, well, clubbers, not the let's-go-home-for-a-nice-homemade-truffle-pasta sort. You want that crowd - go to PasarBella.\n\nSecond, the name puts unnecessary restrictions on the menu. Are diners all that flush with cash to eat truffles every day, when it's really best enjoyed as a seasonal delicacy? And if you don't want to charge truffle prices, how do you keep them down?\n\nSuffice it to say that Truffle Gourmet makes a valiant attempt, but it's given itself too little room to manoeuvre. To its credit, it's a pleasant enough joint, with warm woods and an open kitchen where pastas are tossed on the stove while freshly made focaccia dough is popped into the oven. There's also an attempt to keep prices realistic, with $28 set lunches and a la carte items hovering in the $20 to $50 range.\n\nWhether such a strategy will work remains to be seen. Right now, the set lunch is a mixed bag that includes a decent creamy pea soup served in a tiny hollow moulded into a large plate, followed by a so-so mixed antipasto platter in which a little scoop of chicken liver mousse outshines its lacklustre companions of frittata, caponata and cold rice salad.\n\nIts house special pasta carbonara is decent - slippery-smooth homemade noodles tossed in the requisite egg yolk and bacon dressing. Some attempt is made to gussy up the dessert of Italian chocolate cake and custardy tart on a carpet of torched meringue but the sweets make little impression.\n\nStill, we enjoy the grilled iberico pork chop ($56) - juicy meat with nicely charred edges and a Marsala-laced sauce, sitting on top of potatoes and showered with truffle crumbs rather than actual shavings.\n\nThe seafood pasta ($32), meanwhile, manages to capture some of the briny goodness of scallop, clams and bottarga granules, topped with truffle caviar - not the sturgeon variety but rather lookalike black pearls flavoured with truffle. But the highly recommended Uovo Fritto ($30) doesn't light our fire with its bland, lightly crumbed soft-cooked egg sitting in a creamy sauce sprinkled again with truffle dust.\n\nSome fine-tuning of concept may well do Truffle Gourmet some good, and the first course of action could be to offer the chef a free platform rather than creating arbitrary barriers around him. There's some potential here, but like the fungus in question, it's going to need some digging to find it.\n\nRating:\n\n6.5\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

VMware provides cloud and virtualisation software and services and is a subsidiary of EMC Corporation.\n\nQuoting IDC statistics, VMware's Asean vice-president and general manager, Jon Robertson, said that a massive 82 per cent of x86 servers here have not yet been virtualised. \"We still have a lot of work to do,\" he said.\n\nIn contrast, 80 per cent of Australia's servers are virtualised, he said, adding that this was, however, quite an anomaly, with the global average falling below the 50 per cent mark.\n\nGartner's trackings also tally with these figures: in late-2012, the tech analyst firm said the proportion of virtualised servers worldwide was 14.3 per cent, and forecast this would reach 21.3 per cent in 2016.\n\nPaul Strong, VMware's chief technology officer, said that legacy applications tend to stand in the way of virtualisation.\n\nMany older software suites require their own physical, non-virtual servers, and don't play well with changes in the architecture. \"When you buy an app, you buy into legacy and you have to carry it for many years,\" he said.\n\nBut now, companies are moving business processes over from in-house data centres to third-party clouds, courted by the cost savings of offloading the maintenance to a provider. This is helping enterprises to shed their reliance on their legacy apps, he said.\n\nCompanies are also pushing to the cloud because of additional complexity brought on by mobile devices, which require more flexibility on the back end to cater to different access methods such as the Web, or an app or mobile browser.\n\n\"This idea of self-service, instantly provisioned resources that IT departments can buy on the Web - we've never had that before,\" said Mr Strong.\n\nFred Giron, principal analyst with Forrester Research, said that Singapore has the Asia-Pacific's second-highest rate of cloud adoption, at 51 per cent. Australia was top in the region, at 54 per cent, and Singapore was followed by Taiwan at 44 per cent.\n\nIn emerging markets in Asia, India and Indonesia are tied at 42 per cent cloud adoption, and China stands at 33 per cent, he said.\n\nHong Kong stood out as a mature market with far less warmth for the cloud. Around 51 per cent of its businesses have no plans to adopt the cloud, and only 29 per cent were on cloud services, said Mr Giron, though he could not provide an explanation for this phenomenon.\n\nAccording to the latest VMware-commissioned cloud study, Forrester found that 65 per cent of Asia-Pacific businesses felt that the cloud and on-tap services online would help their businesses compete more effectively. A further 30 per cent even said that the cloud was a top priority for them.\n\nBeyond tapping on third-party clouds, IT managers are also keen to arm their data centres with virtualisation technology so that they can function as cloud service providers to their organisations.\n\nThe idea is for in-house data centres to be able to provide the sort of one-click subscription service that third-party services do, and end-users have become accustomed to.\n\nOn the consumer level, this is seen in examples such as Dropbox, where you can sign up and instantly be assigned storage space with the service.\n\nMr Giron said 62 per cent of businesses surveyed wanted to be able to provide capacity on demand this way, but that the IT managers felt that, in order to make this happen, there needed to be a deeper change in the way the IT environment is architected.\n\nThe study further revealed that only 55 per cent of respondents had the means to manage virtualised workloads in their organisations.\n\nFor many companies with legacy apps, IT departments have to juggle different control points over different workloads and applications.\n\nBeing able to control their different workloads from one point is often considered the holy grail, and Forrester found that just 15 per cent in Asia-Pacific have achieved this level of integration.\n\nMr Strong said that companies should be cautious about ditching their in-house silos for cloud services that will lock them in. He pointed at Amazon's EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service, which features a number of proprietary technologies, saying: \"By the time you're fully in their cloud, you're also locked into their stack, and into their data centres.\"\n\nIt serves VMware's interests to put down a service like EC2, which would potentially take away customers keen to adopt a hybrid set-up based on VMware's technologies, but other vendors have raised similar arguments against Amazon.\n\nThe OpenStack foundation, which is made up of vendors like VMware, IBM, HP, Rackspace and Red Hat, was established in 2010, with the aim of having a set of open source technologies for clouds.\n\nThere are some overlapping compatibilities between OpenStack and Amazon's platform, but they don't entirely sync up.\n\nStill, Amazon is one of the world's most popular public clouds, and plenty of services run on it. When Amazon's cloud went down in August, popular services like Vine, Instagram, Flipboard and Airbnb went down too.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The seven-year-old fund now has US$2 billion in assets and has returned an average 25.5 per cent per year since launching, investors familiar with the numbers said.\n\nMr Hintze, who earned an MBA from Harvard and was classmates with JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon and hedge fund manager Seth Klarman, says that post-financial crisis regulation, which he calls the \"Great Dislocation\", is creating new opportunities for investors like him because banks are no longer as powerful in some sectors.\n\nThe Volcker rule that is part of the Wall Street reforms, for example, prevents banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments, and Basel III is meant to strengthen bank capital requirements. To comply, banks have been cutting their holdings of corporate bonds since 2008 with US primary dealers now owning only about one fifth of what they held five years ago, Mr Hintze said.\n\nWith banks selling securities rated B and BB, he said there are more buying options for fund managers.\n\nIn the light of CQS's eye-popping returns last year and this year's strong performance, which has topped most credit-oriented funds' roughly 6 per cent gain this year, Mr Hintze and his team are among a small handful of funds that pension fund managers and other institutional investors are eager to meet.\n\nMany of the industry's best-performing funds, including Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Mr Klarman's Baupost Group, are no longer taking new money. In fact, both men have told their investors that they would be sending some money back.\n\nBut CQS's portfolios still have room to grow. Mr Hintze said that for as long as he sees more good investment opportunities, there is room for carefully calibrated inflows. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price in debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nJane Street deposits US$567 million so it can resume India trading\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:48 PM\n\nBank of Japan is said likely to consider raising inflation forecast\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM", "images": []}

Offshore marine services company Posh Semco, controlled by Malaysia's richest man Robert Kuok, is also planning a listing in the city-state, sources said previously.\n\nMore than half of Pacific Radiance's fleet of 133 vessels are owned and operated by its affiliates in markets with cabotage rules, such as Indonesia. In Indonesia, laws requiring offshore vessels to be Indonesian-owned have limited supply and have driven up the cost of chartering such vessels.\n\n\"Indonesia is a big opportunity for companies that are able to set up operations with local partners and have the capability to raise the funds to invest in the fleet,\" Pang Yoke Min, executive chairman of Pacific Radiance, told reporters on Thursday.\n\nChartering rates are at least 20 per cent higher in Indonesia than other markets, Mr Pang said.\n\nThe proposed Logindo IPO follows in the footsteps of PT Pelayaran Nasional Bina Buana Raya Tbk (BBR), part of Singapore-listed Marco Polo Marine Ltd. BBR made its debut on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in January.\n\nSingapore-listed ASL Marine Holdings Ltd also said recently that it plans to list its Indonesia affiliate PT Capital Nusantara Indonesia in Jakarta.\n\nThe listing will give Logindo a chance to raise funds to expand rapidly as competitors race to build up capacity in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2008, the Indonesian government introduced cabotage laws that required vessels to be owned by Indonesian companies and fly Indonesian flags. It allowed exemptions three years later to vessels in the oil and gas sector due to a shortage of such vessels.\n\nExemptions for speciality ships commonly used in offshore oil and gas fields, including AHTS (anchor handling tug supply) vessels, PSVs (platform support vessels), and DSVs (diving support vessels), expired at the end of last year. Exemptions for other types of vessels are to be phased out in the next two years.\n\nLogindo, in which Pacific Radiance owns a 49 per cent stake, has a fleet of 58 offshore support vessels. It will join a growing number of listed offshore oilfield service providers in Indonesia, including PT Wintermar Offshore Marine Tbk, whose share price has gone up over 34 per cent so far this year.\n\nPacific Radiance said it expects Logindo to be listed by the end of the year but did not disclose the size of the offering. Sources with knowledge of the plan have said the size of the IPO would be around US$40 million-US$60 million, but they declined to be identified because the details of the proposal are confidential.\n\nOffshore exploration and spending in Indonesia is expected to more than double in the next three years to US$6.3 billion, outpacing the 60 per cent increase globally, according to energy consultancy Douglas-Westwood.

Its cargo included fruit and automotive parts, DP World said in an e-mail.\n\nLondon Gateway is located closer to major UK population centres than other ports able to handle 400-metre ships that can carry more than 18,000 containers, DP World said.\n\n\"This is the first port to be built in the UK in a generation,\" DP World chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem said in a statement. \"There is nothing else like this. Shipping lines can now bring the world's largest ships closer to key UK markets and reduce the costs of transportation.\"\n\nDP World spent \u00a31.5 billion (S$3 billion) developing London Gateway on a site formerly occupied by a Royal Dutch Shell Plc oil refinery. The new port will be able to handle bigger ships than Tilbury and is two-thirds closer to half London than Hutchison Whampoa Ltd's Port of Felixstowe.\n\nThe dock complex is designed to win clients by combining a harbour terminal with an onsite distribution centre, luring wholesalers and retailers away from older sites.\n\nIts berths are big enough to take ships the size of AP Moeller-Maersk's 165,000-tonne Triple-E class, of which five are due this year, with 138 metre-high cranes able to span 25-container wide decks.\n\nThe MOL Caledon, which can carry about 4,500 20-foot boxes, operates as part of the South Africa Europe Container Service or SAECS, run by an alliance of Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd of Japan, Germany's DAL Deutsche Afrika-Linien GmbH and Maersk, the world's top container shipper, together with the Copenhagen-based company's Belgium-based Safmarine Container Lines NV.\n\nSAECS, which serves the South African cities of Durban, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, switched its UK stop to London Gateway from the rival port of Tilbury, operated by Arcus Infrastructure Partners LLP's Forth Ports Ltd.\n\nThe service goes on to call at Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Bremerhaven, Germany.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The aim, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is to find ways to improve the career and academic progression prospects of graduates, and to better match the strengths and interests of students to a hands-on-type of education.\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the ITE's newly relocated headquarters and the co-located ITE College Central campus in Ang Mo Kio yesterday, Mr Lee said the upcoming review would also look to strengthen the role of the polytechnics and ITE in research, innovation and enterprise. The committee will be led by Senior Minister of State for Education and Law Indranee Rajah and will involve industry leaders, education institution chiefs and various government agencies.\n\nEven as Singapore's ITE and polytechnic system has proven successful over the years, the challenge now is to continue creating opportunities for the younger generation for a \"very different\" future.\n\n\"The economy will be more sophisticated and diversified. Growth will come from productivity improvements and new products and services, some not yet dreamt of or invented,\" Mr Lee told some 1,400 guests that included Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and Education Minister Heng Swee Keat. \"Good jobs will be there, and will require a wide range of skills and expertise. Many existing jobs will be completely transformed by technology, and some jobs will disappear entirely.\"\n\nThus, he said, Singapore would need to make some important shifts to equip the young to seize these opportunities when they arise. There needs to be a greater focus on applied learning, where classroom learning is integrated with real-life applications at work, and where students are encouraged to creatively apply concepts to practical problems. Even after they have entered the workforce, Mr Lee added, they ought to progressively upgrade their skills throughout their careers.\n\nHe also said that while the government was opening more doors for people to earn a diploma, degree or post-graduate degree, they should not succumb to a \"paper chase\". Instead, they should make sure that their qualifications are relevant to the industry as this would improve their job prospects after graduation.\n\nAfter the opening ceremony, Mr Lee went on a guided tour of ITE College Central's facilities, including the interior of an actual-size Boeing 737 aircraft parked on the campus. The $500 million ITE College Central, which started operations in January this year, can accommodate up to 10,400 students. It is ITE's third and final regional campus, after College East in Simei and College West in Choa Chu Kang.\n\nITE director and CEO Bruce Poh said the strong link between education and development in Singapore has kept public investment in education a central priority. \"(This has) made education policies highly pragmatic, and led to the development of a world-class vocational and technical education system, an area in which many countries struggle.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The central bank's US$85 billion in monthly security purchases has bolstered stocks in emerging markets by weakening the dollar and keeping US bond yields low.\n\n\"Some people said that if the government can't get their act together, at least the Fed is going to keep money extremely easy,\" Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc, which oversees US$700 million in assets, said in a telephone interview from Lisle, Illinois. Investors believe \"it's almost impossible to quantify how much the Fed has helped emerging-market corporates\", he said.\n\nThe US central bank will delay the first reduction in its bond purchases until March, according to the median estimate of 40 economists surveyed Oct 17-18. The government shutdown furloughed as many as 800,000 federal workers and disrupted publication of economic reports that the Fed relies on to determine whether the expansion is strong enough to handle less monetary stimulus.\n\nInvestors this year are mostly buying structured notes that amplify the returns of the emerging-markets ETF using leverage, Bloomberg data shows. Other securities pay a coupon as long as the fund doesn't fall below a certain threshold.\n\nThe ETF, which holds stock of companies such as the world's largest smartphone maker, Samsung Electronics Co, and Russia's biggest gas producer, Gazprom OAO, climbed 15 per cent through Wednesday to US$42.01 from its 2013 low on June 24.\n\nSales of the ETF-tied notes fell 18 per cent this year to US$383.8 million through October, Bloomberg data shows.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSURGERY should be the last resort for those faced with a deteriorating health condition, especially if exercise and other natural methods can help. BT Living looks at how pilates, yoga and therapeutic essential oils can improve some common ailments.\n\nThe condition:\n\nPelvic Organ Prolapse (POP). POP isn't commonly heard of, but it often affects one out of 10 women by the age of 80. Deborah Wong, a general physician who now runs Breathe Pilates which specialises in clinical pilates, notes how it's one of the more common operations conducted at KK Women's and Children's Hospital. POP happens when the muscles and ligaments supporting a woman's pelvic organs weaken. The pelvic organs can then slip out of place. POP can worsen over time, and you may need surgery to fix it. There are different types of POP, but they tend to be triggered off by childbirth or menopause, which causes weakening of tissues.\n\nThe exercise:\n\nThere is a fine equilibrium keeping our pelvic organs in place, a balance between the contraction of our pelvic floor and the increased abdominal pressure from the organs in our abdominal cavity, says Dr Wong. In mild cases, pelvic floor exercises help to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. The fundamentals of pilates lie in developing core strength. \"The pelvic floor muscles, along with the deep muscles of the back and abdomen, form the group of muscles we work when we focus on developing core strength,\" explains Dr Wong.\n\nThe condition:\n\nLow back pain and sciatica from slipped discs. The sciatic nerve is the longest nerve in your body and it runs from the back of your pelvis, through your buttocks, and all the way down both legs, ending at your feet. When something compresses or irritates the sciatic nerve, it can cause a pain that radiates out from your lower back and travels down your leg to your calf. Sciatic pain can range from mild to very painful. A slipped disc is the most common identified cause of sciatica, but in some cases there is no obvious cause. In very rare cases, surgery may be needed to control the symptoms.\n\nThe exercise:\n\nLynn Yeo, who runs Space and Light Yoga, specialises in therapeutic yoga for low back pain and sciatica. \"I have helped many clients heal and maintain a pain-free status,\" says Dr Yeo. \"Yoga can really support the healing of many injuries, if taught properly with functional anatomy knowledge and proper biomechanical alignment.\"\n\nYoga also aids in neck strengthening for cervical spondylosis, rotator cuff injuries of the shoulders, knee ligament damage, hip issues, etc. \"Almost everything can be helped, and probably more specifically one-on-one classes in with therapeutic focus. Then once people know what to do, what is safe, they can join classes. Obviously it's always important how you do it, not only what you do, so the teacher must be skilled, and properly trained as well.\"\n\nThe condition:\n\nArthritic joint pain and Sinusitis. Osteoarthritis involves the breakdown of the cartilage between two joints. Rheumatoid Arthritis is caused by swelling and inflammation of the synovial membrane, the lining of the joint. Sinusitis is inflammation (swelling) of the lining of the sinuses, caused by a viral or bacterial infection.\n\nThe treatment:\n\nTherapeutic-grade essential oils are now even being prescribed to treat cancer, with documented results, says Tan Kai Hiang, who started One Drop to promote Young Living Oils in Singapore. For sinus, she has seen chronic cases which don't show improvement even after surgery. But with the application of therapeutic-grade oils, have been able to have their sinuses cleared. Recommended theraupeutic oils for sinus congestion include Young Living Oil's Breathe Again which is a blend of four Eucalyptus plants and peppermint, Copaiba etc.\n\nCopaiba from Brazil has the most published research on its anti-inflammatory effects. Ms Tan says the oils can be used on the chest, back, cheekbones, side of nose regularly for daily support. As for arthritic pain, the three oils she recommends include Young Living's Deep Relief blend, Copaiba and Frankincense, which is used to treat almost every illness. \"These natural anti-inflammatory essential oils, coupled with cartilage builders (glucosamine/chondroitine) and a change in diet are powerful natural cures for arthritis,\" she explains.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE saying \"out with the old and in with the new\" is not one that applies to the Lee family who believe in the sentimental value of all their personal possessions. Over the years, Lawrence and Melanie Lee have amassed a huge collection of well-loved knick knacks that take pride of place in their Yio Chu Kang home. The couple's bedroom, for one, is filled with everything from wedding and family photos to four pieces of cross-stitch which Mrs Lee did back in the 1990s.\n\nIn their daughter Leshane's room is a framed pair of children's slippers. \"It was her first pair of slippers when she was 18 months old. I kept it because I was surprised that she could grip them at such a young age,\" says Mrs Lee, who reveals that she also keeps her children's crafts and uniforms over the years. Leshane is now 11, while her son, Leshon is 17.\n\nOver on a console in the dining room is a toy tanker, which has seen better days. \"That was from my husband's childhood days,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\nHer collection of Garfield figurines, also from her childhood, are also on display, never mind that she hasn't played with them in years, and her two kids have no interest in them either.\n\nClearly the Lees, who have known each other since 1987, are a sentimental couple. They still have their love letters, which Leshon once brought out to read to his friends, but that no longer happens. \"Since then, I've kept the letters under lock and key,\" quips a blushing Mrs Lee.\n\n\"We treasure old things more. Often, it is the newer stuff that we throw out.\"\n\nThe collecting bug has bitten everyone in the family. For the record, Mrs Lee has a soft spot for cups and mugs, and fine bone china. \"I love coffee and tea, and will buy them when overseas too. I like a variety of them, especially tea, not just for the pretty containers but also for the tea itself. I can fill half a suitcase of them.\"\n\nMr Lee collects cars, both luxury and small scale ones, while Leshon is an avid collector of stamps, old currency notes and coins. Leshane collects soft toys, \"every country we visit, she has to come back with one\", says her mum.\n\nYet, despite the many things that the family has around the home, their semi-detached home has no clutter.\n\nAs the owners of building company Builders Hub, they know exactly all the tricks of home design and storage. They've built many private homes, so when it came to their own, it had to meet an important criteria - \"we want something that is easy to maintain\", says Mrs Lee.\n\nHer husband did most of the design. The layout of their home - the second one they've built themselves - is simple. A lap pool runs along the length of the home, which the children as well as the family's three dogs actively use.\n\nBesides the living and dining areas on the ground floor, there is a guest room for either of the couple's parents to use when they come over. Instead of a concrete wall to separate the dry and wet kitchens, Mr Lee opted for a glass wall, so that he could still have his preferred open-concept kitchen.\n\nAn airwell in the home helps bring in natural light and improves ventilation. Besides an outdoor terrace on the second floor, there is also a roof terrace, which the family uses as a dining space on special occasions. \"We celebrated the Mid Autumn Festival up on the roof,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\nThe bedrooms are all on the second floor, and what makes them unusual are the automatic doors. Mr Lee had them installed for convenience.\n\nThe couple's spacious bedroom comes with its own sitting area, which incidentally is the family's favourite spot. \"Sometimes we even have dinner here, and this is the only place where we can watch cable TV,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\nNature lover Leshon is a volunteer with the National Parks Board, and even has two bird nests hanging in his bedroom to prove it. He loves taking photographs of birds, and some of his photos are on display around the home.\n\nHis parents are very supportive of his hobby, buying a professional camera for him, and even going on bird photography trips. \"We are going to Bhutan, so Leshon can photograph birds. He has planned the entire trip,\" says his proud mum.\n\nSister Leshane is into art, as seen from her artworks which hang in her bedroom.\n\nWith his years of experience as a builder, Mr Lee says building this home is no different from building a client's. \"The only difference would be the time taken to plan and design is quicker, since I am both the client and builder,\" says Mr Lee.\n\nThe family moved in two months ago, and have no plans to move out yet. But if they do, it is no surprise which items they will pack first. \"Definitely all our old stuff. We always take them with us,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/savouring-good-ole-days", "site_title": "Savouring the good ole days", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSavouring the good ole days\n\nThe sights, smells, sounds, and especially tastes, of certain pockets of Penang will transport a visitor back to the Singapore of the '60s and '70s. By David Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR baby boomers, a visit to Penang is like finding the home we left years ago. While modernisation and gentrification has altered the townscape quite a lot, certain pockets of Penang still transport the visitor back powerfully to the Singapore of the '60s and '70s. Sights, smells, sounds, and especially tastes, still evoke what can only be described by the clich\u00e9, \"the good ole days\".\n\nThe younger visitor, meanwhile, will find a town on the upswing, thanks to its new status as a Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage site. Hip hostels and cafes line the historic lanes of Georgetown, and specially commissioned street art adorn weathered walls and peep out from unexpected corners. But the most telling impression both young and older visitors will take away is the stupendous street food which literally carpets Penang.\n\nPenang and Singapore share similar flavours - unsurprising given some of our common origins in Malay, Hokkien, Hainanese and Indian food. However, differences exist, some more obvious than others, because of geographical and historical circumstances. As a case in point, look at Singapore's and Penang's idea of laksa.\n\nThat said, for anyone who has ever lamented the declining standards of Singapore street food, a trip to Penang is an antidote. Dress comfortably for sure; ideally in tees and Bermudas as it's hot, and the best food is invariably found in non-air-conditioned coffee shops, side lanes and outdoor spaces.\n\nMeat porridge and fried kway teow\n\nJalan Kuala Kangsar Street Market\n\nGeorgetown\n\nIt may sound touristy, but to local and visiting foodies alike, the street market at Jalan Kuala Kangsar is not to be missed. The food stalls co-exist with market vendors on both sides of a thronging and narrow lane. Nearly all of Penang's signature dishes are here; but two stalls in particular stand out: the pork porridge, and Penang fried kway teow, located at the entrance to the market street, next to Campbell Street.\n\nForget about decorum: make a choice, shout your orders to the stall-owner, and grab a seat nearby. Your porridge will arrive in about 20 minutes, steaming and delicately smooth in texture. What's unfamiliar - at least to us Singaporeans - is the shredded char siew on top, which, surprisingly, goes very well with the porridge.\n\nThe hawkers use itinerant pushcarts, and adjacent to the porridge stall across the lane stands the Penang fried kway teow. Although not on the usual litany of foodie favourites, this stall unfailingly serves up a heaving plate of cockle-filled kway teow perfumed with intense wok hei.\n\nPenang assam laksa\n\nFarlim Shell Station Laksa Caf\u00e9\n\nMedan Angsana 4, Bandar Baru Air Itam\n\n11500 Penang\n\nTel +6016 459 7179\n\nOnce located on the roadside next to a Shell petrol station in Farlim district, this laksa pushcart attracted droves. Following complaints, it was forced into a nearby coffeeshop, where it is still named after its original \"address\".\n\nUnlike most commercial stalls where canned sardine is used as the stock base, this one uses fresh fish and spices for broth. There's the right balance of sweet and sour coming from the blend of assam peel, shallots, garlic, and lemongrass. What stands out from this spicy thick stock is the Penang prawn paste and ikan kembong. Freshly cooked ikan kembong is deboned and strewn generously over the noodles; and those who want more fish can just ask for it.\n\nAnother must-try is the fried spring roll. Eat it the local style, dipped into the laksa broth - another novelty for a Singaporean.\n\nCurry rice\n\nTong Sun Coffee Shop\n\nJalan Perak, Jelutong\n\nPenang 11600\n\nFamiliar to locals in the Jelutong area, this family-run stall opens every night at 10.30 pm. It is a swift and efficient operation. Early arrivals will find the whole coffee shop looking deserted half an hour before opening. Then suddenly a flurry of activity erupts, and a six-man team sets up the stall and brings out more than 30 trays of freshly cooked food from the back of the shop - all within 30 minutes.\n\nThe food is predominantly Teochew, with a variety of spicy curry dishes to choose from. The taste is home cooked and simple; however every curry dish has its own distinct taste, unlike in Singapore, where it sometimes seems like a \"one-curry-fits-all\" situation exists. The only downside is trying to stop yourself from over-ordering.\n\nFried oyster omelette\n\nGan's Crispy Fried Oysters\n\nLam Ah Coffee Shop\n\n194 Lebuh Chulia\n\nGeorgetown\n\nAmusingly, this rundown coffeeshop was listed in Penang food guides for the beef noodle stall it housed. But it is the fried oyster omelette that is driving the crowds here. The stall-owner, Mr Gan, gained popularity when he operated for more than 10 years from an old coffee shop at New World Park. He moved due to high rents some two years ago.\n\nMr Gan serves two versions of fried oysters: the Thai style which is more dry and crispy, and the more popular starchy and wet style - which is also the version that Singaporeans are more familiar with. Go for the Thai version, as the crispy edges of the omelette will blow you away when dipped in the special chili sauce.\n\nLor bak\n\nKheng Pin Caf\u00e9\n\n80 Penang Road\n\nGeorgetown\n\nNo visit to Penang would be complete without a visit to the lor bak stall at this caf\u00e9. Lou Joo Chon has sold lor bak for more than 40 years. He offers quite a selection but the must-try items are the prawn fritters, tau kwa, and fish roll. Also a must is the five-spice meat roll, simply known as lor bak. Instead of minced pork, Mr Lou seasons strips of pork with a specially concocted five-spice powder and wraps it in bean curd skin.\n\nHe then fries the rolls in a moderate heat that cooks the meat without burning the beancurd skin. Another of his unique offerings is the dipping sauce similar to our lor mee gravy. This is a derivation of the Hokkien-style dipping sauce, where heavy stock is used as the base and potato starch is added as a thickening agent. Incidentally, Penang lor mee shares the same stock with lor bak, except meat bones are added to the lor mee stock.\n\nThe popular Mr Lou makes an appearance at the annual Penang Food Festival in York Hotel. But nothing beats eating at his stall, enveloped in the atmosphere of Penang.\n\nDay to night selections\n\nPasar Bukit Mertajam\n\nJalan Bunga Raya\n\n14000 Bandar Bukit Mertajam\n\nButterworth\n\nA visit to Pasar Bukit Mertajam would remind one of eating on a movie set. Located just outside a 120-year-old Chinese temple, the dining space is a courtyard flanked by temples and stalls serving a variety of food from morning till night.\n\nIn the day, the dishes to aim for are wonton noodles, Mee Jawa, Hokkien mee and rojak. Look out for a unique dish known as \"cup rice\", where rice is steamed individually in an aluminium bowl. Upon order, the rice would be topped with morsels of meat and braising gravy - the deliciously soggy mess perked up with pickled chilli.\n\nAt night, the selection from the zi char stall reminds one of unpretentious home cooked food. The ambience is of Singapore streets in the '60s, where tables and chairs were placed randomly in any available space. The food and \"feel\" of this place has made it one of the more popular spots for friends and visitors to gather.\n\nCurry fish head\n\nSri Siam\n\n32, Medan Kurau 2\n\nChai Leng Park, 13700 Perai\n\nButterworth\n\nA visit to Sri Siam makes the hassle of crossing to Butterworth worthwhile. Sri Siam is a name synonymous with street-style curry dishes in Penang - ask any Penangite and he will direct you to this place instantly. Be prepared to queue and elbow for a table during lunch though, because Sri Siam's curry fish head is famous.\n\nUnlike the Singapore version, the curry fish head here is light as it uses coconut milk. However, the taste of onion and mint come through strongly in the gravy. Apart from the curry fish head, the array of dishes available would satisfy even the most seasoned foodie. It is an eclectic mix of Chinese and Malay-influenced dishes, but stick to the spicy items and you won't go wrong. Sri Siam's food bears the strong influence of nearby Thailand, so the spices used slant towards sourness, and there is a generous use of fresh herbs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue at its infocomm division, however, fell 9.7 per cent to $28 million.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit was up 26.4 per cent at $19.6 million, mainly because of $7.1 million in negative goodwill from the acquisition of equity interest in an associate.\n\nExcluding the negative goodwill, profit before tax for the nine-month period was $2.6 million lower, at $16.3 million.\n\nTurnover for the same period was flat at $133.8 million.\n\nEarnings per share for the quarter and nine-month period stood at 0.91 cent and 5.42 cents, respectively, against 1.57 cents and 4.29 cents a year earlier.\n\nThe counter closed 1.5 cents higher at 76 cents yesterday, before the release of its earnings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was on the back of income available for distribution missing its forecast of $26.1 million by 7.4 per cent, at $24.2 million.\n\n\"Q3 2013 continued to be a challenging quarter as the hotels were affected by industry-wide price competition. The hospitality sector also felt the impact of a stronger Singapore dollar, which resulted in fewer bookings from some key tourist markets, as well as subdued business travel spending,\" said Gerald Lee, chief executive officer of the Reit's manager.\n\nSpecifically, the hotels missed its average revenue per available room forecast by 8.9 per cent, at $167.1, as a result of a lower-than-expected average daily rate (ADR), which was 10.6 per cent below forecast.\n\nOn the serviced residences end, revenue per available unit was $229.5, 2.6 per cent below forecast, as ADR was 2.9 per cent lower than expected, due to promotional rates to attract longer stays.\n\nThat being said, retail and office spaces enjoyed high occupancies and stable rentals, which mitigated the impact of the weaker-than expected hotel performance, noted Mr Lee.\n\nRental revenue from the commercial space in the hotels and serviced residences came in at $5 million, 3.4 per cent above forecast.\n\nGross revenue and net property income for the quarter were 9.4 per cent below forecast, at $31.5 million and $28.5 million, respectively.\n\nWhile the challenging operating environment is expected to last through Q4, it should improve in 2014, with the staging of the biennial Singapore Airshow and the Food and Hotel Asia exhibition, said the manager.\n\nIn the meantime, it intends to upgrade about 10 per cent of the hotel rooms and serviced residence units in the portfolio in the next 12 months.

For the first two months since the acquisition, RGHS has performed in line with expectations, it added.\n\nExcluding the advanced distribution paid out on Sept 11 - this was made in connection with the acquisition of the Rendezvous property - a distribution of 0.94 cents will be paid on Dec 18.\n\nThe counter ended trading yesterday down half a cent, at 89.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/curry-favour", "site_title": "Curry favour", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCurry favour\n\nIndian cuisine is shaking off its traditional image and moving upward and on-trend with a crop of new openings that include a molecular-inspired restaurant by India's Gordon Ramsay. Debbie Yong charts the new direction of Indian fine dining in Singapore\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH Jamaican jerk chicken to Japanese omakase fuelling the Singaporean appetite for global cuisine, it's no wonder that Indian cuisine has fallen off the radar despite its longstanding niche in the local dining scene.\n\nBut that could be set to change as Indian fine dining restaurants go on a modernist spree, ready to regain the spotlight by shedding the image of the cuisine as an antiquated, calorie and curry-laden affair.\n\nOne such new entrant is Pind Balluchi, a swish 70-seat modern Indian bar and grill that opened in Clarke Quay four months ago. The first overseas outpost for the 24-outlet casual Punjabi restaurant chain from India is an intentionally upmarket affair aimed at Indian and international diners alike.\n\nFresh herbs feature liberally on their menu of food and drinks, be it in a tangy prawn masala with fresh cut chillies to cocktails oomphed up with springs of basil or tarragon.\n\nAt three-month-old Earl of Hindh in Sentosa Cove, whiskey connoisseurs and fans of traditional Indian food can now pair their two loves in a chic seaside restaurant that sits easily within a row of Western eateries.\n\nEven industry stalwarts have geared up for change. Rang Mahal, one of the first restaurants here to showcase North Indian cuisine when it opened in the now-defunct Oberoi Imperial hotel in River Valley Road in the 1970s, underwent a complete overhaul earlier this year and now showcases more understated interiors and a subtler use of spices. It also launched sister restaurant, Table by Rang Mahal in Seah Street shortly after, a health-oriented eatery showcasing Indian food alongside international fare such as salads and pastas, and a range of fruit juices.\n\nAfter being in operation for 28 years, Tandoor restaurant at the Holiday Inn City Centre also underwent a $1.5 million facelift to replace its brooding, 16th century decor with a more minimalist, glass and mirror-accented rendition.\n\nTo further ramp up the Indian fine dining scene, one of India's most recognised chefs, Abijit Saha, will open in the first quarter of next year, Saha. The progressive Indian restaurant will take over the second floor space currently used as Russian restaurant Buyan's private dining room. The 36-seater space will apply modernist cooking techniques such as spherification, cryogenic and sous-vide cooking to traditional Indian ingredients and recipes.\n\n\"The richness of Indian cuisine comes from the diversity of cooking styles from each region in the country, and the influences we've absorbed from the various nationalities that have previously occupied the country, from the Persians to the Greeks to the British,\" says Saha, who owns two restaurants, Caperberry and Fava in Bangalore and is often lauded as the \"Gordon Ramsay of India\". \"I want to capture this in my restaurant but give it a modernist approach so it can reach out to an international audience too.\"\n\nModern creations will take up 60 per cent of the menu and feature in the tasting menu, while the rest will be classic dishes to appease traditionalists. \"A curry will still look like a curry, but it won't be a restaurant where you can find 100 types of curries.\"\n\nIt's not just in Singapore where things are heating up for Indian food. Saha, who is an annual speaker at the World of Flavours conference organised by the Culinary Institute of America says he's observed a growing interest among global gourmands in Indian cooking in recent years.\n\n\"With our advancements in other industries such as IT, India has raised its profile as a brand tremendously. People are realising we're not just a rustic country full of history, but a melting pot of diverse cultures, and of modernism and heritage.\"\n\nPind Balluchi's head chef Nishesh Mani Tripathi credits the celebrity TV chef phenomenon that has gripped India in the past decade for helping to raise a new breed of young Indian chefs - himself included - looking to bring their own ideas to the table. \"You can eat a kebab in Old Delhi or in a modern, 5-star restaurant, and there are only so many ways of serving curry in a bowl. Young Indian chefs have to work harder to come up with something novel,\" he says.\n\nMuch of the innovation so far has been driven by changing demands from increasingly health-conscious diners, say most chefs. \"While diners were earlier happy to leave choices in the hands of chefs, they now set more parameters within which they would like their food prepared,\" observes Punjab Grill's Singapore director, Chiranjeev Singh. As such, the restaurant has crafted speciality vegan, gluten-free and nut-free menus.\n\nChanging tastes\n\nIt will feature a wider spread of curries with lighter flavours. Pind Balluchi is working on a weekday set lunch menu to entice corporate diners who previously shunned the cuisine for being time-consuming and food coma-inducing. It will feature a wider spread of curries in small servings and with lighter flavours. Variants of their popular kebabs can also be found in bite-sized portions in their bar snacks menu.\n\nAt Earl of Hindh, spices and kebab meats are blended from scratch in-house rather than obtained ready-made from suppliers, and olive oil and mustard oil are used as healthier substitutes in cooking.\n\nAnd while the Indian fine dining scene here has been largely dominated by Northern Indian restaurants with their more subtle spices and saffron and nut-dominated recipes, diners these days are also looking to have regional flavours, such as the coconut-based curries from southern India or the mustard-tinged fare of the eastern states, observes Song of India's corporate executive chef, Manjunath Mural.\n\nMore foreign ingredients have slipped onto menus to play to well-travelled tastebuds as well. \"Broccoli, for example, was not grown in India before, but in the last 10 years, India has become the second largest broccoli producing country in the world,\" says Pind Balluchi's chef Tripathi.\n\nTruffle oil naan and Roquefort kulcha pad up the bread basket at Rang Mahal, along with quinoa and goji berries; Song of India lists cod fish, salmon, crabs and portobello mushrooms on their menu, and Punjab Grill has a popular tandoor-cooked foie gras and betel leaf shots.\n\nAlcohol-pairing, too, is a growing aspect for Indian fine dining, say chefs and restaurant owners. Earl of Hindh caters to whiskey-swilling connoisseurs with their range of close to 20 single malt whiskeys from Scotland and India, while Rang Mahal's overhaul plugged in a brand new alfresco area for a pre- or post-prandial drink.\n\n\"Indians have been traditionally fond of their hard liquor, but the younger generation doesn't want to have a plain Scotch, they want something lighter and more fun that can go with their meal\", observes chef Tripathi. Hence cocktails designed to cut out the spice, such as sweet passionfruit mojitos to basil and tarragon-tinged concoctions.\n\nAnd looks, it turns out, matters just as much. Gone are the days when the more dark wood, ethnic antiques and heavy upholstery used meant a posher restaurant. Minimalism and light colours are the new norm, while an antique Indian vase here or a window motif there keeps the link to one's roots.\n\nAnd its effect is tangible. Jagdeep Thakral, general manager of the Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre says Tandoor now gets more Westerners and local Chinese as patrons since its makeover in September: \"Before the makeover, the traditional d\u00e9cor was a little overpowering for non-Indians.\"\n\nAdds chef Tripathi: \"People don't just want food these days, they want it in a nice ambience, where they can show off to their friends that they have brought them to a nice place - and this segment is only going to grow.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This set off a wave of selling in other penny counters such as Sky One and Tritech Group.\n\nSIAS has reviewed Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold with technology company Handshakes, and discovered a recent instance when a share price run-up came before the announcement of a sizeable acquisition, Mr Gerald said. A listed company is required to seek shareholders' approval when a deal it plans to undertake is proportionately large for its size. In this instance, the preceding share-price run sufficiently affected the way certain ratios were calculated. Hence, such shareholders' approval was not required.\n\nMr Gerald said it's timely for the regulators to review instances where unusual price movements affect ratios that determine the need for shareholder approvals.\n\n\"We want to avoid situations where unusual price movements inadvertently deprive shareholders of a say in significant matters,\" he said.\n\nListed companies should also be required to state clearly whether they had been queried recently in disclosures when they announce acquisitions and disposals to shareholders, Mr Gerald added.\n\nThe SIAS Investors' Choice Awards held last night is an annual event to celebrate displays of excellence in areas of shareholder communication and corporate governance. Corporate winners this year include DBS Group, Yongnam Holdings, SingTel, Fraser and Neave, Sembcorp Marine, Cordlife Group, InnoTek and Ascendas Reit. CapitaLand scooped the Golden Circle Award - the highest accolade - for consistently practising good corporate governance, Mr Gerald said.\n\nThe awards are part of the fourth Corporate Governance Week organised by SIAS that's taking place next week.\n\nGuest-of-honour Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, yesterday urged the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to consider requiring companies to adopt and disclose their diversity policy in their annual reports.\n\nWhile the revised Singapore's Code of Corporate Governance, which requires corporate boards to provide for diversity - including that of gender diversity - is \"a step in the right direction\", Ms Fu said: \"I believe we can do better.\"\n\nIn response to her comments, the MAS said it has already established a diversity task force to study how to encourage greater diversity, including gender diversity, in the boardroom and C-suite.\n\n\"The task force is currently conducting a survey on gender diversity on boards and in senior management, and is expected to produce a report with its recommendations some time in 2014.\n\n\"Along with other relevant agencies, MAS will study the recommendations and consider how best to implement them,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The figures were down from the previous week's 17 firms, 30 trades and $5.5 million. Buyers outnumbered sellers with seven companies that posted nine purchases worth $3.3 million versus one firm with four disposals worth $1.57 million.\n\nBesides directors, buyback activity fell for the second straight week with three companies that recorded six repurchases worth $258,000 - against the previous week's four firms, five trades and $463,000.\n\nWith the sharp drop in director activity last week, the bulk of the significant trades were by institutions with purchases in Forterra Trust and Yongnam Holdings and sales in Hutchison Port Trust, Global Logistic Properties and Boustead Singapore. There were some key director trades with purchases in Aspial Corporation and First Reit.\n\nForterra Trust\n\nPacific Alliance Asia Opportunity Fund LP picked up where it left off in real estate investment trust Forterra Trust in April with a purchase-related filing on Oct 31 of 150,000 units at $2.15 each. The trade increased its direct holdings to 33.013 million units or 13.01 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 10 per cent drop in the unit price since August from $2.38. Although the group resumed buying this month following the fall in the unit price, the trade was made at higher than its previous purchase prices based on the 5.269 million units that it acquired from April 24 to 30 in the open market at an average of $1.97 each and the initial filing on April 23 of 25.8 million units via an off-market trade at $1.92 each, which raised its interest to 10.5 per cent. Overall, Pacific Alliance's stake is up by 24 per cent since that initial filing in April. The recent purchase by Pacific Alliance was surprising as Forterra Trust announced on Oct 29 a third quarter after-tax loss of $5.133 million versus a profit of $9.038 million in the same period last year. The unit trust closed at $2.17 on Friday.\n\nYongnam Holdings\n\nDelta Lloyd Asset Management NV acquired more shares in structural steelworks, civil and mechanical engineering services provider Yongnam Holdings with a purchase-related filing on Oct 3 of 1.2 million shares at 24.1 cents each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 115.089 million shares or 9.08 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 22 per cent drop in the share price since September from 31 cents. The counter is also sharply down since June from 38 cents. The group previously reported a purchase-related filing on March 13 of 500,000 shares at 27.5 cents each and a purchase-related filing on Feb 19 of 1.8 million shares at 29 cents each. Prior to the notices this year, the shareholder reported a purchase-related filing on Dec 14, 2012, of 800,000 shares at 24 cents each and an initial filing on April 20, 2012, of 14.765 million shares at 25 cents each, which raised its interest to 5.72 per cent. Overall, Delta Lloyd's stake is up by 59 per cent since that initial filing in April 2012. The counter closed at 24.5 cents on Friday.\n\nHutchison Port Holdings Trust\n\nThe Capital Group Companies unloaded more units of container port investor, developer and operator Hutchison Port Holdings Trust at a lower price with a disposal-related filing on Nov 4 of 4.465 million units at 73 cents each. The trades lowered its deemed stake to 606.828 million units or 6.97 per cent of the issued capital. The sales were made on the back of the 15 per cent drop in the unit price since April from US 86 cents. The group previously sold 89.91 million units from March 7 to 13 at around 80 cents each and made a disposal-related filing in September 2012 of 35.5 million units (the filing in September 2012 stated that the disposals were made from Aug 29, 2011, to Sept 18, 2012; the unit trust during that period traded in the range of 53-75 US cents). Overall, the Capital Group's stake is down by 33 per cent since the last week of August 2011. Prior to those sales, the group acquired a net 78.2 million units from May to August 2011 at estimated prices of 92-60 US cents each. The Capital Group became a substantial shareholder in March 2011 after it acquired an initial 826.460 million units or 9.49 per cent in the IPO at US$1.01 each. The unit trust closed at 72 US cents on Friday.\n\nGlobal Logistic Properties\n\nLone Pine Capital LLC unloaded more shares of logistics facilities provider Global Logistic Properties at a higher price with a disposal-related filing on Nov 5 of 6.7 million shares at $3.08 each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 424.319 million shares or 8.92 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 22 per cent rise in the share price since March from $2.52. The group previously reported a disposal-related filing on Jan 28 of 5.168 million shares at $2.71 each. Overall, Lone Pine Capital's stake is down by 10 per cent since January. Prior to the sales this year, the group acquired 236.47 million shares from Nov 10, 2010, to Dec 16, 2011, at estimated prices $2.24 to $1.645 each and an initial filing on Nov 9, 2010, of 3.03 million shares at $2.24 each, which raised its interest to 5.07 per cent. The stock closed at $3.00 on Friday.\n\nBoustead Singapore\n\nChartered Asset Management Pte Ltd recorded a rare sale in engineering services and geo-spatial technology services provider Boustead Singapore with a disposal-related filing on Nov 7 of 196,000 shares at $1.46 each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 46.139 million shares or 8.96 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 13 per cent rebound in the share price since August from $1.29. The counter is also sharply up since May 2012 from 85 cents. The group previously acquired a net 32.76 million shares from December 2005 to December 2011 at estimated prices of $0.93 to $1.53 each and an initial filing in November 2005 of 452,000 shares at $0.92 each, which raised its interest to 5.1 per cent. The stock closed at $1.435 on Friday.\n\nAspial Corporation\n\nCEO and managing director Koh Wee Seng picked up where he left off in jewellery manufacturer and retailer and residential property developer Aspial Corporation in August with 6.52 million shares purchased on Nov 7 at 42 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings to 291.009 million shares or 16.73 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 1.023 billion shares or 58.83 per cent. The acquisition was made after the company announced on Nov 6 a 36 per cent gain in third quarter profit to $24.0 million. Earnings in the first nine months rose by 73 per cent to $73.8 million. He previously acquired 13.08 million shares from Aug 14 to 20 at an average of 44.2 cents each, nearly 12 million shares from May 9 to July 1 at an average of 42.1 cents each, and 7.6 million shares from Feb 26 to March 28 at an average of 43.1 cents each. Prior to his trades this year, the CEO acquired 1.55 million shares from Nov 16 to Dec 4, 2012 at 42 cents each and 1.56 million shares from Aug 8 to 21, 2012, at an average of 37.8 cents each. The counter closed at 41 cents on Friday.\n\nFirst Reit\n\nIndependent director Wong Gang recorded his first on-market trade in real estate investment firm First Reit since his appointment in June 2012 with an initial 30,000 units (direct) purchased on Nov 8 at $1.09 each. The acquisition was made on the back of the 25 per cent drop in the unit price since April from $1.45. Despite the fall in the unit price, the counter is still up since November 2008 from 27.6 cents. Also positive this quarter is CEO Tan Keh Poo with 80,000 units purchased from Oct 4 to 7 at $1.08 each, which boosted his deemed stake to 7.277 million units or 1.03 per cent. He also has direct interest of 29,000 units or 0.004 per cent. He previously acquired a net 901,000 units from July 29 to Sept 6 at $1.22 to $1.01 each, 1.93 million units from Jan 30 to July 11 at $1.07 to $1.42 each or an average of $1.27 each and 1.39 million units (direct and deemed) from November to December 2012 at an average of $1.00 each. Prior to his purchases since November 2012, the CEO sold 431,000 units in July 2012 at an average of 95 cents each. First Reit announced on October 25 a 21.9 per cent gain in third quarter profit after tax to $12.1 million while earnings in the first nine months rose by 116.6 per cent to $61.1 million. The unit trust closed at $1.09 on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Ltd\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/free-apps-come-price-watch-out-madware", "site_title": "Free apps come at a price - watch out for madware", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFree apps come at a price - watch out for madware\n\nSymantec highlights that apps can even send out text message ads to friends, reports VICTORIA HO\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGET ready for \"madware\", a term that Symantec has coined for overly-aggressive ads on your Android. The digital security firm has released a new White Paper that details a trend in smartphone apps, in which apps pull ads from a supplier's stock of advertisers.\n\nThis is usually used in free apps, where it's common for app makers to choose to monetise via ads, in the hopes of attracting more downloads by making the app free. Symantec estimates that about 55 per cent of all apps in the Google Play store are supported by ad libraries.\n\nTypically, these will display mobile ad banners either on the top or bottom of the screen, or as a momentary splash screen, but more aggressive ads can push notifications into the user's dropdown bars, leave ads in their photo galleries or even change their ringtones. Some are also able to modify browser bookmarks and send out text message ads to friends.\n\nSymantec said that, so far, about 65 ad libraries are in use, globally - and it classifies 60 per cent of these as aggressive. It said that apps using aggressive libraries have been increasing over the past three years, and the proportion of apps in the Google Play store using these hit a high of 23 per cent in the first half of 2013.\n\nMomentum has been picking up, as well. According to Kevin Haley, Symantec's director of its response unit, 2012 already saw a 210 per cent increase in madware over the course of the year.\n\nThe company seems to have zeroed-in on Android devices because of the degree of control that apps can have within the Android OS. iPhone apps, on the other hand, tend to be more fenced in in terms of security controls, and the OS keeps many of the core phone's functions out of the reach of third-party apps. This can help rein in the reach of damage that nuisance apps can cause.\n\nJust as madware has been creeping up, malware on Android phones has been skyrocketing, in tandem with the popularity of these devices.\n\nSymantec said the number of known malware families increased by 69 per cent between June 2012 and June 2013, growing from 121 threat families to 204. The volume of known malware samples, excluding madware, hit 273,000 in June 2013, representing a four-fold increase over the previous year.\n\nThe overall spread of malware is fairly consistent across most of the app categories, but photography and entertainment apps had the highest number of offenders over the past three years.\n\nSymantec added that photography apps and games downloaded from third-party stores - that is, stores not run by Google - have particularly high occurrences of nefarious apps. While the volume of malware in Google Play-listed photography apps just crossed 0.5 per cent, this was 1.5 per cent in third-party stores. Third-party games had an even bigger 2.3 per cent chance of malware. The report's author, Bartlomiej Uscilowski, said: \"Although malware slips into Google Play, most malware is hosted on third-party app stores.\"\n\nAndroid's growing rate of malware is set against the stratospheric growth of devices sold based on Google's OS. Google senior vice-president and head of Android, Sundar Pichai, said in September that one billion Android devices have been activated, and that these are happening at a rate of 1.5 million devices per day. The company's chief of security for Android, Adrian Ludwig, said in October that stories of Android's security woes are largely overblown, and that just 0.001 per cent of apps downloaded to Android devices are infected in any way.\n\nThe Google Play store has over a million apps now, and the Apple App Store has some 750,000 apps.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So will tai-tais dropping off their kids at enrichment classes here.\n\nOff the beaten track, the upcoming Bentley sport utility vehicle's (SUV) high performance and off-road capabilities will also appeal to sporty types such as the Middle Easterners who love dune-ing in the desert, or others just traversing less-developed roads in their home countries, be it Russia or China.\n\nBentley is clearly targeting its coming SUV - expected to be launched by 2016 - at a truly global market.\n\nWhile the SUV will take the luxury marque into uncharted territory, beyond its established two and four-door coupe and convertible range, \"it will still be a Bentley\", assures Sangyup Lee, the group's head of Exterior Design.\n\nAsked if his appointment to the British marque by Volkswagen Group (VW) just 10 months ago was its way to inject new ideas and a fresh mind to the SUV project, he said \"yes, the SUV is a new segment for Bentley and, yes, freshness of design is important, but at the same time it still has to be a Bentley and the challenge is to make it timeless and classic\".\n\n\"It has to be recognised even with one's eyes closed. When you sit in it you can tell that it is a Bentley just by smell, touch and sense (of luxe wood and leather), and also by the precision of its sheet metal. If we lose that, then it's not a Bentley,\" he stressed.\n\n\"That is my biggest challenge,\" says Mr Lee - who designed the iconic 2010 Camaro during his time at General Motors, before he crossed over three years ago to VW, which owns Bentley.\n\n\"Bentley has a strong DNA, and I will have to take the SUV's design to the next level, but still respecting the brand's heritage. To do that, maturity in design is very important . . . it's not just styling to change the design. I have to soak myself into the history and DNA of the brand, otherwise I cannot design it.\"\n\nWhile there is already a concept model of the Bentley SUV, the final design is still under wraps (with the design studio at Crewe totally off-limits to visitors), although Mr Lee lets on that he expects to sign off on this soon.\n\nMarket feedback from customers played a part in its design, just as for other Bentley models.\n\n\"There is for instance already a lot of players in the mid-size, C-class SUV segment like the Porsche Cayenne, the BMW X-5 and the VW Touareg. But there is no true, big D-segment luxury SUV, with the closest being the Range Rover, but the latter's DNA is different . . . its design language says it's powerful in a rugged way, not necessarily sophisticated way.\" Beyond the SUV, and asked whether future Bentleys will look different from those today, Mr Lee says: \"Yes and no, because the brand DNA has to be there.

Six-month revenue from continuing operations rose 1.7 per cent to HK$1.24 billion. Earnings per share for the first half rose to 20.1 HK cents, from 8.1 HK cents, the latter after accounting for loss per share of 10.6 HK cents from discontinued operations.\n\nProfitability improved; its gross profit margin for the first half of the year rose 1.1 percentage points to 13.1 per cent, thanks to a change in product sales mix. No dividend was declared for the six-month period.\n\nGoing forward, costs and wage pressures in China will continue to affect business, but the group expects to still achieve profitability growth for its fiscal year. \"We are looking at ways to further increase both our capacity and productivity in a prudent manner, in tandem with our customers' market outlook,\" said chairman and managing director Ricky Tse.\n\nSo far this fiscal year, the group has increased its production capacity and co-developed a semi-auto assembly line to support the seasonal increase in demand from customers. The group said it will continue to drive contributions from new customers, expand its product portfolio especially in the industrial and commercial electronics segment, and improve its fundamentals, including design and development capabilities, production efficiencies and inventory management.\n\nYesterday, its counter added two cents to end at 23.5 cents after its results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was larger than Kellogg Company or The Hershey Company. At the same time, its co-founders were able to put an official price tag on their corporeal selves.\n\nLess than 10 frenzied hours of trading later, co-founder Evan Williams, with the lion's share of 12 per cent, became US$1.1 billion richer. The other co-founder, Jack Dorsey, walked around feeling US$443 million taller, and Twitter CEO Dick Costolo had to find room for another US$145 million worth of change.\n\nThese remain paper gains for the next 180 days - the lock-in period for the executive team and early shareholders - but after that, they will have access to a market willing to pay good money for a firm that lost US$133.8 million for the first nine months of 2013.\n\nGranted, this might no longer be the case six months down the road but on Thursday, the gods smiled upon Twitter. As the shadow of technical glitches during Facebook's IPO hung over Twitter's debut, bankers working on the deal collectively exhaled when the first few hours of trading went smoothly.\n\n\"Phew!\" was all Anthony Noto, the Goldman Sachs banker who led the IPO, could manage at 10.53 am, as the stock surged past US$46.\n\nWhile the market opened only at 9.30 am, New York City time, on the West Coast, Chris Sacca - one of Twitter's largest investors - spent the early hours of the morning wide awake.\n\n\"Trying to convince my two-year-old daughter the SEC quiet period remains in effect and applies directly to her. Especially at 4.29 am,\" he had Tweeted that morning.\n\nFor anyone estimated to have a stake worth US$1 billion in Twitter, slumber would understandably have been hard to come by on the day of the IPO. This fact was not lost on his Twitter circle. Within minutes, someone replied: \"Congratulations on the IPO. This must be a very exciting day for you, plus it pays for your two-year-old's college.\"\n\nOther Silicon Valley players took some time to indulge in a little schadenfreude on Thursday. Matt Haughey, the creator of community blog Metafilter, tweeted just around lunchtime: \"Twitter's market cap could exceed Yahoo's by the end of the day. The same Yahoo whose $12 million offer for Twitter was declined in 2007.\"\n\nMr Haughey was a smidgen too optimistic, however. Yahoo! had a market cap of US$34.2 billion at the end of Thursday.\n\nTwitter also flexed its street cred beyond the fanboys of Silicon Valley, with Star Trek star Patrick Stewart ringing the opening bell at the stock exchange for Twitter's big day. \"I guess I represent the poster boy for Twitter,\" he said yesterday. Stewart, who goes by the username 'sirpatstew', has posted only 332 Tweets but has a following numbering more than 700,000.\n\nAs the counter wended its way towards a triumphant US$44.90 close, former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger - who has almost three million followers - called Twitter \"proof of the CA dream\" in a Tweet.\n\nOther pundits and observers, however, maintained some distance from the giddy euphoria that permeated the Twitterverse. Ali Veshi, the host of Al Jazeera America, posted a slackjawed selfie, with the Tweet: \"My expression when I saw #twitter started trading at $45.10\".\n\nThose who made out as the largest bandits, however, maintained radio silence on Twitter. One of Twitter's early backers, financier Suhail Rizvi, is so reclusive that he has someone on his payroll whose job is to scrub the Internet of any trace of personal information. His firm, Rizvi Traverse Management, reportedly owned 17.9 per cent of Twitter worth US$3.82 billion at last count, but no hashtag-riddled celebration on Twitter was forthcoming on Thursday.\n\nTwitter co-founder Evan Williams, the centre of attention with his 12 per cent stake, was either too busy or too modest to tweet about being US$1.1 billion richer on IPO day.\n\nThe day before that, though, Mr Williams tweeted about being in New York City for \"@twitter business\". The glow from prospective billionaire-dom was evident - he capped off his tweet with \"#iloveyouguys\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fall stemmed mainly from property developments as construction of various projects (including Double Bay Residences and Waterbank at Dakota in Singapore) was completed in 2012 or early 2013.\n\nRevenue from all other segments recorded improvements. The increase was due mainly to revenue from Parkroyal on Pickering and Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road in Singapore, which opened in the first and second quarter of 2013 respectively, along with higher revenue from Parkroyal Darling Harbour and Parkroyal Yangon.\n\nCommenting on its Q3 performance, the group said the share of profit of associated companies, excluding fair value gains of associated companies' investment properties, fell 11 per cent to $23.8 million - following the completion of the Terrene project in Bukit Timah in January.\n\nBut the group booked a $4.8 million share of profit from joint-venture companies in Q3 this year (mainly contributed by the Archipelago project in the Bedok Reservoir area), compared with a nearly $1.5 million loss a year earlier.\n\nGross profit margin improved to 50 per cent in Q3 from 43 per cent the previous year, mainly due to lower revenue from property development, which has a higher cost margin.\n\nEarnings per share rose to 12.14 cents from 11.43 cents in Q3 2012. Net asset value per share stood at $8.51 as at end-September 2013, up from $7.98 as at end-December 2012.\n\nThe group said its gearing ratio edged up to 0.31 as at Sept 30, 2013, from 0.28 as at end-December 2012. This was primarily due to additional borrowings for the acquisition of shares in Pan Pacific Hotels Group held by non-controlling shareholders in Q3 2013 and the land parcel at Sengkang West Way.\n\nThe group said that as at end-October, 330 units have been sold at the recently launched 445-unit Thomson Three condo in Upper Thomson Road.\n\nLooking ahead, UOL said the introduction of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework in June will further moderate demand for residential properties.\n\nOn a more positive note, rentals of office space are expected to maintain modest growth. The retail leasing market, which grew by 0.4 per cent in third quarter 2013, is expected to be stable.\n\n\"The performance of the group's hotels in Singapore is expected to be affected by the increasing supply of hotel rooms and slower visitor growth. Uncertainties in the global economic environment will continue to affect the hotel industry in the Asia Pacific region,\" UOL said.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, net profit rose 74 per cent year on year to $596.6 million. This was helped by fair value gains and other gains amounting to $402.6 million, up from $90.2 million in the year-ago period. Revenue, however, slipped 7 per cent to $813.9 million.\n\nThe counter closed 14 cents lower at $6.36 yesterday, before the results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Early-bird acceptances tendered by yesterday's close would have received an additional $625 per $250,000 of notes, while acceptances tendered from today to Nov 12 will receive $375 per $250,000 of notes held.\n\nBT understands that F&N was still tallying the first round of early-bird acceptances as at late last night.\n\nBondholders of F&N's higher-coupon bonds - about $200 million of 6 per cent notes due 2019 and about $108 million of 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 - have expressed outrage at F&N's offer because the offer is considerably lower than market value. The 6 per cent notes, for example, are trading in the region of 109 per cent of par on the market. If F&N calls back those bonds under its offer terms, bondholders would get only about 103 and change.\n\n\"Of course, bondholders don't think that's fair and economic compensation for them to give you the call option,\" said one fund manager.\n\nBut what apparently rattled most was the apparent signal that F&N sent during negotiations, that it would be willing to push ahead with the FCL listing and enter technical default if the necessary waivers were not obtained.\n\n\"If you don't consent, I will go ahead, trigger a default, and if I default, I can pay you back par plus interest, which is worse than what I'm offering\" was how the fund manager characterised F&N's negotiating tactic.\n\nIn other words, F&N could potentially choose to default rather than negotiate, a move that would set a precedent not just in Singapore, but around the world.\n\nAsked about its stance, a spokesman for F&N would only say: \"If consent is not obtained for a series of notes, we will consider our next course of action and make an announcement at the appropriate time.\"\n\nA default in such circumstances would go against the spirit of the contract. \"When bondholders lend . . . they don't expect you to default if you can pay,\" the fund manager said, adding it's not what investors expect from a listed company.\n\nBut some observers thought that the threat of a voluntary default could be more bark than bite.\n\n\"It strikes me as pretty reckless if you were to do it,\" said Andrew Carey, a partner at Hogan Lovells who specialises in debt capital markets.\n\nMr Carey explained that while on the surface, a voluntary default seemed like a logical alternative for a company in F&N's shoes, in reality the costs would be much higher.\n\nFor example, triggering a default in the bonds could set off defaults on other obligations that F&N might have. The high cost of a voluntary default is why it is so rarely, if ever, seen.\n\n\"I have had it discussed as an academic exercise, I've never seen it in practice. It sounds like an endgame for a company in some sort of desperate space or maybe it's just a game of chicken,\" Mr Carey said.\n\nHarry Elias head of corporate and financial services Claudia Teo also pointed out that choosing default would exact a cost on future capital raising.\n\n\"Is it usual? Definitely not, because you talk about investor relations, and you want to maintain your relations, especially if you want to go to those investors again.\"\n\nBut Ms Teo said that if F&N were to choose technical default, it would suggest that the company felt that the value of listing FCL was more than the risk of angering bondholders. \"They must have come to the conclusion that (they) can accept this risk.\"\n\nAnother lawyer, who declined to be named, also said that this was a high-stakes game with many opposing interests. What might be unattractive for bondholders could be a good deal for equity holders. \"They're playing hardball, But if it leads to savings on their part, the shareholders will thank them.\"\n\nFollowing a takeover by Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi at the start of this year, F&N said in August that it plans to split its property business from the rest of its businesses.\n\nFCL has received eligibility to list by way of introduction on Singapore Exchange, and F&N shareholders will meet on Nov 13 to vote on the split. A bondholder meeting will take place a day later.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These were detected within 15 minutes of their occurrence - the first one late on Thursday night and the second one 20 minutes past midnight yesterday.\n\nWithin an hour of discovering the attacks late on Thursday night, the search function on the affected subpages was disabled.\n\nBT understands that a patch addressing this particular vulnerability for the embedded Google Search bar had existed, but it had not been applied by the time of the attacks. The patch is currently being applied across government websites.\n\n\"Both the PMO and Istana main websites are still functioning, and restoration of the compromised subpages are under way,\" the IDA said yesterday.\n\nThe attack was designed in such a way that a user looking for website content through the embedded search bar would have been brought to a page of search results, some of which would have contained Web links to a page hosted elsewhere.\n\nThis page would have resembled the PMO or Istana website with additional images to create the impression of defacement, the IDA said. One of the images had been the Guy Fawkes mask, used by the Anonymous group, a hacking collective.\n\nYesterday, security software firm Trend Micro echoed the IDA's stance on the matter, saying, \"The attack was not a result of a hacking attack, but an exploitation of vulnerability within the website.\"\n\n\"The exploited URL was broadcast across various social networking sites including Twitter, Facebook and more, implying that the PMO website has been defaced. With the exploited link referencing to PMO website's official URL (www.pmo.gov.sg), when clicked on, unsuspecting visitors and consumers were tricked into thinking that the exploited link was a real defaced-PMO website,\" Trend Micro said yesterday.\n\nLast week, individuals claiming to be part of Anonymous urged Singaporeans to mount a protest on Nov 5, which was Guy Fawkes' Day. While the date had passed without apparent incident, the IDA revealed yesterday that there had been \"unusually high Internet traffic\" to many government websites throughout Nov 5.\n\n\"This was indicative of attempts to scan for vulnerabilities or potential (distributed denial-of-service) attempts,\" it said.\n\nThe attacks on both websites are being investigated by the IDA and the police.\n\n\"We will continue to strengthen all government websites. This includes the checking and fixing of vulnerabilities and software patching.

Which is why he's eschewing opportunities to expand the indie musicfest globally so that the event can remain a boutique one.\n\nAfter all, that's how the festival began. It started literally in an alleyway (or laneway, as the Australians call it) - a narrow 4m wide and 100m long space at the back of a bar in Melbourne in 2004, before expanding to a proper festival in other Australian cities from 2006.\n\nThere's been no looking back since; by 2010, New Zealand was added as a stop and Singapore followed suit a year later. Two months ago, Laneway, as the festival has become affectionately known, made its debut on American soil in Detroit.\n\nBut Rogers insists the growth is an organic one and he is well aware of the danger of the festival becoming too big for its own good. Staying small and manageable is one of the reasons Laneway has remained successful in the music festival circuit Down Under, while bigger and more established ones struggle or get canned due to the stiff competition and poor ticket sales in the overheated market.\n\n\"Our approach is a little different from the way a bigger festival is being programmed,\" says Rogers. \"I sort of pride myself on having a balanced line-up of acts with a realistic break-even rather than going in and putting the whole project under stress if we can't hit the numbers.\"\n\nUnlike most festivals, Laneway doesn't rely on just one big name to push ticket sales but instead is programmed around a body of acts. Through the years, critics have lauded the festival for being forward-thinking and cutting-edge because of its knack for spotting indie music's next big thing.\n\n\"Part of my job is projection,\" explains Rogers, who's in-charge of programming Laneway. \"I'm doing that between May and August which is about six to eight months before the festival happens and I pick out acts that I think by that time will be hot and ready to pop.\"\n\nHe adds that he does it by tracking bands that he's already a fan of as well as the industry buzz around them. \"A lot of times you rely on your intuition and taste,\" Rogers reveals.\n\nA festival's reputation also goes a long way; for Laneway, it's led to acts asking to be on the bill, like one of next year's bands, Haim. A friend of the American all-sisters trio approached Rogers out of the blue while at a bar in Austin earlier this year and the latter, who's a fan, immediately said yes.\n\nHaim also fits nicely into next year's \"riot-grrrl\" line-up that features a handful of bands with female members in it. They include English all-girl post-punk quartet Savages, Scottish synth-pop trio Chvrches and Australian indie darlings The Jezabels.\n\nAccording to Rogers, the Singapore leg of Laneway has shown unstoppable growth over the last three editions with attendance numbers growing about 30 per cent year-on-year. Four thousand tickets for 2014's show has already been sold since they went on sale last month - that number is the total attendance for 2011 when Laneway was first staged at Fort Canning.\n\nSince this year, the festival has also moved to its new home at Gardens by the Bay to accommodate the growing crowd. It's expecting 10,000 to 12,000 people next year and a third stage has been added to the festival because of the expanded line-up.\n\nRogers projects if things continue the way they are going, Singapore will eventually become the biggest stop for Laneway in the next three to five years. \"We'll hit 18,000 to 20,000 which is still a good number to manage a boutique event and give people a personal experience,\" he says.\n\nAnd with around 30 per cent of punters from the region coming to Singapore each year for Laneway, Rogers' aim is to turn Singapore into a destination venue for the festival. Referring to two world-famous music festivals which are known for attracting an international crowd, Rogers quips, \"I want people to think of Laneway Singapore as Coachella or Primavera; but we don't want to force anything. The focus will always be on the music.\"\n\nSt Jerome's Laneway Festival 2014 takes place at The Meadows, Gardens by the Bay, on Jan 25, 2014.

At the same time, as an island nation with limited space, Singapore has faced the challenge of constructing new, large developments without displacing existing uses, and of developing in a sustainable way, setting new benchmarks for sustainable design and construction.\"\n\nSingapore buildings on display include Marina Bay Sands, Changi Airport Terminal 3, Marina Bay Financial Centre and the National University of Singapore's University Town master plan.\n\nThe Marina Bay Sands project, featured under the fun category, was chosen because the development leverages culture and recreation to improve development opportunities, expand tourism and to shape local cultural identity.\n\n\"Ideas we have been exploring, about making high density more liveable, creating a three-dimensional matrix of open spaces, and stacking different uses, are now ripe for realisation. Theory is now practice in Asia - the urbanism of the future,\" said Moshe Safdie, architect of Marina Bay Sands.\n\nOther projects in Asia that were categorised as fun include the reconstructed Shanghai Bund, designed by architectural firm NBBJ, and the Foster +Partners designed Kai Tak Cruise Terminal in Hong Kong.\n\n\"What many cities in Asia have done over the past 20 years is borrow ideas from the West and transform them to a whole new level. With the exhibition, we are trying to show how some of the ideas should be brought back to the West - completing the circle of exchange and learning,\" explained Bruce Fisher, director at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and who was also one of the architects behind the Marina Bay Financial Centre.\n\nHe added that while Singapore's development process is very different from New York's, specific concepts and lessons were still transferable.\n\n\"For example, Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority has implemented specific mandates to do with zoning that transform architecture. While our government is very different, we can definitely do more to incentivise developers.\"\n\nAlthough most architects and designers are aware of the need for an exchange across countries, Jill Lerner, president of AIA New York (2013) explained that there are many others who remain ignorant on the importance for such a process.\n\n\"Many Americans will ask why we should look to Asian cities, when they come here to learn from us. But the point of the exhibition is to broaden our perspectives and to understand the urban challenges and potential design solutions in a different way. It is smart to learn from the best ideas to help keep New York City globally competitive.\"\n\nWhile the exhibition offered audiences a fresh perspective of Asian cities and how both the East and West are more connected on a global scale, it also emphasised the hyper-connectedness of cities within Asia.\n\nChangi Airport Teminal 3, known globally for its elegant design, was featured alongside several other transportation hubs in the region due to the high level of connectivity and flexibility it offers to visitors.\n\nIn addition to being connected, dense and fun, Singapore's architecture was also showcased as being green and environmentally friendly.\n\n\"By building on the tropical environment, Singapore has ensured that publicly accessible green space is a cornerstone of the city,\" explained Robert C Whitlock, principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.\n\nThrough the examples of the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) and NUS's University Town Masterplan, designed by Perkins +Will and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) respectively, the exhibition highlighted how these developments incorporate green practices at both the design and institutional level.\n\n\"Singapore is a country with a true vision of the future where architecture and urban design have a major role . . . (and) public and private interests are profoundly balanced by the government. Consumers are highly educated in terms of quality of design and construction. They are not only interested in their own spaces but also in the overall architecture and urban context,\" commented Daniel Libeskind whose firm designed the Reflections at Keppel Bay project.\n\nExplaining the purpose behind the exhibition, Mr Solomon said: \"It was my goal to introduce audiences to the work of international teams in Singapore as well as other cities in Asia. Though very different from one another, and different from New York, these cities face many of the same challenges and are developing, through the involvement of global architectural practices, innovative responses that are relevant worldwide.\"\n\nGiven that cities in the West are in the process of reconstructing and redeveloping public spaces, the exhibition comes at a timely moment to provide both architects and the public with real-life examples of what to expect as they move forward.\n\n\"There are so many cities in the world that are hamstrung by development choices made in the last mid-century and I think the example that Singapore is creating shows that these sorts of changes can provide a huge benefit. As is clearly understood in Singapore, the growth of the city and its inhabitants is a strategic undertaking in a global environment,\" commented Mr Whitlock.\n\nThe Practical Utopias exhibition is on display till Jan 14 at the Center for Architecture in New York City.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ever since MBS first opened its doors in 2010, almost all of the contracts at the $8 billion property have been awarded to Singapore-based companies.\n\nIt's all part of an ongoing commitment to benefit local firms, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), said an MBS spokesman in response to queries from The Business Times.\n\nThree years ago, MBS awarded 70 per cent, or $285.8 million, of its total procurement contracts to companies based here. Last year, that figure shot up to 93 per cent, or $389 million worth of contracts, of which a little over half ($197 million) went to local SMEs.\n\n\"(MBS) is committed to benefit Singapore and we will continue to ensure that the community and local enterprises benefit most from our presence in Singapore,\" said the spokesman.\n\nLocal companies, too, could expect to see an increase in their business volume, given MBS's scale and the fact that it serves thousands of guests each day, she said. One such company that has reaped the benefits so far is ZeroSpot, which provides a one-stop shop for all of MBS's laundry services including staff uniforms, towels and hotel guest laundry.\n\nEarly in its partnership with the IR, ZeroSpot's management chose to invest $18 million on new equipment and to set up a new plant in Tuas, mainly to cater to MBS's needs. Besides the Tuas plant, ZeroSpot operates a satellite laundry service at MBS meant for fast and urgent turnarounds for guest laundry. The company also had to hire 80 extra workers to meet the demand from the IR.\n\nSecuring a lucrative MBS contract also proved to be a jackpot for Sing See Soon Floral & Landscape, which started working with MBS in July 2009, months before the IR had even opened to the public. The company supplies flowers to MBS for its wedding and Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) events, and the IR is now Sing See Soon's biggest customer.\n\nSealing the MBS deal led to the company investing in a computerised system to process orders, having previously relied on traditional methods, such as face-to-face meetings, over-the-phone orders and accepting only cash in payment.\n\nThe MBS spokesman said: \"As a long-term business in Singapore, we want to reach out and work with as many local companies as possible to help them grow along with our development in this country.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Osborne to announce decision on Dec 4", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWill UK tax foreign-owned property sales? Osborne to announce decision on Dec 4\n\nHe refuses to confirm talk of capital gains tax\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 7, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[LONDON] A UK Treasury minister signalled that foreigners who own British homes will find out next month whether the government will slap an unprecedented tax on property sales.\n\n\"You'll have to wait for the Autumn Statement\" on Dec 4, when Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne presents new economic forecasts, Financial Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid said in an interview, when asked whether the government is planning a capital gains tax on foreign investors selling property in the UK.\n\nMr Osborne is considering such a levy to curb rising house prices in London and the south-east of England, Sky News television reported last week, without saying where it got the information. Overseas demand is adding to pressure on a market experiencing a shortage of supply. Rightmove plc said on Oct 21 that values in the capital rose more than 10 per cent last month.\n\nPrices for luxury homes have soared in recent years as the debt crisis in the euro region and uprisings across North Africa made London property a haven for international investors.\n\nValues of prime London residences have risen more than 60 per cent from their low in 2009, with non-UK residents accounting for 25 per cent of all purchases in central London in the 12 months through September, according to broker Knight Frank.\n\nMr Osborne is under pressure to address the risk of a housing bubble in the UK after the International Monetary Fund and ministers including Business Secretary Vince Cable criticised his programme to support home ownership. Help to Buy allows people to purchase a property costing as much as \u00a3600,000 (S$1.2 million) with a down payment of as little as 5 per cent.\n\nA tax on foreign-owned property \"is definitely a political move, as polls in the past suggest this would garner huge support\", said Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics and a former Treasury official. The price increases seen in some parts of London mean \"some buyers may be viewing this as a market that's overheating\".\n\nThe British Property Federation said imposing such a tax may damage economic growth because penalising people who want to invest in Britain may slow the number of homes being built.\n\nMr Osborne raised a homebuying tax to 7 per cent from 5 per cent for properties priced above \u00a32 million in March 2012. He refused to comment when asked in a BBC interview last week whether he was considering a new sales tax on foreign homeowners.\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on specific tax affairs - it's not a leak that comes from anyone near me,\" he said. \"The only reason I don't want to deny it is because I don't want to then get into a whole list of other things you are going to ask me about.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Revenue slipped 37 per cent to US$13.6 million.\n\nProduction in the quarter fell from 3,363 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to 1,979 boepd. This was compounded by lower average realised gas prices of US$6.01 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), down from US$6.28 per mcf in the previous quarter.\n\nThe fall in production was mainly due to unplanned disruptions in its B8/32 and B9A oil and gas fields in Thailand, while bad weather conditions slowed repairs and maintenance, the firm said.\n\nIts Kambuna gas-condensate field in Indonesia also ended production in July as expected.\n\nTyphoons in offshore northern Vietnam affected KrisEnergy's drilling activity in the Cua Lo-1 exploration well in Block 105 as well. Drilling has taken longer than the expected 42 days due to the bad weather, it said. \"We're making good progress, but we're also facing frustrations, mainly from mother nature,\" said KrisEnergy CEO Keith Cameron in a results briefing. \"While this is frustrating, we recognise all operators must take necessary safety precautions.\"\n\nWhile typhoon activity in the region is still ongoing, the firm does not expect its Q4 results to be affected because of the recent installation of a new production platform in the B8/32 field in Thailand that has brought production back to usual levels.\n\nIn addition, gas production at the onshore Bangora field in Bangladesh - in which KrisEnergy will hold a 30 per cent working interest through the acquisition of Tullow Bangladesh Limited - increased from 85 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) to 110 mmcfd after the completion of workovers at two development wells.\n\nThe acquisition \"continues to proceed through the government channels for approval\", Kris Energy said.\n\nThe group is also looking to add to its portfolio, and has bids in place for \"more than a dozen\" blocks, said director of business development Richard Lorentz.\n\nThe counter ended half a cent lower at $1.265 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apart from making more money or climbing the career ladder, finding extra pockets of free time is the major obsession of professionals caught up in the dizzying cycle of work, children, elderly parent care, and chores. But where there's a need, there's a business opportunity, hence a slew of services have sprouted up to help cash-rich but time-poor urbanites get more bang out of their precious 24 hours a day.\n\nWhile major supermarkets already offer online shopping services, independent online grocers have sprouted up to save their customers the hassle of waiting in line. Redmart, for example, is one such site that has seen business grow since they started two years ago. It is helmed by Roger Egan and Vikram Rupani who started it two years ago, and who \"had both lived in New York and frequently used online grocery services,\" says Todd Kurie, RedMart's vice-president for marketing. \"They were surprised to see that online grocery shopping was not yet popular here, especially given how busy professionals are.\"\n\nSome 85 per cent of their clients are between the ages of 25 and 45, and 70 per cent are married with children. \"Using these figures, we believe that at least 60 per cent of our customers fall into the 'busy executive' category,\" says Mr Kurie.\n\nHe adds that RedMart works for busy folks who \"would rather spend time and effort on their work, family, or hobby, than to spend it shopping for groceries\". Its customer base is now \"in the tens of thousands and we have repeat customers, with the average customer ordering $130 worth of goods every three weeks.\"\n\nAnother one cashing in on this market is Christopher Tan, managing director of Reservation Commerce, a consumer web company that provides reservation services. Earlier this year, the company launched tabadoctor.com, a website that allows consumers to make instant appointments with medical specialists, ask health related questions of a panel of doctors, and get access to health articles.\n\nSince it started in January, over 500 doctors have signed up with the website, and the site gets 50,000 page views monthly. Last month, the company launched a second similar portal called tabasalon.com, where consumers can make instant appointments with over 100 salons that offer beauty services from hair to nail and bodycare, including popular ones such as Shunji Matsuo and Toni & Guy. \"Tabadoctor.com has been so successful, we decided to expand our services,\" says Mr Tan. To make it ever more hassle free for consumers, a single password is all that is needed to access both portals.\n\nMr Tan has plans to include more services in his portfolio. \"We want to make the lives of consumers easier, and there are still plenty of areas to cover.\"\n\nAnd as more like-minded entrepreneurs catch on, the business of saving time may well have an unlimited upside. BT Lifestyle looks at some of them.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nSuper Body Super Brain\n\nSO you walk into a room and suddenly forget why you are there. You're always misplacing your smartphone, have trouble staying alert and have problems concentrating. Chalk it up to a lack of sleep, stress or old age, but popping gingko nuts and coffee is not the long-term solution.\n\nExercise has been proven to slow down the degeneration of the brain, but who has the time or inclination to spare even half an hour at the gym?\n\nEnter James Tang, director of Brainy Moves, who says that you just need 10 minutes of exercise each day to build up your brain function, and keep fit at the same time. He practises the Super Body Super Brain programme: \"A quick and effective programme that is suited for the busy working crowd, who will find themselves performing better at work.\"\n\nA former PE teacher, Mr Tang is the Asian representative for Super Body Super Brain, the mind-body exercise programme that incorporates fitness with neuroscience which was started by New York-based fitness trainer Michael Gonzalez-Wallace.\n\nWhen he was still a PE teacher, Mr Tang noticed that many of his students lacked focus, mental resilience and multitasking abilities. \"These are all examples of brain inefficiency,\" he says. His study of research papers and articles on the Internet eventually led him to Super Body Super Brain. In August, he flew to New York to meet Mr Gonzalez-Wallace and trained under him. Super Body Super Brain is a series of low-impact exercises comprising complex moves, fun activities and sensory training to enhance the body and brain.\n\n\"I was sceptical as to whether this exercise programme would work, but it piqued my interest,\" says Mr Tang. \"It also helped that the exercise programme is endorsed by neuroscientists and medical professionals.\"\n\nMr Tang adds that a 10-minute workout every day is sufficient, although he usually trains clients for an hour. He charges $80 per hour for individual clients, or $35 per hour for groups of five. To make it easier for clients, he travels to the venue of their choice. Little equipment is required, and the programme is suitable for people of all ages.\n\n\"The programme is customisable to suit different levels of psychomotor skills and health conditions,\" says Mr Tang. \"You don't need to be sporty or skilled to participate.\" There are a series of exercises to be done, such as squats on tip-toes together with bicep curls or arm raises. Apart from strengthening the biceps and abdominal muscles, you improve on balance, which trains specific sections of the brain that help improve reading capacity. \"The exercises for each session are always different to keep the mind mentally engaged,\" says Mr Tang. He also does pre- and post-assessments with clients to see if the programme has been effective.\n\nMr Tang says that clients are expected to see an improvement in memory, increased level of alertness and less fatigue, and the ability to multitask better. Since going on the programme, Mr Tang finds himself \"drinking a lot less coffee to stay alert\".\n\nHe is in the midst of building up the business, and also has received enquiries from interested parties. He is working with two secondary schools to start the programme, and hopes to work with companies as well.\n\n\"We will all grow old, but if there are exercises that can slow down the rate of our minds degenerating while getting a fitter body at the same time, why not do them?\" he advises.\n\nWhen it takes just 10 minutes, it's harder to make the excuse that one has no time.\n\nJublia Match\n\nNETWORKING is always the way to go when it comes to making new contacts - the trick is in how to filter the process such that you only meet the kind of people you want?\n\nJublia Match, a web-based application, aims to make networking more efficient. It works like a matchmaking service but instead of a potential life partner, you could be meeting someone ready to do a million-dollar deal.\n\nThe application is the brainchild of three NUS students, Errol Lim, Chinab Chugh and Tan Kuan Yan, who met in Stockholm while completing a one-year internship programme.\n\nAs part of their internship, they attended business and startup conferences in Europe. \"We found that there was a wealth of business opportunities and leads within the network of attending delegates. However there was no way of knowing who the relevant person was that we could talk to,\" says Mr Lim. \"With the limited time you have to network, it is almost impossible to fully secure quality meetings at the event.\"\n\nThe trio worked to create a system that curates the list of delegates based on a person's networking needs, and also schedule speed meetings effortlessly and automatically.\n\nHere's how it works: a networking invitation is sent to delegates of an event. Delegates use Match to view, make and accept meetings from a curated list of delegates that is presented based on the type of people that they would like to network with. They indicate their time availability at the event and submit their choices.\n\nJublia Match then schedules meetings for the different delegates based on their choices and their available time slot. A meeting schedule will be sent to each delegate a day before the event. At the event, delegates turn up at the agreed place and time.\n\nThe company has been receiving positive feedback from delegates who use their service. \"The best compliment is when a delegate tells us, 'I know that someone is keen to meet me, in this way, you did your job well',\" says Mr Lim. Jublia Match is a free application for delegates, while event organisers who use the service pay US$2.19 for each delegate they want to reach out to. The service started in May this year, and since then the company has worked with 13 events of various profiles in cities like Stockholm, London, New York, Kuala Lumpur, Slovenia, and Singapore. To date, they have helped about 4,000 delegates make meaningful connections at events.\n\nThe name Jublia, comes from the Swedish word \"jubla\", meaning jubilant in English. \"We thought how appropriate the word was given since it describes the feeling you get when you make a meaningful match with someone else,\" says Mr Lim. Since the founders are all male, they decided to add a feminine touch to the company name by turning jubla into Jublia.\n\nMr Lim predicts Jublia Match will be a runaway hit with busy folks. \"Jublia Match makes it ridiculously easy for them to capture the networking value at an event. It's a smarter way to network and helps our users get a good return on investment from the time and money spent attending such an event.\"\n\nMothernist\n\nSELF-HELP sites for working women are a dime a dozen, but Mothernist cuts through all the long-winded caring and sharing rhetoric with a goal-oriented approach to improving the emotional well-being of the burnt out modern female.\n\nDespite its name, Mothernist is not just for mothers. \"The name is a combination of mother and modern women, to reach out to those aged 25 to 45,\" says founder Julie Goldstein, a Belgian psychologist who moved to Singapore from London eight months ago.\n\nShe started the site in September, to \"raise awareness around psychological issues in Asia\".\n\nHer focus is on mental health and well-being which are often neglected when caught up in the hustle and bustle of modern living. \"Tiredness, not having a clear sense of purpose, feeling overwhelmed and anxiety attacks are all examples of mental health issues,\" she says.\n\nTargeted at women from 25 to 45, it offers tips and advice on eating well, the importance of taking personal time out, and how to cope with mood swings during pregnancy, among other issues.\n\nBut rather than have endless articles to scroll through, Dr Goldstein puts these tips across in the form of videos, to make it more appealing to time-strapped women.\n\n\"When you watch a video, you're not just listening to what the presenter says. But you observe the body language which is very visual, and which conveys the message more effectively than the written word,\" she says. Each video, sourced from external content providers, is between two and five minutes long.\n\n\"The videos are non-preachy and get the message across quickly,\" she adds. There are articles on the website, but a majority of the information is put across through concise video clips.\n\nAnother handy tool that she has on the website, is a link-up with talktala, an online platform for group therapy, based in the United States.\n\nAt any time of the day, users can go online to talk to a certified therapist. Sharing problems on a therapist-led forum is free, but there is a fee to pay for a personal chat with a therapist.\n\n\"The service is good for people who are not able to take time off or may feel shy about stepping forward to meet a therapist,\" says Dr Goldstein, who also runs an online therapy practice.\n\nShe hopes that in the Asian context where certain social stigmas in relation to mental health prevail, the website will offer another avenue and tool for women to deal with the pressures of a complex multi-tasking lifestyle.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The non-cumulative non-convertible non-voting class N preference shares have a payout of 4.7 per cent.\n\nThe reason for the bank's action is that the new shares will be Basel III compliant and qualify as Tier 1 capital.\n\nDBS said that \"the fact that the existing preference shares no longer fully qualify as Tier I capital of DBS Bank constitutes a preference share change of qualification event\" under the Basel III capital adequacy requirements implemented by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Jan 1, 2013.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, DBS said that it was \"proposing to accept tenders amounting to $800,000,000 in liquidation preference of existing preference shares, or a lower or greater aggregate amount at (its) discretion\".\n\nHolders who wish to participate must do so by 5pm Singapore time on Nov 21, 2013.\n\nThe tender does not apply to the retail tranche issued also in 2010 - an $800 million 4.7 per cent non-cumulative non-convertible non-voting class O preference shares callable in November 2020.\n\n\"We are starting with the institutional tranche - to see market reaction,\" said a bank spokesman.\n\nIf the response is \"overwhelming\", a bigger issue of the new notes could be considered, said Clifford Lee, DBS Bank head of fixed income.\n\nThe 4.7-4.9 per cent payout and shorter tenor of the new preference shares are seen as \"investor friendly\" and attractive relative to a recent perpetual issue by United Overseas Bank (UOB).\n\nIn July, UOB sold $850 million of perpetual notes paying 4.9 per cent that were Basel III compliant. Yesterday, the notes were quoted at $102.35-$102.85, yielding 4.335-4.219 per cent.\n\n\"Instead of a price nearer to 4.2 per cent, they're (DBS) paying 4.7-4.9,\" said a banking source.\n\nStill, some investors sold off the existing DBS preference shares after the announcement, causing prices to fall to $100.51-$101.398 from $102.52 on Wednesday. They could be only looking at the exchange at par, and not the coupon of the new bonds, suggested the source.\n\nSaid Gary Dugan, Coutts chief investment officer for Asia and Middle East: \"Anything (bank perpetuals) above 4 per cent is attractive.\"\n\nInterest rates are likely to remain low for the next 2-3 years and perpetuals still remain very attractive, he added.\n\nUnder MAS Notice 637, effective on Jan 1, 2013, Tier 1 securities have a point of non-viability (PONV) loss-absorbing feature. What this means is that investors or debt-holders will have to face a partial principal writedown or conversion into common equity when the PONV is being triggered by MAS. The PONV is triggered when MAS decides that a bank is no longer viable, or when public-sector support is required.\n\nSeparately, a UOB spokeswoman said that the bank would not comment on future capital management plans, when asked if it might consider similar exchanges for its non-Basel compliant preference shares.\n\nAt OCBC Bank, Ang Suat Ching, its head of funding and capital management, said that \"while our existing preference shares are not Basel III compliant, they will continue to qualify substantially as additional Tier 1 capital over the next few years under MAS's transitional Basel III rules\".\n\n\"Our Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio as at end-September was 14.3 per cent, a level that we are comfortable with. We continuously assess our capital and financial requirements, as well as market conditions, in determining any early redemption or new issuances of capital instruments.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/younger-buyers-spice-bentleys-cars", "site_title": "Younger buyers spice up Bentley's cars", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nYounger buyers spice up Bentley's cars\n\nThey prefer two-door Continental coupes and convertibles in bold, bright colours\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nREFLECTING perhaps old money and the establishment, most four-door Bentleys - such as the Mulsanne and Flying Spur - on Singapore roads are in understated white, greyish-white or black. But the recent influx of foreign tycoons here, plus younger buyers, has spiced this up with purchases of two-door Continental coupes and convertibles in bolder \"burned orange, St James red and Silverlake (a bluish-silver)\" finishes.\n\nYounger, below-40 buyers accounted for 15 per cent of the 110 Bentleys sold here in the first nine months of this year, with those aged 40 and above (including middle-aged businessmen) making up the remainder. The luxury marque has seen a steady sales creep - from 49 units sold in 2010, to 60 in 2011 and 93 cars last year.\n\nThe relatively subtle colour schemes preferred here are generally reflective of the South-east Asian market, Robin Peel, Bentley's head of marketing and communications for the Asia-Pacific, told BT.\n\n\"Our Middle Eastern customers are more adventurous,\" he said, preferring bright blues, sunburst oranges and reds and yellows - recounting a Saudi princess who ordered a Mulsanne in bright metallic \"sequin blue\" to match a dress for a special function.\n\nWhile Bentley has also come up with customised colours such as \"dragon red and pearl pink\" for young, rich Chinese female buyers, it however, draws a line at the outrageous, with Mr Peel saying that the company tries to politely steer customers away from such requests.\n\nColour preferences are just one aspect of the bespoke details to which Bentley pays careful attention.\n\nOver and above the precision and zero tolerance on its assembly lines, what becomes evident during a visit to the British marque's plant in Crewe, Cheshire, is its great pride in tradition and craftsmanship, not to mention luxe materials like the best leathers and wood, that go into its cars.\n\nAt its leather stitching section for example, various patterns for the head-rest of seats are on display, with these ranging from subtle variations of the Bentley logo to other options such as a red Chinese dragon, or a green palm tree framed by two khanjars (curved Arab daggers).\n\nAsked whether the shift in spending power from the West to the East has led to changes in customer preferences, Mr Peel's response was: \"While the dollars may have moved, many Chinese customers for example, don't want a made-for-China car per se but one that is Western and global as they think globally. China has a lot of customers who have a bizarre respect for British things, like the royal family.\" And Bentleys too, apparently.\n\nPaul Jones, Bentley's head of product management, and in charge of product planning and strategy, stressed that \"customer feedback will very much influence development of the group's next product - whether a new model or next generation of products\".\n\n\"While our two-door coupes and convertibles were mainly the preserve of Western markets, the big drivers for the coming SUV was for instance its truly global market,\" he said. The off-road technology for the SUV will be drawn from the VW Group, which owns Bentley, which is a great advantage, he added.\n\nMr Jones said that in Bentley's case, \"one of its great strengths is its breadth\", adding: \"For example in 2003, what other brand can, on one hand, win the Le Mans - the most prestigious 24-hour sports car race - and also deliver a limousine to the Queen for her Golden Jubilee, and do both credibly. So Bentley has incredible breadth in luxury and performance.\"\n\nOn the \"green\" front, the group - which kicked off its environmental programme in 2008 - has developed new engines including a high-performance four-litre V-8 which has helped to cut carbon emissions by some 40 per cent. \"Here, we have made great steps forward without much trade-off in performance,\" said Mr Jones.\n\nWill an electric Bentley be next on the cards then?\n\n\"A plug-in hybrid has much to recommend it. It is high-torque, quiet and refined, so we are looking seriously at it,\" he said, adding that Bentley can again access this technology in the VW group, which is already offering a number of \"plug-ins\" including those in the Porsche Panamera.\n\nBut diesel-powered Bentleys are a big no-no, said Mike Sayer, the group's communications manager for product and motorsports, as customers, when surveyed, gave a resounding thumbs down to this as they want only petrol-powered cars.\n\nReviving its heritage, Bentley is about to go racing again soon in the GT-3 series in Europe, and will conduct its first \"test\" race in Abu Dhabi on Dec 13. The marque sees racing as a means to improve the road car technologically, and at the same time, boost car sales.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But first, a little vamping up.\n\nFor their first overseas venture, the people behind Pind Balluchi, a 24-outlet chain of casual eateries from India knew that plainly replicating their existing concept wouldn't cut it in the Singapore context.\n\nSo instead of the rustic Punjab fare they are known for, its 130-seat Singapore outpost in Clarke Quay is an upscale bar and grill that features swish interiors and a range of international cocktails to lure locals, expatriates and tourists alike.\n\nBut the restaurant hasn't totally abandoned its roots. According to head chef Nishesh Mani Tripathi, who has worked at the Leela and Claridges Hotels in India, everything is prepped in strict accordance to age-old methods.\n\nThe pathar lamb kebab ($26) , for instance, is pounded by hand as ancient recipes decree, and dusted with dagadh phool or stone flower - a rare type of algae that is found naturally growing on stone in the Hyderabad region of India. The meat is infused with an earthy aroma as it cooks over a charcoal heated granite stone.\n\nThe galouti kebab ($28) - legend says it was created to appease a toothless Nawab king - is minced 32 times and infused with 136 spices, the same way chefs used to do it in the royal kitchens, chef Tripathi claims. He gleaned the recipe from top Indian chef and fellow Lucknow native, Imtiaz Qureshi whom he had worked with previously. The aromatic, griddle-seared discs of lamb meat have a texture that's a cross between a rillette and a slab of foie gras.\n\nTo veer away from the stereotype of Indian food as heavy curries and butter-laden briyanis, grilled tandoori items take centrestage at Pind Balluchi, and quick lunch sets for the weekday office crowd are in the works. Most items are also currently available in bite-sized portions off Pind Balluchi's bar menu.\n\nIf all goes well, chef Tripathi says the group - owned by parent company F&B Asia, which also owns Harry's Holdings here - hopes to open two to three more outlets of Pind Balluchi in Singapore, with each one varying slightly in concept.

Revenue rose 76 per cent to $76.7 million.\n\nRevenue from property development more than doubled to $64.1 million in Q3 2013 from $30 million in Q3 2012.

The site's attributable gross floor area of 328,397 sq ft is more than half of its current landbank of 500,103 sq ft.\n\nEarnings per share increased from 0.69 cent in Q3 2012 to 1.35 cents in Q3 2013. Net asset value per share stood at 23.86 cents at end-September 2013, up from 21.25 cents at end-December 2012. The counter closed unchanged yesterday at 60 cents. Roxy released its results after the stock market closed.\n\nIn the first nine months, the group's net profit rose 36 per cent to $47.4 million from nearly $35 million in the same period last year.

And notwithstanding doomsayers' predictions, don't expect a current account deficit on the country's balance of payments anytime soon.\n\nDespite its acknowledgement that inflation is slowly rising, Bank Negara Malaysia left the overnight policy rate at 3 per cent at its meeting on Thursday. It clearly signalled that governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz was wary of doing anything that could pose a downside risk to growth.\n\n\"Looking ahead, inflation is expected to edge up, driven by domestic cost factors,\" the central bank said in a statement. However, it added that the inflation outlook would be tempered by various factors, including a stable external price environment and moderate domestic demand pressures.\n\nWhy did it not raise rates? The central bank was almost explicit: There were \"uncertainties in the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation\".\n\nMs Zeti clearly knew that growth would continue to be subdued. Others agree with that assessment.\n\n\"We are forecasting third-quarter gross domestic product to remain sluggish, improving slightly to 4.4 per cent from 4.3 in the second quarter,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin in a recent report.\n\nMr Chua's full-year forecast for 2013 is 4.3 per cent, and he expects 2014 to fare better with at least 4.8 per cent. Both forecasts, however, are below government projections.\n\nInflation is rising as a result of an oil price hike in September. Indeed, prices rose 2.6 per cent during the month, driven by increases in transport and food prices.\n\nWhile the full-year inflation number is expected to be around 2 per cent, Mr Chua thinks that 2014 could see inflation topping 3 per cent largely because of an expected fuel price hike later in the year.\n\nMr Chua also thinks that electricity tariffs could be raised next year. These suppositions are based on the fact that Prime Minister Najib Razak had promised to cut subsidies by 15 per cent in his recent budget.\n\nFor these reasons, both Merrill Lynch and Barclays Bank expect interest rates to be hiked by at least 25 basis points next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia's trade data for September surpassed analysts' expectations. Exports rose 5.6 per cent year on year compared with the street's 5 per cent forecast. Imports grew 2.8 per cent compared to the market's consensus of 5.4 per cent.\n\nAs a result, the trade surplus clocked in at RM8.7 billion (S$3.4 billion), the largest in more than 10 months.\n\nThe improvement in exports stemmed from gains in both mining and manufacturing, with exports to the region and China improving slightly.\n\nThe import drop was mainly because of a decline in capital goods' imports, which fell by 2.3 per cent year on year largely due to an already high base.\n\nThe strengthening trade balance should allay concerns among economists about Malaysia's rapidly shrinking surplus on the current account of its balance of payments. The speed of its decline had raised fears that the country could once again post twin deficits as it did in 1998.\n\nThe currencies of India and Indonesia have been attacked following just such a phenomenon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the longest time in Singapore, the criticism has been that the former hasn't kept up with the latter.\n\nThe newly established Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) at Nanyang Technological University aims to redress that. Housed at Blocks 7, 37, 38 and 43 at Gillman Barracks, the centre will present contemporary art, host a research centre in collaboration with NTU's School of Art, Design & Media, and also host a residency and fellowship programme for artists and cultural producers from all over the globe.\n\n\"The CCA was envisaged as a platform for dialogue between research in the arts and the impact of globalisation on the art world,\" says Professor Ute Meta Bauer, founding director of the CCA at NTU's School of Art, Media and Design.\n\nThe CCA also hopes to serve as a hub for the arts in the South-east Asian region - that connects the local with the wider region and beyond. The CCA is developed as a research centre, supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, with the aim to stimulate cross-disciplinary exchanges.\n\n\"The CCA's main areas of activity will be research, exhibitions and residencies, and its mandate is to engage deeper and to cultivate a culture of research in the field,\" explains Ms Bauer, who was appointed following a global search by NTU.\n\nShe notes how the art world in South-east Asia is ambivalent. \"On the one hand, it is highly professionalised, and on the other, it lacks basic infrastructure depending on what country or region we talk about.\"\n\nMs Bauer most recently served as Dean of the School of Fine Arts with London's Royal College of Art.\n\nPrior to that, she was at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, where she was an associate professor for Visual Art in the School of Architecture and Planning. She was also the founding director of the Programme in Art, Culture, and Technology, as well as director of the MIT Visual Arts Programme.\n\nIn Asia, Ms Bauer was last year's co-director with Hou Hanru of the World Biennial Forum Number 1 - Shifting Gravity, a conference organised by Gwangju Biennale Foundation and the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations in Gwangju, South Korea, with a focus on biennial phenomena in various Asian regions.\n\nHaving worked for over 25 years in the contemporary arts field, Ms Bauer notes that it's always been crucial for her to connect practice and theory, artistic production and its dissemination.\n\n\"This approach will form the core of CCA's activities where intellectual endeavour feeds back into exhibition and public programmes, and vice versa.\" It's also open to exploring lesser known areas such as trans-disciplinary collaborations, while \"architecture and the future of cities, art and society, art and social change, will also be addressed, but through collaborations with various art centres in South-east Asia,\" highlights Ms Bauer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGUARD your wallets. With just over a month to go before Christmas, a rash of new boutiques are hanging up the holly as the plaster dries in their swank locations - just in time to catch the all-important festive shopping season.\n\nIf the opening of at least five fashion boutiques this month is any indication, it seems our little red dot has become quite the magnet for ambitious retailers seeking global domination. Swedish high street retailer COS, for one, will be unveiling its first outlet at Ion Orchard next Friday, while other brands like Roger Vivier, Valextra and Kate Spade Saturday have also just opened their first boutiques here recently. American designer Tom Ford will also make his debut at Marina Bay Sands early next year, while French luxury leather brand Goyard will unveil its Takashimaya Shopping Centre boutique later this month.\n\nAnd many shoppers here would be already be familiar with the latest entrants into the retail fray, many of which are established marques in Europe or the US. It is precisely this level of brand awareness by homegrown shoppers, many of whom are frequent travellers or online shoppers, that has attracted fashion companies looking to expand abroad.\n\n\"Singapore is a more established market in the region, yet strategic in the luxury arena with a very dynamic and international clientele that seeks sophisticated and high quality products,\" says Marco Franchini, CEO of Italian leather accessories brand Valextra, which just launched its first Southeast-Asian store at Paragon yesterday.\n\nThe opening of COS, for example, has been highly anticipated by fans of the brand here, who have been getting their retail fix from the nearest outlets in Hong Kong. Known for its minimalist, trend-bucking pieces, the sister brand of Swedish fast fashion behemoth H&M has achieved cult status since its launch in 2007 in London. The brand will be opening its second outlet later in the year in the new Westgate mall in Jurong East.\n\n\"As a city Singapore is considered a premium shopping destination and there appears to be a demand for brands in the market,\" says Marie Honda, overall brand responsible for COS.\n\n\"We hope that the customers in Singapore will like what they find in store and appreciate what we think of as a high fashion aesthetic and great quality garments, offered at a comparably affordable price.\"\n\nWhile budget battles in Washington may have affected spending in the US and Europe is still racked by economic uncertainty, retailers are confident that consumers here will keep cash registers ringing, even if shoppers here are inundated by a deluge of new brands.\n\n\"A market that is competitive is also vibrant, and we believe there is demand for unique product offerings,\" says executive director of the Valiram Group, Mukesh Valiram. The Valiram Group opened lifestyle concept boutique Kate Spade Saturday at Ion Orchard in October, just a month after the US brand launched the first store for this new concept in Los Angeles. A younger, more casual offshoot of parent company Kate Spade New York, the store prides itself on a constant rotation of new offerings, and accompanies an online store to tap on the e-commerce boom.\n\nIn fact, the convenience and vast variety associated with online shopping questions the need for retailers to expand their brick-and-mortar operations in our relatively small market.\n\nAs avid shopper Dr Jade Kua, a specialist in pediatric emergency medicine, says, \"To be honest, most of us are global shoppers and the net-savvy ones can even buy these brands from their armchair, so I don't see this entrance of new stores changing anybody's behaviour as a shopper.\"\n\nFor other shoppers like entrepreneur Jia Min Huang, a bank executive and frequent traveller who bought a Goyard bag last July in Paris, the experience of shopping at a brand's international flagship holds plenty of insider style cachet; not to mention the more attractive price points at the country of origin.\n\n\"The service in Paris was impeccable even though I was interested in just one bag,\" says Ms Huang. \"But I will certainly be interested if the new stores here stock special-edition pieces. Also, it's a plus if I could place an order for a colour that I want that may be out of stock, or make use of a personalisation service, which would not be an option when shopping overseas because my order would not be ready in time for my departure.\"\n\nBeing able to buy products from a brand that is unavailable here also ups its exclusivity factor, given the assumption that it takes a certain knowledge of global fashion trends to gain awareness of such labels.\n\n\"It used to be a novelty when one can only purchase Goyard in Paris, and everyone wanted to get their hands on a Goyard,\" remarks Marie Choo, director of her own public relations and marketing agency. \"With accessibility to such labels here, serious fashionistas will have to up their ante and move on to the next big brand before it gets mainstream.\n\n\"I have gotten my Goyard fix some years back and now I have moved on to Moynat. I have even asked a friend to hand carry a Moynat tote bag for me all the way from Paris, since it is the only city where the brand is.\"\n\nWhen asked, however, if fans who have gotten their brand fix overseas for years may be blase, now that the label is finally available here, Sabine Brunner, brand manager of French shoes and accessories label Roger Vivier, is far from bothered. The fashion house opened its first South-east Asian boutique at Takashimaya Shopping Centre last week.\n\n\"Roger Vivier is not a fashion brand,\" quips Ms Brunner, whose company's products are worn by celebrities like Cate Blanchett and Carla Bruni. \"The new customers will go for a buckle shoe or bag; the fashionistas will go for newer creations such as the comma heel or the Prismick bags. The market for unique luxury accessories like those by Roger Vivier is not saturated. At the end of the day, there are very few brands that can combine elegance, modernity, quality and selective distribution.\"\n\nIndeed, one devotee to the brand has long been anticipating the opening of a store here to boost her collection of Roger Vivier shoes. \"I first heard about Roger Vivier from my mum,\" says Cindy Tay, who owns 10 pairs of Roger Vivier shoes. \"I believe he used to design for Dior and she had a pair of shoes designed by him. And I first got my own pair of Vivier shoes from Bergdorf Goodman some years back. It was a pair of shocking pink sandals with his signature bejewelled covered buckle. I still love wearing them today.\"\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether these new brands will make it in our competitive retail landscape, one thing's for sure, true shopaholics will have little reason to complain when it comes to the sheer variety of labels available just a cab ride away.\n\n\"I have always liked Tom Ford since his Gucci days and used to only be able to buy from his namesake label when I am overseas, so it is nice to know that it will soon be available in Singapore,\" says Ms Choo. \"It is exciting to see big names coming to Singapore. It simply means the fashion industry is now seeing Singapore as an important market on a global scale.\"\n\nThe hit list\n\nTired of the same old labels? Check out these must-visit stores to amp up your wardrobes - and Christmas wish list.\n\n1 COS\n\n#03-23 Ion Orchard\n\nAn acronym for 'collection of style', COS is the sleeker, more high-fashion offspring of H&M. Load up with on-the-cusp silhouettes and streamlined staples typical of Swedish design aesthetics when the store opens on Nov 15.\n\n2 Roger Vivier\n\n#02-12F Takashimaya Shopping Centre\n\nNew to this shoes and accessories house? Then try on its iconic Pilgrim pumps, the silver-buckled design made famous by Catherine Deneueve in the seminal film Belle de Jour.\n\n3 Goyard\n\nTakashimaya Shopping Centre\n\nWhen its doors swing open later this month, make a beeline for one of the house's luxe trunks. After all, Goyard was founded in 1792 as a maker of boxes and trunks. You could even order a special trunk for storing champagnes, tea or even a bicycle.\n\n4 Kate Spade Saturday\n\n#B1-27 Ion Orchard\n\nLazy shoppers, get savvy and conduct your Christmas shopping in this one store. It's brimming with plenty of small leather goods and other gift options, ranging from jewellery to umbrellas and parkas for a pooch, all covered in the brand's fun colours and prints.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was intended that workers would down tools across 22 provinces and the action would be extended if the government did not respond to their demands. The call for the strike action by the Confederation of Indonesian Workers Union failed to draw millions. Several thousand workers did, however, go on strike. There were some demonstrations on the streets of Jakarta and in neighbouring industrial estates.\n\nThe workers demanded a 3.7 million rupiah (S$410) monthly wage for 2014. The Indonesian Employers Association held that the workers' demand would be tantamount to a 50 per cent wage increase and warned that many foreign investors would relocate if the government accepted such a demand. Besides, the demand would not address the needs of those in the informal sector, where about 40 per cent of Indonesians work. Only seven million out of a population of 240 million are union members. A repeat of last year's 44 per cent wage rise could have jeopardised jobs, although it is true that inflation, which soared following a sharp rise in fuel prices in June, has eroded some of the workers' gains.\n\nAnother concern is that Indonesia's economic growth is slowing. The economy expanded 5.8 per cent in the second quarter - the first time since 2010 that the economy has failed to grow by at least 6 per cent. The country's trade account unexpectedly swung back to a deficit in September. The external deficit is expected to pile further pressure on the ailing rupiah, which plummeted earlier this year as investors fled on fears that the US Federal Reserve was set to \"taper\" its huge stimulus programme.\n\nSince then, the Fed has made it clear that it will continue with its full US$85 billion a month bond-buying programme for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the rupiah has not bounced back and has remained one of Asia's worst-performing currencies. The exchange rate slipped to 11,360 from 11,350 to the US dollar after the trade figures were released. The Indonesian central bank has forecast inflation rising to 9.8 per cent at the end of the year, and raised its benchmark interest rate by 1.5 percentage points in early June to 7.25 per cent to deal with price pressures as well as the weakening rupiah.\n\nIndonesia's Manpower and Transmigration Minister Muhaimin Iskandar has advised workers to consider their companies' ability to increase wages. But that would be difficult for a union to judge. Thus, it may be appropriate for Indonesia to explore the possibility of imposing a compulsory system of mediation and arbitration on both industrial workers and their employers. Industrial unrest serves no one; it will be bad for employers, and probably worse for workers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net profit a year ago was RMB28.6 million and earnings per share 0.57 RMB cents. Revenues jumped 50 per cent to RMB279.7 million.\n\nBonvests doubles Q3 gain to $5.6m\n\nHOTEL and property company Bonvests Holdings said its third-quarter net profit doubled to $5.6 million, or 1.404 cents per share, as better sales in its hotel and industrial divisions offset lower revenue from property rentals. Bonvests expects the rental market in Singapore and Tunis to remain stable in the near term, but market conditions for the hotel and industrial businsses will be challenging.\n\nWee Hur 9-mth earnings up\n\nCONSTRUCTION and development group Wee Hur Holdings said its nine-month net profit rose to $13.1 million, or 1.53 cents per share as at end-September from the growth of its property development business. It reported a construction order book worth $326.3 million as at Sept 30, which will last through fiscal 2015.\n\nLum Chang Q1 earnings soar\n\nBUILDER Lum Chang Holdings said net profit surged to $13.8 million, or 3.71 cents per share, from $3.3 million for the first quarter ended September, as higher contributions from associated companies offset a decline in revenue.\n\nOUE Q3 earnings down 43.9%\n\nPROPERTY developer OUE posted a 43.9 per cent drop in third-quarter net profit for the period ended September, with earnings of $13.4 million, or 1.47 cents per share. Despite higher revenue from the property development arm and the inclusion of revenue from US Bank Tower acquired on June 18, profit declined due to lower occupancy at Tower One of 6 Shenton Way.\n\nAbsence of one-time gain hits FE Orchard\n\nPROPERTY developer Far East Orchard said its third-quarter net profit attributable to equity-holders fell to $5.3 million from $125.6 million in the absence of a year-ago $116.2 million one-off gain from the spin-off of Far East Hospitality Trust. Far East Orchard expects a net loss in the last quarter of the year because of one-time costs related to hospitality joint ventures.\n\nRaffles Education Corp in the red for Q1\n\nPRIVATE school operator Raffles Education Corp fell into the red in its fiscal first quarter ended September, with $2.6 million of net loss, or 0.25 cents per share, from a year-ago profit of $4 million. The year-ago period benefited from a one-time $18.3 million gain from the sale of Oriental University.\n\nAircraft-leasing goes well for A-Sonic\n\nLISTED aerospace and air logistics group A-Sonic Aviation continued to grow its aircraft-leasing business with the placement of its fourth single-aisle MD83 plane to Euro-Asia airline.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOVER the course of his career, Marc Sadler has received numerous letters and photos from strangers in hospital beds, thanking him for saving their lives. It's odd since the Frenchman is not a doctor, but an industrial designer.\n\n\"They thank me for designing the motorcycle back protector that saved their lives,\" he explains. \"I never thought I would be saving lives when I became a designer. That thought is so beautiful, much more than the shape of a lamp or a chair that I designed.\" His life-saving back protector for Dainese, the market leader for motorcycle apparel and accessories, is now in the permanent collection at New York's Museum of Modern Art.\n\nHe was in town recently to show his pieces for Italian lighting brand, Foscarini, such as the Twiggy and Tress lamps. Even though he has added lights and furniture into his repertoire, Sadler, 67, began his career as a sports designer.\n\nHe was in the first batch of industrial design graduates from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, in Paris in 1968. \"It was such a great course, because it combined both industrial and aesthetics which I love,\" he says. But back then, no one knew about industrial design. \"It was difficult to be a designer then.\"\n\nHowever, it was three years later while recovering from a skiing accident which left him with a fractured right foot that Sadler hit upon his first successful product - a recyclable thermoplastic rubber ski boot that would reduce the risk of accidents by immobilizing the ankle.\n\nSoon, sports brands came calling, such as Adidas, Puma and Nike, which Sadler designed shoes for. His work for Nike included the first water-repellent thermo plastic rubber slipper that is still in production today, 20 years later.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to design for brands including kitchens for Boffi and Ernestomeda, furniture for Cassina, and Meritalia. Along the way, he has also put his mark on household appliances for Moulinex and Krups.\n\nIt seems that nothing is too difficult for him. He said yes to Italian brand Ifi when asked to design a gelato display case, despite never designing one before. The result is Bellevue, a sleek clear top fridge that allows consumers to see the hand-made gelato, but at the same time, keeps out condensation.\n\nAs with most of his other projects, Sadler makes it a point to visit the client's factory and even work alongside the staff.\n\n\"It helps me to better understand the market,\" he says. \"Being on the ground encourages an exchange of ideas, which I then develop or tune.\"\n\nHis role as a designer is to \"answer questions that companies who hire me have\", he says. \"But for consumers, the aim is to design a product that makes their life easier or better.\"\n\nAsk what makes him different from the many other designers, and he says it is his way of combining technology and art in his design. He cites the example of Twiggy, a standing lamp for Foscarini, which resembles a fishing rod with a lampshade at the end. Incidentally, it was while fishing that Sadler got the idea for the lamp.\n\nThe prototype for Twiggy \"had a cost problem. It was too expensive to manufacture, and no one would want to buy it,\" he says. There was also another technical problem - temperature fluctuations throughout the day would distort the curvature of the lamp.\n\n\"We had to work out ways to make sure that the curvature would stabilise, and we finally did it by using a system of counterweights,\" say Sadler. \"This took several years to achieve, and in the process also shaved off one-third of the production cost.\"\n\nBorn in Austria, he has lived and worked in Europe, North America and Asia. \"But I'm a French living in Italy today. When I'm in France, I tend to defend the Italians, as the French don't really understand what's happening in Italy, and vice versa,\" he says.\n\nHe agrees when it is suggested that the Italians are more into industrial design than the French are. \"The French see design as something you put into a company, and they use the designer the same way as they would with a production or warehouse personnel,\" he says. \"This is not my philosophy of design.\"\n\nThe Italians are different. \"Design is seen as a service, and the Italians don't hesitate to want the best designer for the best product. The French are not like this. That's why I have few French customers,\" he quips.\n\nFor Sadler, a successful product is one which may not come with a high price tag, but yet is very popular with consumers. \"Actually, it is more difficult to make an inexpensive product. Some pieces that I design for certain brands are very expensive, but they only sell a handful each year. I do not consider that good.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The breezy, open-air space overlooking the berthed yachts in Sentosa Cove transport one to the glitzy shores of Monaco or to a laid-back seaside wharf in Australia - or anywhere but India.\n\nAnd that's just how the five friends - Ravi Kiran Sethi, Hemant Rangeen, Aarti Ahuja and Subha Vilasni - behind three-month-old Earl of Hindh like it. Bound by their love of food, the group found lacking a place where they could have traditional, fine Indian food and personalised service but in a non-conventional setting.\n\nModern veneers aside, however, flavours are as traditional as they can get at Earl of Hindh, Mr Sethi disclaims.\n\nNew Delhi-born head chef Jaswant Singh Negi is a recent import from India, where he has worked with luxury hotel chains in India such as the Taj, Radisson and Ambassador group of hotels. He most recently helped to open Punjab Grill in New Delhi.\n\nIn keeping with the restaurant's name, the menu is a throwback to the Indian cuisine during the British reign, when Indian maharajas hosted some of the most lavish feasts showcasing exotic dishes, according to Mr Sethi. He elaborates: \"The art of fine Indian cooking has disappeared over the years and one of the aims of Earl of Hindh is to revive the aromas, flavours and art of royal cooking.\"\n\nThe grilled starters - cooked in two openly displayed tandoori ovens - are the restaurant's main highlights. The signature Earl of Hindh Kakori ($44) is a must-try: the melt-in-your-mouth kebab of finely minced lamb is marinated with 26 spices and chargrilled on a skewer along with a sprinkle of saffron, while the murgh malai kabab ($28) has chunks of tandoor-grilled boneless chicken thigh sheathed in creamy cheese sauce.\n\nAlso very tasty is the desi hara kebab ($22), or delightfully fluffy pancakes made of spinach and chan dal and stuffed with cottage cheese before being panfried. From the range of curries, the kadhai paneer ($21) stands out for its blend of cottage cheese cubes, tomatoes, onion and bell pepper, while the maa ki dal makhanwali ($18) is a melange of black lentils, kidney beans and tomato sauce.\n\nLooking for more international flavour? Dishes such as the dariyai tikka ($32) features yoghurt-marinated cubes of salmon chargrilled in the tandoor, or the khumb makai pala ($18) which combines button mushrooms, American corn and spinach in a curry being a refreshing, cosmopolitan lift to the menu.\n\nClassic desserts such as the Jamun-e-Gulab ($16) get a new look too. They come served on a stick rather than in a bowl of rose-scented sugar syrup, because \"usually no one drinks the syrup anyway\" says chef Negi. The Aam Tukda ($17) is a plated popsicle of frozen mango and milk puree.\n\nThe restaurant additionally carries over 18 types of premium single malt whisky, predominantly in single cask, cask strength and non-chill filtered editions and mostly from Scotland, with a handful of labels from leading Indian distillery Amrut being the exception.\n\nOn the blueprint are whisky and Indian food pairing dinners conducted by whisky experts in partnership with alcohol distributor Whisky World Singapore,\n\nAnd though the restaurant is just over three months old, the five partners hint that they are already working on a second concept.

That was because Fan hardly sold his paintings commercially, choosing to donate most of them to charity. So his works rarely come up in art auctions or other art markets. He also had one patron who collected most of his works.\n\n\"Because he came from a wealthy background, he didn't have to sell his works for a living,\" explains Ms Liu. But he was passionate about painting, and taught and mentored a generation of Chinese ink artists in Singapore - many of whom remember him fondly.\n\nMs Liu, 23, decided to hold an exhibition of Fan's works after interviewing a number of Fan's former students. This is her second exhibition after she opened her own gallery, Asia Art Collective, earlier in July.\n\nMs Liu first learnt about the Chinese ink artist as a teacher - of acclaimed artists such as the late Chua Ek Kay and Chen Kezhan. His other well-regarded students include Ling Cher Eng, Lim Kay Hiong, Nai Swee Leng, Tan Oe Pang and Lee Soo Chee.\n\n\"I was curious to learn more about him,\" she shares. \"I always like talking to older Singaporean artists and hearing their stories because of their commitment and dedication to art.\" Ms Liu father is the acclaimed Chinese ink artist Liu Guo, who made Singapore his home in 1996, following an invitation from the Singapore government.\n\n\"Fan's students like Lee Soo Chee, Nai Swee Leng, Lim Kay Hiong expressed gratitude to their teacher, not only for their skills, but also how he inspired them with his simple philosophy of life, and his upright and righteous character,\" shares Ms Liu.\n\nBesides teaching, Fan headed the Hwa Han Art Society when it was formed in the early 1970s. The society held group shows and also solo exhibitions of Fan's works in various venues including the National Museum.\n\nWhen Fan passed on in 1989, the National Museum Art Gallery held a retrospective of his works featuring more than 100 of them. In 1993, Fan's family donated 50 paintings to the National Museum. The last exhibition of works was held by the Singapore Art Museum, in 1998, which also showcased the works of his students.\n\nMs Liu's idea of a solo exhibition on Fan's works now is to allow the public to be exposed again to his paintings and poetry. More than 20 works of different subjects and themes will be shown, loaned mainly from his students.\n\n\"Although Chinese ink paintings could be seen as very traditional, the modern Shanghai \"Xieyi\" style is very well executed in his paintings. There is a fusion of poetry and calligraphy with the painting,\" describes Ms Liu, who had worked in a contemporary Chinese art gallery and a local auction house before setting up her own gallery.\n\nThe composition of Chinese poetry with painting is a talent and practice that's now getting rarer, she points out. Works in this exhibition will range from S$3,800 to S$14,800.\n\nAsia Art Collective's exhibition on Fan Chang Tien will be held from Nov 9-30 at 19 Tanglin Road #03-42, Tanglin Shopping Centre. Call 6733-2155\n\nMentored by Shanghai greats\n\nFan Chang Tien (1907-1987) was born to a wealthy Teochew family in Guangdong. Since young, he was deeply inspired by the literary Chinese tradition and was well-versed in the Chinese schools of philosophy, identifying himself with Confucianism.\n\nFan studied in the Shanghai Xin Hua Art College and then in the Shanghai Changming Academy of Art. He was mentored by the finest artists in Shanghai - Wang Geyi, Wang Yiting, Zhu Wenyun and Pan Tianshou - who were outstanding disciples of the grandmaster of the Shanghai School of Painting, Wu Changshuo.\n\nThe Shanghai School of Painting as inherited by Fan carries an expressive style characterised by powerful yet controlled brushworks and vibrant colours and sharp contrasts - derived from the fusion of Eastern and Western influences of Shanghai society in the 1900s.\n\nWhen Fan moved to Singapore in 1956, he was already an accomplished artist. He had also worked in Hong Kong and Bangkok as an art educator and artist. When he was in Singapore, Fan taught for a short while in Chung Cheng High School and in Whampoa Secondary School.\n\nFrom 1960, Fan began teaching and mentoring groups of students from home.\n\nFan's oeuvre of painting consists of a diverse array of subjects. His favourite subjects are from nature - bamboo and orchids, mountain birds and eagles, the lotus flower and plum blossoms - each symbolising ideologies and philosophies which he identified with. Fan painted in the \"Xieyi\" style, which is essentially a carefree and expressive painting style that conveys meaning.\n\nFan often signed his paintings as \"??\" , or \"the gardener\", and saw his ink and brush as his gardening tools and his paintings, the plants.\n\n- By CHEAH UI-HOON\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This resulted from higher contribution from sales of residences and land development rights (LDRs), as demand for high-quality homes continued to outstrip supply.\n\nThe Myanmar property developer's turnover surge was due mainly to the recognition of $15.1 million in revenue from the sale of LDRs for two buildings in Zone B of Star City, the group's largest residential project, along with an incentive fee of $2.3 million.\n\nEarnings per share were 0.29 cent, against a loss per share of 0.44 cent the previous year.\n\nAdministrative expenses fell $3.23 million to $6.05 million as the previous corresponding quarter included a share-based payment of $5.4 million to the company's CEO.\n\nFor the first half-year to September, Yoma's profit attributable to equity-holders was $4.4 million, reversing from a $2.1 million loss a year ago, on the back of a 68 per cent jump in revenue to $42.4 million.\n\nYoma said sales continued to be strong at Star City. By end-September, 523 out of 528 of the units in its buildings A3 and A4 were sold, amounting to $60.9 million. But OCBC Investment Research analyst Eli Lee noted that this was up only marginally from the 513 units sold as at end-June.\n\nOf the $60.9 million, $7.23 million had been recognised in previous periods and an additional $4.3 million was recognised in Q2 based on a percentage- of-completion revenue recognition.\n\nIts gross profit margin slipped 2.3 percentage points to 44.9 per cent in Q2 due to lower revenue from the sales of higher margin project, Pun Hliang Golf Estate, leading OCBC's Mr Lee to keep his \"hold\" rating on the stock with an unchanged fair value estimate of 84 cents.\n\nNoting the strong take-up rate of Zone B so far, DBS Group Research analyst Tan Ai Teng remarked that it was \"a good quarter with improvement in property sales and construction\".\n\n\"We expect Yoma to sell LDRs of the two remaining blocks (of Zone B) soon. The company would also receive more incentive fees accordingly,\" she said.\n\n\"Furthermore, Yoma has $49 million of unrecognised revenue in Star City to be recognised over the next 15-21 months as construction progresses.\"\n\nShe maintained a \"buy\" on the company's stock at an unchanged target price of $1.02.\n\nYesterday, Yoma lost a cent to end at 77 cents after its results announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He finds inspiration in everyday life, became an artist because it made him happy, and his favourite music is the sound of birds, waves and the wind.\n\nBut despite his down-to-earth nature, the artist has a self-assigned mission - to work towards the preservation of Chinese ink painting as an art form, which he himself has chosen as his go-to style of creating works.\n\nIt's the \"charm and spirit\" that makes this art form worth preserving, says Nan Qi, who is a founding director of the Chinese Painting Association in China.\n\nAt his current solo exhibition at the Art Plural Gallery in Singapore, titled Authority Sex Money, the artist showcases a collection of works that express his views on the subject of contemporary Chinese ink painting.\n\nFor example, one of them titled Fortune Dot shows a man's silhouette against a dotted background. The subject is actually Mao Zedong, which the artist says can be recognised because of the lone dot on the silhouette that is in the same position as the mole on chairman Mao's face.\n\nHis exhibition will showcase 30 of works he created in 2006 and from 2010 till now. All are for sale, at prices from $6,000 to $120,000.\n\nOn the specific subject matter of the exhibition, Nan Qi is reticent. It's because he feels that \"art itself is more important than the ideology\", and the \"essence of art and artistic language\" is more important than the concepts behind them.\n\nHe fondly recalls the first time that he was drawn to painting, back when he served in the People's Liberation Army between 1979 and 1988. It was there that he attended their Fine Arts academy and studied Chinese ink painting.\n\n\"The army life was extremely dull and boring, and most people would spend their leisure time playing cards, smoking or drinking. I saved all my money to learn painting and it gave me fulfilment and a meaning of life,\" he says.\n\n\"Many of my classmates at the Fine Arts Academy are colonels now and my teacher, Professor Liu Dawei, is a general who serves as the president of the China Artists Association. I gave up many opportunities to become a high-ranking officer for the love of art and I never regretted it once.\"\n\nAlthough in the span of his career Nan Qi dabbled in oil and acrylic, he eventually returned to his first love - Chinese ink painting, becoming well-known among his Chinese and international peers as a master of ink dots.\n\nHis hope is that the developing Chinese economy will help further his cause to boost the image of Chinese ink art. \"The art of the Japanese drew unprecedented attention during their economic boom, so I believe that with the fast development of the Chinese economy, and increased understanding of our culture, contemporary Chinese ink art will be appreciated by more international audiences,\" he says.\n\nAuthority Sex Money will run till Nov 23 at the Art Plural Gallery at 38 Armenian Street. Opening hours are from 11am to 7pm daily, closed on Sundays and public holidays. Admission is free. Log on to www.artpluralgallery.com for more information\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But look closer and you'll find something quite macabre about the images - a maimed arm, a broken leg, a missing mouth or a pirate eye-patch.\n\nThese are no ordinary paintings. They were done by Singapore artist Huang Wei, who was a contemporary of the Nanyang artists. His obsession with the Old Masters like Caravaggio and Velazquez, however, set him apart from his peers such as Liu Kang and Georgette Chen, who were more interested in studying the modern French iconoclasts like Matisse and Cezanne.\n\nHuang worked as a studio photographer in the early to mid-1900s. He painted in his spare time, using photographs of children he took and transforming their images on canvas.\n\nBut he did not reproduce them exactly as they appeared in his photos. Instead, he rendered them as partially disfigured and melancholy-looking, to hint at the fact that not all these children survived the war - or that, if they did, suffered injuries. This morbid perspective perhaps explains why he never held a solo exhibition in his lifetime.\n\n'Black paintings'\n\nAlan Oei, director of Sculpture Square and curator of Huang's works, says: \"Most of our Nanyang artists painted in a 'happy' style, using vivid colours and pleasing subjects. Not many painted images that remind us of the war... it's as if the war didn't happen at all.\n\n\"Huang's paintings are important because they convey more pathos than your typical Nanyang painting.\"\n\nIndeed, Oei - who is a painter himself - was inspired by Huang's canvases to create his own set of macabre paintings. Oei took it a step further by \"entombing\" the children: After he painted the images of children based on photos he found from that era, he poured layers of thick resin on the paintings. They obscure the image and leave just traces of the child visible to the viewer. He calls his creations the \"black paintings\".\n\nBut the theatricality of his gesture doesn't stop there. From tonight till next weekend, Oei is showing his dark paintings, together with Huang's works, in a secret shophouse location.\n\nVisitors have to purchase a ticket at\n\nwww.evilempire.asia\n\nto receive the exhibition's exact location as well as a key that will open one object on site.\n\nVisitors are then required to remain in the shophouse for about an hour to look closely at the paintings. A group of actors will appear during the course of the visit to help illuminate various aspects of Huang and Oei's works.\n\nOei says: \"People don't spend enough time looking at a painting. They glance at one quickly and move away to the next one... I wanted to change that by having them here for about 45 minutes to an hour, during which they will be compelled to look more closely at the works.\"\n\nOei is director of Sculpture Square and created the popular series of Open House art tours conducted in ordinary people's homes in Marine Parade and Tiong Bahru. His creative approach to showcasing his works as well as Huang's will likely make the exhibition, titled The End of History, one of the most memorable of the year.\n\nHuang Wei's paintings are priced from $3,200 for a 60cm by 45cm framed canvas, and $12,800 for a 130cm by 150cms framed canvas. Meanwhile, Oei's grim images of entombed children go for $4,500 each. For anyone with an off-centre view of life, these paintings are definitely worth a long and close look.\n\nThe End of History exhibition will be shown at an undisclosed location on Nov 8,9,10, 15,16 and 17. Tickets at $25 are available at\n\nwww.evilempire.asia\n\n. Upon purchasing the ticket, the location will be revealed to you\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, revenue from its land systems business slipped 11 per cent while that of its others category - which includes ST Synthesis and Miltope - was 33 per cent lower.\n\nST Engineering's aerospace sector, which is the biggest contributor to topline, recorded revenue of $510 million for Q3, as higher revenue from the engines division of the component/engine repair and overhaul business group was largely offset by fewer project milestone completions in the engineering and material services business group. The aerospace sector's profit before tax of $80.2 million was 6 per cent lower as a result of the absence of a write-back of allowance for inventory obsolescence recognised in Q3 2012.\n\nEarnings per share were 4.24 cents, down from 4.77 cents.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit was 2.5 per cent lower at $413.3 million, while revenue was 0.8 per cent higher at $4.69 billion.\n\nFor the third quarter, gross profit dipped 3.6 per cent to $347.6 million while operating profit was 5.8 per cent lower at $157.9 million. Share of results of associates and jointly controlled entities jumped 20.9 per cent to $11.5 million.\n\nCommercial sales accounted for 63 per cent of group revenue, or $1 billion.\n\nSome $1.5 billion of the group's $12.5 billion order book is expected to be recognised in the remaining months of this year, it said.\n\nTan Pheng Hock, president and CEO, said: \"Our strong order book gives us the ability to ride out market volatilities in the future. The diversified competencies across our business sectors put us in a good position to face the uncertain business climate that lies ahead.\"\n\nNo dividend was announced for the quarter.\n\nThe counter closed unchanged at $4.20 yesterday.

At the same time, the government is imposing deep cuts to defence budgets as part of a round of sweeping public spending reductions aimed at slashing the UK's deficit.\n\nThe MOD also announced plans on Wednesday for BAE to build three new offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy.\n\nA total of 940 jobs will be lost in Portsmouth on the southern English coast, with another 835 axed in Filton in the south-west and at facilities in Glasgow and Rosyth in Scotland by 2016.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron described the announcements as \"extremely difficult decisions and our first thought should be with all of those who are affected\". He told Parliament: \"In Portsmouth, yes there will be job reductions but there are many more people involved in ship servicing than shipbuilding, so the workforce will go from 12,000 to 11,000.\"\n\nBAE said it had reached a deal with the government \"to enable the implementation of a restructuring of its UK naval ships business\" resulting in the loss of 1.3 per cent of its global workforce of 88,200 people.\n\n\"Consultation will commence on a total employee reduction of 1,775 that is expected to result from these restructuring proposals,\" it said, adding that the consolidation of its British ships business would \"match future capacity requirements\".\n\nBAE said it had experienced a \"significant\" reduction in workloads following the peak of activity on its current programme to build two aircraft carriers.\n\nIt added: \"The implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain BAE Systems' capability to deliver complex warships for the Royal Navy and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the UK.\"\n\nTrade unions described the cuts as a \"devastating\" blow for the industry.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this is a devastating day for the UK shipbuilding industry,\" said David Hulse, a senior official with the GMB union.\n\nThe newly commissioned MOD ships will meanwhile be built at BAE's shipyards on the Clyde, Scotland and will play a \"key role\" in counterterrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations, the ministry said.\n\n\"This deal will provide the Royal Navy with three brand new maritime patrol vessels with a wide range of capabilities which will support our national interests and those of our overseas territories,\" said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.\n\nBAE, which has been rocked by government cutbacks to military spending worldwide, was also hit last year by the collapse of a proposed mega-merger with European aviation giant EADS.

Canada's Alberta province is expected to follow BC with an issue.\n\nHong Kong has a market in yuan-denominated \"dim sum\" bonds issued by multinational corporations and financial institutions. In May, HSBC was the first to issue an offshore yuan bond in Singapore. Meanwhile, ICBC will be China's first mainland bank to issue an offshore yuan bond in London.\n\nBut BC is \"the first foreign government to do such an issue\", said Mr Courtis, adding that the deal has advantages for all parties involved. It helps with \"internationalising\" the yuan while Canada hopes to gain commercial advantage.\n\nCanada is gearing up to export huge quantities of shale gas - ahead of the US - and China is a strong potential customer, sources told BT. BC Premier Christy Clark was in Beijing for the yuan bond launch and was reportedly \"feted\" there, including by President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"There is vast appetite among official institutions and central banks for RMB paper,\" said Mr Courtis.\n\n\"Such bodies vastly prefer to buy paper issued by other governments rather than corporate paper. As there has not been a non-PRC issuer, this first non-PRC-government issue was swallowed in minutes with approximately two-thirds going to official institutions and central banks.\n\n\"Every day, the renminbi's role in the world is increasing and so central banks everywhere are starting to add RMB to their reserves,\" he added.\n\nThe BC government swapped the proceeds of the yuan issue into Canadian dollars and given current swap rates, \"the all-in costs are cheaper than borrowing even for them - a triple AAA borrower - in Canadian dollars\", Mr Courtis explained.\n\nAt 2.5 billion yuan (S$510.3 million), the BC issue is the largest Chinese offshore (CNH) bond by any foreign issuer to date. The bond was priced to yield 2.25 per cent and has a one-year term. About 60 per cent of the issue was placed in Asia, and 40 per cent in the US and Europe.\n\n\"Many governments and official institutions will want to make the same statement that BC is making,\" Mr Courtis said.\n\n\"Corporations will continue doing CNH issues, when the swap rates are right. Later, they will do issues for funding their PRC operations and for trade finance. But that is not now.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I don't believe we as an organisation are supporting our customers enough, going backwards and forwards around our network.\n\n\"We've got infrastructure, we've got very good people, we need to make sure the connectivity of the group starts to happen.\"\n\nMr McEwan, the bank's new CEO, has been on the job for a month. He rose from running RBS's retail arm to take over from former CEO Stephen Hester, who had led the bank in the last five years. Mr McEwan was in Singapore as part of a week-long visit to Asia, including Australia and Hong Kong, to see how the bank's operations in the region could be improved.\n\nLast Friday, the UK Treasury said that it would not break up RBS, which was nationalised by the UK government in a 2008 bailout.\n\nInstead, an internal \"bad bank\" would be created to hold an estimated \u00a338 billion (S$75.86 billion) of commercial real estate and troubled loans and to sell them quickly over the next few years to strengthen the bank financially.\n\nRBS will also speed up the sale of its US subsidiary, Citizens Financial Group, and targets an initial public offering next year.\n\nIt is reviewing all ongoing businesses. An update will be provided next February together with the bank's full-year results, Mr McEwan said.\n\nAsked if RBS's private banking business or the small Asian segment within it could also be sold, Mr McEwan gave a firm denial. \"The private bank is running well. It's not one that's up for sale . . . I want to signal very clearly, we want to start growing our businesses as opposed to contracting.\"\n\nRBS's private bank, rebranded as Coutts in 2011, has potential to grow in Asia, Mr McEwan said.\n\n\"There's a lot of wealth and a lot of growth in the Asian marketplace. The brand travels well. It's a very powerful global brand for wealth management. We're meeting the team from Coutts . . . (it's about) how do you connect that business with other businesses that we have.\"\n\nThe bank has 13,000 employees in the Asia-Pacific region, 1,600 in Singapore and about 125,000 worldwide.\n\nAsked what kinds of workforce cuts might be on the way, Mr McEwan said that the mix of employees throughout the organisation would change over time. More people will be in the front-end, customer-facing departments and fewer in the administrative and operational departments.\n\n\"These are the things we are now able to concentrate on given that we're a good, sound organisation again,\" he said. \"For five years, we've been trying to save the organisation.

Ships need to install receiver equipment.\n\nAnalysts say Russia is keen to expand its shipping clout through the Arctic, which aims to cut journey times by weeks.\n\n\"The Northern Sea Route provides access to Russia's own hinterland and the vast amount of minerals and hydro carbon resources,\" said Malte Humpert of Washington-based think tank the Arctic Institute. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

So far, tickets for tomorrow night's show have already been sold out.\n\nInoue's story of Musashi is a twist on a famous Japanese tale of the battle between two rival samurais, Musashi and Kojiro. In the original story, Kojiro was killed by the end of the battle, but in Inoue's rewritten version, Kojiro somehow survives and later attempts to take revenge on Musashi.\n\n\"The main message of this show is to stop the chain reaction of revenge,\" says Mr Ninagawa, in an interview through a Japanese translator. \"[INOUE] wanted to convey to the audience that there still is war and conflict in this world to be resolved... and that war shouldn't be here anymore.\"\n\nAnd to help Inoue's intended message strike a chord with audiences, Mr Ninagawa has chosen to stage it such that the set immerses the audience into the world of the samurais both in visuals and audio.\n\n\"It's the first five minutes after the curtain rises that are the most important. In that time I have to hold the audience's attention,\" he says.\n\n\"I want to bring them out from their everyday lives and into another world, that's why I have a stage with a temple and a large bamboo forest. With the rustling sound of leaves that will put that in a different environment and bring them back to that era.\"\n\nMusashi runs tonight and tomorrow night at 8pm at the Esplanade Theatre.

Party leaders have historically used the occasion to launch new ideas or reforms. In 1978, Deng Xiaoping, then the country's new president, thrust China onto the path of double digit-growth with the \"opening up and reform policy\".\n\nBoth the new president and his Premier Li Keqiang have spent most of the past year defending at home and overseas the urgency and benefits of an overhaul of the economy, the current growth pattern of which is inadequate to address China's long list of imbalances.\n\nThey want to avoid the fate of Japan and get stuck in a dangerous \"middle income trap\". The economy is too leveraged for a developing country - the state still controls all major parts of the economy, credit is misallocated and unproductive, inequalities are growing and social discontent is on the rise. The past model was based on investment spurring growth, and the new one must be pulled by consumption, be more sustainable and socially just.\n\nThis means dismantling state-owned enterprises (SOEs), reforming land rights for farmers and giving them more spending power, granting a social security net for the entire population which will unlock earnings currently stored in the banks and reforming the hukou system and giving millions of migrant workers the same rights as their urban homologues.\n\nA long document will be published at the end of the meeting. It is unlikely China will actually mention precise deadlines or detail its reforms. Deng Xiaoping's reforms announced in 1978 became fully effective only in 1984.\n\n\"The key gauge of success should be whether the leadership presents a coherent and comprehensive plan for economic restructuring that can provide a clear direction to party and government officials over the years ahead. By contrast, a piecemeal approach would signal that the leadership has been unable to agree on a framework for how reform should progress,\" wrote Mark Williams at Capital Economics.\n\n\"In our view, effective reform must address three linked problems: the low share of income that goes to average households, the inefficiency with which capital is allocated, and the state's dominant role across much of the economy,\" he said.\n\nPresident Xi was quoted as saying in October that the government was drawing up a \"master plan\" for not just more reform, but a \"profound revolution\".\n\nHuang Shuhe, vice-chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, has emphasised that SOEs are on the agenda. And Yu Zhengsheng, the No 4 member in the party's supreme Politburo Standing Committee has promised \"unprecedented\" reforms.\n\nLast month, the Development and Research Centre, a research body directly under the State Council, issued an ambitious plan which could well serve as a basis for discussions. The plan since dubbed 3-8-3, referring to its structure, was widely applauded by scholars and economists.\n\nUnder the plan, the key to reform is establishing the right relationship between the government and market. The proposal also included making the yuan an international reserve currency in some markets, setting up funds to invest and manage state assets, adjusting the system of transfer payments for local governments and reducing government stakes in financial institutions.\n\n\"The proposal is a comprehensive reform package, probably the most ambitious top-down economic reform initiative in the history of the People's Republic of China, in our view,\" wrote Dong Tao at Credit Suisse.\n\nHowever, analysts say vested interests among SOEs, local governments and party members will slow if not stall the reform momentum. SOEs have been nurtured by the previous regime disposing of monopolies in key areas of the economy with cheap unlimited financing. Key members of the those companies will be present in the plenum and are close to the president.\n\n\"As the leadership looks to propose market reform initiatives that will effectively undermine special interest groups - including SOEs, corrupt officials, bureaucratic institutions and local governments - it will face strong opposition,\" Cheng Li, professor at the Brookings Institute, told a recent conference.\n\n\"Much of that opposition will come from the SOEs, which have not only been the main source of official corruption, but also the most formidable obstacles to achieving market reforms,\" he added.\n\nAt this stage, analysts don't expect thorny issues such as state monopolies and land reform to be tackled. They think reform will most likely focus on financial and fiscal issues first, including interest rates and convertibility of the yuan.\n\nAmong other challenges will be finding a consensus between the different party factions. Former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao still have men at all levels of the party, and their views often conflict with a strong economic reform agenda.\n\nAnalysts also caution that finding the right pace of reform is equally important as rushing the process could destabilise growth.\n\n\"For example, scaling back regulations that require the government to approve investment projects could lead to a further surge in lending to inefficient state-owned firms if the implicit government guarantees behind state sector borrowers are not first removed. The right reforms in the wrong order could just make things worse,\" argues Mr Williams of Capital Economics.\n\nPremier Li was quoted this week as saying growth should remain at the 7.5 per cent level. If reform will slow growth in the short term, it is unlikely leaders will decide to take measures which could potentially hinder development.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The agreement will further enhance and deepen trade and investment flows between both sides.\"\n\nIn providing preferential tariff access to Singapore exporters, ASTEP - signed yesterday morning - offers companies here a competitive advantage in a market of 23 million people.\n\nApproximately 97 per cent of Singapore's current exports will qualify for immediate tariff free treatment, while the remaining 3 per cent will qualify at five, 10 or 15 years after ASTEP enters into force.\n\nThe Business Times understands that the exact date of ASTEP's implementation is not yet known.\n\nIt is expected that Singapore-based companies exporting to Taiwan - particularly those in the electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery, and processed food products sectors - will stand to benefit from the removal of tariffs.\n\nSingapore is Taiwan's fifth-largest trading partner, with key traded products spanning electronic circuits, electrical machinery and organic chemicals.\n\nThe Republic's investment into Taiwan reached $5.9 billion in 2011 - making Singapore the territory's sixth-largest foreign investor.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry noted that Singapore is a regional headquarter and \"a key South-east Asia hub\" for many Taiwan companies seizing growth opportunities in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan is Singapore's eighth-largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between both sides rose 8.7 per cent from 2011 to reach $49.7 billion last year.\n\nThe territory is Singapore's sixth-largest source of investments from Asia, with a total foreign direct investment stock of $7.3 billion in 2011. Negotiations on ASTEP commenced in May 2011, and the agreement was signed yesterday in Singapore by the Trade Representative of the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei, Calvin Eu, and the Representative of the Taipei Representative Office in Singapore, Hsieh Fa-dah.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it demanded that they do so through subsidiaries incorporated in India and said that eligibility would be limited to banks from countries that reciprocate by letting in Indian banks.\n\nThe regulatory framework issued after the close of trading on Wednesday requires that foreign banks invest a hefty minimum of 5 billion rupees (about S$99 million) in equity capital in each subsidiary.\n\nThe new rules also require separate boards for each subsidiary. Two-thirds of the directors must not be executives of the bank, and at least half of the directors must be Indian citizens.\n\nSuch boards will not only require additional expense and organisation for the foreign banks, compared with operating through branches, but will also force the banks to open their books to outside directors, raising the possibility that business secrets would leak.\n\nDespite the conditions, the new regulations are significant in that they allow greater competition in a country with a reputation for being difficult for foreign companies. The shift in direction is all the more notable because India has a history of opposing demands from wealthy countries for more open trade in goods and service, and has even organised campaigns by developing countries against such demands during negotiations at the World Trade Organization and other multilateral platforms.\n\nNew rules for foreign banks have been under discussion here for years. The abrupt release of the latest regulations represents the most recent in a series of moves to increase competition in financial services by Raghuram Rajan, the prominent economist who became the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, on Sept 4.\n\nMr Rajan said in an interview at the bank's headquarters that the net effect of the new rules would be to let foreign banks, including US banks, compete on a nearly equal footing with domestic banks.\n\n\"They will have access, provided they come through the wholly owned subsidiary route and abide by the guidelines,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be a lot more freedom for foreign banks here,\" he said. \"On net, it will be a tremendous opening to them, so I think they should be happy.\"\n\nA paper released by the central bank in late August said the main goal in allowing foreign banks in was to increase competition and efficiency in the local banking sector. The central bank wants to spur Indian banks to adopt more sophisticated financial services and risk management techniques.\n\nBut the push to attract foreign banks that form subsidiaries - and perhaps take over small Indian banks - has drawn criticism in some quarters in India, including the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Industry players also cite difficulties in getting local drivers for the job, even with a pay increase.\n\nUnder SMRT's new scheme, a master bus captain, the highest of seven pay grades, will drive 50-70 per cent of the time. He will have training and mentorship responsibilities, and needs to know 15 routes as well as undergo leadership management training.\n\nSaid Desmond Kuek, president and CEO of SMRT: \"We hope a better-trained, energised and engaged workforce will ultimately create a more reliable and service-oriented bus service that our passengers can enjoy.\"\n\nNational Transport Workers' Union executive secretary Ong Chin Ang said that the new model would transform frontline roles as competent drivers hit a ceiling after just three promotions under the previous career scheme.\n\nHowever, Roger Wong, general manager of Woodlands Transport, which has about 200 drivers, said that costs for private bus operators might increase as a result, with the going wage between $2,400 and $2,800 a month. \"Someone has to pay for it. We just can't increase our prices just like that,\" he said.\n\nOther operators said that it remained unclear if more locals - or indeed their own drivers - would be enticed to join SMRT following the move. This is because of the long hours and mundane conditions of public bus driving. Private bus drivers might have a greater variety of routes and a more flexible schedule. As for pay, drivers can hit $3,000 or $3,500 a month with a lot of overtime, they said.\n\nSaid a school bus operator who is trying to hire Malaysian drivers: \"Raising wages may not help attract more locals. Even if we advertise and pay so high, we may not attract the right people. A lot of people who can work for us have actually reached retirement age and want to go slow.\"\n\nSMRT has more than 2,100 drivers and operates a quarter of the public bus fleet. But its bus operations have been making operating losses for many years in a row now. Last November, 171 SMRT bus drivers from China made headlines when they went on strike over pay and living conditions. Since then, wage costs have increased.\n\nSMRT shares fell a cent to $1.285 yesterday, near a seven-year low. Last week, SMRT reported a 57 per cent plunge in net profit to $14.4 million for its second quarter ended Sept 30, owing to higher staff and depreciation costs.\n\nAnalysts are almost universally bearish about SMRT. According to Bloomberg, the 12-month target price for the stock is $1.10, based on estimates by 11 analysts. \"SMRT is playing catch up. I don't see how their bus operations can do well even with an increase in fares,\" an analyst said, referring to changes to the fare formula recommended by a committee earlier this week.\n\nThe elephant in the room is SBS Transit and its pool of almost 6,000 drivers. SBS already pays experienced local drivers around the $3,500-monthly range, BT understands.\n\nBut when asked about pay comparisons yesterday, Tammy Tan, SBS Transit's senior vice-president of corporate communications, kept mum. \"We have, since May 2012, implemented a career progression model where bus captains showing talent, capability and potential are able to rise in the organisation,\" she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He has been pressing Boeing publicly for more than two years to move forward with a successor to the 777-300ER that would offer greater capacity. At the last air show two years ago, Mr Clark ordered 50 777-300ERs, and at the previous expo he ordered 70 Airbus A350s.\n\nWhile Emirates is likely to dominate the first days of the show, other carriers are also looking to place orders. Boeing is in talks with Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways about 777X orders worth as much as US$87 billion including the Emirates requirement, people familiar with the matter said previously.\n\nMr Clark reiterated he would like more A380 superjumbos, beyond the 90 he's ordered so far, though is constrained by limited space at the current Dubai airport.\n\nWhile Boeing's updated 777 is the most keenly awaited wide-body programme of recent years, given the success of the current model, the Chicago-based company is not alone in chasing major orders.\n\nAirbus is marketing its largest A350 variant as an alternative, and the plane - called the A350-1000 - is set to enter service three years before the 777X, which Mr Clark sees debuting in 2020 at the earliest.\n\n\"There are other aeroplanes in the frame,\" Mr Clark said. \"They're improving the Airbus A350-1000.\"\n\nEmirates already has 70 A350s on order, 10 of them the A350-1000 variant. Mr Clark had said publicly that he wasn't yet satisfied with the performance promised on the A350, joining executives including Akbar Al Baker, chief executive officer of Qatar Airways and the first A350 customer.\n\nBoeing is giving its 777 a radical makeover, designing a plane that will boast the biggest engines ever and a record wingspan. Its first variant, the 777-9X, will be able to fly as far as 14,800km with more than 400 passengers, while burning 20\u00a0per cent less fuel than the current 777.\n\nA second type, carrying 350, will push past 9,400 nautical miles, enough to go non-stop from New York to Singapore.\n\nMr Clark said GE has dropped a water injection system for the 777X engine that Emirates would have found useful in desert-heat conditions.\n\nA GE spokesman said the company continues to evaluate a water-injection system, and that the engine's entry into service is several years away. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

But there's always room for one more spectacle that we haven't seen - Starlight Express - where the cast of 28 performs the entire show on roller-skates.\n\nThe rock musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber is one of the longest-running musicals at West End in London, about a child's dream where his toy trains come to life at night and race for the title as the \"fastest engine in the world\". The show first started out in West End, in 1984, where it played for over 7,000 performances, and also had a shorter run at Broadway in New York, before going on tour around the world. One of their upcoming stops is at the Marina Bay Sands Grand Theatre here in Singapore next week.\n\n\"It's a universal love story, and audiences all over the world can relate to the themes and characters - the goodies, the baddies, the competition and, of course, the romance,\" says Arlene Philips, a renowned West End choreographer who has worked on Starlight Express since its Broadway days.

This was offset by recognition of rental income from the properties acquired in July, and higher rent from the Singapore properties.\n\nNet property income dipped 2.4 per cent to $21.8 million.\n\n\"Any adverse impact from the depreciation of the JPY has been mitigated as PLife Reit has locked in the Japan net income hedge for the next few years,\" said Parkway Trust Management, the manager of the Reit.\n\nAs a result of the delivery of quarterly Japan net income hedge, a realised foreign exchange gain of $0.4 million and $1.2 million was recognised in Q3 and the first nine months of 2013 respectively, it added.\n\nFor the nine months ended September, the Reit saw DPU rise 4.2 per cent to 7.93 cents. Distributable income (after deducting amount retained for capital expenditure) was $48.0 million, 4.2 per cent more than the $46.1 million posted a year ago.\n\nGross revenue dipped 1.6 per cent to $69.0 million, while NPI inched down 1.2 per cent to $64.4 million.\n\nLooking ahead, the manager said it maintains a neutral outlook about its medium-term acquisition prospects, as the global markets are beginning to show signs of stabilising. The long-term prospects of the regional healthcare industry is expected to be robust, however, due to rising demand for better quality private healthcare services, driven by the fast-ageing population.\n\nJapan's recovering economy bodes well for PLife Reit's growth plans, added the manager. The group acquired seven properties in Japan this year at a combined purchase price of 6.26 billion yen ($78.82 million).

Large-scale wind turbines have reached parity with solar or other forms of energy generation in North America. We believe at this point that tidal energy isn't comparable with solar, but in the next 5-10 years, it will be. In deploying any renewable technology, it's not purely the technology, you also need the industries to come in and develop business models for it.\"\n\nThe next step, if the technology proves scalable, he said, is to find commercial partners who will install the turbines and generate electricity to Sentosa, or to consumers in Singapore.\n\nAsked if tidal energy could become a sustainable resource, Prof Mhaisalkar said that while it may not be able to meet 10-20 per cent of Singapore's energy needs, it is possible to generate a reasonable amount of energy from tidal and wind turbines.\n\n\"We are in a unique location to test such technologies in tropical waters, and 'Made in Singapore' renewable energy solutions can be exported to the region, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, where there is more tidal flow, or Malaysia or Thailand. That's where we hope the larger-scale deployments will happen,\" he noted.\n\nDeploying the turbine system was an even bigger challenge than designing it, Prof Mhaisalkar recalled.\n\n\"The ocean is a very intense environment. So we needed to make sure the technology is robust to withstand the forces of nature,\" he said. \"What was challenging was putting the turbine in a tropical environment in Sentosa, where seaweed, fish and other vegetation caused challenges; the currents and the monsoons caused challenges. So we struggled for more than a year to find an ideal way to deploy the turbines.\"\n\nInvestment in such emerging technologies reflected Singapore's commitment to explore renewable energy options, much like how it has developed its expertise in water technologies, said Prof Mhaisalkar. \"Apart from proving that tidal energy is feasible in Singapore, the test bed will allow us to improve our designs for future turbine systems, leading to new avenues of renewable energy.\"\n\nAs part of its CSR initiative, Sentosa Development chief executive Mike Barclay said Sentosa has been opened up as a test-bed for new green initiatives and technologies, particularly those that can be scaled up for wider adoption across Singapore. \"We already have wind and solar energy but we've never tapped tidal energy. I think this one has legs.\"\n\nDiscussions are going on with Sentosa Development about the possibility of deploying larger turbines near the Southern Islands and Pulau Semakau. \"We've done a detailed resource assessment of the area between Sentosa and the Southern Islands, where tidal flows are pretty strong,\" Prof Mhaisalkar said.\n\nOther green experiments in the pipeline include wind turbine and solar power, as well as sustainable transport or driverless vehicles.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

It will sit atop the Stamford Grand North Ryde Hotel, a Stamford Land property.\n\nThe 22,000-square-metre freehold site will house about 650 apartments, shops and commercial offices, including a convenience store, management offices, mini-supermarkets and childcare centres.\n\nAll 379 residential units offered in the Stage 1 launch were snapped up at an average price of A$10,000 per square metre; the remaining 267 units will be released for sale later this year or early next year.\n\nNo revenue will be recognised until the project is completed in 2017.\n\nSeparately, the group, Australasia's largest independent operator of luxury hotels, said that although its net profit for the six months ended September had dipped, its revenue rose 6.4 per cent to $133 million.\n\nThis came largely from a significant increase in expenses to cover its development property sales, which jumped from $4.3 million to $17.3 million.\n\nSeventeen apartments at The Stamford Residences Auckland (TSRA), a commercial unit and an apartment at The Stamford Residences & The Reynell Terrace, were sold during the period. This compares with the sale of six apartments at TSRA a year ago.\n\nThe sales gave a big revenue boost to the property development business, for which revenue jumped from $5.7 million in the six months ended September 2012 to $21.1 million.\n\nThe group's hotel segment, on the other hand, reported a drop of 6.6 per cent in revenue to $103 million, from translation losses from lower exchange rates and lower revenue from its two Adelaide hotels. This was partially offset by the better performance of its Sydney and Melbourne hotels.\n\nOver at the property investment arm, revenue dipped 2.3 per cent to $6.9 million.\n\nIn the trading business, revenue rose 4.8 per cent to $1.9 million on the back of higher contributions from the group's interior decoration business.\n\nLooking ahead, the group said the hotel segment is expected to perform satisfactorily, given the strong demand at its Sydney and Melbourne hotels and signs of recovery in its two Adelaide hotels. Reviews are in progress to rejuvenate the rooms, and food and beverage outlets across the group.\n\nEarnings per share for the period was 1.07 cents, compared with 1.09 cents previously.\n\nStamford Land's counter ended trading down half a cent, at 57.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Her story is far more prosaic - she simply taught herself to cook two decades ago.\n\nBut that didn't stop her from publishing three cookbooks of her family's Peranakan recipes - tangible labours of love that prove her dedication to the craft.\n\n\"My children always said I'm not a cook because I only started cooking about 20 years ago when I opened my restaurant called Ming's Cafe & Pub. I used to rely on maids because I was working,\" says 73-year-old Ms Soon, who used to be the vice-president of public relations at the former Overseas Union Bank (OUB).\n\nJust last month, she released her third cookbook, Grandmothers' Recipes: Sweet and Savoury, which can now be found in all major bookstores alongside its predecessors Grandmothers' Recipes (2006) and More Grandmothers' Recipes (2012).\n\nIt all began when she left the bank in 1990 to start a restaurant, and Ms Soon was gathering recipes from her family members, which she had to tweak to suit the restaurant's menu. And after giving up Ming's Cafe & Pub, she decided it was time to compile and preserve them.\n\n\"I had a Singaporean family, a Malaysian family, plus my mother-in-law's recipes that my children love to eat every Chinese New Year, so I realised I had to preserve them in a cookbook,\" she says. \"I even had to try out every single recipe because none of them had proper measurements.\"\n\nThe cookbooks are a mishmash of Peranakan, Chinese and even western favourites from ayam buah keluak to lasagna, all written in a simple, easy-to-follow format. At her book launch, she kept her guests well-fed with a gourmet spread that showed off her mean cooking skills.\n\nAlthough she still has enough recipes to fill a fourth book, with more exotic local dishes such as chilli crab, black pepper crab and coffee pork ribs, Ms Soon has no plans to publish it any time soon.\n\n\"It's not easy publishing a cookbook yourself, you know. It's very tiring, because I have to do everything myself and I have to sell 1,000 copies per book just to get back my cost.\n\n\"If somebody else does everything for me then maybe I will, but I don't think I want to have to run around and do it anymore,\" she says with a laugh.\n\nWho knows - if enough home cooks find her cookbooks invaluable, they might well persuade her otherwise.\n\nAll three cookbooks can be purchased at major bookstores at $40 each before GST, or directly from the author by emailing ros@grandmothersrecipes.com.sg.

There will also be a greater emphasis on working with companies to elevate the quality and pay of jobs in this sector.\n\n\"Finally, we will develop a strong marine and offshore eco-system, which brings together industry players, such as classification societies, equipment makers and vessel owners,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nMr Lee paid tribute to former Sembcorp Marine president and CEO Tan Kwi Kin for his efforts in lobbying the prime minister on the idea of the new facility, which he was convinced would help boost Singapore's competitiveness. \"The government supported Sembcorp Marine, by reclaiming land at Tuas for the new yard and helping Sembcorp Marine upgrade its capabilities,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nThe 206-hectare new yard facility will be developed over three phases. The 73.3-hectare phase one started operations in August; phase two is expected to begin in the next three to four years.\n\nSembcorp Marine also celebrated its 50th anniversary at a gala dinner yesterday, where the group said it will commit $10 million over five years to an endowment fund for the establishment of Sembcorp Marine Lab @NTU, a new research facility at the Nanyang Technological University.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

This is partly due to the ramping up of activity at the new shipyard in Brazil, but even more to the load situation and activity level in Romania and Norway.\n\nOperating profit for the third quarter was 72 million kroner, down from 301 million kroner in the corresponding period of 2012. The operating margin, representing operating profit to total revenues, was 3 per cent.\n\nOperations at the group's European shipyards are stable, with work load at the Romanian yards gradually reverting to a normal situation. The Norwegian yards saw successful delivery of four vessels during the quarter.\n\nThe load situation at the Vietnam yard has improved as a result of a new project secured during the quarter.\n\nKey shipyard infrastructure for the group's second yard in Brazil, Vard Promar, was completed in the third quarter. The ramp-up of production capacity at the new yard is under way, and the first blocks have been produced.\n\nThe group added that growth in the oil companies' exploration & production (E&P) spending is expected to continue in 2014, fuelling demand for its products, in particular in the North Sea market.\n\nVard shares closed trading yesterday five cents lower at 83 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Previously, it had forecast a low single-digit growth in 2013. Service revenue, however, is slated to be flat, which means that the drop will be driven by lower equipment sales instead.\n\nAt the same time, the outlook for Ebitda margin was lifted for the full year, from 31 per cent to about 32 per cent, yesterday.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit gained 5.8 per cent to $287.1 million, but revenue slipped 1.2 per cent to $1.75 billion, also because of lower handset sales.\n\nMobile revenue for Q3 gained 1.6 per cent to $308.3 million, driven by a strong enterprise postpaid segment. Average revenue per user (ARPU) for the postpaid market gained $1 year-on-year to $70, as takeup of the new tiered data subscription plans continued to grow.\n\nApart from mobile, the only other segment to record year-on-year revenue growth was fixed network services which was up 3.1 per cent to $92.7 million.\n\nStarHub's pay-TV segment turned in quarterly revenue of $95.5 million - a 3.7 per cent drop as advertising and subscription revenue fell. Even so, the division had reason to cheer, with a net increase in subscribers for the first time after shrinking for six straight quarters. Over the third quarter, it added 1,900 subscribers, bringing the total to 531,000 subscribers.\n\nAccording to StarHub, this growth was partially because it was able to carry the English Premier League matches after its cross-carriage triumph, and also because it cracked down on set-top box piracy by tightening security on its equipment. ARPU, however, was down a dollar year-on-year to $51, because of \"higher competitive discounts\".\n\nIn the broadband segment, fierce price competition from smaller players raged on, with revenue shedding 5 per cent to $59.6 million.\n\nThe group declared an interim dividend of 5 cents per share, the same as in Q3 last year, and will maintain its annual dividend of 20 cents per share for the year. Earnings per share for the quarter and nine months stood at 5.5 cents and 16.7 cents respectively, against 5.6 cents and 15.8 cents for the corresponding periods the year before.\n\nStarHub's counter closed a cent lower at $4.36 before the release of its earnings yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

F&N said that it has engaged lawyers and \"intends to vigorously resist the claim\".\n\nIn a circular dated Oct 28, F&N said: \"Without prejudice to its position that MEHL has no basis to give the notice or make the claim, the company also does not agree with the propriety or process of the valuation or the amount and has communicated that to MEHL.\"\n\nThe spat is the first major dispute between a foreign investor and a Myanmar state-owned enterprise since the country embarked on its road to reform after decades of isolation under military rule. The resource-rich nation has drawn many international investors, including big corporations such as Coca-Cola and Unilever.\n\nMyint Aung, MEHL deputy managing director, is contesting various media reports which suggested that the dispute was a test case for Myanmar's investment laws. The case, he said, is not about the investment laws in Myanmar or how foreign investors are treated in the country.\n\n\"We believe that allowing parties to exercise their contractual rights, including the right to arbitrate a dispute, will strengthen and not weaken foreign investors' confidence in Myanmar,\" he said yesterday. \"The arbitration speaks for our desire to adhere to proper and due process.\"\n\nWhile MEHL did not specify the term in the agreement that it said F&N had defaulted on, BT understands that it is connected to F&N's recent takeover by Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi.\n\nMr Charoen completed his takeover of F&N in February and now holds about 90.3 per cent of F&N shares - 61.7 per cent through privately controlled TCC Assets and 28.6 per cent through listed Thai Beverage Public Co.\n\nThere might have been a clause in the agreement that allows either side to buy out its partner if the ownership of the partners changes.\n\n\"Change-of-control clauses are quite common in joint venture agreements,\" said Lo Kim Seng, a director at Stamford Law.\n\nMyanmar Brewery, which sells the Myanmar Beer and Andaman Gold brands, is the country's biggest beer supplier and its top taxpayer. Its 83 per cent market share in Myanmar makes it the leading brewer in the region's fastest growing beer market, F&N has said.\n\nThe brewery is F&N's only beer asset after the company sold its stake in Asia-Pacific Breweries (APB) last year to Dutch brewer Heineken.\n\n\"If the judgment goes against F&N in any way, it will have an impact on the group's overall profitability with regards to its food and beverage division,\" DMG & Partners analyst Goh Han Peng said.\n\nF&N does not typically specify how much it makes from Myanmar Brewery. In a report during its recent takeover, F&N's independent financial adviser JP Morgan placed net income for the year ended September 2012 at $52 million for the brewery, based on management guidance.\n\nGiven that F&N owns 55 per cent of Myanmar Brewery, this would have contributed about $29 million, or 72 per cent, of F&N's $40 million in net profit from beverages in fiscal 2012.\n\nBased on this, the US$246 million valuation by MEHL works out to around 12 times earnings. \"For this kind of market leader, the market value is probably in the range of 20 times,\" Mr Goh said.\n\nMyanmar Brewery was started in 1995 as a joint venture between APB and the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings. APB transferred its shareholding to F&N in 1997.\n\nAs the unit was incorporated in Myanmar, the agreement between F&N and MEHL will be governed by Myanmar law.

Apart from enhancing existing concession schemes, two new schemes were proposed - one for low income workers and another for people with disabilities - with both to be funded by the government and not the public transport operators (PTOs).\n\nIf accepted and implemented, the concessions could add about half a million new beneficiaries to the current 1.2 million commuters receiving some form of public transport concessions, or about a 40 per cent increase.\n\nAs fare increases are expected, another recommendation is for the PTOs to contribute 20-50 per cent of their fare gains to the Public Transport Fund, which is co-funded by the government. The fund was set up to help needy families.\n\nAnother recommendation is to include energy costs in the computation of a new and more responsive fare formula, since they have become a substantial part of operating costs for PTOs. Under the formula, a fare adjustment is equal to the price index minus a revised productivity extraction, where the price index features the new energy index component in addition to a revised core CPI and an unchanged wage index. If accepted, the new fare formula will be valid from 2013 to 2017.\n\nThe committee also proposed a rollover mechanism to smoothen out significant fare increases over two years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was partly due to increased shipments to Indonesia.\n\nSales in Singapore recorded double-digit growth as a result of full three-month operations of stores opened last year, while that of Malaysia dipped slightly.\n\nIn North Asia, the timepiece business in Hong Kong and China fell 26 per cent and 47 per cent respectively. FJ Benjamin attributed the lower sales to a slowdown in demand for luxury timepieces in China and reduced tourist spending by mainland Chinese visitors in Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company recorded a fair value loss on investment securities of $0.6 million and a forex loss of $0.8 million (compared with a $0.4 million gain last year), resulting in a non-cash translation swing of $1.2 million.\n\nEarnings per share was 0.07 cent, compared with 0.41 cent a year ago.

Some are even donating property to simply get rid of it,\" he noted.\n\nThe residential housing market is moribund as there are few buyers and banks are plagued with growing numbers of bad loans.\n\n\"Prices have fallen by over 30 per cent these past three years. It's because of the taxes imposed by the (EU-IMF) creditors and the economic uncertainty,\" Mr Paradias said.\n\nAccording to a study by leading Greek union GSEE, 75 per cent of mortgage payments are in arrears.\n\nThis represents a sum of 65 billion euros and mainly involves urban property, mainly in Athens.\n\nThe average debt per homeowner in mortgage trouble is 94,000 euros, GSEE said.\n\nOn the other side, non-performing bank loans have reached 59.6 billion euros according to sector reports, including 30 billion euros regarding business loans and 16.8 billion euros from mortgages.\n\nEconomist Christos Galanos believes few foreign investors will come to Greece given these rates and they will instead wait for the economy to pick up.\n\n\"The government should have taken action when housing prices were soaring before 2009. Instead of trying to suppress the bubble, it (allowed banks) to give mortgage incentives,\" said Mr Galanos.\n\n\"When the crisis arrived, it was not ready to manage the free fall in housing prices,\" he added. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Over the following weeks, the fire triggered rounds of investigation, regulatory involvement and a war of words between operators.\n\n\"Our investigations showed that the fire was caused by an employee not following strict maintenance procedures, including the use of an unauthorised blowtorch,\" SingTel said. BT understands that the blowtorch in question had not been approved for use. The telco did not say where the tool came from.\n\nThe employee has since been suspended, pending the independent review by the SingTel board committee of inquiry, which is ongoing.\n\n\"SingTel treats this incident very seriously and has always ensured that its contingency plans and safety measures meet global benchmarks,\" it said yesterday.\n\nSince the fire, the telco has taken steps to prevent a repeat of the incident, it said. It will limit maintenance work that requires the application of heat, introduce better tools and equipment, and reinforce training on safety requirements and operations.\n\n\"We recognise the importance of reliable communication services to customers and Singapore's status as a leading financial and business hub,\" said SingTel group CEO Chua Sock Koong.\n\n\"We apologise unreservedly to all our customers for any inconvenience caused.

Keppel's ability to accommodate a tight delivery schedule, as well as its execution track record helped to clinch the contracts, despite aggressive competition from the Chinese shipyards, according to market sources.\n\nThe first rig will be delivered in Q1 2016, and subsequent ones at intervals of four months with the last to be delivered in Q3-2017.\n\nOn top of the five confirmed orders, the first of the five options must be exercised within one year with the remaining four options within consecutive four-month intervals.\n\nWith these new contracts, Keppel's Offshore & Marine division has to-date secured 20 newbuild projects totalling $6.4 billion, all of which were its proprietary design.\n\nTransocean had issued an invitation for the other shipyards to tender, as it looks to expand its fleet of premium jack-up rigs from the current 12.\n\nKeppel's KFELS B class jack-up rigs already form 33 per cent of this fleet and, with the current order plus the options, the KFELS premium jack-up rigs are likely to dominate the fleet.\n\nTransocean's president and CEO, Steven L Newman, said: \"Continuing our growth in the high-specification jack-up business is an important element in our asset strategy.\"\n\nHe said the group as \"very excited about the potential for these rigs, given expectation for continued customer demand for assets of this capability and outstanding operating performance of the four new high-specification jack-ups we have already placed in service\".\n\nThe KFELS Super B Class rigs are designed to operate in 400 feet of water and to drill to 35,000 feet, with a an innovative drilling system to tackle challenging mid-water conditions.\n\nAnalysts say Keppel's big win is an endorsement of Singapore shipyards' leading edge in the premium jack-up rig segment, where the China yards have tried unsuccessfully to make inroads although they had secured contracts for lower specification jack-up rigs.\n\nAccording to Rigzone data, Singapore yards including those of Keppel and Sembcorp Marine have built more than 80 per cent of the high specification global jack-up rig fleet.\n\nKeppel shares closed trading yesterday at $10.93, up nine cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rise in revenue was led by growth across all three business segments - the sale of goods, the rendering of services and airtime revenue.\n\nThe group generated net cash from operating activities of $1.4 million for the first half, up from $0.3 million a year earlier. As a result, its financial position strengthened, with net cash standing at $14.2 million.\n\n\"The group remains cautious as the operating environment is still difficult.

News releases came a distant second for about 70 per cent of the companies, with the least preferred modes being company visits, newsletters and normal mail.\n\n\"Companies need to embrace and learn the most effective strategies in relation to online communication,\" said Irving Low, partner and head of Risk Consulting at KPMG in Singapore. \"If employed correctly, online communications can be an effective risk management tool in responding to market rumours.\"\n\nCompanies, however, still have to learn to be more forthcoming and timely with their announcements. The study showed that only 14 per cent notify the market ahead of time when releasing earnings results, while just 21 per cent issue profit warnings.\n\nThe study also found that messages can be made clearer - with unclear communications sometimes leading to clarifications sought by the market regulator, the Singapore Exchange.\n\nIt also noted that chief financial officers (CFOs) need to help stakeholders distil the facts from the noise and from \"popular opinion\", as well as provide better guidance for investors to make informed investment decisions.\n\nSaid Melvin Yong, Singapore general manager of CPA Australia: \"In an age of 24/7 communications, retail investors are constantly bombarded with information. Their difficulty is separating fact from fiction or market speculation. This is where CFOs, increasingly the face of investor relations, can do their part - communicate clearly and simply and dispense with confusing jargon.\"\n\nCFOs also need to realise that stakeholders want a real conversation with management and that small shareholders have become an even louder voice.\n\nArthur Lang, group CFO of CapitaLand, advises: \"One should not unnecessarily sugar-coat any message but communicate with credibility. Always adopt an open, honest and consistent approach to provide timely and accurate information, and ensure consistency and continuity of communication.\"\n\nThis is where the more traditional methods of communication can play their part. \"Though technology is useful, nothing beats face-to-face engagements,\" said Mr Low.\n\nThe study also found that there is great momentum and practical support for integrated reporting here. A quarter of the annual reports reviewed had a section that focused on other stakeholders and key performance indicators, and about 10 per cent produced a separate sustainability report.\n\n\"Integrated reporting takes a holistic view of corporate reporting and will fundamentally change the way companies communicate with stakeholders,\" said Vincent Chen, head of the Accountancy Sector Research Centre, Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC), which supports the Singapore CFO Institute.\n\nThe findings of this report will be made available and discussed at the CFO Connect Symposium 2013 today organised by the SAC.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Doug (played by Asian-American MTV host Alan Wong) has a gash from riding his bicycle off the school roof, and Kayleen (played by Lasalle graduate Seong Hui Xuan) is doubled over with stomach problems. They quickly bond over their shared fascination with pain - little knowing that it would be the tie that binds them for three decades of gory mishaps to follow.\n\nUnreeling like a cross between Love Me If You Dare, a French film about obsessive lovers who end up destroying each other, and the episodic Hollywood flick, One Day, we follow the pair over the course of eight scenes at five-year intervals.\n\nAt times, the characters border on storybook cliches: accident-prone Doug believes that Kayleen has some sort of mythical healing power over him, while yearning to be the fabled hero that protects her from worldly ills. Kayleen, likewise, is a modern-day feminist conundrum. Outwardly in control but emotionally and physically debilitated inside from a troubled childhood, she's torn between yearning for an emotional buttress in Doug and asserting her independence.\n\nDelivery is not always spot-on. The duo's too-squeaky and cartoonesque portrayal of elementary school children would have grated on one's nerves had it dragged any longer, and though generally affable, Wong's Doug borders on Disney Channel-type slapstick in a couple of scenes. Though, as an upside, the laughs elicited helped to lighten an otherwise morbid theme. He only really sheds his goofy demeanour in the final scene, when he emerges as an emotionally burnt, wheelchair-bound middle-aged man.\n\nSeong, on the other hand, shows more versatility in her transition from schoolgirl to confusion-addled pubescent teen and later, a wiser - if slightly weary - grown woman.\n\nThe script cleverly calls for the actors to change between sets in two corners on-stage, applying their cosmetic bruises and blood-soaked bandages in full view of the audience, perhaps as a way of underscoring the self-inflicted nature of the wounds.\n\nRather than flow according to chronological order, the vignettes jump either 10 years forward or 15 years back each time - the era's radio hits playing in the background as a marker of time. As a result, audiences get the benefit - or more accurately, the heart-wrenching burden - of hindsight in watching the pair slowly weave their web of mutual destruction.\n\nIn an early scene, for instance, we meet adult Doug, blinded in one eye by explosives, before a vignette, two scenes later, reveals how the accident could have been prevented had Kayleen not shunned him at her father's wake just moments before. Ouch.\n\nAs the characters sum it up themselves: \"We can both hardly see. And maybe that's for the best.\"\n\nGruesome Playground Injuries plays at the Esplanade Theatre Studio, weekdays at 8pm, weekends at 3 and 8pm till Sunday, Nov 10.

The yield on the company's five-year US dollar bonds fell 54 basis points since June, to 4.14 per cent on Nov 5.\n\nVanke has teamed up with Keppel Land for the development of 726 flats in east Singapore as foreign Chinese buyers have emerged as the top overseas buyers of residential property in the city-state this year.\n\nMainland builders are accelerating projects abroad as people from the world's most-populous country seek access to education, healthcare and citizenship abroad, said London-based broker Savills plc.\n\n\"Chinese developers have been looking offshore for funding for many years now but there's more impetus to do it now after the government turned the credit taps off,\" said James Macdonald, Shanghai-based head of research at Savills China. \"Being able to turn to overseas bond markets is important to Chinese developers as these markets are not tied to government policy and prices are dictated by the market.\"\n\nRegulators across China have sought to clamp down on property prices, tightening lending requirements and boosting minimum downpayments for additional home purchases in an effort to reduce the risk of a bubble destabilising the financial system.\n\nThe People's Bank of China in June engineered a cash crunch that saw short-term funding rates soar amid efforts to curb loose lending practices that have undermined bank balance sheets.\n\nThe yield on the government's benchmark 10-year bonds added three basis points to 4.22 per cent and has jumped 64 basis points this year. The yuan, which gained 2 per cent so far in 2013, was little changed at 6.0968 per dollar.\n\n\"Overseas markets are attractive as there is less government interference and stronger rule of law, which makes them more transparent and predictable,\" said Mr Macdonald, adding that currency diversification is another driving factor behind investment abroad.\n\nDalian Wanda Group Corp, founded by China's richest man Wang Jianlin, is constructing a luxury hotel and apartment building in England. Its unit, Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co, is considering selling a US dollar bond and met investors in London this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nChinese and Hong Kong developers have sold close to US$20 billion of debt in dollars this year, making up about 17 per cent of the market in Asia outside Japan.

This works out to about 26,000 yuan per square metre.\n\nTo partly finance the acquisition, CRCT said it has launched an equity fund-raising to issue 45.4 million new units at $1.30 each through a non-renounceable preferential offering to unitholders. This will raise gross proceeds of $59 million. The preferential offering will close next Wednesday.\n\nPart of the funding will come from the remaining proceeds from CRCT's private placement last October and external borrowing.\n\nYesterday, CRCT also brought forward its targeted completion for the acquisition to the end of this year, from the second quarter of 2014 previously.\n\nThese developments follow CMA's successful bid for Grand Canyon Mall for 1.74 billion yuan in July this year. That same month, CRCT had signed a conditional call option agreement with CMA to acquire the mall.\n\nGrand Canyon Mall is a three-year-old mall along the South Third Ring West Road in Beijing's up-and-coming south region. It enjoys an average monthly footfall of more than one million.\n\nLim Beng Chee, CMA's CEO, had earlier said that by offering this mall to CRCT, the former can reserve its balance sheet capacity for other opportunities while growing its assets under management, leasing network and market share.\n\nCRCT is managed by an external manager that is an indirect unit of CMA.\n\nYesterday, CRCT closed a cent lower at $1.38, while CMA ended two cents higher at $2.05.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, the market is still very robust and is still seeing good growth ahead.

But he said he was confident the next carrier would cost US$1.2 billion less, excluding non-recurring engineering costs and inflation.\n\nCongress has imposed an US$11.4 billion cost cap on the ship.\n\n\"We understand where the country is from a budget standpoint. We understand the urgency to drive toward affordability on these ships, as does Newport News,\" said Rear Admiral Moore.\n\nFailure to control costs could jeopardise Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 11 aircraft carriers, massive ships that can respond to a range of threats and situations around the globe.\n\nThe Pentagon is bracing for about US$1 trillion in spending cuts over the decade that began in 2013, unless Congress acts to reverse US$500 billion in cuts required under sequestration, a prospect seen as increasingly unlikely.\n\nThe late US president's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, is scheduled to smash a bottle of American sparkling wine across the Ford's hull on Saturday at a christening ceremony to be attended by hundreds of dignitaries, including former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nThe ship will replace the USS Enterprise, which was inactivated last year. Rear Admiral Moore said the Ford will be used for 50 years, and the new class would serve through 2110.\n\nThe Ford features a new nuclear power plant, a redesigned island, electromagnetic catapults, new weapons and storage elevators, and an enhanced flight deck.\n\nThe ship will produce 500,000 gallons of fresh water a day, 100,000 more than earlier Nimitz-class carriers, Rear Admiral Moore said. This will allow sailors to take \"Hollywood showers\", keeping water running while they bathe, instead of Spartan \"Navy showers\".\n\nHe also said that about 70 per cent of the Ford would be complete in time for the christening, a far higher percentage than the amount of work that was done when the last of the previous class of aircraft carriers, the Nimitz-class, was christened.\n\nDoing more work before christening would help save money on the Ford and also reduce costs of the next carrier, according to Rear Admiral Moore.\n\nHe said the Ford would be built with 50 million man hours of labour, but the Kennedy would require only around 43-44 million.\n\nThe next ship in the class, the USS Enterprise, would take around 40 million man hours to build, about the same amount of time needed to build the Nimitz-class carriers, despite the far greater complexity of the new ships, Rear Admiral Moore said.\n\n\"We are making significant progress on the Kennedy,\" he told reporters. He said Newport News was building more of the new ship's sub-systems in its shops or on the dock instead of doing all that work on the ship.\n\nHe said the Ford-class ships also had far more automated systems, which would reduce their long-term operating costs.\n\nSuch changes would allow the Navy to staff the ship with 900 to 1,200 fewer people than current levels of around 5,500 to 6,000 people, including air wing personnel, Rear Admiral Moore said.\n\nNewport News estimates the Ford-class ships will cost US$4 billion less to operate over their lifetimes than earlier ships. About 40 per cent of a ship's total lifetime cost is in maintenance, Rear Admiral Moore said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It is part of a decade-long effort by the US government to hold the healthcare giant - and other pharmaceutical companies - accountable for illegally marketing the drugs as a way to control patients with dementia in nursing homes and children with certain behavioural disabilities, despite the health risks of the drugs.\n\nThe settlement, which requires the approval of a federal judge, will also resolve accusations that the company inappropriately promoted two other drugs - the heart-failure drug Natrecor and Invega, a newer anti-psychotic drug.\n\nMuch of the conduct highlighted in the case, which for Risperdal extends from 1999 through 2005, occurred while Alex Gorsky was vice-president for sales and marketing and later president of the company's pharmaceutical unit, Janssen. Mr Gorsky became chief executive of Johnson & Johnson last year.\n\nIn a news conference on Monday announcing the settlement, Eric Holder, the attorney-general, said the company's practices \"recklessly put at risk the health of some of the most vulnerable members of our society - including young children, the elderly and the disabled.\"\n\nAs part of the settlement, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to plead guilty to criminal misdemeanour, acknowledging that it improperly marketed Risperdal to older adults for unapproved uses.\n\nIt did not admit to wrongdoing for the civil portion of the settlement, which involves claims that the company promoted the drug's use in children and the developmentally disabled, as well as accusations that it paid kickbacks to doctors and pharmacists in exchange for writing more prescriptions.\n\nThe company will pay criminal fines and forfeiture of US$485 million and civil penalties of US$1.72 billion. The civil settlement also resolves similar accusations brought by 45 US states.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said it stood by the safety and efficacy of Risperdal and was trying to put the chapter to rest. But some called into question the extent to which the company could move on, given that Mr Gorsky was now chief executive.\n\n\"Stockholders and patients will pay the price for the fraud,\" said Patrick Burns, co-director of Taxpayers Against Fraud, an advocacy group for corporate whistle-blowers. \"Mr Gorsky, however, gets to keep his job at Johnson & Johnson and all his bonuses.\"\n\nMr Burns has called on federal officials to hold executives more directly accountable in such cases.\n\nJohnson & Johnson officials tried to expand the market for Risperdal to older dementia patients soon after the drug was approved in 1993 to treat symptoms of psychiatric disorders, according to federal court filings. The drug, whose generic name is risperidone, was primarily tested in schizophrenia patients, and the US Federal Drug Administration repeatedly rejected efforts by the company to expand the drug's use to older dementia patients, according to the filings. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

It also experienced the strongest surge in wealth - 13 per cent to US$1.18 trillion.\n\nThese figures suggest that Asia \"is driving the tectonic shifts in wealth globally\", said a joint statement by UBS and Wealth-X. The latter researches the ultra-high net worth segment, defined as those with assets of at least US$30 million.\n\nAsia contributed the largest number of new billionaires this year at 18, followed by 11 in North America. Globally, there are some 2,170 billionaires, compared with 2,160 in 2012.\n\nTheir combined wealth grew 5.3 per cent to US$6.5 trillion from US$6.19 trillion last year. Interestingly, their combined wealth this year is enough to fund the US budget deficit until 2024, and is greater than the GDP of every country except the US and China.\n\nBy 2020, UBS and Wealth-X expect the billionaire population to exceed 3,800. This is a projection based on existing \"demi-billionaires\" - that is, those with a current net worth of between US$500 million and US$999 million.\n\nSaid the report: \"When taking into account those not yet worth US$500 million, the increase in the billionaire population is likely to be even higher.\n\n\"For example, many 'technopreneurs' continue to increase their wealth rapidly, and are able to achieve billionaire status in the span of only a few years.\"\n\nChina has the second-largest billionaire population globally, after the US. It has 157 billionaires with a combined net worth of US$384 billion; the US has 515 billionaires with a net worth of just over US$2 trillion.\n\nSingapore has the fifth-largest billionaire population in Asia, and the 18th largest in the world. In terms of the world's cities, it ranks sixth. New York is the top choice among billionaires, with 96 choosing to base their primary businesses there.\n\nAccording to the data, the average billionaire globally is worth US$3 billion. About 35 per cent or US$1.27 billion of this wealth is in private holdings. Another 35 per cent or US$1 billion is in public common stock. Cash accounts for 18 per cent or US$545 billion, and real estate 3 per cent or US$78 billion.\n\nThe report said that the liquidity cushion is higher than it was before the global financial crisis in 2008, \"suggesting that the old mantra of 'cash is king' remains as relevant as ever\".\n\nGlobally, about 60 per cent of billionaires are self-made, while 20 per cent inherited their wealth.

Constrained housing supply and demand from investors are driving prices higher, overpowering the downdraft from slower economic growth and a rising unemployment rate.\n\n\"It's easy to see how bubble-like conditions could emerge,\" said Saul Eslake, chief Australia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Melbourne. While prices are climbing, the increase isn't being accompanied by a rapid rise in borrowing or building, he said.\n\nIn Sydney, the nation's most populous city, the average home price surged 13 per cent in the 10 months to Oct 31 to a record A$718,122 according to the RP Data-Rismark home value index.\n\nThat compares with US$806,000 in New York as at Sept 30, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, and \u00a3331,338 (S$662,013) in London, according to the Nationwide Building Society.\n\nAustralians are used to high home prices and debt. Average household debt has hovered near 150 per cent of annual income since 2006, compared with 135 per cent in the US. House prices haven't fallen more than 10 per cent in any one year for more than 40 years, according to Reserve Bank of Australia data.\n\nIn Newtown - a former working-class suburb 5 km from the city centre where Ms Wong bought the property - prices have risen 13 per cent this year, according to researcher Australian Property Monitors.\n\nMore than 81 per cent of homes that went to auction in Sydney during the Nov 2 weekend were sold, even as the number of properties for sale rose to 739, the highest number in three years, according to APM.\n\nThe average home price across Australia's biggest cities was A$605,336 as at Oct 31, after recovering from a decline of 7.4 per cent between October 2010 and May 2012, according to the RP Data-Rismark index. That's a record, but it's about the same level in real terms as at end-2010, based on the statistics bureau's inflation calculator.\n\nInvestors like Ms Wong and self-managed pension funds, along with foreign buyers, are spurring the recovery. The value of loans to investors rose a seasonally adjusted 26 per cent in August from a year earlier, while those to owner-occupiers increased only 9.7 per cent, state data show.\n\nRising sales to investors puts the market in a more precarious position if economic conditions unexpectedly sour, Mr Eslake said.\n\n\"Investors aren't as committed to their properties as owner-occupiers,\" he said. Changes in the outlook for home prices, rising interest rates or unfavourable changes in regulation could lead them to \"dump their properties, putting sharp downward pressure on prices\", he said.\n\nAustralia's tax structure, which allows property investors to claim deductions on investment losses and offset them against other income, encourages investors to buy when they otherwise wouldn't.\n\nAmong investors, self-managed-superannuation funds - pensions managed by individuals rather than large money managers - have been boosting purchases of homes. Investment by SMSFs in residential property has risen 65 per cent since mid-2008 and 10 per cent in the 12 months to June to A$17.5 billion, according to data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which oversees regulation of the small funds. The ATO's June 2013 data is extrapolated from the funds' tax return filings for the year through June 2012.\n\nWhile do-it-yourself pensions borrow on average about 70 per cent of the value of a home, compared with about 90 per cent for regular borrowers, based on Australia & New Zealand Banking Group figures, they could \"potentially exacerbate property price cycles,\" the RBA said in its Financial Stability Review last month.\n\nForeigners accounted for 12.5 per cent of purchases of new homes in the three months to Sept 30, compared with about 5 per cent through most of 2011, according to a survey of more than 300 property professionals by National Australia Bank.\n\nWhile Australia is the world's sixth-largest country by size with a land mass of 7.7 million sq km , about two-thirds of its 22 million people live in its eight state and territory capitals, which occupy less than 0.5 per cent of the total area.\n\n\"This population concentration puts upward pressure on capital city dwelling prices,\" Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in an Oct 15 report.\n\nSydney now has 122 suburbs - or one in five - with a median home price above A$1 million, a 31 per cent jump from a year ago, according to researcher APM.\n\nIrina Burgess, 46, has been searching for a home in Sydney's lower north shore district for the past two years without success.\n\n\"A friend sent me a link to try and cheer me up, which was a 10-bedroom chateau in France with 22 acres (8.9 hectares) for less than the price of a two-bedroom apartment in Cremorne,\" a suburb 5 km north of Sydney's centre, she said. \"The prices are bonkers.\"\n\nOf the 20 suburbs with the biggest home-price gains over the past 15 years, half were in Perth - the biggest beneficiary of the nation's mining boom. Oakford, 34 km south of the city centre, has seen prices surge eightfold in the past 15 years to a median of A$852,000, APM said.\n\nIn other parts of the country, gains have been more modest with prices in Canberra rising 3.5 per cent in the year to Oct 31, Brisbane's increasing 3.4 per cent and Adelaide 1.9 per cent, according to RP Data-Rismark data. Hobart and Darwin home prices have fallen 0.7 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.\n\nThe most recent prices have generated plenty of talk of a housing bubble, with those words appearing in Australian media articles more times in September than at any time since 2003, chief economist Craig James and economist Savanth Sebastian of Commonwealth Bank of Australia's CommSec unit said in a research note.\n\nSimilar concerns have emerged in countries including the UK, where former Financial Services Authority chairman Adair Turner said an economic recovery \"is heavily focused on that favourite old British activity, which is another house price boom.\"\n\nIn Sweden, apartment prices rose 16 per cent in the 12 months to September after more than doubling since 2000, sending household debt to record levels and prompting a warning from the International Monetary Fund that the country needs to take measures to prevent consumer debt and housing costs from spiralling out of control.\n\nIn China, prices jumped by the most this year in October, the 17th consecutive month of increases, and in Canada, policy makers have been tightening rules on mortgages to try and prevent the market from overheating.\n\nHelping drive the pickup in prices in Australia is the central bank's 2.25 percentage points cut to its benchmark rate since November 2011 to a record low 2.5 per cent as it seeks to offset a peak in mining investment. The RBA's rate cuts have pushed the average standard variable home loan rate to 5.95 per cent, the lowest level since September 2009.\n\nEven with mortgage rates at a four-year low, not everyone is participating. First-home buyers accounted for 13.7 per cent of loans in August, the lowest level since April 2004 and compared with a high of 31 per cent in May 2009 when government incentives targeting them were in place.\n\nThe government is keen to see house prices rise in the hope that the construction industry, which is seeing a pickup, will underpin slowing economic growth. Treasurer Joe Hockey said last month that rising prices encourage more development and help ease a shortage of homes. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The looming adoption date begs the questions: Are companies fully prepared for the change? And just how will the new standard affect financial statements and the companies they belong to?\n\nThe Accounting Standards Council (ASC), which issues the standards here, actually held back the implementation of FRS 110 by a year, after receiving feedback that this and other FRSs due to be introduced at the same time were posing a greater challenge to stakeholders than anticipated.\n\nAccounting experts agree that, given the extra preparation time, FRS 110 should not present that much of a challenge to most companies on its own. But they also agree that the increased complexity of the new standard and the greater judgment needed to apply it will present some issues.\n\nSim Hwee Cher, Assurance leader at PwC Singapore, points out: \"For example, in the case of the option to purchase further shares, such as warrants - before FRS 110, the assessment of whether these options lead to consolidation was less complex and focused mainly on whether the option holder has the current power to exercise his option.\n\n\"Under FRS 110, the assessment will be much more complex, involving the consideration of a melting pot of factors including whether and how far the option is in the money, the purpose and design of the option, an assessment of the wider arrangement that led to the acquisition of the option, etc.\"\n\nReinhard Klemmer, partner and head of Accounting Advisory Services at KPMG in Singapore, says the initial adoption of the standard where market practices have not been set will prove difficult. \"For example, does a company with shares of less than 50 per cent control another company when the former is by far the largest shareholder? Such decisions are hard to make without historical precedent.\n\n\"Another requirement of the FRS 110 is to determine the significant activity of a company that may require consolidation - which was not something that the accounting standards required previously. The activity may not be straightforward enough to determine, which makes it hard for the finance function to judge on its own.\"\n\nThere are also operational issues a company will face in applying FRS 110. Shariq Barmaky, Assurance and Advisory partner at Deloitte Singapore, believes one of the biggest challenges will be the need for the parent company or investor to continually assess if it controls an investee when facts and circumstances indicate there are changes to the elements of control defined by the standard. \"We anticipate challenges in executing the assessment continually, particularly where very often the assessment of control is one that requires consideration of other market factors as well as other parties to the investee.\"\n\nMr Sim points out that other operational issues include \"managing stakeholders with regard to the impact on capital ratios, key performance indicators (KPIs), effects on key items such as revenue - due to consolidating additional revenue or vice versa - training finance teams to understand the new approach, implementing internal controls to identify judgmental areas of consolidation, and so on\".\n\nThe adoption of the standard will also be trickier for certain types of companies or entities.\n\nTan Seng Choon, Assurance partner at EY, says: \"Companies that will face significant challenges in adopting FRS 110 would likely be those who invested in special-purpose entities and fund/asset managers who are directing the activities of the fund that they manage, as these are the areas where (the) judgment involved would be significant.\"\n\nMr Barmaky points out that \"Reits (real estate investment trusts) and business trust structures need to exercise judgment in determining if they are principal or agent to the structure\".\n\n\"Among others, the assessment of principal-agent, and whether the rights are substantive or protective in nature, may not be a straightforward assessment,\" he adds.\n\nMr Klemmer believes two distinct categories of companies will face the greatest challenges: large conglomerates with a wide variety of relationships and operations in a number of foreign countries; and smaller companies that may lack the manpower to dedicate their most knowledgeable resources to deal with the adoption issues.\n\nHe adds: \"The other group that may struggle are some of the users of financial instruments, for example, lenders who have financial ratios they monitor; such ratios may significantly change if additional companies are being consolidated into the borrower . . . (Also,) as consolidation has an implication not just on one or a few line items on the financial statements, analysing its impact will require significant effort.\"\n\nStill, despite these, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that FRS 110 was introduced to improve on the current situation. It is meant to deal with the current diversity in practice in applying FRS 27, and with off-balance sheet vehicles, such as the securitisation vehicles that posed such a risk during the global financial crisis.\n\nMr Barmaky says: \"The debate continues as to whether FRS 110 will bring about more or less consolidation but, in essence, the new standard is intended to bring about more appropriate consolidation that better reflects the relationship between a reporting entity and an investee.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Much of the world remains under-insured.\"\n\nOver the next decade, the insurance business in Asia is projected to grow at about 8 per cent a year. By 2020, Asia is likely to account for almost 40 per cent of the global market.\n\nSingapore is already recognised as Asia's leading reinsurance hub, he said. Sixteen of the world's top 25 reinsurers have regional hubs here.\n\n\"The market has built up significant expertise in specialty insurance, namely marine, energy, catastrophe, credit and political risks. For example, Singapore is the second-largest market for structured credit and political risk worldwide after London,\" he said.\n\nMost Asian risks, including entire large reinsurance programmes and speciality risks, can now be fully placed in Singapore. MAS's vision is thus for Singapore's insurance industry to accept not just regional, but global risks by 2020, Mr Menon said.\n\nTo get there, MAS has four strategies, which are to:\n\nMAS will work with existing players to build up their speciality and reinsurance underwriting and broking capabilities and to expand their regional hubs, he said.\n\nIt will also seek to broaden the industry by promoting growth in emerging business lines, such as cyber risks, though efforts in this area might be stymied by a lack of Asian data.\n\nMAS is working with the industry to create a test bed for cyber risks, so that insurers and potential clients can come together to simulate loss events, he said.\n\nOn promoting Asian demand, Mr Menon said that cross-border access has to be improved and increasing the pool of Asian risk data is critical. Asean is working towards a comprehensive insurance liberalisation framework, with 2020 being the target year for substantial liberalisation in the industry.\n\nThe framework is expected to be discussed at the Asean Finance Ministers' Meeting next year.\n\nAs for paucity of data on Asian risks, Singapore is addressing the gap by setting up several research institutions to gather and analyse data in specific areas of risks, said Mr Menon.\n\nFor example, the Institute of Catastrophe Risk Management at the Nanyang Technological University is researching flood and earthquake risk assessment in selected Asian cities.\n\nA thriving hub needs a broker network, which has been growing here, he said. The vibrant broking cluster here has played a central role in facilitating business flows, and plays host to more than 70 insurance brokers. Four of the world's top five brokers have their regional hubs here.\n\nToday, brokers are not just intermediaries, but also high-value service providers that drive innovation and collaboration in the industry, he said.\n\nA good example of this is Aon, which recently established its Analytics and Innovation Center here to provide analytics solutions to the group's business units on a global basis, he added.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

If all goes according to plan, its Jurong Shipyard headquarters, PPL jackup rig building yard, Jurong SML yard in the south-west, Sembawang Shipyard and SMOE shipyard in the north will all come together on a 206 ha site in Tuas South.\n\nThe relative urgency with which it is undertaking this is being driven by three key factors: Firstly, there are economies to be reaped from integrating, modernising, upgrading and re-scaling its existing dispersed - and, in some cases, ageing and overcrowded - facilities.\n\nSecondly, it is raising its dock capacity to meet the intense competition from Korean and Chinese yards and, finally, it is freeing up the older sites and the 83 ha of SembMarine-owned waterfront land in Sembawang for potential redevelopment.\n\nAt the launch of the Sembmarine Integrated Yard @ Tuas yesterday, SembMarine chairman Goh Geok Ling said the integrated shipyard is being designed to accommodate all of SembMarine's Singapore yards, including the two largest and oldest ones - Jurong Shipyard built in 1963 and Sembawang Shipyard, a former British naval base.\n\nHe described Phase I of the new yard as just the beginning, and said that when Phase II is done in three to four years, \"we look forward to further expanding many of these facilities and continue to innovate our processes\".\n\nAs Singapore's leading builders of offshore rigs and floating production storage and off-loading (FPSO) vessels, SembMarine and Keppel Offshore & Marine (Keppel O&M) compete head on in some segments with South Korean shipyards like Hyundai Heavy, Samsung Heavy and Daewoo Shipbuilding; the rivalry is particularly in the building of semi-submersible rigs, FPSO vessels and, potentially, drillships. In recent years, even the China-based shipbuilding yards have started competing in the sector, using aggressive pricing to gain a foothold and make up for their lack of a track record.\n\nWhile the Korean and Chinese yards are primarily shipbuilding yards, the sharp decline in new orders for commercial ships has forced them to shift their focus to the relatively more lucrative, booming sector of offshore rig-building and offshore production vessels and platforms.\n\nIn his speech at the yard's launch event, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong outlined the challenges in this promising sector, which range from increased competition from the Korean and Chinese yards to the tightening of the foreign worker inflow here and the scarcity of land.\n\nThe question is whether SembMarine could have moved much earlier.\n\nIndeed, it has been more than a decade since its then-president and chief executive Tan Kwi Kin mooted the idea of building a new-generation shipyard. The idea, entailing the reclaiming of land in Tuas for the new yard, had received strong government support.\n\nSembMarine's \"sister\" company Keppel Corp has had a very positive experience in relocating its shipyards from their waterfront facilities in 1999.\n\nKeppel had moved its Keppel Shipyard out of Keppel Harbour to Jurong, which opened the way for the group to team up with Keppel Land to develop the site jointly into the classy waterfront homes of its Keppel Bay project.\n\nThese projects - its Carribean @ Keppel Bay, Reflections @ Keppel Bay and now, Corals @ Keppel Bay - have been well received by the market as unique waterfront homes.\n\nPerhaps SembMarine could also consider developing a Sembawang Bay residential development in 10 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the management of Keppel O&M's currently larger and relatively newer shipyard facilities are likely to be looking over their shoulders to size up the quickening expansion of SembMarine's shipyard facilities, likely to rival their own in the next decade.\n\nSometimes, timing makes all the difference.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Beyond various schemes and incentives to spur firms and workers to upgrade, what are needed are \"systemic improvements\" across entire sectors to achieve breakthroughs in productivity, Mr Tharman said as he singled out three industries in particular that the government is working on: construction, logistics and retail. To that end, \"we will be as aggressive as it takes, to support upgrading, on the job, outside the job and every form of upgrading by firms\", he added.\n\nIn that spirit perhaps, JTC tenants seeking to renew their leases on the government-owned factories will now have to pass some sort of productivity test. In an interview with BT, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Teo Ser Luck said firms will have to submit for consideration a proposal on how they plan to raise efficiency levels and \"set milestones\" - presumably a schedule of planned investments in plant and machinery, number and \"quality\" of jobs that will be created, etc. This will also apply to developers bidding for industrial land. All this is not good news for many SMEs, which, already faced with rising rents, will have to raise their efficiency game in short order, or be prepared to go to a commercial landlord - or relocate out of Singapore - if they are to stay in business.\n\nAs market principles go, the new JTC rule for lease renewals and land applications veers off the beaten track. While it is well meaning in that it seeks to address the longstanding problem of low efficiency across some industries that is perhaps rooted in outdated, labour-intensive ways of doing things, its practicality is questionable. For example, what measures of \"efficiency\" will be used, and how will these be tracked and assessed across a range of industries? What timeframe will companies have to achieve their milestones - bearing in mind that productivity gains accrue over a matter of years and vary from industry to industry? Some companies may even ask, quite reasonably, and with all due respect, what business is it of JTC - an industrial infrastructure specialist - to assess efficiencies in such specialised industries as semiconductors or chemicals.\n\nRather than getting involved in assessing the operations of companies in various industries (albeit jointly with Spring Singapore), JTC should stick to what it knows best, and what it is good at: creating and managing industrial space in ways that are innovative and land-efficient. While raising productivity is important, and companies want it too, it is a complex, long-haul process and not something that should be linked to lease renewals, even if this is practicable to do - which it is not.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It dived $12,499 to a seven-month low of $55,503.\n\nOne commercial vehicle dealer said dealers who had been aggressively clearing their existing stocks of heavy goods vehicles to beat the new 2014 emission standard have mostly finished doing so. New commercial vehicles have to be Euro 5-compliant from January next year.\n\nHe added that another reason for Cat C's plunge was that the recent strong orders for cement mixers and other heavy vehicles involved in the construction sector had been filled.\n\nAs for the passenger car market, the sales manager of a European dealership pointed to the weak overall market stemming from loan curbs and higher registration taxes introduced in February this year.\n\nSome dealers said they were still doing steady business in less expensive, entry-level models. But those in the luxury sector are generally feeling the pinch.\n\n\"Of course you still have cash-rich individuals buying cars but for a lot of other people, affordability is an issue with the mandatory 50 per cent cash downpayment,'' said the sales manager. \"It has taken a while but we are definitely seeing the vehicle financing restrictions starting to hurt buyers.''\n\nHe added that yesterday's slump in COE premiums did not come as a big surprise because it was a \"timely correction''.\n\n\"The sharp increases in late September and early October were overdone,'' he explained. \"Premiums rose too high and too quickly without corresponding real demand, especially when there aren't many new Cat B models to entice people.''\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

This more than offset the lower revenue contribution from the shipbuilding and shiprepair segments.\n\nTurnover from dry bulk shipping and other businesses held steady at $13.4 million, as most of the current quarter's short-term charter rates were secured earlier in the last quarter at an average Baltic Dry Index (BDI) rate of 888, which is comparable to rates received in the same quarter last year.\n\nGross profit fell 36.4 per cent to $73.2 million for the quarter from $115.1 million last year, mainly due to lower profit contributions from the shipbuilding and marine engineering segments as a result of inventory write-down and provisions for expected losses recognised on construction contracts.\n\n\"Our industry outlook remains cautious amidst the uncertain global economic climate and difficult operating conditions.

The NTSB concluded that the pilot and co-pilot did the exact opposite of what was needed to save the plane after it lost speed and stalled.\n\n\"This will give our pilots the most advanced training available to handle emergency events that they may experience,\" said FAA administrator Michael Huerta. \"This is one of the most significant updates of air carrier pilot training in the last 20 years.\"\n\nMr Huerta said that the complexity of implementing change explained why it took \"a long time\" to achieve. \"The important thing we're trying to do is raise the bar on safety,\" he said.\n\nThe rules announced on Tuesday are among several mandated by Congress in the aftermath of the Colgan crash. It follows rule changes that required that pilots get a minimum of eight hours of sleep and 10 hours off between flights. The crash came after one pilot slept in an airport lounge and the other flew cross-country to meet the flight in Newark.\n\nThe newly announced rules require additional pilot training on preventing and reacting to aircraft stalls, better tracking of pilot training and performance, and additional training on handling planes in crosswinds and gusty conditions.\n\nMr Huerta said that he would invite the airlines and safety experts to Washington later this month to discuss additional steps to improve safety and pilot training. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Air travel has become a product with multiple attributes that may include in-flight Wi-Fi, extra legroom or lounge access, as opposed to just a seat on an aeroplane. Travellers can build their own trip experience by selecting which options will add value to the journey.\n\nOn airline websites, customers have access to these additional products and services. But for the 60 per cent of tickets (by value) that are sold via a high-street travel agent or travel website, information available to agents is more basic, because distribution technology used by agents currently is limited to little more than fares and schedules.\n\nThe 2013 Iata Global Passenger Survey (GPS) of nearly 8,000 travellers confirms the existence of an information gap between airline websites and other shopping channels. For example:\n\nThere is a long explanation for why this gap exists. But the short version is that distribution via travel agents is built on pre-Internet messaging standards. These don't have the same capabilities as XML (eXtensible Markup Language), the language of Internet-based commerce.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (Iata) is working with our travel agent and travel technology partners to close that gap through the New Distribution Capability (NDC). Simply put, NDC is an initiative to update the existing messaging standard between airlines and agents to XML. It's true that global distribution system (GDS) companies are working to make it possible for airlines to merchandise their products through travel agents in a manner more consistent with airlines' own websites. But each is working on its own proprietary solution. NDC will be an open standard available to any and all who want to use it, including the GDSs and non-Iata airlines.\n\nSpecial offers\n\nIn addition to enabling airlines to display and sell the full range of their offerings through travel agents and travel websites, NDC will permit customisation and personalisation that consumers have come to expect.\n\nAccording to the GPS, nearly half of all travellers are interested in sharing such things as travel preferences, age, interest/hobbies and frequent-flyer status in order to receive special offers or products and services from airlines tailored to their needs, and a fifth would share their social media profile as well.\n\nCreating the NDC standard will unleash innovation - and that will mean change. But NDC will operate within the same privacy laws that govern every other business. That is no change from today. By giving travel agents more information, there will be greater transparency for consumers. Systems incorporating the NDC standard will enable much richer comparison shopping for travel products, not just the base fare, but the entire spectrum of offerings.\n\nConsumers may continue to shop anonymously, as today, but for those who choose to identify themselves, such as by providing a frequent flyer number for example, airlines will be able to personalise offers.\n\nIata's raison d'etre is to set global standards to enable harmonisation and greater efficiency across the entire industry. Standards are pro-competitive and cost-effective. By facilitating the adoption of new technology, they create value.\n\nWe have made strong progress over the past year. Our application for approval of Resolution 787, which is the foundation document for NDC, is before the US Department of Transportation (DOT), and we are optimistic of a positive outcome in the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\nThe NDC pilot programme was launched in February 2013. Five pilots are underway and a number of others are in the process of getting started. We expect the pilot phase will last through 2014. In 2015, the initiative should move into a deployment phase, in which a number of airlines will have adopted the initial version of NDC. A global rollout is expected to begin in 2016.\n\nConsumers already enjoy rich shopping experiences on retail platforms such as Amazon.com, so shouldn't they expect the same level of transparency and choice when buying a plane trip?\n\nThe writer is director of financial and distribution services transformation at the International Air Transport Association\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Brokerages also began to put their own restrictions on various penny stocks.\n\n\"The market pulled back not just out of caution, but also as a result of all the curbs in trading houses,\" he said.\n\nPhillip Securities analyst Ken Ang noted that seasonally, the end of the year is usually more quiet for equity activity, \"but right now, there's an additional impact of lower market confidence\".\n\n\"We don't see this as a long-term thing, though. We expect (securities) trading to pick up in January.\"\n\nMonth-on-month, activity also came off from a higher base of $30.3 billion traded in September. September had seen heavy trading after the Fed in mid-September opted to leave its asset-purchase programme unaltered, leading investors to unwind their pre-tapering positions, said Mr Ng.\n\nDerivatives volume, however, rose 20 per cent year-on-year to 8.5 million contracts, although it slipped from nine million contracts in September.\n\nOpen interest, or contracts not closed or delivered at month's end, rose 63 per cent to 3.8 million contracts. It reached an all-time high of 3.811 million contracts on Oct 29.\n\nMr Ang said that these are \"pretty good numbers\" that point at growing market interest and a more optimistic environment towards SGX's derivative business, specifically its equity index futures.\n\n\"The nature of derivatives is that they are volatile based on market sentiments, but for quarters now, they have been able to improve quite nicely.\"\n\nThe jump in open interest numbers means that more traders are holding their overnight positions via the exchange, even if it means having to place collateral with the clearing house.\n\n\"So either existing traders are holding more open positions, or more market participants are coming onboard. Either way, it leads to increased trading activity from higher interest in the products offered by the exchange,\" said Mr Ang.\n\n\"It shows that SGX remains clients' preferred platform for their trades on, for example, the Asian equity index futures,\" he added.\n\n\"Conveniences such as being able to switch from holding, say, a Nikkei 225 position to one on the India, Indonesia or Taiwan index futures, all on the same platform with no need to transfer collateral, makes SGX an attractive alternative to trading in the respective onshore markets.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue a year ago was US$17.8 million.\n\nThe firm had sold its two jack-up rigs, of which it owned 45.5 per cent indirectly, in August.\n\nThis contribution from the drilling services division resulted in the group's overall average gross profit margin for the quarter rising from 26.5 per cent last year to 44.5 per cent.\n\nRevenue from its oilfield services division also rose from US$5.4 million last year to US$35.8 million, boosted by the procurement of a one-off short- term contract and an increase in the provision of sundry services during the quarter.\n\nRevenue from its marine division increased from US$10.4 million to US$17.8 million, as more vessels were deployed.\n\nFalcon Energy said that it is optimistic about business prospects going forward, due to buoyant demand and stable oil prices conducive for higher levels of exploration and production activities.\n\nThe group sees strong growth in its marine division, with improved utilisation rate of vessels at higher charter rates, and on longer contract terms.\n\nOne of two 78-metre multi-functional support vessels that it ordered in October 2011 has been delivered, and is now used on a three-year bareboat charter by a Mexican firm.\n\nThe second will be delivered by the end of this year.\n\nIn preparation for higher demand for offshore vessels, Falcon Energy said that it plans to invest in newer vessels.\n\nIts oilfield services and oilfield project divisions continue to do well, despite facing stronger competition and lower margin, it added.\n\nVoyage Research analyst Ng Kian Teck said that even after taking aside the increase in profit from the one-off gain, the outlook for the firm is improving, especially in its marine division.\n\n\"The utilisation rate (of the vessels) has been steadily increasing.

However, some check-in counters manned by staff will still be on hand to cater to passengers.\n\nFurthermore, unlike the existing terminals where immigration and pre-boarding security screening take place at different points, these will be centralised at T4, cutting down the number of staff and amount of equipment required. CAG said the area will be designed and managed in a way to prevent bottlenecks.\n\nTo be located on the site of the former Budget Terminal, the hybrid T4 terminal will have a handling capacity of 16 million passengers a year - nearly three-quarters that of Terminal 3 - but at 195,000 square metres will span roughly half of T3's size.\n\nT4 will cater to both full- service and budget airlines, with 17 aircraft parking stands for narrow-body planes and four for wide- body planes. To link T4 to the other terminals so that passengers can catch connecting flights, complimentary shuttle services will run, both landside and airside, for a seamless connection.\n\n\"It will be the first terminal where we fundamentally re-think our check-in processes to add speed and efficiency while reducing manpower needs for our airline partners,\" said CAG's chief executive Lee Seow Hiang at the ground-breaking ceremony yesterday.\n\nTransport Minister Lui Tuck Yew, who was guest- of-honour at the event, said Changi must build capacity to meet growing passenger traffic, especially as travel demand in the Asia-Pacific moves at a clip that is set to make the region the largest aviation market worldwide by 2031.\n\n\"Airports require sufficient capacity to attract new airlines, add new city- links and increase frequencies. Without this, airlines would turn to other airports that can better facilitate their growth, and Changi would risk losing connectivity and consequently, its mantle of being Asia's premier hub,\" he warned.\n\nOther airports in the region are striving to boost capacity, with Kuala Lumpur International Airport seeking to ramp up handling capacity to 100 million passengers per year by 2020 and Hong Kong International aiming to hit 97 million by 2030.\n\nT4 will take Changi's handling capacity to 82 million per year, up from 66 million now, while T5 will be able to handle a massive 50 million passengers per year on its own. Changi's passenger traffic is forecast to grow at about 5 per cent per year for the rest of this decade, from around 51 million in 2012.\n\nAt the sidelines of yesterday's event, AirAsia Singapore chief Logan Velaitham said the charges for airlines to operate at T4 would ultimately play a deciding role in whether the budget carrier relocates from Terminal 1. \"That would be the key driving factor,\" he told BT.\n\nCAG, which has started discussions with airlines, said that charges would be \"reasonable\".\n\nAround $600 million is being invested towards building T4 while a further $680 million will be put aside for supporting infrastructure, such as aircraft parking stands, ancillary buildings as well as road and drainage works.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Boeing is keen to control costs on its new 777, as it faces competition from the all-new Airbus A350-1000.\n\nThe talks are aimed at a multi-year extension to the existing machinists' contract expiring in 2016, said one source familiar with the talks.\n\nAnother source said the contract would run until the middle of next decade.\n\nUnder the deal being discussed, machinists could receive a bonus payment if an agreement is approved by union membership, one of the sources said.\n\nHowever, Boeing has warned union leaders it will open talks with other potential locations if the discussions break down, the source added.\n\nBoeing has told the union that in the absence of a deal \"all bets are off\" as to the location of final assembly and wings production, the source said.\n\nA union official confirmed that the talks are taking place and had intensified recently, but declined to be specific.\n\n\"There are and have been discussions about the 777X,\" said Frank Larkin, national spokesman for the machinists. \"I'm unaware of any proposed deal at this point and what shape that deal may or may not take.\"\n\nDesigned to carry up to 406 people on some of the world's longest routes, the 777X is due to enter service in 2020 and is expected to be produced well toward the middle of the century.\n\nThe US planemaker is expected to launch the latest version of its popular 777 mini-jumbo jet with at least 100 orders from Gulf carriers at the Dubai Airshow this month.\n\nBoeing has signalled recently that it was diversifying beyond the Seattle area where the current 777 was designed and is being built. In an internal memo obtained by Reuters last week, Boeing told employees it would place a significant amount of engineering design work for the 777X in a handful of cities around the United States and overseas.\n\nThe dispersal of engineering work was seen as putting pressure on Everett, and Washington state, to prove they could handle the project at low cost compared with other locations.\n\nWashington state also is working on tax cuts and other incentives to help win the 777X work.\n\n\"We've been led to believe the incentives are just as important\" as the labour deal, said Alex Pietsch, director of the Governor's Office of Aerospace for Washington State.\n\nIncentives include a 16-year extension of tax breaks passed in 2003 and set to expire in 2024, and funds to improve roads and transportation to reduce traffic congestion. Boeing says its drivers cover 8.5 million miles a year in Washington state, or close to the Earth's circumference every day.\n\nBoeing's decision on where to build the plane and its advanced composite wings will have long-term implications for the aerospace industry, including its chain of suppliers.\n\nThe location talks also suggest Boeing wants to bring more design and construction under its direct control after costly mistakes from outsourcing much of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nRob Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the moves suggest \"a broader trend from Boeing towards more make/less buy in order to control production better, and potentially capture more aftermarket revenue\".\n\nAfter a revamp of its smaller 737, the 777X will be the last major new commercial project on Boeing's drawing board for at least 15 years, and the final choice could determine the location of high-tech composites work for decades to come. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Mr Gross and Mohamed El-Erian, the co-chief investment officers of Pimco, didn't return e-mailed requests for comment.\n\nInvestors started to flee bonds this year on concerns that the US Federal Reserve will taper its bond-buying programme, which could lead to higher interest rates and a decline in fixed-income prices.\n\nStocks have rallied on rising corporate earnings and forecasts that the US economy will accelerate in 2014.\n\nUS bond mutual funds saw net redemptions of US$117 billion in the four months through September, while stock funds received US$35 billion, according to the Investment Company Institute in Washington.\n\nThe Vanguard index fund attracted US$14.5 billion in contributions this year, including US$2.1 billion in October, according to estimates from Chicago- based Morningstar.\n\nMr Gross' fund more than doubled in size between 2008 and 2012 as investors deserted stock funds after the financial crisis for the perceived safety of bonds.

If accepted, the new fare formula will apply from 2013 to 2017.\n\nIn his Facebook post yesterday, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said that he was grateful to see the committee's recommendations focused on ensuring that public transport fares remain affordable for all commuters.\n\n\"We must do this while recognising the need to keep the public transport system in Singapore financially viable,\" said Mr Lui.\n\nPointing to the last fare exercise in 2011, the minister said that the proposal to allow for a smoothening of significant fare increases over two years using a rollover mechanism was \"helpful\". The FRMC proposes that the Public Transport Council be given the discretion to roll over a portion of the quantum of fare adjustment in a particular year to the next fare review exercise.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the recent annual conference of the sector's trade association, Interferry, the chief executive of the Britain-based P&O Ferries, Helen Deeble, urged members to speak in a united voice when dealing with governments.\n\nShe said: \"We need to be involved pre-regulation because he who shouts loudest wins. There is a fundamental conflict between our industry, which is essentially long term, and the short-term objectives of politicians. Governments may be huge, unwilling to change course and focused on getting re-elected. But there are some good guys out there and we can promote our industry if we find them.\"\n\nThe 250 conference delegates heard of the political, technical, operational and commercial challenges facing the industry; safety was a recurring theme, with discussions made more poignant by the loss of more than 100 lives in August with the sinking of the Philippine ferry St Thomas Aquinas after a collision.\n\nP&O Ferries fleet director John Garner said that, with 80 per cent of accidents caused by the human element, it was vital to look beyond technical aids and address the \"soft\" side in developing a company-wide safety culture.\n\nJan Helge Pile, the senior vice-president of Marine & Technical at Color Line, agreeing, said there was more to gain - and probably at lower cost - by focusing on the crew.\n\nGrandi Navi Veloci president Roberto Martinoli added: \"Focusing on operational measures would definitely give better results. As an industry, we believe we are over-regulated, but when something happens, we are going to be responsible, even if we have all the certification. That's part of our business, whether we like it or not.\"\n\nNevertheless, there is considerable pressure on the ferry industry to improve design, particularly to prevent a sinking in the event of flooding.\n\nProfessor Dracos Vassalos of the Britain's Strathclyde University welcomed the introduction of goals-based rather than rules-based damage-stability regulations, saying this opens the way for life-cycle risk to be addressed at the design stage.\n\nExpressing alarm over the so-called \"Grandfather Clause\" which exempts existing ships from the new rules, he warned: \"As a result, the bulk of contemporary knowledge is channelled into new ships - (which make up) one per cent of tonnage, leading at best to marginal safety improvements for the whole fleet.\"\n\nProf Vassalos said the \"grandfather provisions\" leave a regulatory gap that undermines and inhibits progress on vulnerability to flooding, and that the disparity between old and new ships was increasingly becoming a chasm.\n\nEven the newest ships could soon be left behind by proposed safety rules. Interferry's executive director of the European Union and IMO Affairs Johan Roos warned that the IMO sub-committee on ship design and construction was expected to consider a proposal to increase the statistical survivability of new ships by adding more bulkheads.\n\nHe said: \"We are deeply concerned that such a measure would jeopardise the entire ro-pax (roll-on, roll-off passenger ship) concept, possibly without adding to the actual safety level.\"\n\nInterferry's view is that, before adding more steel, much more emphasis should be placed on enhanced operational safety. Current regulations only address physical alterations of designs. The trade association argues that enhancements to an already safe ferry system should focus on a different approach: Instead of trying to design a ferry that can withstand any plausible damage, the emphasis should be on avoiding the accident to begin with.\n\nThat could be a hard-sell at IMO. The reality is that the current generation of roll-on, roll-off ferries are far safer than those built 20 years or more ago, but politicians do not easily forget names such as Herald of Free Enterprise and Estonia - and they should also not try.\n\nNevertheless, with accidents continuing to occur on old ferries, such as the St Thomas Aquinas, surely the immediate focus ought to, as Prof Vasallos argues, be on upgrading or replacing those ships.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The one-time \"dark continent\" is now starting to glow. The World Bank projects that its economic growth will average 5.6 per cent this year - respectable even by Asian standards. Eleven of the world's 20 fastest growing economies are now in Africa. The continent also boasts high rates of urbanisation, growth in discretionary incomes and infrastructure spending - all of which have opened up huge investment opportunities.\n\nAlthough the quality of governance is mixed across the continent, there have been major improvements over the last decade in several countries, including Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. Security concerns, while still present, are nowhere as serious as they were 10 years ago. Africa is also open for business, with fairly liberal economies and investment regimes. Indeed, many studies show that investment returns in both manufacturing and services are higher in some African countries than in even China, India and Indonesia.\n\nWhile a few Singapore companies have been active in Africa for many decades, it is only in recent years that high-profile companies such as Hyflux, Olam and Surbana have ramped up their activities on the continent. But there is reason to believe that Singapore's commercial engagement with Africa is far below potential. Its total trade with the whole continent last year was less than $18 billion, which is slightly more than half of its trade with India and about one-third of its trade with China. Only an estimated 55 Singapore companies operate in Africa, compared to several hundred in each of Asia's larger economies.\n\nThere are many potential opportunities for Singapore companies in Africa, including low-cost manufacturing, energy, telecoms and other infrastructure, urban planning, housing, consulting and advisory services. Moreover, Singapore companies are well positioned to partner those from other countries in the region that are active in Africa, such as companies from China, India and Australia. IE Singapore has a memorandum of understanding with China - the biggest investor in Africa - which can facilitate co-investment by Chinese and Singapore companies. And Singapore has free-trade agreements with both Australia and India, which can help with doing business in third countries.\n\nThere are also local organisations such as the Africa Business Group, established by the Singapore Business Federation that can help pave the way to doing business on the continent through the sharing of knowledge and contacts. Singapore companies should consider placing Africa on their radar screens -it's certainly not too early to explore the opportunities on offer in this underexplored and promising frontier market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He has been a non-executive director on Temasek's board since September 2011, and is also a member of its executive committee.\n\nMr Cheng's appointment comes some three months after Temasek appointed Lim Boon Heng its new chairman. Mr Lim took over from S Dhanabalan, who had served as Temasek's chairman for 17 years.\n\nMr Dhanabalan said then that a new chairman does not mean a change in direction for Temasek as \"the chairman together with the board and management determine which direction to take\".\n\nMr Cheng, in addition to being chairman and managing director of Singapore- listed Wing Tai, is vice-chairman of Singapore-Suzhou Township Development and a director with Singbridge Holdings, Singapore Health Services and Kidney Dialysis Foundation.\n\nHe had previously served as chairman of NOL, Power Seraya, Media Corporation of Singapore and Raffles Holdings. He also served on the boards of various public service organisations.\n\nMr Cheng came to Singapore from Hong Kong in 1974 to take over the Wing Tai business that had been founded by his father and uncle in 1963. Back then, Wing Tai was a garment manufacturer.\n\nMr Cheng made the move into property, foreseeing its potential. Wing Tai is now known for luxury projects, such as Helios Residences at Cairnhill and the upcoming Le Nouvel Ardmore. The group is also in the retail business, behind international brands such as Topshop and Uniqlo in Singapore.\n\nMeanwhile, the hunt for Temasek Holdings' next chief executive to succeed its current CEO Ho Ching goes on. Its chairman said soon after his appointment that the investment firm will continue its search until a suitable candidate is found.\n\n\"Then we will have to judge whether the timing is right for us to make a CEO change,\" Mr Lim had said. \"It is about the right person first, then the right time.\"\n\nIn July, then-chairman Mr Dhanabalan said that Temasek also had plans to add more non-Singaporeans to the Temasek board. He said that, given that Temasek and its stable of Singapore-based firms have grown more global, their boards have to change to reflect that.\n\nTemasek owns a $215 billion portfolio as at March 31, 2013, with 71 per cent of its underlying assets in Asia and 25 per cent in the mature economies of North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yesterday, he emerged from the shadows to defend the BOJ's record in contributing to the country's improving economic situation.\n\nThe highly upbeat tone of his public remarks is likely to reassure financial markets that Abenomics is still firmly on track, analysts said.\n\n\"What I recognised when I assumed the role of the governor of the Bank of Japan in March this year was that we must bring Japan's economy out of deflation that has lasted for almost 15 years,\" he told business leaders in Osaka.\n\n\"The greatest challenge facing Japan's economy in the immediate future is a prompt overcoming of deflation, and the role the bank has to play to that end is critical.\"\n\nThe BOJ's policy of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing \"has been steadily exerting its intended effects\", he said.\n\n\"Japan's economy is expected to grow above its potential as a trend, amid a continued virtuous cycle among production, income and spending, and is likely to steadily follow a path towards achieving a 2 per cent price stability target,\" he noted.\n\n\"Since the turn of the year, real GDP has registered high growth of about 4 per cent on an annualised basis for two consecutive quarters (and) while exports have generally been picking up at a somewhat slower pace, domestic demand, notably private consumption and public investment, has been firm,\" he said.\n\n\"Domestic demand is likely to maintain firmness as external demand is expected to increase the virtuous cycle among production and income, and spending is likely to be maintained. Japan's real GDP growth in fiscal 2013 is now projected (at) 2.7 per cent, partly reflecting a front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike.\"\n\n\"What sets Japan's current economic recovery apart from past false dawns is that it is domestic demand-led, with the non-manufacturing sector as the main driver,\" the BOJ governor noted.\n\nMr Kuroda rejected criticisms by many economists that Abenomics policies were not leading to an increase in wages and personal consumption cannot continue to increase in this situation.\n\nHe said the employment situation continued to improve moderately but steadily, with both the unemployment rate and the ratio of job offers to applicants having almost recovered to the level before the Lehman shock. \"There has also been an increasing sense of a labour shortage on the firms' side,\" he added.\n\n\"This improvement in the employment situation has started to influence wages. The year-on-year rate of change in nominal wages per employee has gradually stopped declining on the whole, partly due to growth in summer bonuses for the first time in three years.\"\n\nThe improving trend in the employment situation is likely to continue as the economy recovers moderately, and nominal wages per employee are expected to be put under upward pressure gradually, Mr Kuroda argued.\n\n\"From a somewhat longer-term perspective, wages will likely show a clear uptrend as the effects of tightening supply and demand conditions in the labour market emerge and inflation expectations rise.\"\n\nAbenomics has also been criticised on the grounds that it is not leading to any significant improvement in private capital investment.\n\nMr Kuroda dismissed this criticism as well.\n\n\"Reflecting the major feature of the economic recovery this time, business fixed investment has been resilient in the non-manufacturing sector,\" he noted, adding that there were also signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector.\n\nResponding to concerns that the proposed two-stage hike in the national consumption tax from next April could derail economic recovery, Mr Kuroda said: \"While there will be a swing due to the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand, Japan's economy is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential, as a trend.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All three recorded better than expected Q3 earnings due mainly to good growth in broad-based customer-related businesses with credit quality remaining strong.\n\nDBS posted a net profit of $862 million, up one per cent year on year, despite getting the call on tapering wrong.\n\nAt the bank's results presentation, Mr Gupta said: \"We basically got the call on Fed tapering wrong.\"\n\nThe market had expected the US Federal Reserve to begin pulling back on its quantitative easing or bond purchases in September and when it didn't happen, bond prices rallied.\n\n\"We pared down some of our Treasury holdings in the long-end and took out hedges for some of our Treasury positions. Clearly when the Fed didn't taper . . . the hedges . . . went out of the money,\" he said.\n\nSeptember trading income fell to $32 million, from the monthly average of $95 million for Q2.\n\nAt OCBC, net trading income too fell to $47 million in Q3, from $144 million in Q2. OCBC's Q3 net profit fell 59 per cent to $759 million, from $1.85 billion a year earlier, which included a divestment gain of $1.126 billion.\n\nExcluding the non-core gains last year from the divestment of stakes in Fraser and Neave and Asia Pacific Breweries, the core net profit of $759 million was actually 5 per cent higher than the year-ago quarter's core earnings of $724 million. It also beat the $658 million average of eight estimates in a Bloomberg survey.\n\nWhat stood out in Q3, as was the case in Q2, was the continued brisk loan expansion for the banks.\n\nMr Gupta said DBS has been gaining market share in both business loans and mortgages.\n\nDBS' total loans grew 19 per cent year on year while its Singapore loans rose 18 per cent year on year.\n\nData from the Monetary Authority of Singapore showed that September lending for the industry grew 15.7 per cent year on year, up from August's 15.4 per cent but down from July's 17.6 per cent.\n\nOCBC said Q3 loans growth was up 16 per cent year on year but Singapore loans rose a slower 11 per cent. OCBC's core non-interest income was strong, underpinned by higher fee income and better insurance performance from its Great Eastern Holdings unit.\n\nFees and commissions rose 16 per cent year on year to a quarterly record while profit from insurance was up 26 per cent.\n\nUOB said loans gained 15.8 per cent year on year while Singapore loans rose a faster 18.4 per cent.\n\nIt was also the only bank among the three which saw its net interest margin stabilising at 1.71 per cent, unchanged from the previous quarter.\n\nDBS and OCBC said their net interest margins continued to slide, due to the low interest rate environment and repricing of Singapore mortgage loans. For DBS, it was down two basis points from a quarter ago while it was one point lower for OCBC.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Gupta said DBS expects full-year 2013 loans growth at 15 per cent. For 2014, loans should grow 8-10 per cent, he said.\n\nOCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien said OCBC will seek growth opportunities mainly in its key overseas markets of Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China as the higher margins elsewhere make up for the slim ones at home. Hence, Singapore's contribution to group revenue, which stands at about 60 per cent, may dip below that level.\n\nUOB loans pipeline remains healthy and the bank is confident of achieving low to mid-teens loans growth for full year 2013, said Jimmy Koh, managing director, investor relations.\n\n\"For 2014, despite global moderation, we are expecting high single-digit loans growth due to projected resilient pan-regional trade flows. While mortgage approvals have come down, UOB's mortgage growth has remained resilient due to a strong pipeline,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The majority, or 19 out of the 30 stocks in the Straits Times Index, are expected to hand out better payouts in the next 12 months, with three expected to pay special dividends, said Markit Dividend Research.\n\nBut while payouts are expected to be better, the picture is somewhat gloomy in dividend yield terms, especially in banks and telcos, and that is because share prices have risen.\n\n\"Focusing on dividends for the next 12 months to be declared by stocks in the FTSE Straits Times index, we expect 19 out of the 30 stocks to raise their returns to shareholders and six to cut them. The remaining stocks are projected to maintain zero dividend growth,\" said Markit in its first research piece on Singapore dividends.\n\nIt forecasts three to pay special dividends.\n\n\"Sembcorp Marine and Singapore Technologies Engineering have been paying special dividends consistently for the last four years at least, so we believe it will continue to pay them unless circumstances become dire.\n\n\"Separately, Sembcorp Industries had declared specials in FY'10 and FY'11 but chose to omit it in FY'12. On better projected earnings for the current fiscal year and one-off gains from the IPO of Salalah, we think that this year's payout could be augmented by a special dividend,\" said Markit.\n\nSembcorp had owned 60 per cent of Salalah which went public in September, and was required to dispose of a 20 per cent stake for the IPO.\n\nDBS Group Research in August estimated that Sembcorp would book $109 million from the IPO.\n\nYield chasers should brace for falling yields from the index stocks.\n\n\"Comparing the expected 12-month forward dividend yield with the corresponding period a year ago, yields have fallen for more than half of the stocks in the index,\" said Markit.\n\n\"Based on our current dividend forecasts, five out of 10 sectors will see a lower average yield for the 12 months ahead. These are the banks, industrial goods & services, media, real estate and telco sectors.\"\n\nBanks are the main drivers of dividends in the STI, accounting for over 20 per cent of aggregate dividends paid by all the stocks in the index last year, said Markit. \"We expect dividends to edge up for all three banks in the coming year, but expect yields for OCBC and DBS Group Holdings to trend lower, falling 24 basis points (bp) and 42 bp to 3.4 per cent and 3.47 per cent respectively.\"\n\nSeparately, the dividend yield for United Overseas Bank is projected to rise 7 bp to 3.63 per cent this year, it said. UOB declared a special dividend of 10 cents in FY'12. \"We do not expect this to happen again this year, but are forecasting a growth in regular dividends so that the total payout meets its historical target of 40 per cent and above.\"\n\nSingTel and StarHub have always maintained a high dividend payout based on the proportion of earnings, it said. Earlier at its Q1 release, SingTel guided for the group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to decline by a low single digit level for FY'14 on a weaker Australian dollar outlook.\n\n\"We expect dividends to stay flat, even if this could represent a payout slightly higher than its targeted range of 60-75 per cent of underlying earnings.\"\n\nStarHub, on the other hand, has guided flat dividends for the remaining two quarterly dividends this year. \"Despite higher capex, given that the uncertainty of the 4G spectrum pricing is over, we think there is scope for increased dividends in FY'14 alongside improved earnings.\n\n\"This would come after four years of flat dividend growth. In yield terms, projected yields for SingTel and StarHub are at 4.50 per cent and 4.90 per cent respectively.\"\n\nBoth are lower than the year-ago yields of 5.25 per cent and 5.38 per cent.\n\nTop yielders are trusts and SPH.\n\nBoth Hutchison Port Holdings Trust and Capitamall Trust aim to maintain full distribution of profits to shareholders, it said.\n\nHPHT leads the pack with a projected yield of 6.83 per cent. A year ago, HPHT dividends would have yielded investors 8.16 per cent, it said. \"We do not expect the absolute level of dividends for the next couple of years at least to reach 2012 levels as it had struggled to meet the previous year's dividend commitment with a deferral of capital expenditure.\"\n\nFor SPH, last year was a bumper year for shareholders with a special payout arising from the listing of SPH Reit. This pushed the yield to 10.32 per cent, almost twice the rate this year. \"Going forward we are forecasting flat dividends for the next three years out as earnings are projected to remain stagnant on a weaker outlook for its core businesses and dilution of its stake in the Reit business.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The unabashed gold bug's Euro Pacific Capital Inc manages a US$20 million mutual fund that invests in stocks related to gold and lost 6.4 per cent since it began in July. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index slid 1.5 per cent in the same period.\n\nMr Schiff, 50, isn't fazed that gold is heading for its first annual price drop in 13 years, or that Goldman Sachs Group Inc has called it a \"slam-dunk sell\". He predicts that bullion will reverse its 21 per cent year-to-date decline and probably surge 52 per cent to reach a record US$2,000 an ounce within a year. That's just the beginning: Mr Schiff said that he would \"be amazed\" if the US dollar didn't collapse and gold failed to skyrocket before President Barack Obama leaves office in 2017.\n\n\"I'm waiting for the dollar crash, I'm waiting for the real crisis to hit that I know will benefit gold,\" Mr Schiff said on Oct 18. \"The longer it takes, the longer I have to wait for that payday. But the longer it takes, the bigger that payday is going to be.\"\n\nWith inflation at or below the Fed's 2 per cent target for the past 11 months, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index reaching record levels and the US dollar strengthening against major currencies in the past year, Mr Schiff knows his forecasts make some people laugh. He's used to it. They also scoffed in 2006 when he predicted on television that housing prices would plunge, lenders would go bankrupt and stocks would plummet, as they did two years later.\n\n\"They should take him seriously - he was right with a lot of other ones,\" Ron Paul, the former Republican Representative from Texas who has called for abolishing the Federal Reserve and auditing the US gold depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, said on Oct 23. Mr Schiff was an economic adviser to Mr Paul's presidential campaign in 2007.\n\nMr Schiff's predictions don't persuade Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr Obama.\n\nGold bugs, investors who buy the metal as protection against a collapse in financial assets, fail to understand that the Fed's pumping money into the economy only offsets banks' tighter lending and stockpiling cash, Mr Goolsbee said. Until credit conditions return to \"normal\", there's no danger of inflation, he said.\n\n\"They have been saying that for literally four-plus years, and they have been egregiously wrong,\" Mr Goolsbee said on Oct 30. \"As a matter of mathematics, they're just adding up the numbers incorrectly to say that they think there's going to be 200 per cent inflation.\"\n\nJeff Currie, the head of commodities research at New York-based Goldman Sachs, said at an Oct 8 conference in London that gold would fall after lawmakers reached a deal on the US debt limit. Mr Schiff went on CNBC Europe to say that Goldman Sachs had it backwards: allowing more government debt would push gold higher.\n\nGold, which closed at US$1,316.20 an ounce on Nov 1, will decline to US$1,050 by the end of 2014 as the US economy improves, the US dollar strengthens and the Fed reduces its bond-buying programme, Goldman Sachs analysts said in an Oct 18 report.\n\n\"Nobody really understands gold prices and I don't pretend to really understand them either,\" Fed chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee in July. Other central banks kept expanding reserves after gold peaked in 2011, losing US$545 billion in value.\n\nAssumptions such as Mr Currie's on why investors have lost faith in gold as a store of value are false, according to Mr Schiff. The economy is only growing because of government spending, so debt continues to swell, he said.\n\nTo hold interest rates low, the Fed will have to keep buying bonds, which means printing more dollars, Mr Schiff said. Foreign countries use them to buy US bonds - in effect lending the US more money to pay back what's already owed. Governments such as China eventually will balk, he says. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Her public mien is gentle and engaging, qualities that are likely to expedite her confirmation process and also influence her leadership of the Fed.\n\nThings were not always so in Fed land. Historically, Fed chairmen ran the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with iron hands, imposing their will on their colleagues and policy and often dropping policy shifts as unexpected shocks on the markets and the economy. However, the Alan Greenspan Fed embarked on a practice of driving policy more by consensus among FOMC members, with regular public statements as to the intentions of Fed policy and the likelihood or inevitability of future policy changes. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has intensified each of these trends, and we would expect chairman Yellen to follow suit.\n\nEven apart from collegiality, there is reason to think that a Yellen Fed would be at least as communicative as its two predecessors. Short-term interest rates remain at the zero bound. The US banking system, the traditional transmission mechanism from Fed policy to the economy, is still essentially flat on its back. The one policy tool the Fed has left in its arsenal is forward guidance on its intended future path of short rates. To maximise the usefulness of forward guidance, a Yellen Fed would need to be just as communicative as Mr Bernanke's.\n\nMs Yellen would certainly bring an activist stance to Fed policy. Her statements indicate that she believes current employment levels are too low and that she believes it's the Fed's responsibility to address that problem. How would she go about that? Her writings provide insight here. Ms Yellen's recent statements offer two alternatives to the Taylor Rule, which has achieved some credence among policymakers and economists in recent decades.\n\nThe Taylor Rule provides a formula describing how short-term interest rates should be adjusted in response to shifts in inflation and real growth. If inflation were at its target with real GDP (gross domestic product) at full-employment trend levels, as understood by the Fed, then the funds rate should be set at two percentage points above the inflation rate. Each percentage point move in inflation above target should elicit a 0.5 per cent hike in the funds rate and vice versa, and each percentage point move in real GDP below target should elicit a 0.5 per cent point cut in the funds rate, and vice versa. Notice that the Taylor Rule responds equally forcefully to movements in real GDP away from target as to movements in inflation.\n\nMs Yellen has proposed what she calls a balanced approach, consistent with her concern about low employment levels stemming from a weak economy. Such an approach would take the same basic structure as the Taylor Rule, but react twice as forcefully to movements in GDP as to movements in inflation.\n\nThus, if real GDP were 1.0 per cent below target and inflation 1.0 per cent above target, this approach would still call for short rates to be 0.5 per cent below their \"normal\" level, 1.5 per cent above the inflation rate. (The Taylor rule was introduced by Stanford economist John Taylor in his 1993 paper Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice. He formulated the rule as an equation describing how Fed policy could be said to have operated over 1987-92.)\n\nNow, what relevance do these rules have when the funds rate is essentially at zero and further cuts are impossible? For example, presently, most formulations of trend GDP growth and inflation targets would prescribe a negative funds rate even under the Taylor Rule and all the more so under a balanced approach. Desired funds rates would have been even more negative during and just after the 2008-09 recession. If the funds rate can't be lowered to the (negative) desired levels, an alternative approach is to guide forward rates lower for a long period of time in the hope that guidance lowers present term yields to much the same levels as would hold if the funds rate were at the negative levels the Fed desires but can't attain.\n\nThis gets us back to forward guidance. It also paves the way for the optimal control approach Ms Yellen has introduced. Under that approach, different forward paths for the funds rate would be run through the Fed's macro model of the economy, and the resulting estimated paths for inflation and real GDP would be fed into a \"loss function\" that rates the outcomes based on the amounts of deviation of each from desired paths. The policy path with the best loss function result would then be the path the Fed would announce and embark on. The idea here is that by including in the mix not only present but also future outcomes - or at least the Fed's estimates of future outcomes - a Yellen Fed could determine the optimal amount of forward guidance to provide to markets today in order to overcome the zero-bound constraint.\n\nIn an ideal world, optimal control would work perfectly. Of course, in an ideal world, we wouldn't need models, nor forward guidance nor even a Fed. So, what possible real-world challenges might arise?\n\nFirst, there is reason to think Fed models' estimates will prove inaccurate. If inflation and GDP behave differently from model specifications, prescribed policies could be sub-optimal.\n\nSecond, we've predicted that a Yellen Fed would be as consensus-driven as its immediate predecessors, but it is hard to envision what there would be to reach consensus on, should policy be model-driven. Fed district presidents will not have as much influence as Board members over the structure of the Fed Board's model or the loss function employed. However, once these are chosen, policy is all but determined, and it is not clear what would then be left to reach consensus on. On what grounds could dissent be voiced or prevail? Similarly, should the model or the policy prescriptions prove unsatisfactory, how could a Yellen Fed gracefully back away from them?\n\nA third issue is whether an optimal control policy is indeed a policy rule at all. Taylor and others meant for his rule to impose discipline on policymakers and minimise their discretion. It is clear that Ms Yellen has introduced both the balanced approach and the optimal control approach in order to achieve more leeway - if not discretion - than the Taylor Rule affords. Also, it is hard to know whether periodic \"refits\" of the Fed model or the loss function would be free of discretion. So, the credibility of an optimal control policy would be an issue.\n\nOf course, the same could be said with respect to Fed forward guidance. Just because the Fed announces it will keep short rates at zero until mid-2015 and thereafter raise them only gradually doesn't necessarily mean it will actually act thus.\n\nAnd, if forward guidance is not credible within the markets, its impact on yields and on the economy is suspect. In the same way, optimal control policy in practice would only be as optimal as it is credible and understandable to the public. Economists call this the \"time inconsistency\" issue with policy pronouncements. Optimal-control policy announcements would be just as subject to this issue as the announcements we now receive.\n\nIn other words, the success of an optimal policy approach would be dependent in part on the avoidance of disconnects between Fed intentions/announcements and market reactions. An example of such disconnects is provided by the bond market's selloff this spring and summer in response to the Fed's \"guidance\" on possible tapering of quantitative easing (QE) and Mr Bernanke's subsequent displeasure.\n\nNote also that tapering of QE is a much simpler concept than policy paths arising from model simulations and loss functions.\n\nMr Greenspan's policies were applauded - at the time at least - for their simplicity and clarity. Amid the upheaval of the last six years, Mr Bernanke has resorted to more complex operations with less than clearly satisfactory results. Ms Yellen appears willing to up the ante yet further, by possibly resorting to model-driven policy that may be hard to explain clearly to the markets.\n\nThe balanced approach she proffers in her writings provides a reasonably clear policy rule. It would provide Ms Yellen more scope to address her policy concerns, but not unlimited leeway, and it would require retrenchment when and as the occasion arises (that is, when GDP and unemployment have attained their targets).\n\nIn the near term, none of this makes much difference. The time for tightening is far away. Meanwhile, Ms Yellen should be credited for advancing the discussion of Fed policymaking and transparency. Whatever one might think of her proposed policy approaches, she has introduced and discussed them openly and well in advance of the day when they might take hold.

The median estimate of seven forecasts collated by Bloomberg was 51. A reading above 50 denotes expansion while one under 50 points to contraction.\n\n\"The stronger PMI reading suggests that growth momentum could strengthen in Q4,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin. With this, he expects the government to raise its full-year GDP growth forecast to between 3.5 and 4 per cent, from the current 2.5-3.5 per cent forecast.\n\nUnderpinned by further expansion in new orders, new export orders and higher output, October's stronger PMI also reinforces the surprise surge in September's factory output that the Economic Development Board reported two Fridays ago.\n\nElectronics manufacturers, whose output surged 20 per cent in September, also reported higher activity levels in the latest PMI survey. The electronics PMI rose to 51 in October from 50.3 in September, SIPMM said. Sub-indices showed growth in both local and foreign new orders, as well as higher output.\n\n\"Overall inventory continued to contract for the third consecutive month, indicating that the new orders could be expected to beef up production and imports in the coming months,\" said Janice Ong, executive director of SIPMM, which compiles the monthly index from its poll of more than 150 industrial companies' purchasing managers.\n\nThe drop in inventories - the overall inventory sub-index fell to 48.9 while that for electronics sank to 46.4 - suggested that producers are either finally shipping them out, or writing excess inventory off, said Barclays economist Joey Chew. \"In any case, it's good for manufacturing and exports to get rid of this inventory hangover,\" she said.\n\nGlobally, the latest PMIs for the US, Europe, China, Korea and Taiwan, which have all shown expansion in manufacturing, bode well for an export recovery too.\n\n\"Despite the dip in consumer sentiment in October from the US government shutdown and fiscal drama, it appears that producers and retailers are still gearing up for a strong Christmas shopping season,\" said Ms Chew.\n\nIf, however, Singapore's export performance continues to diverge from industrial production as it has in recent months, that may flag a loss of competitiveness. With inventories now correcting, the only explanation for a export-production gap would be that Singapore's producers have cut export prices and sacrificed profit margins to secure orders, Ms Chew said.\n\nBut SIPMM's Ms Ong reckons that lower input costs may have helped. \"Factory output has been boosted by lower input prices, suggesting that our local manufacturers have been focusing on cost-reduction strategies to stimulate demands of their manufactured goods,\" she said.\n\nLooking at the details of the PMI report, Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan said there was insufficient evidence in the data so far of significant manufacturing growth.\n\nThough the appreciable uptick in employment sub-indices does set a \"fairly upbeat tone for Q4\", the smaller rise in new export orders shows uncertainty over whether the rebound in global demand will last. \"The danger is being carried away with one round of rather effervescent data, whereas the underlying reality is more grounded,\" he noted.\n\nAfter all, businesses themselves are less optimistic than before, said OCBC economist Selena Ling.\n\nEDB's recent quarterly business expectations survey showed that more manufacturers expect the business outlook to deteriorate over the next six months than those who expect improvement. A quarter earlier, the number who were optimistic outnumbered the pessimistic.\n\nIn any case, Q4 will not be without its challenges. Mr Varathan believes export demand could be dampened if fiscal uncertainty in the US holds back business activity, or if the lagged effects of the stronger Singapore dollar cascade down to manufacturing.\n\nVolatile external demand dynamics aside, ANZ economist Daniel Wilson said local producers will \"continue to contend with increased cost pressures driven by rising rents and wages\" through Q4 and into 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Brazil, which largely bankrolled the Mariel Port project, has voiced its interest in investing in the development zone located on Cuba's Mariel Bay, 45 kilometres west of Havana.\n\nHavana decided to build the new port after it came to the conclusion in 2009 that the Bay of Havana could not be expanded to accommodate larger ships that will begin passing through the Panama Canal in 2015.\n\nThe project was launched in 2010 as a Cuba-Brazil joint venture with an investment of US$900 million. The first 700-metre stretch of dock is scheduled to be ready in December and to be officially inaugurated by Cuban President Raul Castro and his Brazilian counterpart Dilma Rousseff in January. - Xinhua\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The UK banking industry avoided the market following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 because of regulatory requirements to meet stricter capital rules.\n\nGreater competition on commercial property loans has narrowed lending margins by as much as two percentage points in the past year, said Anthony Myers, a real estate executive at Blackstone Group. With UK commercial property values rising for the first time since 2011 and balance sheets on the mend, British banks are increasingly willing to offer loans backing offices, stores, and industrial properties.\n\n\"Having to compete against the renascent energy being shown by the banks, the amount of fat in the margins has been squeezed out considerably,\" said Ashley Goldblatt, head of real estate lending at Legal & General (L&G) Group's investment management unit. The company set up its real estate lending business three years ago and is on track to have loaned \u00a3500 million (S$992.5 million) by the year-end.\n\nFifty real estate lenders entered the market in the 12 months through June, according to London-based broker Savills. Aviva, Great-West Lifeco's Canada Life, Jones Lang LaSalle's LaSalle Investment Management affiliate, and Prudential's M&G Investments unit are among companies that have loaned \u00a3100 million or more on deals in the past year, said William Newsom, a senior director at Savills.\n\nGreater competition is narrowing interest rate margins and starting to slow the influx of new entrants, Mr Newsom said in e-mailed comments.\n\n\"I'm sceptical about the amount of business the senior debt funds are likely to do because interest-rate margins have come down,\" Mr Newsom said. \"They have to provide investors with a certain level of return, so they're in a bit of a bind.\"\n\nBritish lenders showed increased willingness to provide commercial property debt for the fourth straight quarter in the three months through September and that's expected to continue through the end of the year, according to the Bank of England's quarterly credit conditions survey.\n\n\"The improved economic climate and business confidence levels in recent months has seen an uplift in the commercial real estate market in general and hence an increase in demand for finance from a range of providers,\" Susan Geddes, managing director of structured real estate finance at Banco Santander's UK unit, said in e-mailed comments.\n\nLloyds Banking and Banco Santander have increased their commercial-property lending in the past six to nine months, Chris Bates, head of European real estate finance at Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers said by phone. The company, which has US$28 billion of debt investments in the US, started lending for UK real estate a year ago and now has a \u00a3260 million loan book.\n\n\"This increasing liquidity has meant pricing in London in particular has come down quite dramatically,\" Mr Bates said.\n\nThe UK commercial real estate values rose for the fifth straight month in September, posting the biggest gain since April 2010, Investment Property Databank said on Oct 14. The recovery in commercial property prices has also helped attract banks back to the loan market.\n\nBanks and building societies provided 85 per cent of all loans to commercial property companies last year, according to data compiled by De Montfort University in Leicester, England.\n\n\"The reason banks only did 85 per cent last year is because, for the majority of the year, they had to pull their reins in,\" L&G's Mr Goldblatt said. \"This year, they're back out in force.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Revenue was down 65.8 per cent at $89.9 million, from $262.7 million a year ago.\n\nThe significant decrease in revenue was attributed to the company's property development segment, which recorded $21.8 million of revenue, down from $194.1 million.\n\nThe same quarter a year ago, Chip Eng Seng had recognised results from the delivery of the completed residential units of Australian project 33M. Under the company's construction segment, revenue remained at the $68 million mark.\n\nFor the property investments segment, quarterly revenue halved to $449,000 because no rental income came from its vacated Queen Street property in Melbourne, Australia, which is being redeveloped as Tower Melbourne.\n\nDespite property development revenue fluctuations, net profit for the quarter did not drop as much.\n\nPre-tax profit was boosted by a $27.9 million share of results from associates, up sharply from $186,000 a year ago. The results came from a completed joint venture development, the executive condominium Prive, which obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit in July.\n\nAs at end-September, the company had seven wholly owned property development projects.

More than just a piece of plastic, Mauritius's new ID card contains an electronic chip that stores each citizen's fingerprint and biometric data.\n\nThis is one of many projects in which both countries are partnering at the government level, fronted here by the Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE).\n\nEstablished in 2006, SCE shares Singapore's public sector expertise with interested foreign parties, with the aim of generating economic spin-offs for the private sector here.\n\nApart from offering visit programmes and training initiatives to foreign governments, SCE manages and implements overseas projects. By pooling public and private sector expertise, SCE tailors solutions to match foreign countries' needs.\n\nSaid SCE's chief executive officer, Kong Wy Mun: \"It's difficult for a company to go directly into an unfamiliar emerging market, because they can't be sure whether the government may change the rules halfway, whether they can negotiate for good terms, or whether they can even receive payment at the end of it.\n\n\"But when we come in as a government entity and contract on their behalf, we help to mitigate these risks for companies. With our access to a foreign country's top leaders, we can ensure that things are transparent and done properly.\n\n\"Likewise, for the foreign government they feel assured contracting through us because they know we are not a fly-by-night entity. Some governments have been played out before with companies that over-promise, so naturally they can be hesitant to contract other foreign companies directly. So it makes sense for (both our) Singapore businesses and the governments we partner,\" noted Mr Kong.\n\nRetired civil servants with deep knowledge of Singapore's nation-building experience are sometimes called in to assist with overseas projects. For instance, SCE has worked with the former CEO of the Central Provident Fund Board, Liew Heng San, and SPRING Singapore ex head honcho Lee Suan Hiang.\n\nWhile SCE has only recently moved into Africa, it is finding that the continent abounds with opportunities.\n\n\"When we first started, Africa was really a very very small component of our total project value,\" said Neo Poh Ling, director, Sub-Saharan Africa, SCE.\n\nIn the next three years, SCE estimates that Africa will make up at least 60 per cent of the group's total project value. To date, it has done about $90 million worth of projects on the continent - a long way from its initial $4 million figure in 2008.\n\nNational ID project\n\nPart of this includes its various partnerships with Mauritius - a country almost three times Singapore's size and with a population of 1.3 million. Collaboration between the two nations was first sparked after Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam was impressed with Singapore's system of managing identity documents and its national registry database while on a visit to the city-state five years ago.\n\nKO Fong Weng-Poorun, senior chief executive in the Prime Minister's Office, told The Business Times: \"At the time, we were already looking to replace our ID cards - which dated back to 1986 and were just paper-based cards - so we decided to knock at the door of Singapore.\"\n\nSCE brought together a team of experts, helmed by Singapore e-government company CrimsonLogic, to analyse Mauritius's needs.\n\nPrior to the launch of its new ID card - which sports a soft pink colour similar to Singapore's NRIC - Mauritius's national registry consisted of three handwritten ledgers dating back to the 1800s: a blue book for births, a black one for deaths and a red book for marriages.\n\nBut data sets were often incomplete and incorrect, because surnames were not updated after marriages occurred, which sometimes led to double counting. Whole fields were often missing, too. No back-up copies were available either, which posed a security risk.\n\n\"Sometimes people say that our ID project is just about producing a card. But it's (so much more than) that - it's the management of the database, making sure the information is secure,\" said Mrs Fong Weng-Poorun.\n\nThe new card, launched in October, allows Mauritians to set up a bank account without their birth certificate and proof of current address, since this information is stored on the card.\n\nThe government has plans to integrate the card with future e-government systems, including health and tax services. So far, the country has spent 1.1 billion Mauritian rupees (S$50 million) on its ID project.\n\n\"If we are serious about improving Mauritius's position as a thriving economy and a business hub, we need to have the facilities to achieve this objective. You cannot have a modern country and have a small piece of paper as your identity card,\" added Mrs Fong Weng-Poorun.\n\nOther collaborations\n\nIn addition to the national ID card scheme, SCE is collaborating with the Mauritian government to build a light rail transit system as well as improve its prison security framework.\n\nR Jayachandran, Singapore's High Commissioner to Mauritius, believes there is scope for future partnerships. \"Given that Mauritius is also an island state like Singapore, our wealth of expertise and experience in managing air and sea ports is perhaps one area we could explore with Mauritius in the near future.\"\n\nMauritius has also turned to Singapore for help with its water management processes. It loses about 60 per cent of its water because of 100-year-old worn-out pipes. This results in island-wide water shortages and rationing, and some residents even lack access to water, sometimes for up to 12 hours.\n\nDev Aukle, general manager of Mauritius's Central Water Authority, told BT: \"Singapore is helping us realise that there are other ways to (minimise) water losses. Maybe we don't have to change all the pipes but we can pay closer attention to managing what we already have, perhaps with more sophisticated detection equipment.\"\n\nSCE's team includes Singapore's PUB and environmental services firm CH2M Hill, who are working to bring down the amount of water lost in Mauritius from 60 per cent to 25 per cent. Singapore loses only 5 per cent of its water.\n\n\"It's important to remember that Singapore stands as an example because we've done this before,\" said Kumar Nadarajah, principal engineer at CH2M Hill. \"Like Singapore, Mauritius is an island, it is water-stressed, and I think the main Singapore story is that it has turned adversity into success. So why can't Mauritius do the same?\"\n\nTaking a different angle, Alvin Lim, SCE's director for Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and Latin America who oversaw the national ID card project, reckons Singapore has much to learn from the countries it assists.\n\n\"I think these collaborations offer us good opportunities to examine ourselves, and understand what we can do better. If we don't do that, we may fall into the trap of thinking that our way is the right way, the only way,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The airline's fiscal year runs to the end of March.\n\nRyanair added that net profit rose 1.0 per cent to 602 million euros in the group's first half, or in the six months to the end of September, as traffic rose 2.0 per cent to 49 million passengers.\n\n\"We are pleased to report slightly increased first half profits, particularly against a backdrop of softer fares this summer,\" Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in the statement.\n\nAside from exchanges with customers on Twitter and plans for a simplified website, Ryanair is also seeking to improve its public image as it flies into tougher market competition.\n\nCustomers being hit by fines at the airport for failing to print off their tickets and for carrying too much weight in their luggage are among some of the biggest grievances, even if Ryanair's policy is posted on its website.\n\nRyanair recently simplified its online booking process, and will launch a new homepage later this month, after customers regularly complained about the confusing and long procedure.\n\nThe airline also said it would allow passengers to carry a second bag of hand luggage from December.\n\nRyanair's chief operating officer Michael Cawley has said that while changes are being introduced, there will not be a shift from the basic principles that transformed Ryanair into one of the biggest carriers in Europe.\n\n\"The idea that there's going to be wholesale changes is wrong. There's some changes announced and there will be more changes but we don't want to throw out what's good about Ryanair,\" he told an aviation conference in Dublin last month.\n\n\"We need to be perhaps a little bit less vigorous in the implementation of (our policies). When we're taking 70 euros from someone for a bag that doesn't fit we should do it not with glee but with sympathy,\" he added.\n\nRyanair had in September issued a shock profit warning that it blamed on intense competition and falling airfares, sparking a share-price plunge across Europe's airlines sector which highlighted its influence on the market.\n\nFollowing the profit warning, outspoken chief executive, Mr O'Leary declared that the company would strive to be less abrasive.\n\n\"I'm conscious that we need to eliminate a lot of minor things that irritate,\" Mr O'Leary told the company's annual general meeting (AGM).\n\n\"We do need to soften the image when things go wrong. We need to be quicker and more responsive.\"\n\nIn summing up he added: \"We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily pisses people off.\"\n\nThe airline came under fire in the run-up to the AGM for charging a Dublin-based neurosurgeon 188 euros to change flights after his wife and three children were killed in a house fire in England.\n\nThe airline later apologised to the customer.\n\nMr O'Leary also admitted that the company needed to reduce its \"macho\" culture and subsequently took part in a rather amusing but forthright question-and-answer session on social-media site Twitter, under the hashtag GrillMOL.\n\nDonal O'Neill, aviation analyst with Goodbody stockbrokers, said that September's profit warning should be distinguished from the customer service changes.\n\n\"They're partly related long term but in the near term they are quite different issues,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"In order to differentiate itself and in order to keep growing, Ryanair has to offer a slightly different product to its passengers and that's with a longer-term view to appeal to those kinds of consumers that traditionally used legacy carriers (like British Airways and German airline Lufthansa).\n\n\"A lot of these services are focused on trying to continue to take traffic from those carriers and also to try to win new traffic and maybe slightly higher-end traffic,\" Mr O'Neill added.\n\nRyanair transported almost 81 million passengers across Europe in the year to the end of October, its own data revealed on Friday.\n\nRyanair added that from February it will move to fully-allocated seating on all flights, ensuring that families sit together. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It will be developing the project on a 99-year leasehold site that it clinched in April.\n\nIt paid $1,162.86 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), a record for 99-year private housing land offered at a state tender. The group is targeting to launch the condo in the first half of next year, said a KepLand spokeswoman.\n\nMCC Land received URA's provisional nod to develop a 599-unit condo in Tampines Avenue 10.\n\nOn a freehold site on Hoe Chiang Road in the Tanjong Pagar area where Keppel Towers and GE Tower currently stand, KepLand unit Mansfield Developments obtained provisional permission in Q3 for a mixed development project comprising 249 apartments, about 25,630 sq m (about 275,900 sq ft) gross floor area (GFA) of office space and around 6,140 sq m (66,090 sq ft) of retail space.\n\nEarlier in Q1 2011, Mansfield had obtained URA's approval to redevelop the same site into 590 apartments and 16,800 sq ft of retail space. A KepLand spokeswoman said the submission for the revised development proposal is part of the group's \"ongoing efforts to evaluate all possibilities to ensure best use of this freehold site, which is located close to Tanjong Pagar MRT Station\".\n\nA couple of projects in the fast-developing Jurong Lake District on sites sold by the state clinched URA's provisional nod in Q3.\n\nOne is a proposed development by Resorts World Singapore's unit Tamerton Pte Ltd for a 560-room hotel along Jurong Town Hall Road in the Lakeside zone and about 22,170 sq ft GFA of retail space.\n\nAt a URA tender that closed nearly a year ago, Tamerton paid $1,167.35 psf ppr for the 99-year leasehold site - a record for a hotel site at the time. The first hotel development site to be sold in Jurong, the 0.9-hectare plot drew 11 bids.\n\nThe other Jurong project that won URA's provisional nod in Q3 is Sim Lian's project in Venture Avenue in Jurong Gateway to build about 625,500 sq ft of offices and 69,500 sq ft of retail space. Talk in the market is that Sim Lian is looking to strata title the office component for sale; a launch is expected in first half next year. BT understands it has yet to decide whether to keep the retail component for rental income or sell it as well. Jurong Gateway and Lakeside are the two zones that make up Jurong Lake District.\n\nAlso receiving provisional permission in Q3 were Changi Airport Group to develop approximately 130,350 sq ft of retail space and 88,800 sq ft of offices at Terminal 4, and Laguna National Golf and Country Club to develop a 199-room hotel.\n\nIn the industrial property space, BS Capital linked-Kranji Development clinched URA's provisional nod for a warehouse development in Jalan Lam Huat in the Kranji location. The proposed project, with about 1.17 million sq ft GFA, will come up on a freehold site it bought from a unit of City Developments last year.\n\nUnited Engineers received URA's approval to build an extension to its UE BizHub Central in Ang Mo Kio. The extension, which will come up on a surface carpark site, will have GFA of around 259,400 sq ft. UE has given the just listed Viva Industrial Trust a right of first refusal to purchase UE BizHub Central.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was underpinned by stable margins and healthy asset quality as we stayed disciplined in pursuing sustainable growth,\" said UOB chief executive Wee Ee Cheong.\n\nOperating profit grew 3.4 per cent quarter on quarter in Q3 to $949 million and 2.8 per cent year on year, with net interest income crossing the $1 billion milestone for the second consecutive quarter. Loans rose by 2.1 per cent in the quarter, led by the region which grew 4.4 per cent excluding currency effects. Gross customer loans rose 15.8 per cent year on year to $177 billion and were broad-based.\n\nLoans from Singapore increased a faster 18.4 per cent while the regional countries grew 12 per cent.\n\nNet interest margin stayed unchanged quarter on quarter at 1.71 per cent as the bank has had a good mix of assets in the last few quarters, said Jimmy Koh, UOB managing director and head of investor relations. Margins were down 13 basis points from a year ago. \"Longer term, as we move our asset mix into the region, we should see margins improving.\"\n\nNon-interest income fell marginally from Q2 as an increase in trading and investment income was partially offset by lower contributions from wealth management, fund management and loan-related income arising from uncertainty in financial markets. Expenses rose 4 per cent year on year and fell 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter to $715 million. Cost-to-income ratio held steady at 43 per cent. UOB is in the final phase of a refresh of its regional banking platform.\n\n\"This lays the foundation for improved efficiency, enhanced risk management system, speed to market and seamless customer service across our franchise in the coming years,\" said Mr Wee.\n\nCredit quality remained strong and non-performing loan ratio was unchanged at 1.2 per cent from the previous quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, the region will continue to be impacted by the uncertainty surrounding QE tapering, and US fiscal cliff issue, said Mr Wee. \"Despite the near term headwinds, the fundamentals of the region remain sound, underpinned by growing intra-regional trade and rising consumer affluence,\" he said.\n\nOn loans, Mr Koh said the bank was confident of achieving low to mid-teens loans growth for full year 2013. \"For 2014, despite global moderation, we are expecting high single-digit loans growth due to projected resilient pan-regional trade flows. While mortgage approvals have come down, UOB's mortgage growth has remained resilient due to a strong pipeline,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nUOB shares closed trading yesterday at $20.80, up two cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sgx-should-consult-public-hft", "site_title": "SGX should consult public on HFT", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSGX should consult public on HFT\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Nov 4, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE is a sense of painful resignation, infused with no small amount of frustration and even impending doom among retail players and their brokers following news that the Singapore Exchange (SGX) is pressing ahead with plans to introduce high-frequency trading (HFT) to the local equities market. Since it appears to be a question of when and not if, the exchange should address the myriad issues before opening its doors to a mode of trading that is controversial and has yet to prove beneficial to markets as a whole.\n\nThe first thing that the SGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore should note is the absence of a proper understanding of how exactly HFT works, the activity being so complicated that very few individuals can properly claim to have full understanding or to be experts.\n\nIf anything, the fragmentary knowledge that can be gleaned from surfing the Internet or from anecdotal testimony of traders has probably created more confusion than clarity.\n\nA natural consequence of ignorance and the shock of the new is, of course, fear - and this has manifested itself in complaints to the press and vitriolic criticism of SGX making its rounds in cyberspace and in dealing rooms.\n\nThe exchange may well counter that these fears are unfounded and that HFT offers boundless liquidity and efficiency benefits that would ultimately improve the lot of all traders.\n\nBe that as it may, it's worth noting that HFT's advantages are as yet unproven and the fear of the unknown pales in comparison to the fear of losing one's livelihood. For this reason, the exchange would do well to tread carefully.\n\nOver the past few years, retail brokers have suffered a massive loss of income because of declining commissions (inevitable, given deregulation and ultimately to the benefit of end-users but painful nonetheless); thinning volume; a cancelled lunch break; a China or S-chip segment mired in governance scandals whose crash is seen as largely responsible for keeping retail customers away; and more recently, sudden trading curbs imposed by the exchange that appear to have driven all but the most die-hard retail punters from the market.\n\nGiven this background, it's hard not to see HFT as another blow to trading representatives who serve small customers. The perception now is that SGX, bent on enhancing liquidity and therefore its coffers, is only interested in big players that can move millions in a second, and is not really after retail business.\n\nThat said, HFT traders cannot spend the day trading among themselves - eventually, the game will descend into a meaningless technological arms race to see who can develop faster computers with no real end in sight. Vibrant retail participation is therefore essential. How then, should the issue be approached?\n\nEducation might be a good starting point. It would be fair to say that most market players, whether dealers, remisiers, investors or speculators (as well as the journalists who cover the market), have only a fleeting understanding of HFT.\n\nYes, everyone knows that it involves super-fast computers that can execute millions of transactions per second and yes, everyone knows that this means traders who have slower computers or reflexes would probably lose out.\n\nHowever, there is so much more to HFT that needs careful study before it can be embraced as a legitimate market activity. For example, even if HFT isn't an appreciable presence currently in the local equities market yet, what about algorithmic trading? This is present, so how does this differ from HFT?\n\nHow is it that algos can enter quotes and withdraw them quickly repeatedly and not face sanctions by the exchange - or if they are, this is not public knowledge - yet when individual brokers do the same, they are hauled up for questioning?\n\nWhat is \"predatory algos\" and \"dark pool pinging\" and would these be allowed?\n\nThen, there's \"latency arbitrage\", which has evolved because each market player doesn't get the same information about stocks at exactly the same moment in time. Some get it sooner and some later, and the difference is known as latency.\n\nThis creates an arbitrage and profit opportunity because if a HFT trader can position itself even one foot closer to the exchange's servers and therefore gain a nanosecond's advantage over others, it can act on that information first.\n\nAccording to material available on the Internet, there is therefore an incentive to pay for faster access, even if this is only for a nanosecond. Does this mean those who pay more can situate their computers closer to the exchange and if that is the case, how does this fit with the exchange's duty of ensuring a level playing field?\n\nWould SGX consider a HFT tax on all high-speed transactions? Many countries already have this and some have taken it even further - Italy, for example, last month introduced a tax of 0.02 per cent for orders placed and cancelled within half a second.\n\nPerhaps the exchange should circulate a public consultation paper before rushing into HFT. After all, the attitude among regulators in many countries is this: HFT operators may claim it brings liquidity benefits but we're sceptical; this doesn't mean we'll bar it but before we allow it, we'll make sure there are plenty of safeguards first. Let's hope the same approach is used here.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

New York-based Blackstone did not disclose the dollar amount of its investment in the statement.\n\nChief executive officer Stephen Schwarzman is stepping up real estate investment in Asia, tapping the market for US$4 billion for the company's maiden property fund focused on the region. Blackstone, which has been among the biggest buyers of property in Australia and India, is further seeking to boost such investment in China as rising income and urbanization drives demand.\n\n\"With China's economy increasingly driven by domestic consumption, the retail sector has tremendous potential,\" Chris Heady, head of Blackstone's real estate business in Asia, said in the statement. \"There are only a few high quality shopping mall managers in China and SCP is one of the most experienced.\"\n\nSCP owns and manages 19 shopping malls under its Incity, SCP Plaza and One City brands, according to the statement.

Today, the same people will tell you it'd be a mistake not to be there,\" said Louis Tay, Surbana managing director for Africa.\n\nHis sentiments reflect ever-growing optimism about the continent's prospects. According to the International Monetary Fund, over the course of the next five years, half of the world's 20 fastest-growing economies will come from Africa.\n\nCurrently, there are an estimated 55 Singapore companies operating in Africa, though this number looks set to increase.\n\n\"While Singapore companies have primarily looked at Asia, we see more companies looking at emerging markets further afield, including Africa, which is considered to be one of the last frontiers for market expansion,\" said Jayakrishnan Gopalakrish- nan, IE Singapore group director for Middle East and Africa.\n\nInterest in the continent has partly been fuelled by its abundant resources. Africa boasts 60 per cent of the world's arable land, 82 per cent of its platinum reserves, 19 per cent of all gold, two-thirds of global cocoa production and 10 per cent of the world's global oil reserves.\n\nBeyond the resource story, Africa's demographics make the world sit up, too. With more than half of its close to a billion people under the age of 20, the continent will have the world's largest workforce by 2035.\n\nThis, coupled with rapid urbanisation, is creating vast business opportunities. According to McKinsey, half of Africans will be living in cities by 2030, up from 38 per cent in 2010, which will increase demand for infrastructure, housing, health care, and consumer goods.\n\nAccording to masterplanning group Jurong International, it is still early days yet, and the lack of infrastructure and urban planning in most African countries mean that there is great potential for development.\n\nSurbana's Mr Tay agreed: \"It's like the story about two guys who go to the same country to look for business opportunities. The first guy says 'I can't do business here, the people don't even wear proper shoes!'\n\n\"But the second guy says 'This is a great opportunity because we can sell them shoes.' It's obvious who's going to come out on top.\"\n\nIn addition to big-name investors such as Hyflux, Olam and Pacific International Lines (PIL), smaller homegrown companies have found a foothold in the continent.\n\nOne company that has capitalised on Africa's rising infrastructure needs is PowerPac, a manufacturer of road-making machines. It first entered the continent in 2004, starting with a small contract for a Nigerian customer. Since then, it has clinched a US$60 million (S$75 million) deal with the Nigerian Police Force to supply 2,000 units of highway police patrol vehicles.\n\nIt has also secured a $73.8 million contract from an unnamed east African country - which is five times more than an average contract PowerPac typically sees elsewhere.\n\nA player in the African car industry is Kheng Keng Auto, which sells and services cars. \"It's not like in Asia where you can easily get public transport or a taxi. Cars are very important there, and more roads keep being built so more people keep needing cars,\" said its managing director, Cher Kwang Siong. The firm entered the African market in 1999.\n\nAfrica's spending power looks set to ratchet up further. By 2020, the number of households with discretionary income is projected to rise 50 per cent to 128 million, accounting for an estimated total consumer spending of US$1.4 trillion.\n\nThis bodes well for Christina Tan, CEO of GMT Investcorp, a Johannesburg-based distributor of luxury goods. GMT is the sole retailer of Patek Philippe watches in South Africa and the franchisee of international brand names such as Gucci and Bally.\n\n\"When we went in in 1995, South Africa already had fantastic infrastructure and beautiful shopping centres. But we realised that luxury goods brands were completely lacking - there were no such things as flagship stores,\" said Ms Tan.\n\nShe opened Africa's first Gucci store one year later, enabling well-heeled Africans to snag an upmarket handbag without having to travel to Europe, where Africans have traditionally gone to buy luxury goods.\n\n\"Obviously, we only serve the top end of the population. But even if we can capture one per cent of South Africa's 50 million people, I think things could be quite interesting,\" added Ms Tan, who sees the affluent country as a stepping stone to the rest of the continent, especially oil-rich countries such as Nigeria.\n\nCody Lee, director, Middle East & Africa, Singapore Business Federation (SBF), reckons that Africa is the last remaining continent where one can dream big. \"Currently, Africa's rate of return is equivalent to what we saw in China and India in the 1980s. Africa is the only place where you can see a 20-30 per cent return on investment.\"\n\nStill, he warns that \"not everything is so rosy\", given concerns about security and corruption. In September, an upscale shopping centre in Kenya became the target of a terrorist attack that claimed more than 70 lives.\n\nBut Kenya is just one of 54 countries on the African continent, Mr Lee pointed out. \"Its security situation is not indicative of the whole continent. Places like Mauritius, Botswana and Rwanda are very safe,\" he said, noting that the three countries have \"exemplary corporate governance\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

ING, the Netherlands' biggest financial services company, said last week that the current market value of the bonds is about 71 per cent of the face amount. The government may see a gain of almost 800 million euros (S$1.3 billion), Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem told Parliament.\n\nThe pay-off for the Netherlands and the consequences for the US$800 billion market for US mortgage bonds without government backing will depend on how well it can unwind the bet with the help of BlackRock Inc. The sales, which require European Union approval, are targeted to be finished within the next year. Risks over that period include the forecasted reduction of the US Federal Reserve's unprecedented economic stimulus, potential continued sales of the debt by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the possibility of more budget battles underlying US lawmakers like the one that roiled global markets last month.\n\n\"Timing is everything,\" said Michael Canter, head of securitised assets at AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees more than US$250 billion in fixed income investments. \"If they try to sell when there's not a lot of liquidity out there, it could be a really bad thing. But if the markets are in a good place, it definitely could be absorbed without a hitch.\"\n\nING received a 10 billion euro capital injection in October 2008, when mortgage-backed securities held at its US units plunged in value after foreclosures soared and property prices plunged. In a second round of aid in January 2009, the Netherlands assumed 80 per cent of the risk on the 27.7 billion euro portfolio of mortgage bonds.\n\nING sold the securities to the Dutch state at a discount, while giving the government a loan, which shrank as the mortgages defaulted or were repaid.\n\nWhile down from post-crisis peaks reached earlier this year, prices have gained in 2013, ratifying the Dutch decision to hold. Typical prices for a type of Alt-A bonds among the holdings rose last week to 73.75 cents on the dollar, from 65 cents in January, Credit Suisse Group AG data show. The debt, tied to borrowers who often qualified with limited documentation or bought investment properties, rose as high as 75 cents in May.\n\nThe rally in US non-agency home-loan bonds fuelled by a housing recovery and the Fed's US$85 billion in monthly debt buying was interrupted in June as speculation grew that the central bank would scale back the purchases. It resumed after the Fed unexpectedly said in September that it would hold off on tapering.\n\nOver the past month, securities backed by option adjustable-rate mortgages, another type held by the Dutch, have gained two US cents to 70 US cents, according to Barclays plc data. The notes, tied to loans that can allow borrowers to pay less than the interest that they owe by increasing their principal, fell as low as 33 US cents in 2009.\n\nThe Fed is now expected to delay the first reduction of its bond-buying programme until March, according to the median estimate of a survey conducted on Oct 17-18.\n\nThe Dutch government is seeking to return money to taxpayers after it provided more than 95 billion euros to rescue companies including ING, ABN Amro Group NV and SNS Reaal NV.\n\n\"This is a clear step closer to being detached from state aid,\" said Cor Kluis, an Utrecht, Netherlands-based analyst at Rabobank International. \"If ING will now pay back the remaining capital, it will be fully government-free.\"\n\nING could repay the state aid by mid-2014, ahead of a schedule agreed on with EU regulators last year, Mr Kluis said. He recommends that clients buy the shares.\n\nThe EU approved ING's rescue with some conditions, including that the company return the financial aid with premium and interest. Other strings attached included a ban on management bonuses for as long as aid is outstanding. The company also said that it will not pay dividends to shareholders before completing repayment.\n\nTo maximise proceeds, the Dutch will invite competing bids throughout the sale process, which can be halted at any point, Mr Dijsselbloem said in a letter to lawmakers. Progress and results will be published on the Dutch State Treasury Agency website, he said. ING will pay about 400 million euros to the Netherlands from a provision that it took in 2009 to unwind the transaction, meaning that the state may see a gain of almost 800 million euros.\n\nLarge sales of non-agency mortgage securities have met with mixed consequences. A sale of US$8.7 billion of debt by Lloyds Banking Group plc in May resulted in a pretax gain of \u00a3540 million (S$1 billion) for the lender that boosted the group's core Tier 1 capital, a measure of financial strength. Still, it weighed on the market with the offering completed as speculation grew that the Fed could begin reducing its bond buying.\n\nAuctions in 2012 of non-agency securities acquired by the US central bank during the rescues of American International Group Inc and Bear Stearns Cos proved a catalyst for market demand. The previous year, the Fed's sales as it sought to unwind the portfolios exacerbated a slump in the market as Europe's debt crisis deepened.\n\nThe non-agency market, or home-loan bonds not backed by the US government, is regularly shrinking as foreclosures get completed and homeowners refinance into new loans. The amount of the debt outstanding fell to US$849.2 billion as at June 30, from a peak of US$2.3 trillion in 2007, Fed data show. It probably will contract an additional US$60 billion next year, according to Barclays analysts including Sandeep Bordia and Jasraj Vaidya.\n\nThe involvement of BlackRock as an adviser to the Dutch suggests that a programme similar to the unwinding of the Fed's Maiden Lane vehicles is possible, the analysts wrote in Nov 1 report. At the same time, it is unclear whether the nation will sell the bonds in blocks or individually, and at what pace, they said.\n\n\"We do not expect this sale by itself to have a huge effect on prices, especially if the sales are conducted in a manner that is cognisant of market conditions,\" they wrote.\n\nOne risk is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the US-backed mortgage companies that own about US$150 billion of privately issued residential and commercial bonds, may continue with auctions of the assets, according to AllianceBernstein's Mr Canter and Barclays. As part of sales ordered by regulators to shrink their illiquid holdings this year, they have already sold many of the investment-grade securities that are easiest to trade, Barclays said.\n\nThe Dutch probably will be \"try to be smart about it\", Mr Canter said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The increase was largely driven by $80.5 million in progressive revenue recognition from the sale of residential projects Signature at Lewis, Skyline 360 and Waterscape at Cavenagh, compared to the $24.9 million that was recognised a year ago.\n\nHiap Hoe said of its outlook: \"As the Singapore's property sector is expected to remain challenging in the near-term, the group will continue to step up its marketing efforts to drive sales for its remaining unsold residential units.\"\n\nIt added that it will \"continue to adopt a prudent approach in its land acquisition programme\" in Singapore, and will \"continue to evaluate opportunities by seeking well located land sites and quality completed properties to strengthen its regional property portfolio\".\n\nDuring the quarter in August, Hiap Hoe made its maiden foray overseas, snapping up three developments over two months in Melbourne. One is a 3,795 square metre site in inner Melbourne that cost A$28.8 million (S$34 million), where it plans to develop a 425-unit residential-hospitality project.\n\nThe second is a A$43.8 million commercial building in Melbourne's central business district (CBD), while the third is a a A$105 million mixed use retail and office asset, also in Melbourne's CBD.\n\nIt is rolling out a tender and selection process this month for two hotel operators for its planned hotels in Melbourne.\n\nThe group's landmark integrated hotels-cum-commercial development, Zhongshan Park Integrated Development, is also fully operational and is expected to contribute to its recurring income stream from Q4 onwards. The office block is fully leased, while the retail mall is over 90 per cent leased, it said.\n\nSaid Teo Ho Beng, Hiap Hoe's executive chairman and CEO: \"Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities in Singapore and the region, so as to identify well-located land sites with strong redevelopment potential and quality assets to grow our portfolio of investment assets and generate attractive returns for our stakeholders.\"\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit rose 65.2 per cent to $72.8 million. Revenue was 58.1 per cent higher at $191.7 million.\n\nHiap Hoe shares closed flat at 81.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investment incentives are one thing, but RPGT is another matter. Already there are two different RPGT rates for locals and foreigners. Will there now be two different rules, one for the special zone and for outside the zone?\" asked a Kuala Lumpur-based consultant who did not want to be named. \"If so, who is to say the exemption can't next be extended to 1MDB's Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) for example?\"\n\nTRX, the proposed mixed development in Kuala Lumpur, already enjoys a number of incentives as the government hopes to draw investors to the aspiring \"financial hub\" in Kuala Lumpur which has yet to get off the ground.\n\nAnother consultant was not surprised by IRDA's action. \"I predicted this would happen because if not, investors would be deterred from investing in Iskandar.\"\n\nHe said that the concern was not so much for Iskandar but Medini which, at 901 ha, makes up only 0.004 per cent of Iskandar.\n\nUnder the masterplan, Medini is earmarked as the central business district for Iskandar.\n\nCurrently, the five flagship zones have been given a number of incentives. On top of these, developers, special status companies and workers in Medini can avail themselves of an additional package of perks. Qualified companies, for example, do not have to pay RPGT on the disposal of land and buildings if they start operations in the node before the end of 2015.\n\nFurthermore, Medini developers have a freer hand in that they are not bound by bumiputra ownership quotas or foreign ownership caps. This is also the case in Putri Harbour. In other parts of the state, foreigner ownership is capped at 50 per cent of residential high-rise and 30 per cent of landed real estate.\n\nAccording to realtors, Iskandar state planner Iskandar Investment Bhd and government-owned UEM Sunrise are two of the bigger land owners in Medini.\n\nFrom 2014, non-Malaysians will have to pay 30 per cent RPGT on gains if they dispose of a property within five years of purchase, and 5 per cent in subsequent years. Malaysians will pay 30 per cent for disposals in the first to third year, 20 in the fourth year and 15 in the fifth. In the sixth and subsequent year, no tax applies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The latter included $165,000 from discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations rose 9 per cent to $15.4 million.\n\nViking said yesterday that it is partnering Singaporean rig building veteran Chan Kwan Bian to construct a drilling jack-up rig at a cost of about US$180 million. The rig is a cantilever drilling jack-up CJ46-X100-D GustoMSC designed for use in waterdepth up to 114 metres and can accommodate 120 men during operation.\n\nViking, through newly set-up investment holding subsidiary Viking Asset Management (VAM), has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire a 30 per cent stake, valued at US$5.4 million, in Mr Chan's Smart Earl Investment, which has the rights to build the jack-up rig.\n\nIt has also entered into an agreement to place out 40 million new shares worth $3.2 million to Tan Boy Tee, another Singaporean rig building veteran. This agreement includes an option of the same quantity and amount, exercisable within 90 days.\n\n\"With this share subscription, Mr Tan will become a substantial shareholder of Viking. If he exercises the option, his shareholding will represent 10.1 per cent of the enlarged issued and paid-up share capital of the Company, which will be approximately 793 million shares,\" said Viking.\n\nMr Chan and Mr Tan are co-founders of Labroy, a former SGX-listed offshore and marine specialist which was sold to Dubai Drydocks World in 2008.\n\nThe drilling rig will be built by state-owned Chinese yard China Merchant Heavy Industries. It is expected to be completed within 26 months.\n\nDaniel Lin, executive director of Viking and son of Andy Lim, chairman and controlling shareholder of Viking, has also been appointed the CEO of VAM.

You have malls. You have stadiums. You don't normally screen 50,000 people going into a stadium for weapons.\"\n\nLast Friday's shooting began at a TSA checkpoint, whose purpose is keeping bombs and weapons off planes. No matter how far the initial line of defence is pushed outward from those vulnerable targets, the risk couldn't be eliminated for the men and women on guard, said security specialists, consultants and a congressional committee chairman who oversees the TSA.\n\n\"The TSA is there to make sure it doesn't happen on an airplane,\" said George Hamlin, a former Airbus executive who runs Hamlin Transportation Consulting in Fairfax, Virginia. \"How do you set up a system to protect the protectors?\"\n\nTSA administrator John Pistole said last Saturday the agency is discussing airport security issues \"writ large\" with Congress, including whether officers should be armed. The agency will study its policies and procedures to determine what can provide the best possible security, he told reporters in Los Angeles.\n\nThe agency was created after the Sept 11 attacks to bolster protections against terrorists boarding aircraft. US House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, whose panel oversees the TSA, promised fresh attention to in-airport security on Sunday.\n\n\"How we typically stop a lot of these things is through good intelligence,\" said Mr McCaul, who cited parallels between the Los Angeles incident and the Sept 16 Washington Navy Yard massacre, in which a gunman with a history of mental illness killed 12 people.\n\nThe alleged Nov 1 shooter, identified by authorities as Paul Ciancia, 23, left a note in which he wrote of wanting to kill TSA agents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Ciancia's family alerted authorities in New Jersey, and Los Angeles police visited Ciancia's home the morning of the attack, Mr McCaul told CNN.\n\nCiancia is accused of killing one TSA officer and wounding two other TSA employees and a civilian passenger, according to a criminal complaint filed on Saturday in Los Angeles federal court, and was shot by airport police.\n\nMr Pistole, the TSA chief, is looking to expand the use of Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response Teams with stepped-up local law enforcement to enhance airport security, Mr McCaul said. Having more law enforcement officers on display will help, even though it's difficult to provide foolproof security, he said.\n\nWhile some of the best-known instances of airport violence have occurred outside the US, such as terrorists' 1985 attacks on ticket counters in Rome and Vienna targeting El Al Israel Airlines, the US hasn't been immune.\n\nA gunman killed two people at the El Al counter in Los Angeles in 2002. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Bankers will have to show what would happen to the value of leveraged loans they hold, the impact of another housing bust and how they'd fare if a firm that owes them substantial sums collapses.\n\nThe test was designed in part to build resiliency against what some see as emerging asset bubbles, said a Fed official who spoke on a conference call with reporters. The counterparty failure test aims to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis, when distress at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group Inc. threatened to destroy their biggest trading partners.\n\nCounterparty credit risk \"has been a very big concern since the crisis,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a Washington regulatory research firm whose clients include the world's largest banks. \"This is an intervening supervisory step while the broader rules are pending.\"\n\nThe Fed is using the tests - based on hypothetical adverse conditions and not forecasts - to encourage the 30 biggest banks to build capital cushions against economic turmoil. Twelve banks will be subject to the capital review for the first time.\n\nThe six banks with large trading operations - JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co - will be required to test how their portfolios would perform against a global shock to financial markets. Details of that scenario will be released \"soon\", the central bank said. New York-based JPMorgan is the biggest US bank by assets, followed by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America and New York-based Citigroup.\n\nThose six banks, as well as Bank of New York Mellon Corp and State Street Corp, also will have to test against a scenario in which one of their counterparties experiences an \"instantaneous and unexpected\" default. Previous tests focused merely on incremental defaults as the economy eroded, a Fed official said.\n\nThe test shows Fed officials remain concerned that banks might still rely too heavily on a single counterparty to hedge potential losses, a practice that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn the \"adverse\" scenario, banks will be tested against global flight from long-term debt that pushes the US into a recession, with unemployment rising to 9.25 per cent. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note jumps to 5.75 per cent by the end of 2014, and corporate bond and mortgage rates also rise.\n\nIn the Fed's \"severely adverse\" scenario, the jobless rate peaks at 11.25 per cent, stocks fall almost 50 per cent and US housing prices slide 25 per cent, while the euro area sinks into recession. Developing economies in Asia also experience a \"sharp slowdown\", the Fed said.\n\nThe Fed said that the larger drop in US house prices in this year's severely adverse scenario is \"particularly relevant for states or metropolitan statistical areas that have experienced brisk gains in house prices over the past year\". - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

SuperSports Arena will also ramp up the broadcast of local sporting events such as marathons and school competitions to support local sports,\" StarHub said yesterday.\n\nOn the initial run, the programmes will be available only to StarHub subscribers on those two channels and the operator's mobile TV service, TV Anywhere. Six months after the initial broadcast, however, the content will be made available for free through TV Anywhere.\n\n\"StarHub is proud to be the first pay-TV operator in Singapore to come onboard the (PCFS) by MDA.

The paper said that the two sides were locked in a tug-of-war.\n\nAir France-KLM's conditions, it said, included the removal of Alitalia's board of directors and a restructuring of its debts of nearly one billion euros (S$1.68 billion) to reduce them by 70 to 80 per cent.\n\nThe 5,000 job cuts would be more than double what Alitalia's CEO Gabriele del Torchio has pencilled in as part of a revised restructuring plan to keep it in business, the newspaper said.\n\nA source close to the matter said that Air France-KLM, which is in the middle of its own restructuring, had asked for \"many job cuts\" but fewer than 5,000, without giving a figure.\n\nThe Franco-Dutch airline declined to comment on the report and a spokesman for Mr Lupi was not immediately available for comment.\n\nAir France-KLM gave its approval to a 300 million euros capital increase in the ailing Italian national carrier along with Alitalia's other investors, but is not obliged to participate and has always said that it would attach strict conditions before giving any help.\n\nPart of a wider bailout, the cash call is seen as only a stopgap solution before talks on a possible tie-up between Alitalia and Air France-KLM, although Mr Lupi has said that Italy would seek a different international partner if Air France-KLM does not subscribe to the capital increase.\n\nOn Thursday, Air France wrote off the value of its stake in Alitalia, which has not made a profit for more than a decade. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

What are the pros and cons of contract hiring, and how should the benefits for contract employees be packaged vis- a-vis perks for permanent staff?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSaw Ken Wye\n\nCEO\n\nCrimsonLogic Pte Ltd\n\nHOW work evolves is going to be part of the new normal. Just as cloud computing has come into the fore as enterprises realise that they need a flexible and scalable resource at affordable prices, the way we employ people will change. Having a good strategy for contract workers will allow an organisation to plan its workforce around projects and tasks it needs to accomplish. It caters for the peaks and troughs. A risk mitigation strategy needs to be in place to make sure that corporate insights and knowledge doesn't walk away with the contract worker when the contract is over.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHOSE of us who have worked for multinational corporations (MNCs) will testify that contract hiring is an effective way to circumvent headcount freeze, minimise costs and above all, build flexibility in managing and regulating manpower needs. It is a regular feature of our manpower planning. Many, if not all, contract employees tend to be administrative or non-executive staff. But they all perform a useful role and contribute to the operational and business efficiency of the company.\n\nWhen I was in Compaq, our contract employees were treated, where or whenever possible, as though they were our full-time colleagues. For example, they were all invited to the company's town hall meetings, functions and events, as well as permitted to enjoy employees'benefits such as free beverages, subsidised canteen food and use of gymnasium. There was little discrimination and differentiation. As part-time employees are potential full-time staffers, it is in the interest of the company to treat them well, fairly and with respect. Even if they do not become full-time employees, they can be great ambassadors for the company; they are likely to promote the company as an enlightened and progressive employer.\n\nI hope that more of our local companies can follow the example of MNCs to not treat contract employees as second-class workers. In our tight labour market, every headcount matters to increase productivity. I would advocate that companies regard every worker as an investment rather than an expense. It will influence and determine how everyone in a company is treated. Employees - irrespective of whether they are full time or on contract - are more likely to be highly motivated when treated well. They will give their best to the company. It is a win-win for both employers and employees.\n\nPascal Lambert\n\nChief Country Officer, Singapore and Head of South-east Asia\n\nSociete Generale CIB\n\nWITH possibly the exception of information technology (IT) services, we do not see a major trend in contract hiring in our banking industry. For Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Singapore, a non-permanent workforce would comprise mainly of interns and trainees who are fresh from business school and university.\n\nAs we are committed to providing long-term employability to our staff here in Singapore, our first priority would be to hire staff on a permanent basis rather than a contract basis. While contractors help with meeting seasonal needs and do allow for a more flexible workforce - and our strategy is to use them to supplement the work done by our permanent staff - there are also associated limitations. Such negatives include increased costs, potential operational risks as a result of increased turnover, which also affects knowledge transfer, potential confidentiality issues and impact on the morale of permanent staff.\n\nIn Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Singapore, contractors represent a very small proportion of our total staff. We generally utilise contractors if there is a short-term need or a requirement for specific expertise. However for many of the reasons above, we do not systematically use contractors as a way of maintaining flexibility within the business.\n\nRaman Singh\n\nManaging Director\n\nMundipharma\n\nCONTRACT employment has definitely seen an upsurge of late with the recent tightening of hiring policies and streamlining of company workforces due to smaller recruitment budgets. While contract employees do add value by bringing broad skill sets and contributing through their depth of experiences, there is always the risk of losing them to competitors who may offer them a permanent position.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, there is a growing need to implement carefully-devised work improvement programmes and retention strategies that lead to greater productivity for the entire workforce - whether permanent or contract. Given the growing demand for subject experts in a functional role, employing the right talent becomes all the more important. As a pharmaceutical company, Mundipharma aims to cultivate a global community of experts functioning as brand ambassadors. Ultimately, the objective is to ensure that each and every employee remains flexible and prepared for change.\n\nSerge Shine\n\nManaging Director South-east Asia\n\nSpring Professional\n\nGIVEN Asia's dynamic markets, balancing contract and permanent employment is an opportunity for organisations to inject flexibility into their businesses. This will help them be more competitive and adaptable to volatile market conditions, while maintaining reputation and stability through pools of permanent staff.\n\nSimilarly, employees should not dismiss contract employment as a career path. As Asia continues to make headway in the IT and engineering industries, the flexible nature of contract employment will allow the broadening of resumes and experience. The promise of flexible work schedules for a heightened work-life balance and a compensation plan comparable to that of permanent employment should also be a draw.\n\nJoe Marten\n\nCEO\n\nAluminaid Pte Ltd\n\nCONTRACT hiring is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and is closely related to business needs and size. We currently employ 22 full-time workers in which we have invested a significant amount of time and money. As a start-up, it makes little sense to invest in short-term contractors during this crucial time of growth.\n\nHowever we expect that over the next two years, our employee base will grow tenfold. We predict that our hiring needs will also evolve. As we move our manufacturing operations to Singapore, we expect that our need for skilled workers will rise sharply, and our business may then sustain a contract worker model. Overall, there needs to be enhanced accountability for smaller and medium-sized recruitment agencies to look for lasting solutions that offer long-term value, rather than quick fixes and easy commission derived from contractors.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nCONTRACT hiring is definitely on the rise in Singapore. The more volatile economic cycles have resulted in companies flexing their total workforce to remain cost competitive as the demand for goods and services change. Many companies are also outsourcing non-core functions - for example administrative and security services - to service providers which typically adopt the contract employment model. Regulated clients such as banks are also turning to the contract employment model when running large projects, particularly when there is a regulatory deadline.\n\nContract hiring allows employers to retain flexibility to manage costs. Outsource providers that specialise in providing dedicated functional contract workforce can often improve work output due to scale. However, unless managed and negotiated well, the flexibility associated with this variable costing model can be more expensive in absolute terms. On an hourly basis, contract employees are usually paid higher wages but would have significantly less benefits, largely because certain benefits such as leave and health insurance tend to be annual benefits that are suited for permanent staff. At PwC, we have plans to work with our service providers such as insurers to adjust the benefit programmes to cover contract employees.\n\nWe believe that in the long run, companies that are innovative and which can balance the mix of permanent and contract employees would yield the highest risk-adjusted results.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nBEING in the recruitment industry ourselves, we have witnessed first-hand that contract employment is a growing market trend in Singapore. This trend has been especially prevalent in the last few quarters. Indeed, contract hiring is a strategy that we recommend to recruiters, particularly if their organisation is experiencing a permanent headcount freeze. We believe that contract hiring is a trend that is here to stay.\n\nEver since the global financial crisis of 2008, the business landscape has changed, and volatility has become the norm. Companies now realise that they need to be more agile in order to respond to market dynamics. Besides enabling an organisation to fill skills gaps quickly, contract employment provides organisations with more flexibility should the need to restructure their workforce arise. It also allows the organisation to try out a candidate before offering him a permanent position. Some of the disadvantages of contract hiring are that it can be disruptive to teams, as contract staff come and go, and the quality of work produced by different contract workers may be uneven.\n\nThere are already certain market benchmarks when it comes to packaging benefits for contract workers vis-\u00e0-vis permanent staff. As a rule of thumb, the rates for contract employees tend to be higher than the salaries of permanent staff with comparable portfolio and experience, as the contract arrangement does not include the suite of benefits that would be extended to a permanent employee. But it is interesting to note that employers have been increasing the benefits for contract workers of late, to include a little more of the perks that permanent staff enjoy.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive\n\nABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and\n\nCEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nABN AMRO in Singapore is hiring as we are successfully growing our business. While we are mostly hiring permanent staff, contract employment is one of the ways which help us adapt to fast-changing business conditions. Talent gaps, mainly in the middle and back office functions, can be filled swiftly with contract employment to ensure the continued provision of quality support services. Depending on the nature of work, contract employment is also used to augment complex project work. Contract staff are very valuable, and should be integrated in the organisation as well as any other staff. Thus, over and on top of market remuneration, we also ensure that our contract employees are given opportunities to advance their careers with us and most importantly, welcomed and included in our employee activities. We are pleased that over time, many of our contract staff become permanent employees.\n\nAllen Ang\n\nMD\n\nAldon Technologies\n\nFOR ages, contract employment is common practice in the construction industry. Painters are usually employed temporarily for the duration of the project. Because of the seasonal nature of their business, contractors find it cost-deficient to hire permanent painters. Since the 2008 financial crisis, more organisations, including statutory boards, employ executives on contract for specific periods and may subsequently convert them to permanent employees if found to be suitable. This gives the organisations flexibility to try out a new employee before absorbing him. However, the jury is still out if this is an effective way for a company to recruit talent.\n\nIn the IT sector, more and more certified project management professionals prefer to work independently and take on IT projects on a project basis. Companies also prefer to tap the pool of these highly qualified and experienced project managers, and engage them on a project basis for their specific skills which are not needed when the project is completed.\n\nOn the other hand, contract employment may not be suitable for some manufacturing activities. At Aldon, our manufacturing process requires highly specialised precision engineering skills. Our workers are trained on industry best practices, and such training requires a sustained period of training. Under such circumstances, contract employment is not suitable for us.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group Pte Ltd\n\nTHERE is certainly a clear trend for hiring on a contract basis in Singapore. Most companies do so to remain flexible on the human capital deployment front. However, I am personally more in favour of permanent employment, particularly for Singaporeans. In the current Asian mindset, there is still a stigma attached to contract jobs. More importantly, it is the feeling of belonging that permanent employment can bring which is critical in these competitive times. The labour market is still extremely tight, and employers would tend to keep all the good talent that they can find. Benefits are mostly similar no matter whether contract or permanent, which helps us bridge perceived differences in employee status and foster team spirit.\n\nGuy Day\n\nCEO\n\nAmbition Group Ltd\n\nAMBITION has certainly experienced an increased demand for contract staff as employers not only recognise the relief that it provides during crunch periodsbut also as a staffing solution to combat shrinking headcount budgets. We have witnessed a shift as talents are becoming more open to contract roles, which can represent an opportunity towards a full-time conversion, and also provide the chance to gain experience in different companies. During headcount freezes, contracting is an effective way to bring on talent until those constraints are lifted.\n\nIf there is a downside to contracting for employers, it is retaining high-calibre staff, especially if permanent opportunities present themselves in a talent-short market such as Singapore. For candidates, there is the need to kick-start the job hunting process when the contract ends.\n\nTo attract more people into contracting jobs, companies need to structure benefits so that they are comparable to permanent staff, including items such as annual leave, sick leave and health care. Providing similar benefits is motivational, it makes contract staff feel part of the organisation and avoids alienation.\n\nIn markets such as the UK, Germany or Australia, where contracting is often seen as a career choice, contractors benefit from a higher salary, increased benefits as well as a retention bonus to ensure that they complete the contract. While benefits offered to contract staff in Singapore have improved, it has been from a very low base and there is still a long way to go before contracting is seen as a viable career option for the majority of job seekers.\n\nFlorence Ng\n\nManaging Director, Founder\n\nStraits Talent Pte Ltd\n\nCONTRACT employment offers a good interim solution to companies with labour shortages during periods of need, large-scale projects, or crisis, and in some cases, headcount constraints. In more developed labour markets such as in the West, one will see that contract employment is often viewed as a good alternative to the traditional permanent mode of employment. While contracting is starting to gain some traction in Singapore and, indeed Asia, I believe that we are still a long way behind mature markets such as the UK, US or Australia.\n\nIn the corporate world where the talent pool is finite and growth is imminent, it is about the demand and supply of talent. Here in Singapore, where we boast a tight labour market and an average unemployment rate of less than 3 per cent, one can therefore expect that the contracting market will remain small, due in large part to the lack of available talent. The reality is that in Asia, \"face\" plays an important part in one's career choices. I know many job seekers who shun good paying contracting roles as they relentlessly pursue permanent roles, because permanent employment is seen as a hallmark of a more successful and stable career path, with the promise of career progression. Until the mindsets of job seekers change, which will take time, companies will continue to struggle to find professional contractors to fill interim positions. One way is to provide perks such as annual leave and medical coverage (these are not automatically given to contractors) and throw in completion bonuses, to sweeten the deal financially.\n\nRonnie Tan\n\nGroup EVP, Asia-Pacific and Global Talent Management\n\nRight Management\n\nIN this age of uncertainty, finding and mobilising the right talent is critical. The challenge facing businesses is to begin building the frameworks, structures, strategies and systems that will allow businesses to compete and thrive. One such strategy is through contract employment. A comparison of the top five markets ranked for contingent workforce availability shows that most of the highest ranking countries are in Asia-Pacific. These countries generally demonstrate higher cost efficiency along with availability, but tend to have lower productivity and more restrictive labour regulations.\n\nAs businesses realign their workforce to keep pace with changing business demands, contract employment helps businesses attain the required high skill talent as Singapore further transforms and moves up the value chain in the region. The magic is in the mix of the labour components that best meet the need of the business.\n\nMichael Smith\n\nCountry Director\n\nRandstad Singapore\n\nTHERE has been a recent surge in the supply of contract roles, especially in banking and financial services and information technology. For employers, they offer not only a swift solution to plug gaps with a high level of expertise, but also provide the flexibility to hire per project and remain agile to meet changing workforce demands and business requirements.\n\nFor employees, contracts offer flexibility and an opportunity to work in a variety of projects and build up new skills sets. Contracting often acts as a stepping stone to a permanent position, which was agreed by 80 per cent of employees in Singapore, according to Randstad's Q2 2013 Workmonitor Report.\n\nAs contract employees often do not enjoy the same benefits as their permanent colleagues, employers should compensate by offering higher remuneration packages to make sure that they secure the talent that they need to drive business growth. The Singapore contracting market is relatively immature compared with more mature markets such as the US or Australia. In the future, we should see some levelling out in this area.\n\nVictor Chia\n\nCEO\n\nDairy Farm Singapore (Food)\n\nGIVEN the current extremely tight labour supply, especially in the retail sector, there is definitely a critical need to tap a \"new additional\" workforce on part-time/contract/flexible arrangements. This will supplement the existing shrinking pool of full-time workers set against a challenging backdrop of an ageing Singaporean population and tightened control on recruitment of foreign workers.\n\nPeople who look for flexi work want to maximise their free hours, enjoy work-life balance and be exposed to varied work experiences with potential opportunities to find their career niche. It is on this premise that Dairy Farm Singapore will be launching its flexi work scheme on Nov 7 with the aim of building a regular pool of flexi staff to complement our permanent workforce.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman\n\nHTwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nCOMPANIES and businesses have to resort to various options in hiring staff to get their work projects moving. Getting suitable and qualified staff to carry out certain job functions can be challenging in this current tight labour market. I believe that many employers are not closed to the idea of contract employment for some of their business activities.\n\nIn some situations, contract arrangements may be more efficient and cost reducing. Contract employment may work for some jobs or tasks but not all. Employers must be very clear as to what jobs can be done on contract. Short-term projects requiring specialised expertise or skills, for example, can use contract staff. Overall, salaries for contract services may be lower compared to permanent positions as some benefits will not be included. Employers happy with the services of a contract staff may offer permanent employment in the long term. So it is a good testing period for both employers and employees. I feel that as the economy grows, employers have to be innovative in their hiring practices and be open to various hiring options that work for them, without compromising standards and quality.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nBEING a Singapore-based company, Castlewood Group invests heavily in its full-time staff and has seen clear evidence of the long-term benefits. When it comes to the hiring of contracted staff, we often consider it as \"panning for gold\" as it allows us to identify potential superstars in various disciplines, and thus enables the company to introduce talented, enthusiastic new blood into the fold on a permanent basis, having had the benefit of previewing performance and attitude beforehand. Contracted staff seeking a permanent position thus ensure they give 100 per cent effort 100 per cent of the time as they want to be recognised as potential full-timers. It also avoids any poor work ethic or a \"temp\" mindset.\n\nPhilippe H J Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South-east Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nTHERE is a growing trend for companies to hire more contract workers. Some of the reasons are due to the economic downturn and uncertainties in recent years, and a need for more business flexibility. The tighter labour market has also resulted in companies being more creative in their hiring strategies.\n\nThere are some factors that companies should consider before hiring contract workers. While they bring benefits such as added help and relief in pressing situations and flexibility in operations and projects without adding to the headcount, the primary consideration in the hiring process should be the short- and long-term business and operational requirements that the new hire will contribute towards. The nature of business and continuity plans should be other key factors as well.\n\nAt International SOS, our global reach and the unforeseeable nature of medical epidemics and crisis mean that we employ additional contract staff to maintain the high level of service and medical protection for our customers in times of need. For our concierge business at Aspire Lifestyles, the additional contract staff during peak periods ensure that our customers receive a positive call experience at all times, and that we are well equipped to meet their requests. Having the option of hiring contract workers provides our businesses with flexibility in both our operations and overheads.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nAS economic cycles become shorter, contract employment will allow businesses greater flexibility to scale their operations up or down. It also helps to aid labour market transitions, boosting employment by turning available work into jobs. In fact, contract work is more the norm than the exception in the energy and resources industries in which Fircroft specialises. These industries depend largely on project-based wins. Teams are adjusted according to the size, length and complexity of the projects. In recent years, the energy industry has been booming, especially in Asia. This has resulted in the rise of contracted specialists in this region. Singapore is Asia's leading oil trading hub and is one of the world's top three export refining centres. Now with a new LNG terminal and a greater push by the government to develop more energy sources, Singapore can greatly benefit from this hiring trend.\n\nAnother related trend to note is that companies in these sectors tend to use technical recruitment firms to manage their contract employees - everything from recruitment to other human resource needs such as payroll and relocation services. As contract employees in these technical sectors have had exposure to a greater variety of work environments, they are often highly sought after for their experience and niche skills. Hence they can often command remuneration and benefit packages that match or surpass that of permanent staff.\n\nLim Tit Meng\n\nChief Executive\n\nScience Centre Singapore\n\nSCIENCE Centre employs many contract staff to work on the numerous projects and events that we organise. We have around 160 permanent staff and routinely take in new staff on two-year contracts with the option to extend for another two years, and then be placed on a permanent basis.\n\nThe demand for contract employment has arisen as firms seek a more flexible workforce that brings varied skill sets, look to better meet changing market conditions and as a solution to headcount constraints. In a downtrending economy in particular, it helps organisations keep labour overheads low while maintaining productivity. Figures from the Ministry of Manpower have indicated a slight increase of workers on term contracts - 192,200 last year, up from 188,400 the previous year.\n\nThere are downsides to contract employment, of course, including finding quality candidates and a lack of commitment or loyalty to the company from contract staff. To overcome these issues, Science Centre extends the same benefits to our contract staff that all permanent staff enjoy, thereby making no distinction between contract and permanent staff.\n\nJack Chua\n\nCEO\n\nERA Singapore\n\nCONTRACT employment has much to do with the nature of the job. Positions which are of an ad-hoc or project basis are more likely to be filled by contract staff. However, for positions which are permanent, and where it is beneficial to the company if the staff understands the history and knows the culture of the company well, then contract staff will be considered too transient. In addition, where loyalty and sense of belonging is important, then permanent positions should be considered.\n\nGenerally, as contract workers are better paid than permanent workers, they do not enjoy the benefits of permanent workers, such as increments and bonuses. There have to be some trade-offs in both positions, to be fair to the company and to the workers too. Those who value freedom and flexibility can consider contract employment while those who want security and career advancement can look for permanent employment.\n\nFrom the company's perspective, the best option is to have a mixture of both permanent and contract staff, so that the company has more control and flexibility in managing its manpower needs and operating costs in the long run.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nTHE dynamic yet tight market allows for much more mobility and opportunities for jobseekers. Jobseekers now have several options to choose from, and contract hiring provides great benefits to both jobseekers as well as employers.\n\nContract hiring allows for higher mobility and flexibility as well as providing companies with much needed support, particularly during busy periods. Contract employers are generally exposed to a variety of projects and have a wide breadth of experience and can provide valuable insights for organisations. Firms are encouraged to recognise the value that these employees bring, and these employees should be seen as part of the whole team and not as an \"external\" team. Most organisations already provide leave and medical benefits. Other benefits include CPF, insurance and career planning.\n\nNatalia Shuman\n\nSenior Vice President, General Manager\n\nEMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nCONTRACTING is a strategic option for employers as it provides them with the flexibility to inject specialist skills for specific projects without incurring the long-term costs of a permanent hire. Contractors can also benefit from this flexibility as it allows them to drive their own careers by choosing the projects that they would like to work on.\n\nWe are seeing more Singapore-based companies offer competitive packages to attract contract candidates with niche skill sets. However, the majority of employees still prefer the certainty of permanent positions to the flexibility of contract work.\n\nKaren Cariss\n\nCEO\n\nPageUp People\n\nCONTRACT hiring is on the rise in Singapore and other markets as it allows companies to better manage costs, especially under volatile market conditions. But while cost could very well be the biggest driver for contract hiring trend, there are other benefits that companies could derive from flexible employment. Contract workers provide firms with greater agility, productivity boost or temporary cover as and when needed. For example, retail companies usually hire additional staff on contract basis to fulfil requirements during peak periods. Contract hiring is also a solution, albeit a short-term one, for talent gaps in specific industries or job scopes.\n\nWhen it comes to compensation and benefits, contract employees definitely have a more tailored package that takes into account the candidate's skills set and experience, the responsibilities associated with the job, the duration and conditions of employment. Permanent staff are typically entitled to more long-term and fringe benefits and professional development opportunities. In the end, there are no hard and fast rules to managing a talent pool with a growing contract base but they can be supported by strategies and HR technologies to better track and manage costs on contract hires, with features such as mobile administration of timesheets, contract spend trend analysis, computerised alerts, instantaneous reporting and bulk actions are intended to decrease expenses for organisations.\n\nDoina Palici-Chehab\n\nCEO\n\nAXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nAT AXA, we are constantly on the lookout for great talent to join us - and this certainly includes contractors, for specific needs. Within the marketplace, there certainly is an increasing trend of more contract based employment being offered - and it is one that is beneficial to both companies as well as the contractors. Contractors are usually more readily available, with a wider range of different corporate experiences, from which they can draw on to bring value into your company. While this may come at a slight premium in pay, for a fixed duration and purpose this can be worth the cost. While you do need a strong core of permanent employees, contractors certainly have a place within an organisation as well, which in many cases have also led to permanent positions.\n\nZaheer Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQI Group of Companies\n\nTHERE is a real trend towards contract employment in Singapore, and increasingly the region. In Singapore, we are fortunate to have developed and progressive employment laws, which have added clear contractual certainty here. Contract hiring no longer labels an employee as the perennial part-timer.\n\nThe pros for both employers and employees outweigh the cons, given flexible contract length, easy work scope planning, productivity and deployment (including redeployment), salary scales without statutory or other benefits, while giving ambitious employees an opportunity to explore and develop their fullest potential. The simplest adjustment for equitable parity with permanent employees is to adjust contract employees' salaries upwards to mitigate their position. Offering other simple on-job benefits, such as leave, are effective package perks. Ultimately the \"contract-to-permanent basis\" employment is also an available incentive. As Forbes journalist Kerry Hannon succinctly puts it - \"(contract) staffing is the bee's knees these days\".\n\nToby Fowlston\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nRobert Walters (Singapore) Ltd\n\nIN the last three to four years, we have seen contract and temporary recruitment methods emerging and being used by a variety of employers. In particular, there has been a surge in the last 12 to 18 months. Employers are favouring contract staff for various reasons. They are able to bridge a resource gap for a fixed period of time without increasing headcount, and they are given the option to manage long-term sick leave or maternity leave effectively without added pressure on existing teams. Contracting also allows companies to see first-hand how a candidate operates in a role, and integrates into the company culture. This enables an assessment before making a permanent offer at the end of the contract assignment. There is also the time benefit in that they are often available on short notice. For the above reasons, there is an increasing wage premium on hiring temporary or contract employees.\n\nSteve Melhuish\n\nCo-Founder and Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nPropertyGuru\n\nCONTRARY to the conventional practice where companies hire contract staff to overcome temporary shortfalls, my company PropertyGuru hires staff on a temporary basis to help us enhance our Internet and mobile technology products. In particular, we hire technology specialists for, on average, two to four months. These employees would come on board and provide support to our core team of technology specialists and help us brainstorm ideas to improve our current operating Android and Apple mobile applications, and digital discretionary products available on our website. As we are constantly looking for the next big thing, these contract employees provide us with a fresh view on our technology systems and give us third-party ideas on how they feel we can better expand our bandwidth of offerings.\n\nAlso, we do use contract employees to head out to the market and perform on-ground research and give us the latest statistics on what end-users want to see in their digital products. Another division in my company that is big on contract employment is the marketing and brand division. We like to call them our \"Go-To-Gurus\" as these recurring temporary staff support the marketing division in their active roll-out of the many brand outreach initiatives in each of our financial year. These Go-To-Gurus give us the additional brand audit and awareness that my company looks to each year to ensure that we are constantly communicating and speaking with our consumers. We ensure that feedback is listened and responded to by improving the way that we develop, operate and roll out our brand promises.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nWITH today's economic uncertainty, there is a growing workplace trend of hiring contractors rather than permanent employees to perform necessary services. This is a result of a number of factors, including greater flexibility, reduced overall costs and often a greater specialisation that contractors bring to a project. The distinction, however, has wide-reaching implications for a company's practices. An employee has certain benefits that generally are not available to contractors. In some countries, the contractors are paid a higher salary than regular employees to compensate them for the instability of a contract role. Problems arise when companies have difficulty hiring contractors as most candidates prefer a permanent role. Nevertheless, there are some advantages of taking on a contract assignment as it is an opportunity to pick up new skills as well.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nCONTRACT employment has indeed become more popular with employers. They can control manpower costs and operate within tight budgets as well as maintain staffing flexibility and avoid staff retrenchment in the event of poor business. The manpower costs can be lower because the benefits provided to permanent staff are normally not given to contract staff since they are often employed for a limited period to support short-term or special projects. But the quality of contract staff may not be satisfactory compared with permanent staff. And permanent employees might not be keen to give up their full-time jobs for lack of job security. In any case, employers may face difficulty in retaining contract staff till the end of the contract period because they would probably resign once they find a permanent job. Hence, to attract or retain talent for contract jobs, employers may wish to work on the benefits. They could, for instance, provide the same perks or draw up special benefits such as target objectives performance bonus or end-of-contract bonus.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nCONTRACT staffing is an alternative engagement format. Permanent staffing will form the core of the corps. Contract staffing augments the core. The pros of contract staffing are that employers can engage staff flexibly, employing on a needs basis. This gives them predictability in tenure and the ability to cap liabilities. But on the other side of the coin, contract staff are short changed since they may not enjoy the full suite of benefits and entitlements. The cons of contract staffing is that it does not instill any sense of loyalty to employers, and employers will have little lien to these staff members.\n\nTo improve the compensation package for contract staff, companies can consider providing a gratuity payment at end of the tenure to encourage completion of tenure and better loyalty; providing portable medical benefits and insurance on co-share basis; providing pro-rated medical and hospitalisation cover.\n\nWorkforce balance and internal equity is important to sustain overall motivation and a sense of value and commitment to employers, notwithstanding they are permanent or contract. Fair consideration should prevail in any mode of engagement.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\njobsDB Singapore & Malaysia\n\nSINGAPORE'S successful positioning as an attractive business destination has led to numerous international bands to base their operations and IT infrastructure here. Often, an organisation's strategy to set up its new team would include hiring permanent resources, as well as outsourcing specific operations to various IT services companies and independent contractors.\n\nAn individual specialising in a technical field has two career choices - to take on the managerial career route or to become an expert individual contributor. Contracting is a very popular career path in Europe, the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand. This is due to the flexibility that it provides to an individual's lifestyle - contracting professionals often make use of the breaks in between contracts to pursue hobbies or travel plans.\n\nFrom an organisational perspective, there are many benefits of hiring talents on contract, for example, completing a six-month task in three months by employing an expert provides a more cost-effective solution to an organisation; having a pool of contractors offers more flexibility in maintaining the workforce balance in times of downturn; contracting offers an initial insight into new markets which will help in making manpower decisions in countries with stricter labour laws; headcount issues can be easily managed by hiring talent on contract and passing on the responsibility of HR administration to professional organisations instead; and lastly, organisations have the flexibility to transfer talent from one project to another based on appropriate skills-sets required for different projects. Before the global IT revolution, the working culture in Asia has generally been skewed towards job longevity and stability, thus resulting in the contracting option being a less popular method of hiring or working in Asia.\n\nI believe that contracting is here to stay, regardless of a challenging or booming market. There are definitely more options out there in the job market when one keeps an open mind to consider contract work. Job seekers should consider contracting for the following reasons: It opens the door to a new industry or a new profile.\n\nIt is a stop-gap arrangement for those in-between jobs.\n\nIt gives you the opportunity to try out a role before deciding to move long-term into a similar position, without having to commit to your employer.\n\nYou gain exposure to new technologies and projects across the industry in a much shorter time span.\n\nYou are provided with the opportunity to list additional knowledge and value to your CV with every new project undertaken.\n\nYou are provided with the opportunity to prove yourself in a large MNC environment and get recognised for better roles.\n\nYou have the opportunity to experience salary increments from one contract to another instead of having to wait for annual increments.\n\nFrom a lifestyle perspective, it provides you with more freedom to plan longer holidays in between contracts or to invest your time in training and courses to upgrade yourself and gain more skills.\n\nIn short, contracting definitely provides you with a more flexible lifestyle while broadening the limits and horizons for a professional, well-rounded and exponential career path.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On top of that, a Kyodo News survey says that this government bill aimed at toughening penalties for leaking state secrets is opposed by 50.6 per cent of the public. What might be regarded as this very \"un-Japanese\" call to popular protest has been occasioned by the decision of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's (LDP) government to submit to the national Diet a Secrecy Bill designed ostensibly to protect state information that the government deems vital to national security.\n\nMr Abe says that the draft legislation is meant to protect confidential information and that it is \"a prerequisite\" for the country so as to win the trust of, and share intelligence with, other countries. The prime minister apparently hopes to pass the bill in time for the planned launch of a Japanese version of the US National Security Council, to better respond to security threats around Japan, especially in dealing with China's assertive maritime activities and North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. However, bar associations and other advocates of constitutional democracy have expressed deep reservations about the proposed amendment. They argue that any government's claims of a need for secrecy must be balanced against the people's right to know about the actions of their government agents. There are also fears that this revision to the Freedom of Information Act of 2001 could restrict the flow of ordinary information that people need to know.\n\nIt is being asked, for instance, if the proposed law could curtail public access to information on issues such as the Fukushima nuclear crisis and the ongoing problems at the tsunami-devastated region and the seas around it. Or, for that matter, how the new law would affect information about tension with China over the disputed islands. These are both highly sensitive issues for the government. The Abe administration has come under severe domestic and international criticism for its handling of the Fukushima issue while skirmishes between Japanese and Chinese patrol vessels over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands have been openly publicised up to this point.\n\nThe timing of the bill, which the government hopes to pass in the parliamentary session ending on Dec 6, might appear unfelicitous given the current outcry in the US - now spreading to Europe and Asia - over abuse of state power in gathering and use of information. As well, the fact that the Abe administration is introducing the bill at a time when it is also seeking to make revisions to the pacifistic Constitution - changes that, among other things, would vest more power in the state and thus less in the hands of individual citizens - is disquieting.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/h-share-market", "site_title": "The H-share market", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe H-share market\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE were a total of 151 companies with a combined market capitalisation of HK$4.64 trillion (S$743 billion) at the end of September. A full list can be found on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's website: http://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/stat/smstat/chidimen/cd_hmb.htm\n\nKeep in mind that the actual market capitalisation of the companies is far larger than what is in the table. The numbers here only reflect the value of shares outstanding in the Hong Kong market.\n\nAnother thing to note is that investing in Hong Kong dollar-denominated shares exposes one to exchange rate risk.\n\nAs the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, and the US dollar has steadily weakened against the Singapore dollar over the years, the strength of the Singapore dollar is a potential worry for investors looking to buy Hong Kong dollar-denominated stocks. While S$1 could buy HK$4.50 at end-2003, S$1 now gets you about HK$6.20.\n\nA quick glance at the 50 largest H-share stocks shows that many are related to finance and commodities. The largest five stocks are China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and state-owned oil and gas company PetroChina.\n\nFamiliar names might also include telco plays China Telecom and ZTE Corporation, airlines Air China and China Southern Airlines, and beer producer Tsingtao Brewery.\n\nA quick screen of H-shares trading at valuations around their book value and price-to-earnings (PE) ratios below eight times at end-October throws up some names.\n\nThe well-known Bank of China, for example, is trading at a 10 per cent discount to its book value and a PE ratio of 5.2 times.\n\nA far smaller bank, Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank, is trading at around five times its earnings and at a 15 per cent discount to book value.\n\nIt was at HK$3 a share just a few months ago, and has recovered 30 per cent to HK$3.90 a share now.\n\nChina Petroleum, otherwise known as Sinopec, refines, produces and trades petroleum and petrochemical products. It is trading slightly above book value with a PE ratio of eight times.\n\nSinopec and PetroChina are China's two largest energy companies. Both recently reported increased profit because of a government policy in March that allowed them to raise fuel prices to match increasing costs.\n\nSinopec reported a 20 per cent jump in third-quarter net profit to 22 billion yuan (S$4.48 billion), while PetroChina reported a 19 per cent gain in profit to 29.8 billion yuan.\n\nAnother energy supplier, China Coal Energy, has fallen about 35 per cent year-to-date. The company is trading at a 40 per cent discount to its book value and around seven times earnings.\n\nCoal producers have been reporting weak earnings because of excess supply and weakening demand.\n\nLow coal prices, however, have benefited cement producers such as Anhui Conch Cement, which is the largest Hong Kong-listed cement maker.\n\nThe company had recovered from June lows of HK$20 a share by more than 30 per cent to now trade at about HK$27 a share, with a PE ratio of more than 17 and 2.3 times book.\n\nInvestors should also take note that H-shares trade at different valuations from A-shares, but commentators have said there is no easy way to gain arbitrage profits between the two because of the closed nature of the Chinese market - unless policymakers act to open it up.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Which is all very good if you're in River Cottage like Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstal where you know the name of the porker you're going to eat and the whole village makes a big occasion out of the slaughter; or if you at least have access to a butcher who buys entire pigs from a farm he's familiar with.\n\nTranslating that kind of thinking to Singapore is a little more tricky. Here, we're lucky just to know whether we're eating AirPork or not - never mind the conditions the pig was reared in, or whether the intestines and liver you buy are from the same animal or scooped from a common pool of entrails in an assembly line slaughterhouse while the remaining bits of animal are turned into dog food. I'm just saying ...\n\nOnce the lofty ideals are out of the way, it's possible to focus on the second half of Henderson's quote, which is, \"there is a set of delights, textural and flavoursome, which lie beyond the fillet\". That is true, and that would be the premise of Wolf, which is broadly inspired by Henderson's hip London restaurant. Where other eateries might stop at a chewy bavette of beef or bone marrow in the name of adventurous dining, Wolf explores a deeper culinary path paved with hearts, livers and intestines. All are nothing to flinch at in a Chinese restaurant, but in a Western eatery where you rarely see the face of a fish on your plate, it's no small matter to get this close to a pig's head.\n\nEven so, Wolf tiptoes around the nose-to-tail concept rather than going the whole hog, with a rather small menu that limits itself to the likes of salads with your choice of beef hearts, pig's ear or chicken livers. The day we are there, the very friendly and polished staff are offering the daily special of chitlins or chitterlings - a slightly gamey sausage made of intestines that they conceded were not made in-house. And it did taste like commercially made sausage with its too-fine texture and an imbalance of spices. We much prefer the house-made pig's head and trotter brawn ($18) - meticulously picked out head meat and trotter bits set in jiggly, collagen-enriched gelatinous slabs and served with thick toasted country bread. A salad of julienned endives in a mild aioli dressing with long strips of pig's ear and sweet pearls of pomegranate ($20) could have used more ears and a punchier dressing, but we can happily live with this pleasing textural mixture of cartilage and crisp-tender greens.\n\nWe're less happy with the \"grilled\" ox tongue ($38) where instead of taking up the challenge to grill fresh tongue - which if successful yields a tender, steak-like bite - the tongue is braised beyond resistance and then pan-fried. When you've been searching fruitlessly for a local equivalent of Japanese grilled tongue, this is yet another dead end. The braised puy lentils which are a few minutes short of tender and a salsa verde do not compensate either.\n\nApart from the heart-stopping deep-fried chicken skin snacks you get when you first sit down, the oxtail and lips stew ($32) is another diet-killing but comforting choice where all gristle and cartilage is broken down into a thick tomato-enhanced rich gravy lined with silky smooth potato puree and carrot chunks. If all that gelatine is too much for you, the wood-smoked kurobuta pork chop ($48) is pricey but its char-broiled fragrance and well-brined flavour offer familiarity and flavour. While served so pink that it's almost rare in the middle, it's still slightly dry. No fault of the chef's though - one has long concluded that there is no such thing as a moist and tender pork chop regardless of provenance - maybe Wolf should just stick its neck out and do a roasted pork collar instead.\n\nWith its solid staff, slick surroundings and very clever wall-etchings of a wolf's face and flying pigs, Wolf is a polished set-up even if you take away its nose-to-tail leanings. If anything, it seems to be too hesitant to take up a stronger stand with its menu in favour of being all things to all diners. There is a lot more to explore on this front, especially in the form of home-made sausages, blood puddings, liver and kidney fry-ups (perhaps pig's head every day instead of requiring a two-day advance order). One would hazard that greater exposure and experience for the chef would go a long way towards achieving the inherent confidence and maturity that Wolf needs if it's serious about developing this concept.\n\nAs it stands, it works as your above-average Club Street eatery with its fair share of strengths and weaknesses. But if it wants to go the whole nine yards in terms of respecting the animals that we eat, then Wolf needs more guts to prove it.\n\nRating: 7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nokia's maps assets are based on its US$8.1 billion purchase of global mapping giant Navteq in 2008.\n\nNavteq's maps provide the base data for services such as Yahoo Maps and Bing Maps, as well as maps by GPS maker Garmin.\n\nThe use of maps on smartphones has become so common that Google and Apple decided to build their own maps for their devices, in large part to avoid licence fees to Nokia and competitor Tele Atlas, which started getting hefty because of usage globally.\n\nMr Halbherr said that Here maps have been made available for iPhones and Androids, as well as Windows phones and Nokia's more basic Symbian devices.\n\nThis takes away one of the touted differentiating features of Nokia's own lines of Lumia smartphones, but come 2014, that'll be Microsoft's problem. When the Lumia range was launched, one of trumped features was the presence of Nokia's maps installed in the phone.\n\nNokia is the only maps provider which allows entire cities to be downloaded, allowing a smartphone to navigate without a data connection and making it a reliable GPS device in a foreign country. Apple and Android maps allow some offline use via caching, but largely rely on connectivity for fuller features such as turn-by-turn navigation.\n\nNokia has also been touting the walking directions of its maps for years, by placing people on the ground in busy cities.\n\nThe Finnish company has plenty of growth ahead for maps. In 2012, Here contributed just 4 per cent of Nokia's net sales, while the rest was evenly split between its handset and networking infrastructure businesses. It already counts car makers like Ford, BMW, Audi and Toyota as its customers, and it is investing in new technology to get an edge over players like Google.\n\nLast month, its new True II mapping cars started trawling the streets of Singapore. It looks like a Google Street View car, but its technology does way more, said Kirk Mitchell, vice-president of Asia-Pacific sales and business development for Here.\n\nWhile the Street View cars feature a camera mounted on its top, taking pictures as it drives along, the True II car has rotating lasers which capture 700,000 points each second. The laser determines the distance between an object and the car, allowing the car to map a 3D model of its landscape, not just photos. It also has sensitive position sensors which measure any changes in the road such as bumps or tilts, to map out smoother travelling routes, said Mr Mitchell.\n\nAll of this technology is necessary, because we have barely scratched the surface of creating maps, said Mr Halbherr. \"Maps today are just digital representations of paper maps,\" he said.\n\nThe future of mapping should see us holding up our phones for augmented reality, and it should include voice recognition instead of typing, he added. In future, in-dash maps should also be connected to the Web, so that real-time changes and live traffic data can be pulled down, he said.\n\nMap-making is a technology-intensive process, he said. \"Making a map is always a moving target - once you create the map, it's out of date. Some 2.7 million updates are made to Nokia's maps every single day,\" he said.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Nokia Here has 1,500 people based in Singapore, Japan, India, Korea and Australia. It also works with governments to get information such as traffic data.\n\nNokia announced in September the impending US$7 billion sale of its handset division to Microsoft.\n\nWhen the sale is completed, Nokia will be left with three business divisions: Here, the Nokia Solutions and Networks (formerly Nokia Siemens Networks) networking infrastructure business, and its Advanced Technologies division, which holds its R&D work and patent portfolio.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The figures were down from the previous week's 19 firms, 50 trades and $9.5 million.\n\nBuyers outweighed sellers with 14 companies that posted 25 purchases worth $4.8 million versus a paltry three firms with five disposals worth $768,000.\n\nAside from directors, the buyback activity fell last week with four firms that recorded five repurchases worth $463,000. The figures were down from the previous week's five companies, 17 trades and $1.57 million.\n\nThe bulk of the significant trades last week were purchases with buybacks in Soup Restaurant Group and XMH Holdings. On the directors' side, there were key insider buys in Jubilee Industries, Tee Land, and Grand Banks Yachts.\n\nOn the institutional shareholders' front, Templeton acquired more shares of Ezion Holdings. Lastly, there were conflicting substantial shareholder trades in Cordlife Group.\n\nSoup Restaurant Group\n\nRestaurant chain operator Soup Restaurant Group bought back more shares with 1.1 million shares purchased from Oct 9 to 31 at an average of 23 cents each. The trades accounted for 6 per cent of the stock's trading volume. The company last bought back 194,000 shares on Oct 31 at 25.6 cents each. The group previously acquired 4.735 million shares from Aug 7 to Sept 27 at 20 cents to 16 cents each or an average of 18.1 cents each. The repurchases since August are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in May 2007. The trades since August were made on the back of the rise in the share price since November 2012 from 11.8 cents. The counter is also sharply up since October 2008 from 4.8 cents. The counter closed at 26 cents on Friday.\n\nXMH Holdings\n\nMarine and industrial diesel engine, propulsion, and power-generating solutions provider XMH Holdings resumed buying back at higher than its previous acquisition prices with 760,000 shares purchased on Oct 31 at 37 cents each. The buybacks, however, were made on the back of the 20 per cent drop in the share price since June from 46 cents. The group previously acquired 1.16 million shares from March 13 to April 3 at an average of 27.4 cents each, 100,000 shares in December 2012 at 19 cents each, and 13.7 million shares from September 2011 to February 2012 at an average of 16.1 cents each. Also positive this year is executive director Tan Guat Lian with an initial 90,000 shares (deemed) purchased on July 25 at 39.3 cents each. The shares bought represented 0.02 per cent of the issued capital. She also has direct interest of 35.886 million shares or 9.32 per cent. That is her first on-market trade since the stock was listed in January 2011. The director's purchase price was sharply higher than the IPO price of 25 cents. The counter closed at 37.5 cents on Friday.\n\nJubilee Industries Holdings\n\nExecutive director Toh Soon Huat recorded his first on-market trades in plastic moulding services provider Jubilee Industries Holdings since his appointment in April with 2.67 million shares purchased from Oct 28 to 30 at an average of 17.7 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 19 per cent of the stock's trading volume, increased his deemed holdings by 11 per cent to 28.025 million shares or 11.94 per cent. The purchases were made on the back of the 40 per cent drop in the share price since April from 29.5 cents. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since October 2012 from eight\n\ncents. The corporate shareholder sentiment is not entirely positive this year as substantial shareholder Chua Kim Guan unloaded 11.76 million shares from September 24 to 27 at an average of 20.1 cents each, which lowered his deemed stake by 47 per cent to 13.388 million shares or 5.7 per cent. Those are his first on-market trades since the stock was listed in July 2009. Mr Chua's sale price was lower than the IPO price of 27 cents. The counter closed at 17.7 cents on Friday.\n\nTEE Land\n\nNon-executive chairman and independent director Er Dr Lee Bee Wah recorded her first on-market trade in property developer TEE Land Ltd since the stock was listed in June with 85,000 shares purchased on Oct 29 at 36 cents each. The trade increased her direct holdings by 94 per cent to 175,000 shares or 0.04 per cent. The acquisition was made on the back of the 37 per cent drop in the share price since June from 57 cents. Not surprisingly, the chairman's purchase price was lower than the IPO price of 54 cents. Three other shareholders have also bought shares since listing. Independent director Chin Sek Peng acquired an initial 60,000 shares from Aug 29 to 30 at 34 cents each. Non-executive director Timothy Ong, on the other hand, purchased 200,000 shares from Aug 21 to 22 at 36 cents each, which increased his direct holdings by 69 per cent to 490,000 shares or 0.11 per cent. He previously acquired 200,000 shares from June 10 to 12 at an average of 51.3 cents each and an initial 90,000 shares on June 5 in the IPO at 54 cents each. Lastly, substantial shareholder Koh Wee Meng acquired four million shares on Aug 5 at an estimated price of 38 cents each, which boosted his direct stake 17 per cent to 28.000 million shares or 6.27 per cent. He previously reported an initial filing on June 10 of two million shares at 52.5 cents each, which raised his interest to 5.37 per cent. The counter closed at 35 cents on Friday.\n\nGrand Banks Yachts\n\nIndependent director Basil Chan recorded his first trade in yachts manufacturer Grand Banks Yachts Ltd since February 2012 with 100,000 shares purchased on Nov 1 at 22.5 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings by 6,667 per cent to 102,000 shares or 0.06 per cent. The acquisition was made on the back of the 41 per cent drop in the share price since October 2012 from 38.2 cents. The purchase was also made after the company announced on Oct 28 a first-quarter loss of $579,000 which was less than the loss of $1.446 million in the same period last year. Mr Chan previously acquired an initial 1,000 shares in February 2012 at 21 cents each. The counter closed at 22.5 cents on Friday.\n\nEzion Holdings\n\nTempleton International, Inc acquired more shares of offshore marine logistics and support services provider Ezion Holdings with a purchase-related filing on Oct 28 of 1.1 million shares at $2.24 each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 68.476 million shares or 7.11 per cent. The filing was made on the back of the 9 per cent drop in the share price since August from $2.47. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since June from $1.98. The group previously reported a purchase-related filing on May 31 of 96,000 shares at $2.25 each. Prior to the notices this year, the fund manager acquired 17.86 million shares from Nov 25, 2011, to Feb 23, 2012, at estimated prices of 61.5 cents to 96 cents each and an initial filing on Nov 24, 2011, of 1.455 million shares at 62 cents each, which raised its interest to 5.18 per cent. Overall, Templeton's stake is up by 37 per cent since that initial filing in November 2011. The stock closed at $2.29 on Friday.\n\nCordlife Group\n\nThere are conflicting trades in private cord blood banking services provider Cordlife Group in October with purchases by Coop International Pte Ltd versus a sale by FMR LLC & FIL Ltd. Coop International purchased 2.3 million shares from Oct 4 to 11 and a further 564,000 shares on Oct 28 at an average of $1.21 each. The trades increased its direct holdings by 12 per cent to 27.319 million shares or 10.22 per cent. The purchases were made on the back of the 44 per cent rise in the share price since June from 84 cents. The counter is also sharply up since June 2012 from 43 cents. The group previously acquired 2 million shares in April 2012 at an estimated price of 55 cents each. Coop International became a substantial shareholder in March 2012 after it acquired an initial 18.45 million shares or 7.93 per cent via placement and off-market trade at 50 cents each.

But analysts fear that the Bank of Japan's super-easy monetary policy is creating a runway for a steep take-off that will lead to a crash.\n\nThis comes amid a warning by rating agency Standard & Poor's that rising levels of mortgage-based financial leverage in Asian households could create risks for local banks.\n\nThe sharp spike in property values has been less visible than the surge in stock and bond markets in many parts of Asia because property transactions are less transparent. But this is precisely what makes the boom more threatening, say analysts.\n\nAfter the mega-crash in Japanese land and property prices following the collapse of the bubble economy two decades ago, real estate has been a quiet sector compared with other markets such as China, Hong Kong or Singapore.\n\nBut this could be about to change dramatically, said former Goldman Sachs (Asia) vice-president Kenneth Courtis.\n\nDespite having got their fingers burnt, banks are back in the mortgage market and are being pushed by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lend more.\n\n\"With short-term interest rates at zero and long- term rates being driven down by an unprecedented monetary blitzkrieg launched by the (BOJ) with the aim of generating inflation, investors have been scrambling to take on as much Japanese real estate exposure as they can,\" Mr Courtis told The Business Times.\n\n\"In major metropolitan areas, prices are up sharply. In core Tokyo, prices for new, freehold residential real estate are up 22 per cent over the past year. That still means that valuations are but a quarter to a third of what they were at the peak 23 years ago, (but) I expect a further upward move in prices.\"\n\nGiven that the summer Olympic Games are due to be held in Tokyo in 2020, property prices could receive what some analysts describe as a \"steroidal boost\" - starting well before the games are held.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening. At projects close to the proposed Athletes' Village, the first 800 or so units that went on sale in August were snapped up.\n\nBuyers expect BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda's pledge to double the monetary base over the next two years to push up real estate prices, said Ryo Hashimoto, head of condo sales at Skyz Tower & Garden, an apartment building near the Athletes' Village.\n\nThe \"quanto easing in which Japan is currently engaged is simply gigantic\", said Mr Courtis. \"Japan today is pumping new liquidity into its financial system at three times the rate relative to GDP that the US is doing.\"\n\nHe is not the only one to call attention to rising prices. In Tokyo, the average price of new condos jumped nearly 10 per cent in the year ended June 30 to 686,000 yen (S$8,643) per square metre, said the Land Institute of Japan.\n\nLand prices are on the rise again in the major cities after slumping 85 per cent in the wake of the bubble economy crash, leaving banks with US$1 trillion of bad loans, according to Global Property Guide.\n\nIn the year ended June, the average price of land in Tokyo rose 5 per cent to 204,500 yen psm.\n\nJapan is by no means alone in experiencing property-price inflation. \"From China to Canada and London, fast-rising property markets are haunting the global economy again, five years after the US subprime mortgage bubble burst and triggered the worst financial crisis since the 1930s,\" Reuters said in a global survey published last week.\n\nIt noted, however, that \"except in a few cases, the warning signals are flashing amber, not red, and several countries have acted to cool overheating markets\".\n\nStill, it added, \"the confidence of policymakers that they can avoid another generalised boom and bust could be tested if central banks keep pumping out nearly free money to support economic growth by encouraging investment in riskier assets, such as equities and property\".\n\nMeanwhile, Asia's increasing household leverage - mainly from rising mortgages - could be risky for Asian banks'creditworthiness, according to an S&P report last week.\n\nThe report evaluated asset quality of banks in six economies: Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and China. It noted that while banks in Asia have been operating under favourable credit conditions resulting from healthy economic growth for a few years now, a structural weakness appears to be emerging in some economies.\n\n\"Rising household debt fuelled by rapid loan growth and easy monetary conditions could weaken the credit quality of banks in Asia,\" said S&P credit analyst Ivan Tan. \"Potential asset bubbles and imbalances are building up in some countries, and could put the banks at risk.\"\n\nMalaysia, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea have the highest household debt in Asia, S&P noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/valley-choice-singapore-professionals", "site_title": "The Valley of choice for Singapore professionals", "publish_date": null, "content": "The Valley of choice for Singapore professionals\n\nHigh salaries, flexible hours, progressive culture make Silicon Valley a major draw\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] More Singaporeans have moved to Silicon Valley (SV) for work in the last decade, according to people who have worked or are working there. And while information technology (IT) and engineering professionals are known to command higher salaries, those who move cite other reasons.\n\n\"As a trend, I do see it increasing; we actually try to keep track of the numbers,\" said Vinnie Lauria, founding partner of tech incubator Golden Gate Ventures (GGV) which has offices in Singapore and SV.\n\n\"As the Singaporean network in SV gets stronger, it encourages more folks to make the jump - something they were afraid to do earlier.\"\n\nAlthough there are no absolute numbers to show, Mark Sin, president of SingaporeConnect, a grassroots organisation that supports Singaporeans living in San Francisco, noted that he is seeing more Singaporeans at get-togethers.\n\nFor James Chan, the founder-CEO of tech incubator Silicon Straits who studied and worked in SV from 2005 to 2009, said the increase was not obvious to him - until he came home.\n\n\"It got a lot more obvious after I returned to Singapore and tried to wrap my head around the shortage of startup-compatible software engineers here. Those who were sufficiently exposed to Western tech media tended to aspire to leave Singapore to work at startups in SV,\" he said.\n\nWhy SV? A major pull factor mentioned by many is surprisingly not the salary, but that there is a greater respect for tech and engineering professions there.\n\nSaid Shaun Lim, who moved to SV to work at PayPal after graduating from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2010: \"I'm a software engineer and this is arguably the best place to be for my profession.\n\n\"The work here is more interesting and meaningful. Even as a junior engineer, I was able to start projects of significant size from scratch and be responsible for design and implementation. I don't believe this is something engineers in Singapore enjoy.\"\n\nCaleb Chao, a fellow NUS graduate and now a software engineer at Google, said he appreciated the opportunity to develop and work on established and complex IT systems there.\n\n\"Large IT companies have offices in Singapore mainly for sales, marketing and technical support; development is mostly non-existent and at the very most a token presence,\" Mr Chao said.\n\nThe Valley's open, welcoming and progressive culture is another much-talked-about pull factor.\n\n\"Hours are flexible. If people want to take time off for appointments or errands, there's no need to specifically take vacation hours,\" Mr Sin said.\n\n\"SV is an inspirational place to be in. Words like 'disrupt', 'change' and 'new technologies' are all the rage; coffee shops are always packed with entrepreneurs working on startup ideas or pitching to investors. We also get to be at the forefront of and use the latest technologies before others do,\" said Jenn Ng, who worked at DBS and PwC Singapore before joining SV-headquartered software company Intuit.\n\n\"It's the only spot in the world that has kept up with its virtuous cycle of paying it forward, and celebrates failure as much as it celebrates successes,\" said Silicon Straits' Mr Chan.\n\nAgreeing, GGV's Mr Lauria said: \"It's a culture that rewards risk-seekers. Most people in the Valley are from somewhere else; 52 per cent of startups are by foreign-born entrepreneurs. These are the people who aren't scared of failure and will dare take a jump into the unknown.\"\n\nIn fact, one of the reasons why SV thrives is that it is a land of equal opportunities for immigrants, said Tan Yinglan, author of The Way of the VC and venture partner at Sequoia Capital.\n\n\"Anecdotally, immigrants in SV have been entrepreneurial, motivated, hungry and eager to improve their lot in life. This creates economic dynamism in the Valley,\" Mr Tan noted.\n\n\"It can be a pretty competitive place to be in. Analysts are expected to have a certain level of technical abilities such as coding skills. Many interns don't mind working for free, and it is still a male-dominated industry,\" Ms Ng pointed out.\n\nFor those who work for pay, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the software engineer in SV commanded an average annual wage of US$100,049 last year. This compares with the average annual salary of $57,936 drawn by a software engineer in Singapore.\n\nHuman resource consulting firm Robert Half International also ranked SV as the fourth metro area in the United States likely to offer the biggest pay raise in 2014.\n\nAnd while many places, including Singapore, have aspired to learn from SV's successes, observers said the island-state should not aspire to be the next SV. It has made significant strides in maturating its tech and startup ecosystem, and is better-placed to be Asia's startup hub instead.\n\n\"The 'SV label' carries with it a heavy burden of expectations that Singapore is still far from meeting. A good amount of entrepreneurial talent bled out of our ecosystem after the dotcom bust.\n\n\"We're only just beginning to see a revival of key elements in our ecosystem over the past two years - designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, capitalists, investments, acquisitions - yet, much remains to be done before Singapore becomes the 'SV of Asia',\" said Mr Chan.\n\nMr Sin added it is difficult for Singapore to claim the title with competition from bigger markets such as China and India.\n\nAnother hindrance to the startup scene here is that most people live with their families, unlike in the US, and this inhibits entrepreneurship and risk appetite, Mr Lauria said.\n\n\"The number of start-up teams that live and work out of the same apartment in SV is very high. It's amazing what you can do when you're all forced into a small apartment 24/7,\" he said.\n\nMr Lim of PayPal added: \"I do feel that like many things, entrepreneurship in Singapore is being driven largely from a top-down approach, and that can't be too healthy.\"\n\nBut many cited Singapore's stable economic and political systems, high cultural acceptance, strong government funding support and startup events such as Echelon and TechVenture, as beneficial in growing its tech ecosystem.\n\nSaid Steve Leonard, executive deputy chairman of Singapore's Infocomm Development Authority, at the 2013 TechVenture in September: \"It is not Singapore's goal to be another version of SV. We should find something to create for ourselves.\"\n\n\"It is great that Singaporeans are moving to SV. I anticipate that some of them will return home to start their new venture or work for local startups. But as the region's startup hub, it is good for Singapore to have close ties with the Valley,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nMr Lauria, who travels frequently to look up the startup scene in each country, said: \"Singapore really stood out for me because of the startup community here - it reminds me of SV in terms of openness and enthusiasm. There are few global cities as international and diverse as Singapore, and that's an asset for the startup scene.\n\n\"That said, I don't think being the 'SV of Asia' is a great goal to set. Singapore should figure out its place in the region and execute as a startup hub.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In most of the cases covered by Freshfields, the company suffered a major blow - affecting its value, revenue and long-term reputation - from the inability to control reputational crises in the early stages.\n\nFifty-eight per cent experienced a significant disruption to their operations, while 53 per cent suffered a loss of revenue, and 27 per cent, a drop in share price.\n\nOn top of that, news of crises tends to stay in the media spotlight for months, rather than days or weeks. 53 per cent of cases were still in the public eye a month after the story first broke.\n\nThis clearly presents new challenges for companies today.\n\nStephen Revell, a partner at Freshfields' Singapore office, told The Business Times that the Singapore business community is definitely adjusting to the new paradigm.\n\n\"There is a clear recognition in many Singapore companies that we talk to about crisis management, of the importance of preparing for a crisis and the new ways a crisis can take hold.\n\n\"The large increase in PR (public relations) advisory firms opening their doors in Singapore suggests that there is a clear appetite in the market to get ahead of the curve in terms of crisis preparation.\"\n\nFreshfields' findings come from a survey of 102 senior crisis communications professionals from the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and the United States. Those interviewed have advised on a total of over 2,000 significant reputational crises in the last year.\n\nThey said that businesses are just not moving fast enough to contain a crisis when it breaks.\n\nOn average, companies took 21 hours to issue meaningful external communications and more than 48 hours in 18 per cent of incidents. Only 15 per cent of companies managed to get a complete response out within the hour.\n\nMore worryingly, over four in 10 firms had no plan in place in case of a crisis. Only a third had relevant communications material ready, and just one in five had run a simulation exercise.\n\nHarald Spruit, a partner with Freshfields in Netherlands, said: \"Organisations seem to be much less prepared for dealing with the social media aspects of a crisis than they are with overall crisis planning.\"\n\nIn half of all cases, social media had a significant impact on how the story spread locally, while in almost a third of cases, it played a major role in how the story spread globally.\n\nThe communication professionals surveyed said that this failure to prepare effectively to handle the issue online left their clients open to \"trial by Twitter\".\n\nAlso, while two-thirds of the cases suffered only a temporary impact, the remaining third saw more serious long-term damage, such as product recalls, liquidity problems, material litigation and hacking of their IT systems.\n\nNews of close to two-thirds of crises crossed national boundaries, meaning that the impact of issues was restrained to the originating country in only one in three cases. On average, information about a corporate crisis spread to 11 countries.\n\nFreshfields stressed that it is important for companies to balance the need to respond promptly with the potential liabilities. Norbert Nolte, a partner with the firm in Germany, said: \"Companies must ensure that they balance the need to respond to the media at speed with appraising legal risk, otherwise those words could come back to haunt them.\"\n\nFifty-five per cent of the experts consulted said that the companies' legal advisers had a major influence on what was ultimately said to the media. It was found that the more closely the communications and the legal teams worked, the more effective and prompt the response.\n\nGeoff Nicholas, disputes partner and co-head of Freshfields global investigations practice, concluded: \"Companies need to have nimble structures and procedures to take advantage of these vacuums of time. The truly unexpected will inevitably have less that companies can fall back on but, most of the time, good preparation will make a real difference as to how successfully a crisis is ultimately handled.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China became Africa's biggest bilateral trading partner in 2009, with the total volume of trade valued at $198.5 billion in 2012. This is expected to breach $380 billion by 2015.\n\nIn contrast, Singapore-Africa trade is far more modest and has been rising steadily to reach US$14.1 billion (S$17.5 billion) in 2012.\n\nSuch a formidable Chinese presence begs the question: Do Singapore companies even stand a chance in Africa, or have they missed the boat already?\n\n\"In my opinion, there is still scope for Singapore companies to venture into Africa,\" said Djoko Prihanto, senior vice president at Surbana Urban Planning Group. \"While China has come with investment, Singapore is known for its integrity, quality and professionalism, so for certain types of professional work the client may still value the Singapore branding.\"\n\nAdded Colin Tan, director and head of research and consultancy at Suntec Real Estate Consultants: \"China's strength is in their manufacturing capability and exporting of their construction services. But when it comes to advisory services, their quality and standards are some way behind us.\"\n\nIn large and booming economies such as Nigeria, for instance, Singapore's expertise would be especially valued, according to Bola Adesola, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria.\n\n\"With a population of over 160 million people and there being a large infrastructure deficit in Nigeria, there are still opportunities that Singaporean companies can tap ... (It) can utilise its expertise in the service industry and focus on IT, finance and petroleum industries, among others.\"\n\nThe Republic's experience in water management is one area Nigerians are keen to learn more about. \"There is a need for potable water planning and development in Nigeria and this is a good example of where Singapore's reputation of being one of the most advanced countries in water management can be leveraged,\" added Ms Adesola.\n\nRwanda - despite being known for its 1994 genocide that killed at least half a million people - is frequently cited as an ideal investment locale for Singapore businesses.\n\nIn fact, President Paul Kagame dreams of his East African nation becoming \"the Singapore of Africa\". To that end, Rwanda's urban planning authority has enlisted Singapore's expertise in doing masterplanning for the capital city, Kigali.\n\n\"We are helping them to formulate the vision for the next 25 years to 2040,\" said Surbana's Mr Prihanto. \"What will Rwanda look like by then? How big will the population be? What should the key economic sectors be? This is what we're doing there.\"\n\nWhile Surbana declined to say how much the Rwanda contract was worth, Mr Prihanto said: \"Projects in Africa for urban planning are larger in scale and complexity, and command higher consultancy fees than (other) typical planning projects in Asia.\"\n\nSingapore businessmen say other bright spots include countries such as Angola, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\n\"Because of their colonial roots, many of these countries have different investment laws,\" said Cody Lee, director, Middle East & Africa, Singapore Business Federation (SBF). \"But there's not a single country on the continent that I know of that does not allow foreigners to do business there.\"\n\nWith a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) recently signed between IE Singapore and China, Singapore companies looking to penetrate the African market can now partner the China Development Bank, known to be a heavyweight financier of infrastructure projects with extensive networks on the continent.\n\nThe agreement will see both countries fostering strategic partnerships between their firms in third-country markets, with an initial focus on Africa and South-east Asia.\n\n\"There are many ways Singapore companies can actually leverage China's experience in Africa. For example, Singapore can do the planning for a project and China can chip in to fund and build the project. Both countries can share ownership of the entire thing,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nHe encourages companies to do their research, network with Singapore groups already in Africa and attend business and investment forums organised by IE Singapore and SBF.\n\n\"The important thing to remember is that Africa isn't some distant place that Singapore companies should stay far away from. It's not Mars, and people need to realise that.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Already, the country's government agencies are on guard and have tightened IT security, the regulator said.\n\n\"Government agencies have been on heightened vigilance and have enhanced the security of their IT systems in response to the declared threats against the government's ICT infrastructure,\" IDA said in a statement last night.\n\n\"Meanwhile, businesses and individuals are urged to take the necessary precautions to enhance cyber security.

However, this was rectified by 5.20 pm,\" it added.\n\nEven so, some maintenance works will continue over the next few days, which might mean intermittent access to some government websites, IDA said.\n\nYesterday, an IDA incident report dated last Saturday - uploaded by an unknown person to the Internet - mirrored the regulator's account of events.\n\nThe incidence report made references to a routing problem and a router that experienced hardware failure during an \"urgent scheduled maintenance . . . to test the implementation of a security solution for Internet access\".\n\nThe report said that as a result of the glitch, government agencies on the affected connection were unable to surf public websites from the internal government network, while members of the public were unable to access the government's Internet systems and e-services on the same connection.\n\n\"We are waiting for an incident report from the . . . service provider,\" the report said.\n\nYesterday, IDA stressed that \"maintenance of IT systems is part of the government's on-going efforts to enhance security\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But unlike previous years, this will not be done by introducing a string of schemes.\n\nInstead, the focus will be on refining and enhancing the many programmes that have already been implemented, based on feedback gathered by the recently formed SME Workgroup - a government-led body comprising business leaders, government agencies and grassroots advisers.\n\nTeo Ser Luck, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, shared this with The Business Times in a recent interview.\n\nHe said: \"One thing I won't do is to roll out many, many, many schemes. . . We need to focus on implementation, not rolling out more schemes.\n\n\"This means implementing existing schemes effectively and making the necessary changes, refining them based on feedback, and also making sure that we set up the infrastructure to make sure these schemes can be implemented.\"\n\nAny programme that will be introduced must \"make some real impact\", he added.\n\nThe decision to roll out fewer schemes comes amid feedback that there are currently too many programmes in place to help SMEs in Singapore.\n\nThe different names and aims of the programmes are often a cause of confusion, and their sheer number - some consultants put it past 200 - have made it difficult for SMEs to know what is available.\n\nBut this may soon be history. Mr Teo, who heads the SME Workgroup, said that plans are afoot to streamline the schemes such that they become \"so simple, so streamlined\" for SMEs to tap on.\n\n\"I think all the schemes are well-intentioned. But the way we have rolled them out has been too detailed, too many. So we are going to streamline them, that's for sure.\n\n\"I aspire to do that soon,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nSpring Singapore, the agency which oversees a large number of the SME-related schemes, said that it has already streamlined a number of schemes into what it now calls the Capability Development Grant. This was already announced in Budget 2013.\n\n\"We will however, continue to review and simplify existing schemes and programmes to ensure their relevance and usefulness. We will make announcements in due course if necessary,\" said Spring.\n\nSMEs can also visit the SME Centres, speak to the advisers there on the project they are working on, and have the advisers help with applying for all the schemes that they can tap on.\n\n\"That's also why we need to streamline the schemes, so that the advisers are more knowledgeable and it's easier to apply for and implement the schemes for the business.\"\n\nHe also hopes to help SMEs achieve cost advantages by beefing up industry or sector-related initiatives.\n\n\"We can centralise certain help, centralise certain backroom, so that they can all get economies of scale.\"\n\nBut SMEs need to play their part. They should tap on the help provided by the government as much as they can to defray rising costs, and look for new revenue streams wherever possible to continue and sustain the business, he added.\n\n\"So the SME Workgroup, whilst helping, trying to engage and accompanying SMEs along this journey, can't really spoonfeed because we cannot afford to do so. It is not sustainable. And business is not done this way. It's about survival.\"\n\nOverall, the SME sector needs to find ways to grow and strengthen itself.\n\nHe said: \"We need to strengthen our business sector in order to be successful in future, for our economy to have a real pillar of support - where companies are really strong and they can front many things.\n\n\"I'm not so ambitious as to expect them to be No 1 players in the world. I just need them to be strong enough locally and regionally. I think that would already help Singapore.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Designers take their sketches, scan them, and trace over them to make digital versions of their drawings, he said.\n\nUsing 3D technology changes the process: The sketches are done in-software, and trying out the design on a model is done virtually, based on the fabric chosen.\n\nBut getting the modelling to work means figuring out the physics and movement of different types of fabrics.\n\nFrench couture designer Julien Fournie, an ambassador for FashionLab who worked on modelling the behaviour of fabrics for Dassault's software, said: \"It's hard to work with a material such as jersey, for example, because it stretches.\"\n\nHe worked with engineers from Dassault, a 32-year-old company listed on the NYSE Euronext, to map out a jersey's properties so it could be added to its palette of fabrics.\n\nFashionLab's efforts are all designed to meet the fashion world's need for speed. \"Fast fashion\" requires designs to get from the catwalk to retail stores quickly, so being able to prototype a design virtually means saving physical material and the time needed to manufacture test versions of each garment before the final design is settled on, he said.\n\nMr Fournie estimates that shaving time off each step of clothes-making - from design to prototyping to eventual manufacture - could mean generating garments between 30 and 50 per cent faster.\n\nFashionLab is also testing out virtual stores and setting up avatars or exact digital representations of shoppers, which can try on new clothing designs.\n\nViola Tan, the co-founder of Singaporean e-retailer Love Bonito, said \"fast fashion\" for her means bringing on up to 15 new designs each week. She is keen on technology such as shopper avatars, which can assure shoppers that both the design and size are a good fit for them. It could raise revenue for the store, she said.\n\nDassault is not the only technology firm to have spotted opportunities for 3D technology in fashion. Even as 3D printing has gained momentum among technology players globally, 3D-printed fashions have hit the catwalk.\n\nDutch designer Iris van Herpen sent her models down the catwalk wearing her line of 3D-printed clothes; earlier this year, burlesque celebrity Dita Von Teese showed off a 3D-printed gown in nylon mesh to a convention in the United States.\n\nSan Francisco-based design lab Continuum is squarely focused on 3D-printed garments, and companies such as 3D-A-Porter focus on 3D body scanning technology, which brings the fashion world a step closer to getting virtual avatars to try on clothes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was attributed to lower trading property sales (linked to lower sales recognition at The Trizon and The Excellency), and was partially offset by higher income from the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel.\n\nAlso mitigating the impact on net profit were factors such as a lower cost of sales and a higher share of results of joint ventures from the Archipelago development.\n\nSingLand's EPS for the quarterw was 12 cents, down from the 13.8 cents last year.\n\nFor the nine months ended Sept 30, 2013, net profit at both companies were higher than the corresponding period last year.\n\nFor UIC, the year-to-date net profit was 31 per cent higher than a year ago at $218.6 million. SingLand's earnings over that same period was $246.3 million, a 55 per cent surge year-on-year.\n\nThe driver for both companies' gains were fair value gains on investment properties and a higher share of results of associated companies. UIC closed 0.3 per cent down at $3.06 yesterday, while SingLand gained 0.5 per cent at $8.72. The results for the two companies were announced after markets closed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Details of the Dominican Republic case were first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.\n\nEmbraer is cooperating fully with authorities, the company said in a statement, but it declined to comment on details of allegations due to the confidentiality of the investigation.\n\n\"The company requires that all its employees have a conduct of strict compliance with laws and regulations,\" said a spokesman in a statement on Saturday.\n\nComments were not available from officials in the US, Argentina and the Dominican Republic.\n\nInternational cooperation on the investigation reflects a rare instance of Brazilian authorities probing a local company for its foreign business practices.\n\nBrazil has criminal laws against bribing foreign officials, but no direct equivalent of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which gives US authorities grounds to investigate US-listed companies for bribery overseas. Embraer shares called American Depositary Receipts trade on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2008, as Embraer was trying to sell its Super Tucanos to the Dominican Republic, investigators say the company was approached by the director of special projects for the country's armed forces, now-retired Colonel Carlos Piccini. Piccini sought a payment of US$3.4 million to facilitate the sale, which Embraer delivered in 2009 through a shell company in Uruguay, according to investigators. Attempts to reach Piccini through the Dominican armed forces were not successful.\n\nEmbraer delivered the first two of eight Super Tucano aircraft to the Dominican Republic in December 2009 to be used to combat drug trafficking and run border patrol missions.\n\nThe Super Tucano is Embraer's top-selling military plane. A rugged design and low cost make the turboprop popular in counterinsurgency missions from Africa to South-east Asia. In February, the US Air Force ordered 20 Super Tucanos for missions in Afghanistan.\n\nIn documents reviewed by Reuters, officials also cite a corruption investigation raising red flags about dealings between Embraer and an Argentine public official involved in an airline deal.\n\nThe official helped negotiate a contract for 20 commercial jets for Austral Lineas Aereas Cielos del Sur between 2008 and 2009, investigators said, without elaborating in the documents on evidence of wrongdoing. In May 2009, Embraer announced an agreement to supply Austral, a subsidiary of state airline Aerolineas Argentinas, with 20 of its E-190 jets seating 96 passengers. Delivery of the planes started in September 2010.\n\nEmbraer has notified investors of the ongoing legal probe through its quarterly earnings reports. The company has said it voluntarily expanded the scope of its internal investigation following a 2010 subpoena to include sales in other countries, which it has reported to US authorities.\n\nEmbraer could face substantial fines or sanctions due to the investigation, the company said in its recent earnings report, but based on outside legal counsel the planemaker said there is no basis to estimate how much money to set aside. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/re-look-china-stocks", "site_title": "A re-look at China stocks?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA re-look at China stocks?\n\nInvestor focus might return to China this month if top leadership unveils major reforms after a meeting this week, reports CAI HAOXIANG\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCHINA is the world's second- largest economy and descriptions of its potential are often accompanied by superlatives. With a population of around 1.4 billion, almost a fifth of the world's population, and an emerging middle class that has a seemingly unlimited demand for consumer goods and commodities, the prosperity of the world will increasingly depend on how China's economy develops. In the last 30 years, China's economy had grown at a breakneck pace, with real growth rates exceeding 10 per cent a year more often than not. It slowed in the past year to around 8 per cent, but growth like this is still the envy of most countries.\n\nInvestors, however, have generally not fared well in the Chinese market in recent years. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is languishing at around 2,100 points, not far away from 2009 lows and a world away from the 6,000 points recorded in 2007. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange Composite Index is not quite in the same situation, but at 1,000 points, it is off the peaks of 1,500 points reached in 2007 and 1,300 points in 2010. Stocks, which reached highs in the final quarter of 2007, had plunged during the global financial crisis, rebounded briefly and have been on a downtrend for the past few years. The slump is partly caused by a slowing economy and a lack of confidence in the country's financial system. Other than concerns over the manipulation of economic data, recent bugbears have included the credit crunch this June, when the Chinese central bank momentarily refused to add money to the banking system, concerns over too much lending especially to local governments, shadow lending by banks outside of their balance sheets to get around regulations, and potential bad debts that would result but cannot be estimated for certain.\n\nThe lack of reliable data caused outsiders to shun the Chinese market altogether. Analysts have argued that the risks taken do not justify the potential gains, and clearer returns could be found elsewhere. In the past year, institutional investors have bet on developed, well-regulated markets such as the US and Japan instead. Chinese capital markets are also not fully open to the outside world, and domestic retail investors make up most of the stockmarket activity at the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.\n\nThe Third Plenum\n\nThings might change this week.\n\nInvestor attention might return to China as the top leadership of the Communist Party of China holds its third meeting, known officially as the Third Plenum of the 18th Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. The meeting will be held from Nov 9 to Nov 12, China Daily reported last week.\n\nChina President Xi Jinping will approve a document laying out China's priorities going forward. Expectations have been played up by Chinese officials for major reforms to be announced. Historically, the third plenary sessions have been used to draft the outlines of key economic reforms.\n\nMr Xi himself has said that the agenda for the meeting will be \"comprehensive\".\n\nIssues that might feature in the agenda include reforming the banking and financial system, the land-use system, addressing local government debt, the household registration system or hukou, among others. Social equity - a big issue in China because of rampant corruption - is expected to be addressed.\n\nA re-rating of Chinese stocks, currently in the doldrums, is possible if investors like the government's broad policy outlines laid out at this meeting and see them backed by details and concrete actions in coming months.\n\nChinese stock classifications\n\nIn China, companies can issue two types of shares. For the longest time, so-called A-shares were only accessible to domestic investors and are quoted in Chinese yuan. Foreigners could only trade in B-shares, introduced in 1992, which are quoted in US dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen.\n\nHowever, the B-share market has lost its relevance over time and is now beset by problems of illiquidity. Since 2003, some foreign investors could buy A-shares through a scheme. Moreover, Chinese companies can also list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE), issuing what are known as H-shares denominated in Hong Kong dollars. The number of H-share stocks has steadily increased over the years to 151 on the HKSE's mainboard at end-September, and the market has taken off as there are no restrictions on foreign investors.\n\nA lack of confidence\n\nChinese companies have also chosen to list elsewhere, such as on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the New York Stock Exchange. However, many of these stocks have been plagued by a lack of investor confidence, making them easy targets for short-sellers.\n\nInvestors in Singapore will remember the case of Fujian-based vegetable producer China Minzhong. In late August, US-based shortseller Glaucus Research Group accused the company of fraud and financial irregularities. Within a couple of hours of the report coming out, China Minzhong shares fell more than 50 per cent, losing some S$300 million of market value in the process.\n\nAmong other things, Glaucus dug up filings of the company's two major customers before it went public in 2010, and alleged that the company faked sales to them.\n\nBut China Minzhong later produced tax filings to defend itself, arguing that the documents that Glaucus produced were meant for business registration and not meant to be as definitive as tax claims.\n\nIn any case, China Minzhong's major shareholder, Indofood Sukses Makmur, rode in with a general offer at the same price at which it previously acquired its stake earlier in the year. Investors were only too happy to sell, the company's share price rebounded, and the Indofood offer succeeded within days.\n\nInvestors in Singapore are justifiably jittery over Chinese counters listed on SGX, otherwise known as S-chips. In recent years, stocks such as Sino Techfibre, China Gaoxian, Hongwei Technologies and China Hongxing have all been hit by accounting irregularities.\n\nCertain unfortunate accidents also seem to befall Chinese counters. Late last year, China Paper Holdings said a fire had destroyed its financial records for all of 2011 and severely damaged records for the last few months of 2012.\n\nIn 2011, Sino Techfibre also said its financial records were destroyed in a fire. In 2009, auditors investigating missing funds at China Sun Bio-chem Technology Group were hit by a mysterious power failure, a missing disk drive, and were told that a truck transporting accounting records was stolen while the driver was having dinner.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that Singapore authorities have no legal jurisdiction over the board and management of Chinese companies, who are often based in China. These companies are also not registered in Singapore, but in places such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, where regulators find it hard to enforce court rulings.\n\nAfter so many instances of S-chip scares or failures over the past few years, some brokers here appear to have given up covering them altogether. Right after the China Minzhong fallout, a local broking house ceased its coverage on the S-chip sector, with an analyst noting that the time and resources needed to do detailed forensic research on China Minzhong to ascertain the truth behind the Glaucus allegations was beyond his reach.\n\nSumming up investor sentiment, he wrote: \"We believe the lack of accountability by S-chip management makes it a weak investment case for S-chip investors in Singapore, notwithstanding their attractive growth prospects and valuations.\"\n\nBuying China A-shares through an index fund\n\nThe \"attractive growth prospects and valuations\" the analyst cited, nevertheless, might describe the situation for many Chinese stocks. Negative investor sentiment can often be an opportunity. The top 50 stocks on the Shanghai exchange by market cap and liquidity trade at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of eight, while the top 300 stocks on the Shenzhen exchange trade at a PE ratio of 11.\n\nJust a few months ago, Chinese banks were trading at around or below their book values, with dividend yields of over 6 per cent and PEs of around five. Some are still trading at these values today.\n\nIn comparison, the Straits Times Index in Singapore comprising the top 30 stocks here is trading at a PE ratio of 13. Other equivalent regional indices in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are trading at around 15 to 16 times PE.\n\nThose who do not want to take the risk of an individual China stock can look at investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They invest in a range of stocks and allow an investor to diversify away the risk that an individual company will fail.\n\nOn SGX, these include the United SSE 50 China ETF, quoted in Singapore dollars, which tracks the 50 largest and most liquid A-share stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and the db X-trackers (dbxt) CSI 300, quoted in US dollars, which tracks the 300 largest and most liquid A-share stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\n\nFund sizes and fees vary. The United ETF has a total size of S$51 million at end-September and a management fee of 0.45 per cent per annum, while the dbxt ETF has total fund assets of US$908 million at end-September and an all-in fee of 0.5 per cent per annum.\n\nThese ETFs are classified as specified investment products. This means that they are deemed more complex for the retail investor to understand, hence investors have to be approved by their broker to buy them - after filling in a form about one's financial qualifications or passing a test designed by SGX.\n\nThe largest and most liquid China A-share ETF in the market is the Hong Kong-listed iShares FTSE A50 China Index, with total net assets of HK$53.8 billion (S$8.6 billion) at end-September and a management fee of 0.99 per cent per annum.\n\nOther considerations\n\nIn sourcing for a good China ETF to invest in, investors have to think about what stocks these ETFs are tracking.\n\nETFs tracking the Shanghai index have a higher allocation to financial stocks. If there is a domestic banking crisis, they will be affected.\n\nThe United SSE 50 China ETF, at end-September, has 66.4 per cent of its assets in financials, with the largest holdings in the fund being China Minsheng Banking Corp, China Merchants Bank, Industrial Bank and Ping An Insurance.\n\nThe dbxt CSI 300 ETF, meanwhile, has a slightly more balanced asset weighting, with 39 per cent allocated to financials at end-September, with a similar top five holdings as the United ETF.\n\nOther general issues with buying ETFs that investors have to take into consideration include tracking error, fees, foreign currency risk and their use of derivatives.\n\nH-shares, S-chips and other stocks\n\nThose with a bigger risk appetite can consider investing in individual China stocks listed on the HKSE. These H-shares can be bought through local brokers. The sidebar details some interesting ones. There are also ETFs tracking H-shares.\n\nAnd then there are the local stocks. Singapore has more than 100 S-chips, or Chinese companies listed on SGX.\n\nThere are also Singaporean companies doing a significant part of their business in China, such as property developer CapitaLand.\n\nInvestors can also make a bet on the Chinese yuan itself. We will cover these issues in future articles.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Debbie Yong checks in on them\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nThe Provision Shop\n\nBlk 3 Everton Park, #01-79 Tel: 6225 9931\n\nHours: 11am-9pm daily\n\nVINTAGE formica dining tables: check. A pulley-operated Milo tin bucket holding spare change: check. A creaky old toilet door: check.\n\nAt first glance, The Provision Shop (TPS) has got all the trappings of the sundry-peddling \"mamak shops\" you typically find in the void decks of HDB blocks. But look again and you'll quickly discover that it's really a gourmet deli in disguise.\n\nThe 30-seater week-old eatery tucked amid the idyllic Everton Park cluster of HDB blocks is the latest addition to the Unlisted Collection stable of boutique hotels and eateries - and an offshoot of the group's Cocotte restaurant in its Little India hotel, Wanderlust.\n\nExplains Cocotte's head chef, Anthony Yeoh, who spearheaded the $90,000 venture together with the group's general manager of hotels, Charmaine Wee, and operations manager, Florence Guang: \"Our head office is in nearby Chinatown, where we were always pining for a place that would sell gourmet sandwiches and other quick takeaway lunches.\" It was a \"semi-entrepreneurial project\" for the trio, in a way, as Unlisted Collection's head honcho, Loh Lik Peng, merely took a consulting role in the setting-up process.\n\nWhile big sister Cocotte is a classic French bistro, TPS combs together Italian, American and even Polish influences. Menu highlights include a hearty Reuben sandwich ($10/$16) packed with chunks of corned beef and sauerkraut, and a rich, roasty tomato soup ($5).\n\nThere are less commonly found dishes too, such as Belinda's Pierogies ($5), a nod to Mr Yeoh's Sydney-based half-Polish half-sister, Belinda, who helped out with the branding for the store, and the sea-salt lemonade ($6), which has a dash of salt stirred in to temper the drink's acidic edge. Requests for Cocotte's signature roast chicken have been coming fast and furious, so Mr Yeoh may introduce it in the form of a sandwich soon. Sandwiches come in two sizes and all of the cafe's salads, sandwiches and soups can be packed to go.\n\nAt 650 sq ft, TPS is a fraction of the space occupied by 70-seat Cocotte. \"The Provision Shop is just about the size of our kitchen at Cocotte,\" laughs Mr Yeoh. But the space constraints mean the team had to be more creative in their kitchen and menu planning. \"It's tempting to buy everything ready made, as most smaller outfits do, but that's usually where it goes wrong,\" he says. Like at Cocotte, everything is made in-house as far as possible, from the pastas, ice creams and salad dressing to the delicious cherry compote in its brie and ham sandwich ($10/$18).\n\n\"The slight difference is that we try to use more simplified language to describe our food here, so we call things jams instead of compotes or coulis, for example,\" says Mr Yeoh. Not surprising then, that on a quiet weekday afternoon, the estate's aged residents can be be spotted sipping an afternoon coffee next to laptop-wielding creative types in the cafe. \"You can't bulldoze your way through a new neighbourhood without caring for the existing community. We want to service the residents too,\" says Mr Yeoh.\n\nAfter he found out from a friend that a wellness centre in the same block is popular with people seeking treatment for their gluten allergies, for instance, Mr Yeoh came up with a flourless \"blueberry cheesecake\" cake, now sold at the deli.\n\nAnd, as a throwback to another heritage neighbourhood in Singapore, TPS's toilet door was salvaged from heritage Tiong Bahru wonton mee shop, Hua Bee, where the group will be debuting their wonton mee-by-day and yakitori-bar-by-night concept, Bincho, later this month.\n\nThe Beast\n\n17 Jalan Klapa Tel: 6295 0017\n\nHours: 5pm-1am (Mon-Thu), 5pm-2am (Fri-Sat)\n\nIS it us or has Singapore's restaurant scene gotten a little animal-crazy lately? Hot on the heels of nose-to-tail restaurant, Wolf, on Gemmill Lane comes an even more savage peer: The Beast.\n\nBut there are will be no grisly bits of wild animals served here. Instead, The Beast is really an informal southern American kitchen and specialty bourbon whiskey bar - and sister outlet to Chupitos, a Spanish-inspired shots bar in Clarke Quay.\n\nSays the mastermind behind both projects, Jamie Koh, who started Chupitos in 2010 after winning the inaugural Martell VSOP The Ultimate Start-up Space competition: \"I got restless. I wanted to open something else, but I didn't want to do another Chupitos, because there isn't enough of a market in Singapore for another shots bar.\"\n\nChupitos itself took a hiatus last year when Ms Koh took time off to travel around the world as well as open a bar in Ho Chi Minh City. She has since sold her shares in the Vietnam venture and re-opened Chupitos in a different space within Clark Quay in February.\n\n\"I don't believe in simply replicating a brand in shopping malls. I like to create new concepts and I always have a few ideas in my mind inspired by things I've seen on my travels, but it's about finding the right concept for a particular space,\" she adds.\n\nWhen Ms Koh came across the 4,000 sq ft, three-storey shophouse in Kampong Glam in the middle of the year, the first thought that struck her was how much the building - with its high-ceilinged loft level - resembled an animal barn.\n\nThus, The Beast's quirky name and barn-inspired layout. She elaborates: \"The first floor of an animal barn is usually the playground for the animals, where they eat, drink and play.\" Plugged into the first floor, thus, is a casual 30-seater bar with an alfresco corridor for 50, where diners can graze on hearty snacks typical of the American South such as bourbon-glazed ribs and honey bourbon wings.\n\nThe space will also be Singapore's first bourbon bar, as it will carry more than 30 types of bourbon whiskey. Popular labels of American whiskey such as Wild Turkey or Maker's Mark will be tapped from the six large wood barrels that sit behind the bar, while an upper shelf will hold five types of barrel-aged whiskey cocktails such as Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.\n\nThe second floor is typically used for food storage in animal barns, hence it will be the setting for The Beast's 30-seater dining area. On the highest floor - where farm equipment is usually stored - a private event space with a kitchenette on the highest floor will open in a few weeks.\n\nFood-wise, expect Southern comfort fare such as shrimp and grits, chicken waffles and pecan pie, with flourishes such as a home-made bacon bourbon jam. Mains will range between $20 and $30, and cocktails start at $18.\n\nThe food direction arose from Ms Koh's unsatiated cravings ever since the alumna of Emory University moved home from Atlanta, Georgia a few years ago. Recipes for some of the dishes are based on grandmother's recipes contributed by some of her former university mates.\n\nAnd lest you fear it all descends into theme park-esque barnyard tackiness, Ms Koh assures there will be no plastic bulls or cowboy hats around. Instead, deep red cushioned chairs and dark wood panels accented by vintage lamps and rusted oil drums keep things chic, yet comfortable.\n\nMs Koh shares with a grin: \"'Unleash the beast' is the restaurant's informal slogan - we want people to come in, be themselves and have a good time.\"\n\nCafe Ergo Sum\n\n13 Duxton Hill Tel: 6327 9153\n\nHours: 9am-midnight, Mon-Fri\n\nAFTER uprooting from Market Street to Republic Plaza and again to Far East Square earlier this year, three-year-old sandwich bar, Smoke Shack, has finally found a site to launch its flagship outlet.\n\nCafe Ergo Sum takes over the Duxton Hill shophouse unit recently vacated by mod-Sin restaurant, Wok & Barrel, and the new space carries over all of Smoke Shack's popular signature items such as breakfast bagels, English muffins and sandwiches - all filled with meats smoked in-house.\n\nBut the menu will be augmented to also include pastries and Toby's Estate coffee in the mornings and more substantial dinner items such as pastas featuring smoked duck, scallops and prosciutto, alongside chilled soups with smoked toppings. Mains will range from $20 to $30.\n\nTo cater to the Duxton area's after-work drinks crowd, Smoke Shack founder Nick Iman has also roped in an in-house mixologist, Sofian Rahim, who has put in stints as a beverage manager at Bar-Roque Grill and the now-defunct Keystone restaurant to shake up a mix of classic cocktails and signature creations. Bar snacks with Spanish and Asian inflections such as croquettes, chicken wings and bruschettas will be served in the evenings.\n\n\"Unlike in Raffles Place, where it's all about speed, Duxton has a more relaxed vibe - people don't mind lingering over a coffee after lunch or a cocktail after work, so service will be laid-back too,\" says Mr Iman. Likewise, to encourage a convivial atmosphere, the 45-seater comprises two long communal tables that seat up to 20 each, plus 10 outdoor seats.\n\nSetting up a flagship outlet \"has always been an intention\" according to Mr Iman, but he wanted to seek out a suitable location, rather than rush into it. At 1,200 sq ft, the Duxton outlet is more than triple the size of his 400 sq ft sandwich counter in Far East Square, which will continue operating.\n\nWhile staffing is a challenge, Mr Iman gamely concedes that it is one that is \"part of the territory; I knew what I was getting into when I entered the F&B industry\". On a visit during opening week this week, the former private banker can be seen rolling up his sleeves to cook and serve customers personally. Still, he laughingly states: \"Compared to banking, this is less stressful.\"\n\nThe cafe's interiors were a personal labour of love, too. A giant wall mural by the entrance depicting an artwork from Henri Matisse's jazz album was handpainted by Mr Iman himself, while the books, jazz records and a vintage record player that kit out the rest of the space are from his personal collection.\n\nOf the name change, he says: \"People already know Smoke Shack as a sandwich shop, so if I start serving dinner and drinks, it might lead to an identity crisis.\"\n\nErgo Sum, on the other hand, means \"Therefore I am\" in Latin, \"because these are things that I like and which define who I am, and I hope that other people will find interesting too,\" he says.\n\nMarukyu\n\n116 Telok Ayer Street Tel: 6636 5608\n\nHours: 11am-10pm, Mon-Sat\n\nSOME people venture into the F&B business because it's their long-held dream to cook or run a restaurant, others do so when opportunity unexpectedly throws up a plum spot of real estate.\n\nWhen bespoke apparel designer Chong Han San found out that the tenant of the 1,200 sq ft unit below his second-floor studio on Telok Ayer Street was moving out a few months ago, he quickly roped in cousin-turned-business partner, Danny Chong, and moved in on the spot. After all, the CBD shophouse stretch has a ready catchment of daily diners and with Telok Ayer MRT station on the Downtown Line set to open on Dec 22, the area looks set to get even hotter.\n\nIdeas for new businesses such as a nail spa, sleeping pods or a massage parlour were tossed up, \"but we didn't feel passionate about any of them, until the idea of doing a restaurant was brought up\", says Mr Chong.\n\nSo the duo roped in local chef Derrick Lau, a 17-year veteran of the food industry who previously worked at Nadaman in the Shangri-La Hotel and later set up his own Japanese restaurant, Dezato, on Boat Quay, where the cousins were regular diners.\n\nThus, Marukyu was born. Maru means \"circle\" in Japanese, and the kyu suffix was chosen as a homophone for Q Menswear, the name of Han San's bespoke tailoring outfit. He also runs uniform tailoring business, Qu Division.\n\nAt the 48-seater Marukyu (there's also a private room for seven), chef Lau dishes out creations such as milk custard, truffle-inflected scallops, homemade umeshu and a selection of plump sashimi made from seafood that they claim is air-flown from Tokyo and Kyushu daily.\n\nHan San, meanwhile, focuses on the creative aspects of the business such as the restaurant's Zen-minimalist interior design, while Danny, who has a day job in banking, manages the accounts.\n\nLunch sets cost $68 and up and omakase dinners start at $108, and include luxe treats such as A5 Ohmi wagyu beef, a broth of Asari clams and Hokkaido snow crab legs topped with spicy mentaiko.\n\nRather than charging premium prices, Marukyu is targeted at those \"looking to make the jump from your regular mid-tier Japanese restaurant chains to an upscale omakase-only restaurant, but without the steep jump in their bills\", he adds.\n\n\"Bespoke fashion is what I do, and omakase is a culinary extension of that, where you leave it to the chef to design your meal,\" says Han San, who hopes to open more Japanese dining outlets such as a shabu shabu or yakitori joint with chef Lau if all goes well.\n\n\"Whether in fashion or in F&B, our ultimate aim is to make sure the customer leaves satisfied. If there's anything at all they are unhappy with, we will fix it immediately.\"\n\nThe Maison Ikkoku@Gillman Barracks\n\nBlk 39 Malan Road\n\nTel: 6294 0078\n\nHours: 9am-5pm Sat-Sun (cafe), 6pm to late, Fri-Sat (bar). From Nov to Jan 2014\n\nIT'S about time. Kandahar Street cafe-cum-cocktail bar, Maison Ikkoku, has been so busy packing in the hipster crowd for its past two years of operations that we're almost not surprised to hear that they are thinking of expanding.\n\nFrom today onwards, fans of Maison Ikkoku's homemade cakes, speciality coffees or bespoke cocktail concoctions can now get their fix from the outfit's second outlet in Gillman Barracks.\n\nOperated on a pop-up basis for now, the cafe-cum-cocktail bar is part of The U Factory, a three-month pop-up concept that will run from today till January next year.\n\nModelled on Andy Warhol's Factory concept from the 1960s and driven by creative consultancy Hjgher, The U Factory will also incorporate other elements such as a pop-up retail store by global lifestyle magazine, Monocle; a retail gallery by Creative Cultures showing made-in-Singapore designs; and a home bakers' studio by-day and laksa bar-by-night concept by home-grown F&B company, Preparazzi.\n\n\"The area has such fresh green scenery, we felt that it would be perfectly complemented with the smell of freshly brewed coffee in the day, and cocktails made with fresh herbs at night,\" says Maison Ikkoku's business development director and head mixologist, Ethan Leslie Leong. \"The idea is to give people the feeling of being on a short getaway, while still remaining in the centre of Singapore.\"\n\nMaison Ikkoku will launch at its new outlet the Vaara, a cocktail created exclusively in partnership with English perfumery Penhaligon's, and served in a martini glass with a miniature Aladdin's lamp and a scented handkerchief alongside.\n\nThe cafe, meanwhile, will feature a pared down menu comprising its best-sellers such as eggs benedict, and cupcakes and cakes in a jar in flavours such as s'mores, red velvet, nutella and rainbow caramel. A single brew bar will dole out Ethiopian Aramo coffee dripped through a Chemex filter while a rotating selection of single-origin coffees will be featured each week.\n\nThe cocktail bar began operations as a standing-room-only bar from yesterday, while additional seats and cafe operations will only be introduced from The U Factory's official launch next Thursday.\n\nPrices will be slightly cheaper at the new outlet, with cocktails costing between $16 and $25, and food from $8 to $18. The 1,200 sq ft outlet can hold 40 inside and 20 outdoors.\n\n\"We've planned for a second outlet for about a year now, before this space came by. I've started to train my stall for it,\" says Mr Leong. Half of Maison Ikkoku's bar staff will be deployed to the Gillman Barracks outlet.\n\nThe team is still looking for a venue for permanent expansion, ideally a lofty warehouse space where they can use the commercial coffee-roaster the team has already bought, and which offers potential to branch out into the coffee wholesale business, adds Mr Leong.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/transport-logistics/airbus-boeing-row-over-width-seats-long-haul-flights", "site_title": "Airbus, Boeing in row over width of seats on long-haul flights", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAirbus, Boeing in row over width of seats on long-haul flights\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[PARIS] A row has flared up between leading planemakers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a bitter confrontation at this month's Dubai Airshow.\n\nThe dispute focuses on the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for economy passengers - not always the ones most courted by airlines, but whose allocated space holds the key to efficiency claims for the latest jets offered by Airbus and Boeing.\n\nAirbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide for a seat at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide in economy cabins, but its US arch-rival Boeing said that it should be for airlines to decide.\n\nThe dispute comes as planemakers vie to sell ever-larger versions of their twin-engined long-distance aircraft, with potentially record orders expected at the Nov 17-21 event.\n\nHow the back of the plane is laid out - particularly whether seating is nine or 10 abreast - is central to the economic performance claims being made for new \"mini-jumbo\" jet designs.\n\nBoeing said that its revamped 777X will hold 406 people based on economy seats over 17 inches wide and set out 10 in each row.\n\nAirbus said that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 18-inch-wide economy seat laid out nine abreast.\n\nPlane giants often trade blows on technical matters through advertising in the trade press. Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with over 100 orders.\n\nIt recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled \"Would You Accept This?\"\n\n\"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props,\" said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.\n\nAs diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.\n\nBetween the early 1970s - when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel - and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to US Health Department data.\n\nThe waist of the average 21st century American male is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics, which equates to a diameter of 12.6 inches. This leaves two inches either side in many plane seats, which are narrower than at an average cinema.\n\nAirbus said that is not enough for long-haul travel and that its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened \"jet set\" was narrower.\n\nAirbus said that it has commissioned research suggesting that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.\n\nBoeing disputed Airbus' figures on seat measurements, and said that it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities. It also said that research shows that cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.\n\n\"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful,\" said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.\n\n\"They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable. They know their business better than anyone else.\"\n\nFor flyers, it is about more elbow room; but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.\n\nBehind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least US$700 billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of US and European exports.\n\nAs Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.\n\nBoth Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-\n\n300ER.\n\nBoeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original nine-abreast 777 design. The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.\n\n\"The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products,\" said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts said that full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest that many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.\n\n\"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,\" said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.\n\nAirbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from. Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.\n\nWhile boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel. Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but said that it has not yet sold it.\n\nUntil recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customisation by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.\n\nWithout the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts said that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Return on equity fell to 10.5 per cent from 11.2 per cent a year ago and 10.9 per cent for Q2.\n\nFor the nine months, net profit was up 4 per cent at $2.7 billion. Q3 net interest income or the core lending business rose to a record $1.41 billion, up 6 per cent yoy and 2 per cent qoq as loans grew 19 per cent yoy to $245 billion and 3 per cent qoq.\n\nNon-interest income of $744 million was up 11 per cent yoy but fell 20 per cent qoq due to volatile markets in September.\n\n\"We basically got the call on Fed tapering wrong,\" said DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta on the non-interest income quarterly fall at the bank's Q3 results presentation.\n\nThe market had expected the US Federal Reserve to begin pulling back on its quantitative easing or bond purchases in September and when it didn't happen, bond prices rallied.\n\n\"We pared down some of our Treasury holdings in the long-end and took out hedges for some of our Treasury positions. Clearly when the Fed didn't taper . . . the hedges . . . went out of the money,\" he said. September trading income fell to $32 million, from the monthly average of $95 million for Q2.\n\nThe third quarter's bright spot came from stronger-than-expected loans growth which helped cushion the drop in net interest margins (NIM) to 1.60 from 1.62 for Q2 and 1.67 a year ago. NIM is what the bank makes from lending out its deposits.\n\nDBS had earlier expected loans to grow 2 per cent for Q3 but they came in at a stronger 3 per cent, and which was broad based across trade, Singapore corporates and mortgages, said Mr Gupta. For the nine months since December last year, loans rose 13 per cent and now the bank expects full year 2013 loans growth at 15 per cent, he said.\n\nFor 2014, loans should grow 8-10 per cent, he said.\n\n\"Our business in Singapore, you look at the last couple of years, we've been able to gain market share on both the business side and the consumer side; so it's a very broad based performance.\"\n\nThe bank's market share of business loans in Singapore has gone up by three percentage points over the last three years, he said.\n\nIts share of the home loans market has also risen amid an almost 30 per cent drop in new bookings, he said. Mortgages were up $1 billion on the quarter.\n\nIn particular, DBS has gained from a new HDB home loan programme launched in April this year where the interest charged on the loan is capped below the HDB concessionary rate, he said.\n\n\"Today, almost 40 per cent of our HDB bookings are coming under the new loan programme . . . it has allowed us to actually suffer less losses than the market, it's also a better price programme,\" said Mr Gupta.\n\n\"The HDB consumer gets a much lower rate than they get from the HDB, but we get an improvement in our NIM, relative to the rest of the portfolio.\"\n\nOn next year's outlook, he said that he was surprised by the optimism of the Europeans from a board meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Washington he attended last month. \"I'm struck by the optimism of the Europeans . . . when Europe moves from minus-one to one per cent (growth), that 2 per cent delta is significant to the global economy,\" he said.\n\nThe eurozone is Singapore's single biggest trading partner.\n\nHe said that United States growth could be more challenging next year than what people might expect, while China's growth estimates of 7.5 per cent could be sustained.\n\nTo questions on whether DBS is bidding for the private banking arm of Societe-Generale, he said that it would not be appropriate to talk about Soc-Gen or any other acquisitions.\n\n\"We're open to acquisitions . . . if they're aligned to our stratgy,\" he said. \"Hypothetically, a private bank portfolio which is Asian centric . . . is interesting for us to look at.\"\n\nDBS Group is among banks reported to have advanced in bidding for Soc-Gen's private banking assets in Asia.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, DBS shares fell six cents to $16.68.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SIOW LI SEN reports\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE US Federal Reserve is likely to begin tapering only in the second half of 2014 as the US economy remains sluggish, said Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs president and chief operating officer.\n\nLast week, following the release of what some in the market saw as a \"hawkish\" statement from the Fed, they are saying tapering or slowing down monetary stimulus could begin in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nBut Mr Cohn thinks the US economy remains in poor shape and the budget problems in Washington make it worse, so tapering is unlikely until next summer.\n\n\"I think the US is in a tough spot . . . the consumer in the United States is delevered . . . there is capacity in the consumer side,\" said Mr Cohn in a recent interview with The Business Times.\n\n\"You look at corporates in the US, basically corporates in the world are in phenomenally good shape, they've got more cash on their balance sheet than they've had in a long period of time,\" he said.\n\n\"They've been able to borrow more money than they need so corporate balance sheets around the world are flush with cash which is a very good thing for the economy to see economic growth,\" he said.\n\nBut the lack of progress over the budget in Washington is frustrating, he said.\n\nNew York-based Mr Cohn comes to Singapore three to four times a year to meet clients and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and last week's interview was the first time a senior Goldman Sachs executive has met the local media in over a decade.\n\nClients wanted to hear his views on the United States.\n\nFounded in 1869, Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest US bank by assets, is a giant in the investment bank space. It has no retail business and regularly hogs the No 1 position for mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and equity issues.\n\nIn order to drive the US economy forward, among the things Washington can help business with is work on corporate tax reform, immigration reform and figuring out what to do with offshore money, he said.\n\n\"Unfortunately we're in a bit of a conundrum where the fundamental economy wants to grow, it's in pretty good shape and we need some leadership out of Washington and I'm not optimistic how soon we'll get that leadership, but we're all anxiously waiting for it to happen,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, while the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.2 per cent, the US is not really creating enough jobs, he said. The unemployment rate is down because the participation rate - the amount of people looking for jobs - has declined to a 35-year low, he noted.\n\nThe published data which the Fed uses as a trigger for beginning to taper is messy due to the government shutdown last month and also skewed by the upcoming holiday season.\n\n\"I still believe the Fed is not going to be in a position to taper until sometime next year,\" he said.\n\n\"We have the government shutdown in the third quarter, so third-quarter numbers are going to be skewed, fourth-quarter numbers are always sort of messy for the year end effect - the holiday shopping.\n\n\"You may not even get clean economic numbers in the United States until March, and so I think the Fed's on hold through the first quarter of next year; more realistically it could be summertime before we see them talking of tapering.\"\n\nOn the business in Asia, he said it is very important to the firm though he did not provide a revenue breakdown as the firm does not look at its contributions geographically.\n\nIts business here has expanded rapidly over the last couple of years. Headcount of 800 has tripled in the last three years and the strongest growth was in the private wealth business which was up 40 per cent over the year, he said.\n\nThe firm looks at how it performs vis-a-vis its rivals, hence the importance of league tables.\n\n\"Our business in Asia is very important to the firm,\" he said. \"When at the end of the year I look at the global league tables, I look at the M&A league tables, I look at the equity capital market league tables, I look at the debt capital market league tables, I look on a global basis how are we doing.\"\n\nWhat's important is that Goldman Sach is in the biggest deals, he said.\n\nThe firm classifies business by the way it earns the revenue, he said.\n\n\"For me it's important that we're involved in the most important and the biggest transactions in the world.\n\n\"And I think we're thriving at that and to be out there in the biggest and most important transactions, you have to have a global footprint today,\" he said.\n\nClients are very global today and those in emerging markets move very quickly, he said.\n\n\"They're becoming more and more global, our clients are expanding their footprint in new markets all the time, and we're never quite sure which markets they're looking to expand into.\n\n\"A year or two ago, one of the big flows was China to Brazil, today China to Brazil flows, as far as corporate activity has slowed down dramatically.\n\n\"If you don't have a strategy that allows you to have a global footprint and a presence on the ground in each of these markets, you aren't prepared to deal with the shifts in the market.\"\n\nThe shifts happen relatively quickly in the more volatile emerging and growth markets and one cannot overreact, or end up missing the business, he said.\n\n\"You have to keep your footprint relatively steady . . . you can't be trying to modulate your footprint size based on the market, we have learned that through trial and error,\" he said.\n\nIts Singapore business covers global interest rate products, currencies, commodities trading, advisory businesses, asset management and private wealth.\n\nGoldman does not have a foreign exchange (FX) trading desk in Singapore though it is considering setting up one, he said.\n\nOn this trip, Mr Cohn did talk to the MAS about setting up a FX trading desk here.\n\nSingapore is the world's third-largest FX centre, behind London and New York.\n\nIt used to be fourth, behind Tokyo.\n\n\"We're always trying to figure out how to serve our clients better, we're aware of trends in the market.\n\n\"And if more of the foreign exchange volume has moved to Singapore which the latest data shows, we're not ignoring the data,\" he said.\n\nThe Singapore office is expected to grow 5 per cent and it has stepped up recruitment from the three local universities as Goldman diversifies hiring and not just look at candidates from the US Ivy League schools.\n\nWorldwide, it has about 32,000 people and it hires about 2,300 to 2,400 fresh graduates to its much-envied analyst programme.\n\nThis year, it hired 83 graduates from universities (both undergraduate and graduate programmes) for the Singapore office. Of that, 45 or 54 per cent were graduates from Singapore universities.\n\nlisen@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A remarkable feat on its own, it's even more memorable given that Kerridge has been garnering such acclaim for staying true to his convictions as a chef who believes in serving down-to-earth, unpretentious food in equally modest surroundings.\n\n\"These are all incredible accolades and ones that I am very proud of,\" says the affable British chef who is in town from tonight to give diners a second helping of, as he likes to call it, \"proper pub food\" - which is also the name of his cookbook and TV show.\n\n\"The book and television has gone hand in hand,\" he adds, \"and it's an honour that the BBC have asked me to be involved in this.\" Besides gaining in popularity, the show has also helped him to achieve a wider aim which is \"to showcase British pubs, which is something that is very close to my heart\".\n\nHe says that he was approached to take part in 4XFour by Darren Chen, executive director of Savour Events, which made its debut last year at the F1 Pit Building as a pop-up, upscale gourmet funfair which saw visiting and local chefs serving up their signature dishes fast-food style. This year's 20-day event will take place in a fully fitted out, temporary restaurant built on Bayfront Avenue, next to Marina Bay Sands.\n\n\"Having been to Singapore before, I thought it would be a great opportunity to showcase British food and what we do here at The Hand and Flowers,\" says chef Kerridge. \"And a great chance for a couple of my guys to experience the delights of another part of the world.\"\n\nSince this is his second stint in Singapore, \"we are a little more organised, the menu is structured a little better and the food is simplified\", says the chef. While gutsy, hearty flavours are the cornerstone of pub cooking, there's no fear of being overwhelmed by the food in Singapore's hot climate. \"The recipes are scaled down to still be big, strong and rich, and designed to be over a four- or eight-course meal. You should leave the table feeling that you have eaten something proper. The produce available in Singapore is growing from strength to strength, so I'm confident we'll be able to showcase our two Michelin star standard of food in a not so conventional setting but with a similar experience.\"\n\nGiven that all the dinner seats for chef Kerridge's stint from today till Nov 13 are sold out (with only some lunch seats available on Wednesday and Thursday), anticipation is high, and chef Kerridge is more than up to the task. Fame may be a by-product of his efforts but food is still what drives him.\n\n\"Who knows what the future holds - as long as it's fun and food-related, I'll be a happy guy!\"\n\nTom Kerridge cooks from today until Nov 13.

Cisco has the vision and savvy to help our Academy's young scientists and Nobel Prize winners inspire children throughout the world on an unprecedented scale - through the application of the IoT.\"\n\nThe Global STEM Alliance will allow for the seamless integration of technology and content - effectively linking the New York Academy of Sciences' local programmes to locations around the world through in-person and online platforms.\n\n\"This partnership will enable sharing of knowledge resources to every corner of the world - humanising science, through the use of technology, by connecting science-interested people of all ages across geographic boundaries,\" Mr Elfrink said.\n\nHe added that the Cisco Networking Academy programme will help individuals prepare for globally recognised certifications and entry-level ICT careers in virtually every type of industry.\n\n\"Courses are offered in multiple languages through a blended learning model that combines classroom instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities, and online assessments.

This will work to the advantage of tanker operators with ships already on the water.\n\nSome of these are privately owned, such as Fairfield Chemical Carriers Inc, Navig8 Chemicals, Nordic Tankers and Tokio Marine Asia Pte Ltd, an affiliate of insurer Tokio Marine Holdings Inc.

Or as the firm whose traders were said to have misled investors by selling them, as one memorable internal e-mail described it, 'junk that nobody was dumb enough to take first time around'. Now Goldman wants to give something back,\" NYT said.\n\n\"Engaging wasn't just the right thing, it was necessary, especially in the wake of the financial crisis when people said we weren't doing enough,\" said John F W Rogers, Goldman's chief of staff and a driving force behind the bank's philanthropic efforts.\n\n\"Our most senior people, our partners, part of their compensation package is paid to them in what we call 'GS Gives', which are philanthropic dollars,\" said Mr Cohn.\n\n\"Literally, we take it out of their compensation, we put it into an account, we say you can give this money to wherever you want but you need to personally give it away,\" said Mr Cohn.\n\nThe firm's current and retired partners began donating part of their compensation since 2007 through a fund called Goldman Sachs Gives.\n\n\"A big chunk of the money we've given over the years is out of personal giving, out of our partners' pay cheques,\" he said.\n\nDeclining to disclose the portion which is donated, Mr Cohn said: \"It's a decent per cent.\"\n\nAnd even though US$680 million has been given, there's plenty more to be given away, he said.\n\nThe company's corporate philanthropy efforts centre on two major projects - helping 10,000 small businesses and 10,000 women.\n\nLaunched in 2008, \"10,000 Women\" is a five-year, US$100 million initiative to help grow local economies by providing 10,000 under-served women entrepreneurs with a business and management education, access to mentors and networks, and links to capital.\n\nGoldman followed up in 2009 with a US$500 million programme to help 10,000 small businesses with resources that they need to grow and create jobs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite talk of a bubble, investors unwilling to jump onto the buyers' bandwagon can still take bets on property developers themselves.\n\nJubilee Industries Holdings - formerly loss-making plastic injection mould producer JLJ Holdings - appears poised to be the latest intriguing Iskandar play on Singapore Exchange.\n\nA proposed reverse takeover (RTO) announced in mid-October will see Singaporean businessman Dennis Ng inject Tenderside Ventures, a subsidiary of his Malaysian property development company Jewelstone Properties, into Catalyst-quoted Jubilee.\n\nThe deal gives a well-connected and established family a foothold in a listed entity in Singapore.\n\nMr Ng is executive director of United Malayan Land (UMLand), of which his father, Ng Eng Tee, is deputy chairman and also executive director.\n\nUMLand, a Johor-based property developer with decades of track record, was an associate company of property giant CapitaLand and listed on Bursa Malaysia. It was privatised last year by the elder Mr Ng and his business partner, Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary, a well-connected bumiputera entrepreneur who is said to have close relationship with the current Malaysian political leadership. UMLand also has an undeveloped land bank of about 810 hectares in Johor, according to media reports.\n\nTenderside will be acquired by Jubilee for RM150 million (S$59 million) through an issue of new Jubilee shares to Jewelstone. The deal, which will boost Jubilee's issued shares to around 508 million, will result in Tenderside gaining a 54 per cent stake in Jubilee.\n\nRising condo prices\n\nAnd here's where it gets interesting.\n\nTenderside owns a 60 per cent stake in Viridea Lakeside Sdn Bhd. Viridea will acquire the Viridea @ Medini Lakeside project in Johor on roughly three hectares of land. For comparison, the Medini area comprises 890 hectares of land. The estimated gross development value of the mostly residential project, or what it can be sold for when completed, is RM800 million. Out of that, a profit before tax of RM300 million is expected to be generated, out of which 60 per cent or RM180 million will be guaranteed to Jubilee.\n\nThis guaranteed profit before tax works out to about 14 cents a share.\n\nInvestors and developers, however, have some concerns about Iskandar plays.\n\nNumerous aggressive launches of high-rise condominiums have pushed prices to Kuala Lumpur property levels.\n\nOn Oct 25, the Malaysian government's budget included measures to cool the property market that is fast rising out of the reach of ordinary Malaysians.\n\nNotably, a 30 per cent real property gains tax will be levied on gains on property disposed within five years. The minimum price for foreigners to buy a Malaysian property will also go up to RM1 million from RM500,000.\n\nDevelopers in Medini, however, have a unique advantage.\n\nThe area is a special zone in Iskandar that is exempt from price caps and bumiputera quotas which can affect developer profits - a deal introduced several years ago to attract foreign investment. Developers there also enjoy various income tax incentives.\n\nMedini is also a short 10-minute drive from the Second Link connecting Johor to Singapore, so investors who prefer to live there have quick and convenient access to the Republic.\n\nIskandar's planners envisage Medini to be a commercial and business district, with malls, offices, high-end homes and a hospital. Theme park Legoland is located just a stone's throw away.\n\nNot surprisingly, properties there have been selling like hot cakes. In June, Afiniti Residences, a 147-unit wellness themed condominium project that is a joint venture between Temasek Holdings and counterpart Khazanah Nasional, was sold out on launch day. Selling prices for the project, located beside Legoland, were RM850 to RM1,000 per square foot.\n\nHow much might Jubilee be worth?\n\nThe company's last reported net asset value by end-June was 19.6 cents, before the completion of a deal that saw former Novena Holdings CEO Toh Soon Huat lead a group of investors to inject $15 million into the company.\n\nRTO process\n\nMr Toh and company bought in at 15.4 cents a share then. On Oct 29, he bought another 750,000 shares at an average price of 17.7 cents.\n\nMeanwhile, the company placed out shares to Jewelstone at 22 cents each.\n\nCurrently, the company is trading at around 17 to 18 cents. Support might be found around the 15 cents level that Mr Toh originally bought in for, giving opportunities to investors if prices fall to or below that.\n\nInvestors, however, have to note that the RTO process usually takes around half a year, and there is never a guarantee that any takeover will go through.\n\nAny investment in Jubilee - or in similar Iskandar developer plays such as Rowsley and Albedo - is also a bet on the long-term economic sustainability and political stability of the Iskandar region. Sentiment in Iskandar property might already be affected after Malaysia's latest budget measures. Also, the next few years could see more supply come up on both sides of the Causeway. Then there is the prospect of a potential tightening of US monetary policy.\n\nThat said, Medini enjoys special exemptions from the Malaysian authorities.\n\nIf and when the RTO goes through, Jubilee will need to build and sell its residential project fast.\n\nAlthough the company could be vulnerable to short-term fluctuations in share prices in the event of a property market downturn, with the UMLand pedigree behind it, Jubilee is a long-term play. This is a company worth watching in the years to come.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A separate final PMI index published by HSBC and Markit rose to a seven-month high of 50.9.\n\nWhile both surveys breached the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, they gave differing readings on new orders and new export orders - falling in the official PMI and rising in the HSBC/Markit PMI. The official PMI is weighted more towards bigger and state-owned enterprises, while the HSBC/Markit survey focuses more on smaller and private-sector firms.\n\nBoth sets of data point to a stabilisation of the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"This upbeat headline official PMI supports our view that steady growth can be sustained in the range between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent. On the ground, we have reported that some new infrastructure projects have started. Housing sector activities are robust,\" said Dong Tao, China economist at Credit Suisse. Agreeing, Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, reckoned that the economy was on track for a gradual recovery.\n\nAnother independent survey published yesterday also showed strong demand in the property sector, with average prices of new homes in 100 major Chinese cities jumping 10.7 per cent year on year.\n\nBut analysts question the strength and sustainability of the recovery, which they contend has been based on an investment and export-dependent growth model. This has fuelled double-digit GDP increases over the past decade but also brought about economic distortions and high levels of debt.\n\nBeijing now wants to encourage domestic consumption, and has made it clear that it will accept lower growth rates as the economy undergoes transformation.\n\n\"The foundation for a recovery is not yet solid,\" said Zhang Liqun, an economist at the Cabinet think tank Development Research Center. Noting that order, inventory and purchasing price sub-indices declined, he said this suggested that \"companies are still rather cautions about the future outlook\".\n\nThe economy grew 7.8 per cent year on year in Q3, and economists expect growth to moderate to 7.5 per cent in last quarter. This would still be enough to reach the government's target of 7.5 per cent for 2013.\n\nAccording to the official PMI, strong output was the main driver, rising to 54.4 from 52.9. This was offset by weakness in new orders and new export orders, which both dipped 0.3 points to 52.5 and 50.4 respectively.\n\nThe survey also showed that smaller firms continued to underperform larger ones, with new orders in large enterprises reaching 53.8, while small businesses suffered a contraction at 48.8.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse's Mr Dong: \"This is consistent with our view that while the economy is stabilising, this is not a very strong rebound. The stabilisation is still largely relying on infrastructure investment and the housing market. The generic investment from the private sector still seems to be missing. Structural reforms are needed to re-engage private investment and to push the economy back on the right track.\"\n\nThe final HSBC/Markit PMI was unchanged from a preliminary flash estimate released last week, and showed a uptick in both new orders and new export orders.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is set to meet next week for its third plenary meeting, where major economic reforms are expected to be unveiled.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Usually, economists would anticipate the steady growth of 2013 to pick up momentum in the fourth quarter. But hundreds of thousands of temporarily laid-off government workers will hurt October sales data and jobs figures alike.\n\nThe few remaining stores that report monthly sales, including clothier Gap, will likely reveal the damage wrought on their bottom lines from the shutdown in October. The nine retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters are anticipated to show a meagre 0.4 per cent growth in sales from a month earlier - the slimmest margin of growth since the end of the recession.\n\nSimilarly, economists, on average, expect the unemployment rate to have risen to 7.4 per cent in October from 7.2 per cent in September when the Labor Department reports the data on Friday.\n\nWith another shutdown an outside possibility in early 2014, government workers may not be as eager to splurge this year as previously. The questions is: has Congress ruined Christmas?\n\n\"The dust kicked up by the government shutdown is beginning to settle,\" said portfolio strategists at Barclays Wealth & Investment Management, in a note to clients.\n\n\"While those charged with governing our country tend the wounds inflicted by the recent budget/debt ceiling battles, economists and statisticians are making numerous and varied attempts to calculate the impact of this legislative bumbling on US output. A glimpse of the cost will be revealed next year when fourth-quarter GDP is reported.\"\n\nThe third-quarter earnings season has been a tale of haves and have-nots. Industrial and raw materials conglomerates from truck engine maker Cummins to steel maker US Steel reported disappointing results while \"new technology\" companies such as Netflix and Facebook reported growth far in excess of targets.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the 355 Standard & Poor's 500 companies that have reported third-quarter earnings so far have topped the Wall Street target, according to data from Thomson Reuters. In the technology sector, 84 per cent of companies have beaten estimates but that quotient drops to 66 per cent for materials companies.\n\nBut Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital, says \"cyclical\" companies such as Cummins have reached the trough of the latest cycle from where things can only get better.\n\nAfter years of postponing investment in plants and equipment, companies will soon be forced to repair or replace machinery, Mr Marshall said.\n\n\"There's still a lot of uncertainty (about) capital expenditure, but companies are finally moving forward with spending plans,\" said Mr Marshall.\n\n\"We're seeing it across the board - from companies that make cardboard boxes to trucking companies that haven't replaced tractor trailers (in years) to companies adding new capacity within building materials.\"\n\nEven the airline industry, which has been in retreat since fuel prices spiked nearly 10 years ago, is rebuilding fleets of aircraft with new models from Boeing and others.\n\nMuch of the coming round of corporate investment will be driven by advances in technology, Mr Marshall said. For example, new fuel efficient planes will generate demand even among cash-strapped airlines.\n\nFor manufacturers, the emergence of three-dimensional printers, which instantly reproduce widgets designed on the computer screen, is comparable to the emergence of the Internet, Mr Marshall said.\n\n\"It's an industry that reduces manufacturing costs, it saves time to (get products to) market, reduces research and development spending,\" said Mr Marshall. \"There's a strong business case in a lot of areas for using 3-D printing and 'just-in-time manufacturing'.\"\n\nThis does not mean that companies like 3-D Systems, which make the printers and reported brisk quarterly earnings growth last week, are going to make it big.\n\n\"When (the Internet) was first invented, we knew everybody was eventually going to figure out a way to use Internet in their business but there were only a handful of\" Internet companies that survived, Mr Marshall said.\n\nAnother hot stock that's been humbled recently, electric car maker Tesla Motor, will try to live up to investors' high expectations this week.\n\nThis week could be a throwback to the Internet euphoria of the late 90s as one of the most popular online services plans a public offering. Underwriters have learned their lesson from Facebook's flop at its initial public offering.\n\nTwitter will be offered at US$17 to US$20 a share - a valuation of roughly US$12.8 billion for the whole company. But the banks assisting the micro-blogging service, which uses a bird insignia as its logo, hope shares will take flight from that relatively lowly beginning. Some venture capitalists expect Twitter to double in value almost as soon as it arrives on the stock market.\n\nIf the IPO stirs up enthusiasm, this week's stock market performance could be one worth tweeting about.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sony also unexpectedly posted a second-quarter loss, missing analyst estimates for a return to profit.\n\nMr Hirai, who took over amid four straight annual losses, cut jobs and emphasised digital imaging, games and mobile devices in an effort to win back sales from Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co. Instead, he lowered annual projections on Thursday for TVs, cameras, personal computers and video recorders as Sony's film unit lost money.\n\n\"It's hard to picture earnings growth at Sony's electronics operation without a sight of conventional hardware businesses bottoming out,\" Takashi Watanabe, a Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst, said in a report yesterday. \"Significant recovery hinges on whether the company can draft a drastic reform plan.\" He cut his share price forecast 5.3 per cent to 1,800 yen.\n\nEven with Japan's weaker yen, five of Sony's nine divisions posted operating losses in the second quarter. The company, which rejected investor Daniel Loeb's push for a partial sale of its entertainment assets, is trying to recover from flops that prompted criticism from the billionaire.\n\nSony fell to 1,668 yen in Tokyo, narrowing this year's gain to 74 per cent, after the stock was cut to hold from buy by Jefferies LLC analyst Atul Goyal. Competitor Panasonic Corp, which doubled its forecast on Thursday after paring phone and TV operations, surged 6.2 per cent.\n\n\"A year ago both of these companies needed radical change,\" said Yuuki Sakurai, chief executive officer of Fukoku Capital Management Inc. \"Sony stuck with TVs and they probably need to get out that business. Panasonic had its back to the wall and they had no choice but to change.\"\n\nSony's film studio stumbled in the summer box-office season that runs from May to early September. Big-budget tentpoles After Earth, with Will Smith, and White House Down, with Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, failed to connect with audiences.\n\nRecent releases Captain Phillips and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 have been well-received by audiences and critics. Last month, subscription streaming service Netflix Inc ordered a 13-episode series from Sony Pictures Television, by the creators of the drama Damages.\n\nSony's net loss totalled 19.3 billion yen in the three months ended Sept 30, compared with the 14.8 billion yen average profit of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company needs to cut costs and undertake \"more aggressive reform\" of its product portfolio and entertainment business, Fitch Ratings said in a statement yesterday. Sony's BB- credit rating, which is three levels below investment grade, may be downgraded, it said.\n\n\"Management has a planning problem,\" said Junya Ayada, a Tokyo-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. \"There is a risk for a TV volume downswing even though the company has already reduced its forecast.\"\n\nSony is betting its Xperia Z1 handset, introduced in September, will propel it to third place in the global smartphone market, leaping from seventh and narrowing the gap with Samsung and Apple. The phone features a 20.7-megapixel camera and showcases Mr Hirai's strategy to boost internal collaboration to make stronger products.\n\nThe company maintained its annual smartphone sales forecast at 42 million while raising its projection for game consoles at it prepares to release the flagship PlayStation 4 this month. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

By Nicholas Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOUT in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, Asheville is undiscovered country - at least for Singaporeans more enamoured of the big city lights of New York, Boston or Washington.\n\nOne link to the pop culture psyche would be that Asheville was the main shooting location for the hit movie, \"The Hunger Games\" (2012). But Asheville's allure goes beyond the odd Hollywood connection.\n\nNew residents such as chiropractor Marty Hughes, 32, and his naturopathic physician wife Robyn, 33, settled here two years ago, drawn by the outdoor recreational activities such as hiking and cycling, the restaurants, food culture and climate. \"Asheville is one of the few mountain towns in the US that has consistently good weather,\" notes Mr Hughes.\n\nPerhaps the most striking landmark in Asheville is the 3,240-hectare Biltmore Estate, once the largest home in America. Built by the railroad tycoon George W Vanderbilt with the help of architects Richard Morris Hunt and Frederick Law Olmsted, it opened in 1895 as a private getaway for Mr Vanderbilt's family and friends. Today, it still belongs to the Vanderbilt family, and is maintained by some 1,800 employees. About a million people visit every year, and even during the off-peak season, admission is a costly US$49.\n\nReminiscent of the Gardens of Versailles - it was built to resemble a French chateau - Biltmore Estate is best described as a monument to opulence. Biltmore House, the main building on the estate, has 250 rooms. Its banquet hall alone is several stories high and adorned with 16th century Flemish tapestries. Its centrepiece is an oak table big enough for 38 people to have dinner at, replete with fine linens and china, family silver and crystal wine glasses. It feels very much like Downton Abbey, the acclaimed British TV series about an early 20th century aristocratic family.\n\nBiltmore House was one of the first homes in the US to have a private bowling alley - although not the kind you're thinking of. Automatic pinsetters hadn't been invented at the time, so the servants had to manually set up the pins and retrieve the balls.\n\nThe house also had a 265,000 litre indoor swimming pool that's now empty. An interesting anecdote on the audio guide hints at the reason: many years ago, the owners filled up the pool, not knowing that it was leaking. The next morning, the pool was empty, and the basement flooded.\n\nSet aside half a day to traipse through the entire estate, which includes family rooms, guest rooms, servants' quarters, themed gardens, a conservatory, winery and a vineyard - and there is still a lot more to be seen. By the time you leave the estate, the inevitable thought comes to mind: no one needs such a big house, but with that kind of money, wants obviously outweigh everything else.\n\nBeyond the house, though, is what drew Mr Hughes and his wife to Asheville - the natural beauty of the region. There is an abundance of it in DuPont State Recreational Forest, a 40 sq km tract of land that is accessible by car, with friendly terrain that makes trekking for both families and dogs a breeze. A reward awaits you at the end of a four km trek to Triple Falls - the breathtaking sight of a three-tier waterfall that you can jump right into at certain points.\n\nBut Bridal Veil Falls, where the water cascades down a 37-metre-long, 45 degree granite slope, will easily top that experience. Standing at the foot of the falls as the water crashes towards you, you have to suppress the urge to run, as it feels as if it might overwhelm you. But you remain bone dry, and the view is magnificent.\n\nMrs Hughes says: \"The best thing about Asheville is how such a small city of just 80,000 people can offer many of the amenities of a much larger city.\"\n\nThat includes 12 Bones (www.12bones.com), a restaurant famous for its slow-smoked, baby back ribs that counts even US President Barack Obama as a regular patron. In four visits to Asheville, Mr Obama has reportedly eaten at 12 Bones three times.\n\nIn North Carolina, unlike its southern counterpart, the ribs are drier, with vinegar-infused sauces. It's sometimes a subject of fierce debate with their regional neighbours: comedian Stephen Colbert jokingly referred to North Carolina as \"those barbarians to the north\". He added: \"I mean, who makes barbecue sauce with vinegar? That's what you use to clean a toilet.\"\n\nBut 12 Bones proves him wrong. Order a half rack of the brown sugar-rubbed ribs and a quarter chicken (light meat), accompanied by potato salad, corn pudding and cornbread, with a choice of sauces like blueberry chipotle and jalapeno. It's easy to see why Mr Obama keeps going back: the meat is sweet and tender, the atmosphere convivial and the cost extremely affordable at US$23 (S$28.50).\n\nExcellent food can also be found at Nine Mile (http://ninemileasheville.com/), a Caribbean-inspired eatery which does a mean More Fyah (US$10.55) - grilled jerk chicken with fire-roasted tomatoes served over linguine or basmati rice. You can choose your spice level, and portions are generous, accompanied by bread and a salad. The Raggy Road (US$12.55), or grilled cajun tilapia with peppers, squash and zucchini in a white wine, coconut sauce, is another good choice.\n\nAnd of course, the Asheville experience isn't complete without beer. After all, this is the craft beer capital of the US, producing tens of thousands of barrels of beer a year. Over at Wicked Weed (www.wickedweedbrewing.com), prices start from US$9 for four ounces. Interesting flavours include the Coolcumber - made with cucumber, basil and juniper berries - and the Impeached Wheat, a fruit beer made with peaches.\n\nIf you've already done the city route in the US, maybe it's time to get off it. With good food and beer, and the rush of roaring waterfalls in your ears, Asheville will make you glad you did.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Reports by AMIT ROY CHOUDHURY\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[BARCELONA] IT industry leaders gathered at this trendy and high-tech Spanish city last week and pledged to work together to implement standards for what is being described as the next big thing in technology: the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural IoT World Forum, Cisco's chairman and CEO, John Chambers, said that by 2020, IoT will result in US$14.4 trillion in profits for companies worldwide. The company believes that this year alone, businesses could generate more than US$613 billion in profits from IoT.\n\nA raft of top technology companies were present at the event, like Oracle, SAP, Qualcomm, Schneider Electric and Zebra Technologies. Apart from these, there were a number of specialist IT firms present at the Barcelona forum.\n\nOne of the challenges the industry faces is to explain what exactly is IoT. A broad industry definition of IoT is a bunch of uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual representation on the Internet through an IP address. Interestingly, the idea of IoT was first proposed way back in 1999. However, it is only now that industry players have started to realise the potential of IoT.\n\nOne of the highlights of the IoT forum has been the setting up of a committee to draw up a set of guidelines, based on open standards, for development of devices and software so that the IoT devices can \"talk to each other\", much like how computers can \"talk to each other\" over the Internet.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Mr Chambers notes that the inflexion point in the IoT industry has been reached, with technology and cost making it feasible to embed most devices with a sensor that can connect to other devices through the Internet.\n\nThe numbers are impressive. Talking to BizIT, Vernon Turner, research agency IDC's senior vice-president for research, points out that today, less than one per cent of objects (or things) that could be, are connected to the Internet. IDC projects that by 2020, there will be 212 billion \"things\" in the world and that by 2017, 3.5 billion people will connect to the Internet, 64 per cent of them via mobile devices.\n\n\"People and connected things will generate massive amounts of data, an estimated 40 trillion gigabytes, that will have a significant impact on daily life; it will enable faster response times to medical or public safety emergencies and save lives, it will improve the quality of citizen life by providing direct and personal services from the government, and it will uncover new information about how our cities work, thus enabling city leaders to use resources more efficiently and save money while providing superior services,\" says Mr Turner. This will be a major driver for smart cities.\n\nMr Chambers notes that the five big inventions by humans since the industrial revolution - printing press, electricity, transportation, telephone and connected PCs - have all transitioned to the Internet and this is creating opportunities to push more devices on the Internet with unique IP addresses which would allow them to send and receive information.\n\nInternet of Everything\n\nAccording to a Cisco study, these \"things\" add capabilities like context awareness, increased processing power and energy independence. \"As more people and new types of information are connected, the world is going to enter into the world of Internet of Everything (IoE) - a network of networks where billions or even trillions of connections create unprecedented opportunities as well as new risks,\" notes Mr Chambers.\n\nAt the forum, Cisco announced that it has formed what it calls the IoT Group, which brings together existing internal teams working in adjacent fields and tasked with evolving and developing solutions for customers that provide connectivity for varied and disparate sources of data, machines and people.\n\nThis group will focus on developing vertical business solutions that connect the previously unconnected networked sensors, devices and \"things\" so as to enable IoT to transform business processes into dynamic, intelligent, data-driven and innovative business operations.\n\nMr Chamber notes that his company will have spent US$1 billion on IoT by the end of this year. \"If you look over the next five years we look to spend another billion on it terms of approach; in parallel we are going to spend around US$50 million as venture capital to fund small start-ups which have great ideas in the IoT space.\"\n\nThe Cisco boss adds that the company has, over the past five to seven years, seen this trend coming in areas like smart electricity grids, smart cities, in manufacturing, agriculture and mining, and in a huge variety of industries.\n\n\"We have taken the different groups within Cisco that were set up to do these and joined them to create a single organisation which is a IoT product group. Within this organisation where we are going to spend a bulk of the money.\"\n\nHe adds that the company will focus on three areas. The first is infrastructure which includes products for which Cisco is well known, including switches, routers, wireless and mobility. It will also include security and services - all the infrastructure that was designed for the Internet now gets redesigned for IoT.\n\nThe next area is software. \"We are pulling together our software platforms that allow us to take our infrastructure and expose it to the application development community with programmatic APIs (application programming interface).\"\n\nThe third layer is the development of apps that enable Big Data, analytics and all of the components that are required. \"A number of technology companies come to play here like SAP, Oracle, Intel and Schneider Electric, among others.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF you see a bespectacled Japanese man dressed in a jacket watching your moves at the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, don't be alarmed.\n\nIt's only landscape artist Kazuyuki Ishihara. He is no stalker, but rather, is observing visitors taking photos of plants so as to improve his landscape displays.\n\n\"No landscape garden is ever 100 per cent perfect,\" he says. \"I view my gardens in a certain way and visitors may see them in another way. So I try to see it from their point of view such as which angle they like, what flowers they like taking pictures of and improve on my landscaping.\"\n\nThe 55-year-old has been participating annually at the Chelsea Flower Show since 2006, and is a five-time Gold Medal winner. He is no stranger to Singapore, having competed at the Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) in 2008 and 2010. His Japanese-themed garden won a Gold and Best of Show winner at the 2008 SGF.\n\nHe is back again, this time to create a floral display at the Flower Dome for Christmas. This is the first time that the Gardens is collaborating with an external designer for its ever-changing floral displays.\n\nCalled Christmas Sugar Mountain, Mr Ishihara's display will have edible produce, such as strawberries, pineapples, pumpkins, watermelons and tomatoes. \"I want to show children what these fruits look like,\" he says.\n\nThe display will be at the Flower Dome from Nov 20 to Jan 5, 2014. Visitors cannot touch or eat the display, but Mr Ishihara promises that \"when children see it . . . they will definitely be wowed\".\n\nWith each garden that he does, his goal is simply to amaze visitors. \"A well-designed garden should not need any explanation. It should just make a person go 'wow',\" he says.\n\nBorn in Nagasaki, Mr Ishihara was a former motorcycle racer before he had to give that up because of poor eyesight. At 22, he started learning ikebana, the art of flower arrangement, which triggered his interest in landscaping. He has no formal training in landscaping but says that \"after designing thousands of gardens, I know what works\". He says it is a high point for him when he sees visitors taking photos of his creations.\n\nHe says there is no need for large amounts of green in a garden, so long as it has a few elements that make an impact. \"A garden like this is also easier to maintain,\" he says. Some of his gardens are lit up by artificial lighting, so they look different in the day and night. And for other gardens, he makes use of \"natural\" lighting by introducing fireflies into them. \"I create an ecosystem in the garden, so that the fireflies can survive,\" he says.\n\nAmong the landscapes he has created are private gardens as well as public ones, such as for Haneda International Airport and The Westin Tokyo.\n\nHis gardens don't just look good, but often serve a purpose, sometimes unconsciously for the user. \"I think about who the garden is for and what its purpose is,\" he says. For example, mall owners want shoppers to stay as long as possible in the mall, so Mr Ishihara uses plants to create an ambience that will make \"shoppers feel safe and welcome, so they will stay longer\".\n\nWhen creating a landscape for an elderly home, he tries to incorporate some farming activity into his gardens, to get the residents involved with their surroundings.\n\nFor Christmas Sugar Mountain, he is using food in his display as he believes in its power to bridge disparities in society.\n\nInspiration for his designs can come from anywhere, he says. \"It can be from movies, anime . . . and sometimes ideas pop into my head when I am having a beer,\" he quips. His choices of plants vary according to the design, but Mr Ishihara prefers using local plants and trees, and the cherry blossom is one of his favourite.\n\nHis home in Tokyo has a small verandah, leaving little room for a garden. But it's a different story in his office. \"My office is like a jungle,\" he says. There is greenery in the office, and he slips in that there is even a monkey and an owl. \"Yes, yes, they are real,\" he deadpans.\n\nMr Ishihara grew up with animals and having done projects for Ueno and Asahiyama Zoos, \"I want to have animals around me.\"\n\nNo wonder his clients often go \"wow\" when they come to his office.\n\nFor the father of three, nothing pleases him more than seeing children enjoy his creations. He even insists that the gardening staff have a \"childlike mind\" when constructing the garden.\n\nMr Ishihara, himself, is pretty much like a child. He wears multi-coloured striped socks, poses with his thumbs up for pictures, and gamely does jump shots. \"You can call me the crazy gardener.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/dp-architects-calls-shots-dubai", "site_title": "DP Architects calls the shots in Dubai", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDP Architects calls the shots in Dubai\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWALK down Orchard Road, and nearly every other mall, from Wisma Atria to Paragon and Mandarin Gallery have been designed by DP Architects.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise then, that the world's largest mall, The Dubai Mall, is also designed by the 46-year-old architecture firm.\n\nWith a gross floor area of nearly 6 million sq ft, The Dubai Mall is about four times the size of VivoCity, and has become the most visited retail and leisure destination in the world. About 65 million people visited it last year.\n\nHowever, that figure is not enough for mall owner Emaar Properties. Five years after its opening, the mall is currently expanding so that it can welcome over 100 million annual visitors. DP Architects is in charge of the expansion.\n\nThe Dubai Mall will grow by another 1 million sq ft, and the fashion portfolio of the mall will be further strengthened, enhancing the city's high-end retail offerings.\n\nAngelene Chan, DP Architects' deputy CEO says that while the scale of The Dubai Mall has not yet been replicated in Singapore, there were lessons that the firm applied from its many years of retail experience.\n\n\"Ease of circulation is paramount - both for the visitors and, just as importantly, for the service staff and retailers who need to seamlessly operate their businesses. Operational efficiency is the lifeblood of any mall, regardless of the size. Similarly, clear and predictable way-finding ensure that mall guests continue to come back,\" says Ms Chan.\n\nThe Dubai Mall is DP's first project as designer and overall lead consultant. The firm previously did the master planning for the Dubai World Trade Center and the Dubai Internet City.\n\nThe firm's relationship with Emaar Properties began in 1985, when DP built Wisma Atria and the client was represented by Mohamed Alabbar who would later become the Chairman of Emaar Properties. The two firms tried to work together but none of the potential projects materialised until The Dubai Mall.\n\nAs one of the directors involved in the mall's construction, Ms Chan did not have to relocate to Dubai but was frequently flying there. Dubai's climate posed a major challenge for her and the team, \"both in terms of how to design a comfortable environment and the ability to construct under tight schedules\".\n\nFor example, the heat, which can reach 50 deg C in summer limits the hours that workers can safely be outdoors and, coupled with frequent sandstorms, the environment can be hostile to both man and building.\n\nThe Dubai Mall also lies within relative proximity to areas of seismic activity so the building had to be designed to factor in movement. \"Humidity can also be surprisingly high, which can affect architectural finishes, so we had to be extremely careful in our procedures to ensure that we were operating a safe and efficient project,\" says Ms Chan.\n\nIn terms of building codes and compliances, many of the existing codes in Dubai were not sufficient to cover all of the aspects of the building. When there was insufficient regulation, the team adopted Singapore standards and these were subsequently added to the local guidelines.\n\nThe other differences are more cultural, says Ms Chan. While the working language was in English, the project was truly international.\n\nShe adds that, \"working on a project of this scale brings together a talented group from all over the world, and it was important that all of us were respectful of the many cultures and differences that we all brought to the table.\"\n\nAlthough the expansion is headed by another director, Ms Chan is unfazed by the mammoth task of adding another 1 million sq ft of retail space. \"The planned expansion of The Dubai Mall is a testament to its success as a retail and lifestyle destination.\"\n\nFor her, it is also a clear indication that retailers always need to be forward thinking as the \"refresh rate\" of shopping malls has been increasing in order to stay competitive.\n\n\"The Dubai Mall has exceeded its projected visitor numbers every year since its opening - the expansion is a move to ensure that the mall continues to be a world-class shopping experience,\" says Ms Chan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She was getting used to living in Asia and managing the restaurant when the chef, 53, died suddenly of a heart attack in the kitchen - turning her life upside down and leaving his legacy in limbo.\n\nThe Singapore restaurant closed down a year later, and so did his other overseas outpost in Dubai, followed by the restaurant Evo in Barcelona. The final blow came when his flagship restaurant Can Fabes served its last meal on Aug 31 on the back of financial difficulties, loss of culinary direction and the troubled Spanish economy that had already claimed a few fine dining casualties.\n\n\"It was a really difficult decision to make,\" says Ms Santamaria of the closure of Can Fabes after 32 years. \"My family lived just above the restaurant, so we practically grew up with it.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/better-support-policies-social-enterprises", "site_title": "Better support policies for social enterprises", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBetter support policies for social enterprises\n\nMuch potential for Asia, Europe collaboration, dialogue reveals\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nSOCIAL enterprises are alive and thriving and policymakers are increasingly recognising the opportunity to build a new economy - one that creates not just economic, but also inclusive and sustainable growth. Yet, strong and specific policy support for a better business environment for social enterprises (SEs) has been slow in taking shape, although attempts have been made with varying degrees of success in Europe and Asia.\n\nHistorically, Europe and in particular the United Kingdom have been at the forefront of the social enterprise movement. But policy influencers and social entrepreneurs point out that Asian states could do better with stronger policy support.\n\nA recent dialogue held in Berlin among European and Asian policy influencers and social entrepreneurs found that there was still scope for greater collaboration between Asia and Europe to better communicate and reinforce the impact of social enterprises. And, such dialogues can give Asian policymakers more support to widen the scope and reach of the SE sector in the economy.\n\n\"In Asia, countries such as Thailand and South Korea have progressive policy support for their social enterprises. However, in a large part of the region, there is still a lack of capacity and funds to assist SEs to be fully financially sustainable. There is still a significant gap in policy support that can help these SEs scale up,\" said Karsten Warnecke, the Singapore-based deputy executive director of the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF). \"I believe these are areas where both regional and inter-regional bodies, such as ASEF, can play a role in increasing awareness and in facilitating networking and cooperation,\" he told BT. \"We have started addressing these by creating platforms to share expertise and experiences within and across both regions. Such exchange of ideas and best-practices can help practitioners and policymakers create environments conducive for social businesses.\"\n\nASEF and the British Council are two organisations working towards strengthening policy support for social enterprises and promoting the implementation of such support in countries with no existing policy frameworks. They feel the time is ripe for consolidating existing policies and analysing their outcomes, to strengthen support for social enterprises, especially from governments.\n\nIt is with this backdrop that ASEF and the British Council assembled senior policy influencers from 24 countries in Berlin for a policy dialogue and exchange of experiences. They were responding to a need for increased opportunities for sharing experiences between Asian and European social entrepreneurs and to develop the support structures.\n\nThe notion of social enterprise achieving maximum social good and not maximisation of shareholder profit, while remaining a sustainable venture is gaining more acceptability at a time when the rough edges of extreme capitalism are beginning to grind on the social conscience. A renewed attention on social enterprise is now being followed up with more specific policy support to existing government initiatives in areas of taxation, public procurement, financial market rules and regulations and other entrepreneurship supporting schemes.\n\n\"There's a growing interest in social enterprise - it's the sector where entrepreneurs are choosing to set up businesses. This fact speaks volumes about people's motivations and a desire for change in the way that businesses behave and their contribution to society,\" says Peter Holbrook, chief executive of Social Enterprise UK (SEUK), the national body championing social enterprise in the United Kingdom. The social enterprise approach is increasingly seen as a way in which innovative solutions can be found for unmet needs, and a market is \"created\" or \"stimulated\" to address these.\n\nBut the lack of specific structures was a recurring theme in the Berlin discussions. Muhammad Rumee Ali, the head of Bangladesh's biggest and most successful social enterprise, BRAC, feels that at the policymaker level, there has to be a clear and a 'shared' understanding of the definition of a social enterprise, if an effective policy response is to be formulated. Equally important is the need to define the basic architecture of an SE, he told BT following the Berlin meeting.\n\nBritish entrepreneurial leader in social enterprise Penny Newman does not see social enterprise just as business with a conscience. \"It is about actively delivering change, often tackling entrenched social and environmental challenges, where others, be it government or businesses, have either feared to tread or have failed.\" Ms Newman has worked for the past 20 years in organisations that help relieve social injustice in a way that builds an organisation sustainably, including a stint as CEO at Jamie Oliver's Fifteen, the celebrity chef's chain of restaurants where disengaged young people are trained for long-term careers in the restaurant industry.\n\nBut whatever the definition or structure, all agree that policy or governmental support is crucial. SEUK's Mr Holbrook contends that social enterprise movements need to influence governments and policymakers at the highest level, \"to make sure social enterprise is at the top of the business and political agendas\". Mr Holbrook, who led the main dialogue session in Berlin, also noted that SEs needed to work with government partners and mainstream businesses to strengthen their work.\n\nA UK survey on the state of social enterprise found that the sector is thriving and attracting a wave of entrepreneurs and outperforming mainstream bodies. The poll also revealed that SEs scored in its innovativeness - 56 per cent of social enterprises (in UK) developed a new product or service in the last 12 months compared to 43 per cent of SMEs. New product or service development is often used as a proxy-indicator of business innovation.\n\nWhile there is acceptance that evidenced social impact will be a primary criterion for funding and governmental support, rather than explicitly favouring SEs, there need be a more balanced approach. Policies could be framed to give some consideration to the social and environmental value of SEs. For instance, UK has a Social Value Act that benefits SEs.\n\nThe Berlin Dialogue produced some pointers for a better policy context for SEs in Asia and Europe to develop further. There was also a call for a legal form of the social enterprise eco-system and for more regulatory and tax breaks. There is a need for SEs to be more transparent if governments are to play a bigger role in providing a supportive framework for them, such as providing tax relief and start-up capital, the dialogue participants noted.\n\nMr Warnecke said that the Berlin Dialogue produced worthwhile findings for developing a better policy context for SEs in Asia and Europe. \"It was an opportunity to understand the concept as well as role of social enterprises from both Asian and European perspectives,\" he said, adding that the sector can do exceptionally well in Asia, as policymakers look seriously into developing it into an essential part of the economy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Then it is another six hours by car or a two-hour helicopter flight, before Mr Prihanto reaches his destination - Oyo-Ollombo.\n\nFor the geographically challenged, Oyo-Ollombo is 400km north of Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo.\n\nJust what is Mr Prihanto doing in Africa? The deputy managing director for urban planning at Surbana is heading an 18-person team, who are undertaking a master plan and feasibility study for Oyo-Ollombo Special Economic Zone (SEZ).\n\nThe country is planning to develop four SEZ - in Pointe Noire, Brazzaville, Oyo-Ollombo and Quesso.\n\nSurbana was introduced to the project by Singapore Cooperation Enterprise. Mr Prihanto and his team started on the project in February last year and the master plan was submitted in June this year. Pending the approval of the SEZ policies, the Oyo-Ollombo SEZ is expected to launch early next year.\n\n\"We plan how the city will grow and function as an SEZ in the future, including allocating sites for processing facilities and logistics; ensuring good connectivity between the airport, the river port and the neighbouring towns; preparing the expansion of the city to accommodate future population and providing the whole range of commercial, education, health and recreational facilities,\" says Mr Prihanto. \"Finally we envisioned Oyo-Ollombo to be the green capital of Congo as the centre of the agro-business, the model for sustainable development and the model of integration between urban development and nature.\"\n\nThis is Surbana's first project in Congo, which has a population of about 4 million. \"The government is inviting foreign contributors to develop the country,\" says Mr Prihanto.\n\nMost meetings with the clients, the Ministry of Grand Travauz and Ministry of SEZ, take place in Brazzaville, although sometimes site visits have to be made.\n\nFor each visit, the team stays about a week to 10 days. Mr Prihanto says \"Congo is generally a peaceful country, blessed with abundant land, water and mineral resources.\"\n\nApart from work, there is little else for the team to do in Brazzaville. \"There is not much entertainment, no shopping area nor good public places to visit. But there are some good restaurants with great views along the Congo River,\" says Mr Prihanto.\n\nFood is not an issue for the team. \"It is mostly French food, so that is not a problem. The local food is interesting, the people eat lots of bananas and cassava. There are three Chinese restaurants here as well.\" says Mr Prihanto.\n\nHe cites language as a challenge working in Congo. \"It is a French-speaking country. All the reports, documents received, presentation materials, database coding and communications have to be done in French,\" he explains. \"We have a French-speaking staff and we had to engage native speakers to get good standard translation as Congolese consider themselves the best French-speaking people in Africa.\"\n\nDespite Congo's distance and its lack of direct accessibility from Singapore, Mr Prihanto speaks fondly of it. \"You get to appreciate the greenery, dense forest everywhere, rivers and the biodiversity. In the course of the project, I am also enraptured by the spontaneousness of the local people, who will dance to celebrate and welcome visitors.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be available from next Friday.\n\nAn earlier incarnation of this service was launched on M1's fledgling Internet TV service, MiBox, in July.\n\nThe extension of All You Can App to M1's mobile customers, however, will make the app downloads available on up to three Android devices per subscription. As part of a launch promotion, M1 will give its customers a seven-day free trial of the service and a free download of an Electronic Arts app, such as Plants vs. Zombies or Bejeweled 2.\n\nM1 customers who subscribe to the service will be able to pay the monthly fee through their mobile-phone bill.\n\nBT understands that this service will not be available on the iOS platform, given Apple's closed architecture. Even so, Mobiroo, which launched this service in March, is intent on geographical expansion.\n\nDubbed the \"Spotify of apps\", All You Can App already has a similar tie-up with Malaysia's Celcom and has partnerships in the pipeline for North America and Latin America, according to Alan Wong, Mobiroo's president for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"Content subscription services have been growing in popularity, with consumers looking for services that give them unlimited access to content,\" Mr Wong said. \"Our partnership with M1 brings this experience to the apps landscape, and we are very excited to provide M1 customers with this amazing value for an ultimate app experience.\"\n\nMobiroo, which has its global headquarters in Toronto, has another office in Miami and its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore, which is staffed by three people.\n\nIndustry watchers have tapped buffet-style services such as All You Can App as a means of paving the way for greater data usage by consumers who are just making the transition to the smartphone.\n\nIn Germany, Deutsche Telekom has teamed up with music buffet app Spotify to offer a service that bundles unlimited access to music for flat monthly fee. In Singapore, M1's larger peers - SingTel and StarHub - have started exploring partnerships with app services in one form or another, in a bid to tie subscribers to telco-specific services.\n\nIn August, SingTel launched WhatsApp plans for its prepaid customers, ranging from 50 cents for a day to $6 for 30 days.\n\nTwo weeks after that, StarHub launched a free one-year premium subscription to note-taking app Evernote for its existing and new postpaid customers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We'll also see a strong showing in terms of contributions from Great Eastern Holdings.\"\n\nCustomer loans rose 16 per cent to $162 billion from the year-ago quarter, lifting net interest income 4 per cent to a quarterly high of $978 million.\n\nNet interest margin - a measure of profitability - declined to 1.63 per cent from 1.75 year-on-year, given the low interest rate environment and the re-pricing of existing Singapore housing loans, OCBC said. The non-performing loan ratio stayed unchanged at 0.8 per cent.\n\nNon-interest income, excluding divestment gains, rose 3 per cent year-on-year to $779 million. The boost came from record-high fees and commissions, as well as contributions from its insurance unit Great Eastern Holdings. Net trading income, however, fell 68 per cent to $47 million.\n\n\"The challenging market conditions associated with the uncertainty over the timing of the US Federal Reserve's tapering of bond purchases have reduced our income contribution from trading and market-related activities,\" CEO Samuel Tsien said.\n\nAnnualised earnings per share for the three months ended September was 85.2 cents compared with 80.7 cents a year ago.\n\nFor the nine-month period, OCBC's net profit was $2.1 billion, down 38 per cent from $3.3 billion a year ago, which included divestment gains. Excluding such gains, net profit fell 5 per cent.\n\nOCBC will seek growth opportunities mainly in its key overseas markets of Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China as the higher margins elsewhere make up for the slim ones at home. Hence, Singapore's contribution to group revenue, which currently stands at about 60 per cent, may dip below that level, Mr Tsien said.\n\nHe added that the bank will deepen its commercial, wealth management and insurance presence in these countries. \"With respect to expansion versus acquisitions, we'd like to expand based on our current infrastructure. Should market opportunities present themselves, we'd then look at those.\"\n\nWhile Mr Tsien declined to address rumours that OCBC is considering a bid for Wing Hang Bank, he said Hong Kong is \"a market that people will pay attention to\" as it offers greater access to mainland China. The bank currently has only one branch in Hong Kong, specialising in wholesale banking.\n\nOCBC closed four cents lower yesterday at $10.36 a share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is centred around a large landscaped courtyard garden area with extensive facilities, including a swimming pool, cafe, study centre and gymnasium.\n\nCenturion said the existing student accommodation presents asset enhancement opportunities to increase its bed capacity in the future.\n\nIn addition, the car-park building may be redeveloped into new apartment buildings for university students and/or staff working in the healthcare industry in the vicinity.\n\nGiven that it is an operational asset, the proposed acquisition of RMIT Village will be earnings-accretive, and is expected to contribute to Centurion's bottom line when the acquisition is completed, which is expected early next year.\n\nRMIT Village is managed by Campus Living Village, one of the largest student accommodation operators in the world, which owns, manages and is developing more than 35,000 beds for around 50 educational institutions in Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the United States. This arrangement will continue after the acquisition by Centurion.\n\nAffiliated to RMIT University as its student accommodation facility, the property benefits from an arrangement whereby the university may reserve beds for its students before the start of each academic year.\n\nTypically, RMIT University reservations account for 70 per cent of the total occupied beds annually. Occupancy at RMIT Village has been close to 100 per cent in the past three years.\n\nRMIT Village is located on the northern edge of Melbourne's central business district in a well-established education precinct on Flemington Road, in close vicinity to RMIT University and the University of Melbourne.\n\nCenturion's counter ended 1.5 cents higher at 55 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The technology involves drilling a steel-encased hole into the coal seam and with the pressure from the seams extracting water and gas to the surface.\n\nOf these two, Mr Bond said: \"There's not gas in every bit of shale or coal that you drill into.\"\n\nThe energy advantage in the US has created an \"absolute energy gap that is driving America forward\", he said. While some of these is expected to be exported in the form of liquefied natural gas to Asia in the near future, \"by the time you put it on the ship and send it to Asia, it's just as expensive as Australia's (gas)\".\n\n\"No matter how you play the game, there's going to be a gap. They need UCG,\" said Mr Bond. \"You want to keep importing gas? Energy independence is a major issue for every country in the world.\"\n\nCompared to shale gas or coalbed methane, coal is plentiful.\n\n\"(But) you can only do one thing with coal - you can burn it, make steam, and turn a turbine. That's it. It was invented at the turn of the last century for the industrial revolution. The way forward is clean gas,\" said Mr Bond. \"As long as you've got coal, I can turn it into gas.\"\n\nUCG was first used by the Soviet Union during the 1930s, but failed to progress beyond the experimental stage after the discovery of extensive natural gas reserves. High energy prices in recent years have rekindled worldwide interest in it.\n\nThere is currently only one commercial UCG operation in the world in Uzbekistan, run by a subsidiary of Linc Energy.\n\nLike fracking, however, UCG is not without its detractors.\n\nSome say that it remains an unproven technology, and can cause serious groundwater contamination.\n\nThese concerns have caused the Queensland government in Australia to put on hold commercialisation of UCG.\n\nUCG's reputation in Queensland had been tarnished after a test plant by another firm, Cougar Energy, was shut down in 2010, because it allowed cancer-causing chemicals to leach into groundwater supplies.\n\nThe lack of support from the government led Linc Energy to close down its underground coal gasification pilot plant in Queensland earlier this month. The plant has been used for operational trials and research for almost 14 years.\n\nDespite these setbacks, however, the firm is actively developing plans for new plants in South Africa, Russia, and drilling in Alaska and Poland.\n\n\"UCG is on the cusp of being an energy platform that is going to fill the gap for Asia, Europe, Africa. Everywhere that's coal long, everywhere that needs gas, we're going to fill the gap,\" said Mr Bond.\n\nHe added that the UCG technology has attracted investments from billionaires. \"They do that because they understand that as a new platform, that's where the biggest growth margin is. It's like buying shale eight years ago, before everybody else figured it out.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The modest family drama was a dark horse in the race and the first-time director faced stiff competition from the other heavyweight veteran nominees in the category.\n\nIn the end, the victory might have been a narrow one but is significant all the same. Singapore Film Society's programming manager David Lee, who attended the ceremony and followed Taiwanese press reports, says the media there revealed Mr Chen won by just one vote after four rounds of voting by the jury which was led by Lee Ang.\n\nJohnnie To's Drug War was eliminated first, followed by Wong Kar Wai's The Grandmaster and Jia Zhangke's A Touch of Sin. In the end, Mr Chen's Ilo Ilo beat Best Director winner Tsai Ming Liang's Stray Dogs by just one vote to clinch the honour, which is considered the most prestigious prize in Chinese cinema. In addition, the film also bagged Best New Director and Best Original Screenplay for Mr Chen, as well as Best Supporting Actress for Yeo Yann Yann; making it four wins out of its six nominations.\n\nMr Lee recalls being congratulated by various guests and filmmakers at the ceremony even though he was not involved in the making of Ilo Ilo. \"It's good brand-building for Singapore and shows the Golden Horse recognition of Chinese cinema being more than just movies from Taiwan, Hong Kong or China,\" he says.\n\nStanding ovation\n\nThe victory capped an eventful six months for the 29-year-old filmmaker after he first premiered Ilo Ilo at Cannes in May to a 15-minute standing ovation and then made international headlines for winning the Camera d'Or award. The film, which cost $500,000 to make, had a modest run at the local box office, raking in about $800,000 during its initial run. (Surprisingly, it grossed about as much in France, where it even cracked the Top Five charts.)\n\nIndustry players here agree Ilo Ilo's Cannes and Golden Horse honours is a coup for local cinema and bodes well for those in the industry.\n\nBut it's also not the first local film to receive recognition on the world stage; about two decades back, Eric Khoo's 12 Storeys was the first Singapore film to be invited to take part in the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Following that, his 2005 drama Be With Me opened the Director's Fortnight at Cannes and three years later, his next film My Magic was nominated for the Palme d'Or award.\n\nThe veteran filmmaker, who's now a European festival regular and whose works arguably attract more attention overseas than here in Singapore, remarks that Mr Chen's win at Cannes was a \"milestone\" but the Golden Horse ones were even more \"incredible\".\n\n\"People are going to watch out for Singapore films now,\" he says. Hence, it's crucial to strike while the iron is hot. \"We have to move fast - the next two years are going to be crucial - in fact, I'm already thinking of making my next film,\" he half-jokes.\n\nIndependent producer, Juan Foo, adds that now that Singapore is in the public eye, it's time to decide on a cinematic identity - \"Should we be known for (Jack Neo's smash hit army comedy) Ah Boys To Men, which is actually not bad because it has box-office mettle or Ilo Ilo?\" Personally, he feels there should be a 50-50 balance where Ah Boys' dollars and cents potential can meet Ilo Ilo's cinematic soul.\n\nHe also points out that Mr Chen's Cannes and Golden Horse awards were no flukes and boils down to the latter understanding how the industry operates besides just being artistically good at his craft. \"Those who know Anthony and his background will tell you he's one of our best filmmakers because it's rare that one understands and takes the effort to learn the business of filmmaking on top of just being artistic and creative,\" he says of Mr Chen's efforts in finding the right partners and developing Ilo Ilo right from the start.\n\n\"It's not just about making a good film - you have to actively engage the industry and go to various markets - sitting in Singapore, banging tables and asking why won't anybody fund your film won't work.\"\n\nAs a result of Mr Chen's intensive networking and business savvy, Ilo Ilo won the Best Project Award at Tokyo's International Film Festival, FILMeX as far back as three years ago and caught the attention of influential French arthouse sales agent, Memento Films, which was also behind the Iranian film, A Separation. The drama won the Best Foreign Film Oscar last year and with Ilo Ilo now set to be Singapore's entry for the same award at next year's Academy Awards, history could well repeat itself.\n\nMr Foo adds that Mr Chen had control over the film as he was also one of the producers and the dual roles he played is an important one because Mr Foo notes there are not enough producers in Singapore. \"It's the symptom of a young industry because everybody just wants to be a director,\" he says.\n\nSingapore Film Society's Mr Lee says Mr Chen, being the \"man of the moment\" and \"poster boy for Singapore cinema\", will hopefully lead to more young people getting involved in every aspect of the local film industry. \"As a young man, he will be an inspiration for others to not only be directors themselves but also distributors or even just the audience - it takes everyone to make up the industry, not just filmmakers themselves,\" he notes.\n\nHuge push\n\nBut Mr Lee warns that with Mr Chen's accolades and the spotlight now being focused sharply on Singapore, for better or worse, everybody will be forced to work harder. The Golden Horse victory has already attracted some backlash online from naysayers who pooh-poohed Ilo Ilo's win and Singapore being a backwater for Chinese cinema since it's the first time any local film has had the honour of winning Best Picture.\n\n\"I've always felt that as an art form, film is easily accessible but it's also a business,\" Mr Lee adds. \"Anthony has opened the doors so this is a huge push for us... hopefully it will lead to more things like more corporate support and sponsorships, which other art forms like theatre already have a head-start in.\"\n\nMr Chen's win could also mark a significant turning point in Singapore films as the world begins to pay attention to it. After all, it was probably how the Taiwanese film industry experienced a resurgence after over a decade of slump when the likes of Tsai Ming Liang, Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao Hsien were criminally ignored by domestic audiences during the 1990s. But as Mr Khoo notes, the critical acclaim they received from overseas critics and moviegoers kept people interested in Taiwanese cinema and it has revived itself in the new millennium with films such as Cape No 7, Monga and You Are The Apple of My Eye which have all become box-office smashes both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Foo attributes part of that to the ebb and flow nature of cinema - \"It's a natural evolution; you can't hit the mark all the time but you need to keep at it; the next wave could come five years down the road but, at least, with each wave, we get to understand what the market is all about.\"\n\nBut like Mr Khoo, he hopes Mr Chen's win doesn't lead to a rush of directors jumping on the bandwagon and trying to copy Ilo Ilo.\n\n\"Instead of making another similar film in the hope that it would win hearts, minds and money; do perhaps think about how your own film is able to stand out,\" advises Mr Foo. \"If you are pressured and feel you will not be able to top this milestone, then don't even attempt to make anything yet. Go back to film school, the drawing board, the story.\"\n\nThe importance of a strong plot is a sentiment shared by Malaysian-born, Singapore-based writer-director Lee Thean Jeen, who has worked extensively on both the big and small screens. \"The hook is the story,\" he says. \"In my opinion, it's important not to think whether you want to make a commercial or festival film because both have their own audiences.\"\n\nIlo Ilo finds its sweet spot by aiming for the middle so despite its slow pacing, the movie struck a chord with local cinemagoers because the 1997 Asian financial crisis and plight of foreign domestic helpers hit home. As Khoo, whose company Zhao Wei Films also represents Mr Chen for commercial works, puts it, \"For many Singaporeans, this isn't an arthouse film; it's a good drama!\"\n\nMr Foo is also more than happy a film that is slightly culture-specific has managed to win over an international audience. \"Singapore is a complex place with so many voices; (I'm) glad that this one is (being) heard,\" he says. \"Too many people want to be filmmakers for the wrong reasons; too few remain for the right.\"\n\nIlo Ilo has been re-released for a limited run from now till Dec 4 at selected Golden Village cinemas\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Straits Times Index could trade in the red and sentiment could be weak because of overseas worries but low-priced stocks could easily double, treble and in some cases, rise more than 10 times in a relatively short space of time, in some cases accompanied by eye-catching corporate announcements but in many others with no fundamental backing.\n\nAll of this has now come to a screeching halt following action by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and broking houses, the former when it slapped designations on three speculatives and suspended trading for two weeks, the latter because of trading curbs on not just the same three but also dozens of others.\n\nThis week was probably the most painful for those caught in the pennies, a situation made worse by the sudden crashes in SkyOne and Tritech Group on Monday which brought on worries that SGX would intervene.\n\nIn response to the subsequent public clamour, the exchange said it did not see the need to act in SkyOne's case but did so in the case of the three original speculatives Asiasons, Blumont and Liongold because of a threat of disorderly trading.\n\nDespite this clarification, brokers said the damage was already done - daily volume, which used to regularly cross 3 billion units (albeit with an average unit value of 20-40 cents), this week hovered around the 1 to 1.3 billion unit mark. In yesterday's session, when the STI fell 9.47 points to 3,201.2, turnover was a very weak 2.2 billion units worth $871 million for an average of 40 cents per unit.\n\nNot surprisingly, this has made for a grim and depressed mood in most trading rooms, with retail brokers reporting virtually no interest from clients. \"Everyone is scared of which might be the next stock(s) to be designated by SGX,\" said a dealer. \"This is paralysing the market.\"\n\nIf penny stocks were largely down for the week, so were blue chips. The drop in the STI yesterday brought its five-day loss to four points.\n\nThis was despite two blue-chip stalwarts DBS and OCBC reporting better-than-expected Q3 figures - DBS's profit was $862 million and OCBC's was $826 million.\n\nIn its look yesterday at the banks, OSK DMG analysed loans growth and said that despite a pick-up in September's loans growth, it did not foresee growth momentum to continue into Q4 2013. \"This will partly be due to seasonality and the property market cooling measures taking effect,\" said the broker. \"We forecast slower loans growth for banks in the quarters ahead, and maintain our NEUTRAL call on the sector.\"\n\nThe main market-moving event was Tuesday and Wednesday's US Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Stocks surged ahead of the meeting on expectations that the Fed would provide \"dovish\" guidance on how long it will delay tapering its monetary stimulus.\n\nInstead of answering the question of \"how long?\" with the hoped-for answer \"quite a bit longer\", the Fed's statement amounted to \"not that much longer'', which introduced an element of mild panic into Wall Street and by extension, the rest of the world. Financial research firm Ideaglobal said from a reading of the FOMC minutes that the Fed still believes downside risks to the economy and the labour market have diminished.\n\n\"This keeps the FOMC on a data-dependent path and offers no rubber stamp of market expectations for full throttle QE until March or April or beyond,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nARCHITECT Chan Soo Khian has a soft spot for New York. \"I went to university in the East Coast and used to go to New York every year,\" he says. Mr Chan obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington University and Master of Architecture at Yale University.\n\nIt's only natural, then, that the founding principal and design director of SCDA Architects \"always wanted to build in New York.\"\n\nThat dream is coming to fruition with Soori High Line, a boutique residential development located in lower Manhattan's West Chelsea district. This is Mr Chan's first project in the United States.\n\nThis is his second Soori brand - the first being Alila Villas Soori, the resort and private residences in Bali. The biggest challenge about Soori High Line he says, is finding the site. \"I have been looking for suitable sites for several years. The city is almost fully built, and there are always more bidders than available land spaces,\" he says.\n\nThe 14,813 sq ft land he found and bought is minutes away from the High Line, the 1.45 mile long city park built on a section of the former elevated freight rail road.\n\nIt is also near the upcoming Hudson Yards development, where famed architects such as Zaha Hadid and Foster + Partners also have buildings. Fronting West 29th street, the 11-storey development comprises a mix of two- to five-bedroom apartments, ranging from 1,416 sq ft to 6,075 sq ft. There is also a three-storey penthouse that has its own private terrace and rooftop pool.\n\nEach apartment has double volume living and dining spaces, with ceilings reaching between 14 and 18 feet high. All apartments will come with their own fireplace and automated winterisation devices installed in the floor windows and balcony.\n\nOf the 27 apartments, 16 of them will have their own private heated pools. The pools are accessible from the bathroom, and run from the master suite along the living areas to overlook West 29th Street below, with transparent pool edges.\n\nPools in apartments are not new for Mr Chan, who created similar ones in Singapore for SC Global's The Marq which has 23 private pools.\n\nThey are however, believed to be a first for private apartments in New York. No surprise then to hear that the pools proved to be a challenge for the building authorities there.\n\n\"There are very strict building regulations, and I had to convince the authorities to allow for pools in the apartments. I also had to ensure that the pools would be handicap-compliant,\" says Mr Chan.\n\n\"I am bringing a contemporary, Asian design and resort concept to New York City, as reflected in the private residence pools, oversized bathrooms, fireplaces and double-volume ceilings. This type of lifestyle design is often found in Singapore, but is new to New York City,\" he adds. \"Therefore it was important to provide examples of my established work, such as with Nassim Park Residences in Singapore with 120 private pools, and ONE KL in Malaysia, which features 96 private pools, and to assure we have a team of experts who are adept at creating high-design features that are also fully compliant with building regulations.\"\n\nHe is insistent on having the pools, as \"they are not just for swimming, but a way to blend the outdoor and indoor spaces in a seamless way\".\n\nHe adds, \"In the tropics, pools are transition spaces, and I wanted to test this same theory in New York.\"\n\nMr Chan notes that the planning control in Manhattan is \"more pro-urban design,\" and his building facade attests to that - vertical steel fins lined with timber form a staggered veil in front of large glass facade panels, giving it a distinctive look.\n\nMr Chan is not only the architect for Soori High Line, but its interior, landscaping and product designer as well. The project is being developed by Blackhouse Oriel Development, a New York and Singapore-based real estate development firm, of which Mr Chan is a major shareholder.\n\nThe apartments will have fittings from top brands such as Poliform, Verena and Boffi. Mr Chan is designing a bespoke line of furniture for Soori High Line through Poliform, which will include chairs, love seats and coffee tables. These pieces will be introduced at the Milan Furniture Fair next year.\n\n\"I want to bring the Asian lifestyle to Manhattan,\" he says.\n\nHe adds, \"Manhattan is difficult to break into, so this is all very exciting for me.\"\n\nSoori High Line will be launched for sale in the first quarter of next year. Already, Mr Chan has received \"expressions of interest from friends and clients\". It is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Because we are doing all that, then of course Singapore becomes a fulcrum for that (engagement),\" Mr Wagar told The Business Times. While acknowledging that there may be differences between the US and Singapore, he noted that there are several values Singapore as a nation has grown to embody which underpin bilateral ties - a relationship he said US President Barack Obama values.\n\n\"Singapore is a country that by its example shows what can be accomplished by open markets, rule of law and really, by lifting all of its citizens up. That is important for us to have that friendship here and to work with.\"\n\nHe added that Singapore has been the intellectual power behind bringing peace and stability to South-east Asia and that leadership has also led to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) evolving as an economic architecture across the region.\n\nThe 44-year-old lawyer by training, who was sworn in as US Ambassador to Singapore in September, revealed that the completion and implementation of the TPP was the top-most priority in his posting here. Describing the TPP as a \"game-changer\", Mr Wagar sees the partnership as being critical in enhancing American relations with Singapore and the region. It also provides an open market to the US and Singapore from Latin America to South-east Asia, he said.\n\nHe singled out the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) as a factor that has strengthened ties between both countries. With Singapore emerging as a top 10 trading partner for the US in the first half of this year, he believes the USSFTA is the best-performing FTA the US has signed.\n\n\"But as someone who has always been trying to get an A-plus, I haven't figured out where we can improve it yet but if I can, I will,\" he said, adding that the US-Singapore relationship reflects the benefits of trade to other countries in the region.\n\nHe noted that US foreign direct investment (FDI) to Singapore was healthy, being twice the level to China and five times the amount to India.\n\nThat said, he felt more could be done to improve the reverse flow of capital from Singapore to the US. While geographical distance may be a deterrent for some Singapore companies to invest in the US, he said the US Department of Commerce has set up the Select USA scheme to provide a one-stop service to help foreign businesses who wish to invest in the US.\n\nBefore being posted to Singapore, Mr Wagar was the managing director of a law firm in Miami and served on the advisory board of the Export-Import Bank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Based on a land area of about 197,992.3 sq ft, this translates to gross floor area (GFA) of about 494,980.6 sq ft.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, said he expects the site to garner a top bid of about $110-$130 per square foot per plot ratio. The site should be relatively well received, given that the government has recently outlined its plans to develop Woodlands into a work-live-play regional centre.\n\n\"With Woodlands set for rejuvenation, with increased commercial and residential development, the industrial properties in the area will consequently get some spillover benefit from the added accessibility, as well as commercial and residential vibrancy of Woodlands,\" he said.\n\nTan Boon Leong, executive director of industrial services, project and sales, Colliers International, said he expects demand for the site to be healthy, given that land zoned for heavier industrial use is limited. The site could potentially fetch a top bid of between $90 and $120 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), he said.\n\nTaking the nearest comparison, the plot next to the site was sold for $161.02 psf ppr in July this year. That being said, the 1.68 hectare site boasted a unique feature - an integrated heavy vehicle park for a minimum of 80 heavy vehicle parking lots, which was excluded from the computation of the development's maximum gross floor area. In addition, the 80 lots could be sold as a single strata lot.\n\nAccording to Mr Tan, that was the first time the state has sold an industrial site where the heavy vehicle parking lots were not counted as part of the GFA, and also the first time the developer was allowed to have a separate single strata lot for the heavy vehicle parking lots.\n\nMr Ong said he expects the plot to attract about seven bids.\n\nSeparately, three other smaller plots in Tuas were also launched.\n\nPlot 33 has a land area of about 79,998.4 sq ft; Plot 36, about 79,994.1 sq ft; and Plot 37, about 76,606.7 sq ft. These sites have a lease of 21 years 6 months and a maximum permissible gross plot ratio of 1.0.\n\nColliers's Mr Tan said he expects the sites to fetch between $70 and $90 psf. Compared with earlier sites which ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 square metres, and were sold at about $90 to $95 psf, these sites may fetch a slightly lower price in psf terms given that the size is larger, he said. Mr Ong said he expects at least five bids for each site, with the top bid ranging from between $80 and $100 psf.\n\nThe tender for all four sites closes on Jan 10, 2014, at 11am.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its subsea division recorded an operating profit of US$30.8 million, treble the US$10.3 million of the previous year.\n\nAt the associate level, the group's offshore jack- up drilling business, held through its 33.77 per cent stake in Asia Offshore Drilling (AOD), swung to a profit of US$4.4 million, on partial contribution from a US$530 million contract with Saudi Aramco. Two jack-up rigs, AODI and AODII, started work on May 1 and July 13 respectively, while AODIII started its contract on Oct 10.\n\nAOD is managed by Norwegian offshore giant Seadril, which holds the remaining 66.23 per cent of the company.\n\nFor FY2013, Mermaid's management has recommended a final and special dividend of 0.36 US cent and 0.50 US cent per share respectively, or a payout of about 80 per cent of earnings. Mr Mahagitsiri said this was to reward shareholders who had believed in the company through the years, and he was hopeful the firm would do better in coming years.\n\nHe said that when he first took over as CEO, his priority was to build up a strong team, \"which is one of the first key assets\". The focus was to get the team to work like a family, he added, \"where we communicate and exchange information with each other as much as possible in coming up with solutions\".\n\nThe group then went on to secure US$690 million in contracts backlog, as well as some US$170 million in contracts for its newly built jack-up drilling fleet.\n\nAt least one broking house is convinced. CIMB, in a recent research report, has an \"outperform\" rating on the stock. It has projected FY2014 earnings growth of 1.9x year-on- year to US$43.4 million, and expects positive contributions from all segments.\n\nIt also expects Mermaid's earnings to be underpinned by its subsea order book of US$590 million, of which 48 per cent is expected to be recognised in FY2014. Based on CIMB estimates, Mermaid's FY2013 price-to-earnings ratio will drop from 28 times to 10 times and 9.5 times in FY2014 and FY2015 respectively.\n\nThe counter closed 2.5 cents higher at 42 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Secondly, it has ordered brand-new Airbus 330-300s, he told The Business Times in an interview yesterday.\n\n\"This particular period is exciting because we are launching our long-haul services. We've started flying to Dubai, and our plan is to ultimately roll out at least eight new aircraft over the next three or four years,\" he said.\n\nThe current fleet stands at 47 aircraft. If the airline's plans to extend its network of destinations are realised, it will double its number of international long-haul flights by the end of next year. He said he sees huge demand at both ends of the market in the long-haul space.\n\nThe airline is now flying its A330s to Singapore and South Korea, but the \"sweet spot\" for the A330s lies in longer flights of seven to 10 hours, he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are within that flight radius, and are the top two places where Filipinos are hired and re-hired; going by figures from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, 259,546 of them are deployed there. He said a key challenge in the airline business lies in managing over-capacity in the industry.\n\n\"You don't know how much capacity your competitors are putting in, so you have to manage the things under your control,\" he said, citing unit cost and service quality as controllable factors.\n\nCebu Pacific has ordered 49 new aircraft - 30 A321Neo, four A330s and 15 A320s - but these will be paced over an eight-year period to 2021. \"So it's not as dramatic as it sounds,\" he said. Some will be replacement aircraft, as older aircraft are disposed of.\n\nOf over-capacity, Mr Gokongwei said: \"Now that we are a significant player - with over 50 per cent of the domestic market and 17 per cent of the international market (flying out of the Philippines) - we would create problems for the entire industry, including ourselves, if we expand extremely rapidly from a larger base. So we are trying to pace new aircraft arrival with what we predict growth will be.\"\n\nHe said that historically, the Philippine airline industry has been growing by 15 to 16 per cent per year, but from a larger base now, and that constraints in capacity in Manila airport have cropped up. \"We think we have to plan for slower growth in the high single-digits.\"\n\nWith rapid growth over the past five years, the number of slots available for take-offs and landings at the Manila airport is now limited; already, no more slots are available between 7am and 7pm. \"Our advantage is that as the single largest airline, we already control the largest number of slots in Manila. There are opportunities to improve slot utilisation by using larger aircraft and by using the slots for international flights rather than just domestic flights,\" he said.\n\nOther solutions include building more traffic after 7pm or before 7am, and creating more hubs outside Manila. The airline now has six hubs for flights out of the Philippines, and growth is limited to perhaps another two, he said. \"The right thing to do is to increase the density in an operating hub, rather than introduce new ones, so that will be our focus,\" he added.\n\nIronically, his view is that competition among airlines in the Philippines has shrunk; the number of major players now stands at four, the other three being the Philippine Airlines group, the AirAsia Zest venture and the Tiger SeAir venture.\n\nAsked why Cebu Pacific was turning to the long-haul segment, he replied: \"We have done a good job building the brand domestically, then regionally, so the next challenge is building the long-haul market. \"We recognise that we are a point-to-point carrier, so our focus is to build that point-to-point traffic between hubs which have a heavy concentration of Filipinos, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\"\n\nThe carrier's Manila-Dubai flight was the first such direct flight for a Philippine carrier in 15 years. To tap the Japan market now under-served by low- cost carriers, Cebu Pacific plans to offer daily Manila-Osaka-Manila flights from next month, up from thrice-weekly flights now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/sustainable-and-effective-weight-reduction", "site_title": "Sustainable and effective weight reduction", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSustainable and effective weight reduction\n\nTaking a practical, comprehensive lifestyle approach will help reduce the risks of complications\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN most affluent societies, an increasing proportion of the population tends to be overweight or obese and hence it is not surprising that weight loss has become a common desire for many, both for aesthetic and medical reasons. Before jumping onto the weight loss bandwagon, understanding the latest American Heart Association guidelines published in November 2013 in the Circulation Journal provides one with a practical approach to the management of excessive weight gain.\n\nWho needs to lose weight?\n\nMany people who undergo weight-loss programmes do it primarily for aesthetic reasons rather than for medical reasons. From the medical view point, it is good to understand which individuals can benefit from weight loss. Most criteria for the definition of overweight or obese condition utilise the Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation. BMI can be calculated as weight in kilogrammes divided by the square of the height in metres. Current US definitions consider a BMI (kg/m2) of 18.5 to less than 25 as normal weight, 25 to less than 30 as overweight, 30 to less than 35 as class 1 obese, 35 to less than 40 as class 2 obese and 40 and above as class 3 obese or extreme obesity. These definitions categorise individuals into different risk categories for heart disease and obesity related conditions.\n\nOne of the important factors to consider before deciding whether the individual will benefit from weight-loss programmes is to determine whether there are pre-existing medical conditions. The overweight or obese individual has to be assessed for evidence of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. For those whose BMI is 25 to less than 35, a waist circumference measurement of more than 88cm (or 35 inches) for women and more than 102cm (or 40 inches) for men indicates an increased risk of heart and metabolic disease. Obese individuals are also more likely to have sleep-related problems as a result of obstruction to their air passages in the nose and throat region.\n\nThe latest recommendations state that those who will benefit from weight loss are those who are in the obese category with a BMI of greater than 30. However, overweight individuals (BMI 25 to less than 30) who have at least one risk factor for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, elevated waist circumference or obesity-related medical problems will also benefit from weight reduction.\n\nWeight management goals\n\nThe most important starting point for any successful weight management programme is to set realistic goals for weight loss. While it is understood that the greater the weight loss, the greater is the potential benefit, a realistic initial goal will be to set a target weight loss of 5-10 per cent within the first six months.\n\nSustainable weight loss regimes require a net energy loss by burning up calories in the body and reducing the calorie intake. It is recommended that a net energy loss of at least 500 kilocalories (kcal) be achieved daily. Depending on the physical activity of the individual, this can usually be achieved with a daily calorie intake of 1,200-1,500 kcal/day for women and 1,500-1,800 kcal/day for men.\n\nGenerally, very low-calorie diets (below 800 kcal/day) are only to be commenced under medical supervision. In some individuals with pre-existing medical conditions such as Gilbert's disease, the individual can become jaundiced within a few days of commencing on a very low calorie diet. As Gilbert's disease, a benign hereditary condition, has an estimated prevalence of 5-10 per cent of the population, proper assessment must be performed before commencing on such diets.\n\nComprehensive lifestyle approach\n\nA comprehensive lifestyle approach is key to successful weight loss programmes. Effective weight management programmes require that lifestyle adjustments be made during regular face-to-face visits of at least fortnightly frequency. Such programmes must include a reduced calorie diet with a planned daily energy deficit of 500 kcal or more, commencement of a regular physical exercise regime beyond the individual's usual activity level, and motivational drivers for adherence to a reduced calorie and increased physical exercise regime. Generally, a weight reduction of 5-10 per cent is achievable at the end of six months with adherence to such a programme. The weight loss will plateau and weight will stabilise after six months. Further weight loss will require adjustments to the calorie intake and physical exercise to maintain further net energy deficits.\n\nFor those who are unable to achieve or maintain a weight loss despite undergoing a comprehensive lifestyle programme, other adjunctive measures may be considered such as drug treatment with medication such as Xenical (orlistat).\n\nWeight reduction procedures\n\nThere are some who are unable to achieve a sustainable weight loss despite undergoing comprehensive lifestyle adjustment programmes. Those in this category who have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) or BMI of 35 or more in the presence of at least one risk factor for heart disease, weight reduction surgery (bariatric surgery) can be considered if there are no contraindications.\n\nBariatric surgery reduces weight by reducing the size of the stomach or by reducing the capacity to absorb food or by a combination of both. The combined approach surgery, also called the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, is considered as the \"gold standard\" weight reduction surgical procedure. The advantages of these surgeries are rapid weight reduction, significant decrease in death from heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. The net effect is a 40 per cent decrease in death. An analysis of several databases by Buchwald, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2004, stated that almost two in three had reduction in blood pressure, almost three in four had reduction in cholesterol and diabetes improved or resolved in five out of six. The Swedish Obese Subjects study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2004, showed that after bariatric surgery, there was a 72 per cent reduction in risk of heart disease at five years, with sustained benefits at 10 years and 59 per cent reduction in death from heart artery disease at 15 years. Bariatric surgery has also been shown to benefit obese individuals with impaired heart function resulting from obesity. As a result of the significant beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on diabetes, being an obese type 2 diabetes mellitus with BMI of 30 or more is now considered as one of the indications for bariatric surgery.\n\nSustainable weight loss\n\nThere is never an easy way to lose weight without restricting calorie intake and increasing physical activities. While becoming increasingly popular for removing fat, liposuction is not a recommended method of weight loss and it carries no evidence of sustainable health benefits and yet carries a real risk of serious complications, including death.\n\nUltimately, weight loss is a matter of will. I am reminded of an obese patient of mine who has been seeing me for 20 years. During his regular visit earlier in the year, he came for his regular review in my clinic and expressed delight with his significant weight reduction of more than 10 kilogrammes within six months. After 20 years of obesity, he suddenly took a decision to walk 45 minutes on his treadmill machine every morning and night, and made a conscious effort to restrict his calorie intake. The result was a healthier person with normal BMI, achieved purely by willpower. Remember that there is no easy way out, and spending thousands of dollars at a slimming centre or on slimming foods can rarely produce sustainable weight reduction without willpower.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

In the last three months, the travelling American couple have not directly spent a single red, government-backed cent to get here: they have paid for everything in Bitcoin, the virtual currency used by a few and understood by even fewer.\n\nYesterday, in this corner of Singapore, the pair ended the final and 102nd day of their experiment called Life on Bitcoin, after having made pit stops in Berlin and Stockholm to meet fellow Bitcoiners.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Beccy told BT: \"We've had people ask us, 'You've cheated, right?' But we haven't cheated at all.\"\n\nThe couple's experiment with Bitcoin - to be turned eventually into a documentary - started the day they returned to Utah from their honeymoon. To kick off the project, Beccy, who works with a data centre, converted her salary into Bitcoin. The couple paid their landlord in it. He took some persuading to accept this currency which is sent through the Internet - but not before taking a 10 per cent premium for his pains.\n\nIn their hometown, the couple persuaded a family-owned grocery store to take Bitcoin. To pay for petrol, they found a kindred Bitcoin spirit, an employee at a petrol station known to them only as Furb. They had to drive 80km from their home for the petrol though.\n\nThen came the time to start their travel. In the last three weeks, the couple have driven cross-country to New York City, from where they visited Stockholm, Berlin and then Singapore.\n\nAustin said: \"I was curious about how to become involved in Bitcoin because neither of us is a cryptographer, programmer or an economist. As a concept, Bitcoin is really interesting.\"\n\nTheir trip has been equal parts madcap and careful planning. Their flights and hotel accommodation were arranged though Simply Travel, an online travel agency that accepts Bitcoin.\n\nBut getting a meal in Stockholm proved challenging. They wandered the streets ravenous late at night, in search of a restaurant that would accept Bitcoin. At a Burger King outlet, they found their US-issued gift card - paid for with Bitcoin - useless.\n\nBeccy said of the Burger King staff: \"They were like, 'We don't even have a way to accept this'. We looked crazy.\"\n\nSince arriving in Singapore last Sunday, they have eaten at two cafes that accept Bitcoin. One of them, Artistry Cafe, has been doing so since July.\n\nWhere a direct Bitcoin transaction with a merchant is not possible, the couple rely on a fraternity of Bitcoin enthusiasts. In Singapore, a Bitcoiner helped them buy a local prepaid data plan for their cellphone in the conventional way, and accepted compensation in Bitcoin.\n\nThe couple's first Bitcoin transaction took place at a train station as they tried to get home from Salt Lake City's airport, post-honeymoon.\n\nAustin said: \"The first people we talked to had never heard of Bitcoin before, but we explained it to them.\n\n\"They said 'OK', and bought the train tickets, which we then bought from them with Bitcoin.\"\n\nThe experiment has been expensive: For the train tickets that cost US$18 in total, the couple parted with a physical Bitcoin - called a Casascius coin - worth US$45 then. Thanks to the rapid rise of Bitcoin's value, that coin is now worth about US$100.\n\nThe appreciation in Bitcoin's value that caused the couple to inadvertently enrich people in their wake made headlines in Norway recently. In 2009, engineer Kristoffer Koch bought US$24 in Bitcoin and promptly forgot about them. Four years later, that stash of Bitcoin rose to nearly US$886,000 in value, enabling him to buy an apartment in a swanky part of Oslo.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is approaching a full circle of sorts. It is now also available in physical coin and paper form, which contain \"private keys\" that give access to their digital value.\n\nFor all the pockets of euphoria about Bitcoin, the currency's value has a vexing tendency to plunge as suddenly as it spikes. In April, the price of a Bitcoin fell 70 per cent to US$70. Since then, the price has regained dizzying heights, trading at US$213 yesterday.\n\nCompounding the volatility, Mt.Gox - the world's largest Bitcoin exchange - has earned the unwelcome attention of the authorities, becoming the subject of several raids. At last count, more than US$5 million has reportedly been seized from Mt.Gox accounts by the US government.\n\nLittle wonder then, that in the button-down world of bottom lines and shareholders, large corporations have backed away carefully from the Bitcoin concept.\n\nAustin and Beccy found that for their project, buying a cellphone directly with Bitcoin was impossible. Austin said: \"If a company is large . . . they say, 'We'll need to address that to corporate headquarters and that can take weeks or months or years if we can even get the conversation going'.\"\n\nEven smaller businesses keep one wary eye on the vagaries of the Bitcoin world. Prashant Somosundram, owner of Artistry Cafe, puts a per-head cap on bills settled with Bitcoin. He told BT: \"I'm quite conscious that this is still very nascent and any small technical issues could wipe out everything.\"\n\nEven so, the going is good for now. In the last four months, 50 Bitcoin transactions have taken place at his cafe, which has seen the currency appreciate in value by 50 per cent.\n\nDespite the uphill battle that Bitcoin faces, the converted have grown more fervent, drawn to its decentralised nature and the fact that it is impossible to counterfeit and is relatively free of transaction fees.\n\nAustin said: \"After all the difficulties we've been through, I'm still very much a believer.\"\n\nSome time after the BT interview, a minor triumph was scored in Little India, where the couple convinced a henna tattoo artist to take Bitcoin as payment. \"Beccy is the happy new owner of a henna-tattooed arm,\" Austin told BT in an email update.\n\nSomewhere in Little India sits a mildly bemused owner of what might just be a piece of the future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It comes with retail amenities such as a mini-mart, restaurant/cafe and a medical clinic that offers services ranging from specialist consultation, diagnosis, basic treatment, observation and recuperation.\n\nWhile not the biggest development in Zaisan, Zaisan 18 is a unique and upmarket development that is targeted at the sophisticated crowd seeking the comforts of modern living and healthcare. The name \"Zaisan 18\" started off as a project name, which the client, who is in the goldmining business, later decided to adopt because of the number 18's association with prosperity.\n\nMr Lim explains that Ong&Ong Mongolia is one of the very few foreign architecture firms in Ulaanbaatar, and the only one from Singapore. \"The client was impressed by Singapore's rapid progress, so they wanted a Singaporean architecture firm to take on the Zaisan 18 project,\" he says.\n\nDesigned by Andrew Lee, another Ong&Ong director, the design concept was for Zaisan 18 to resonate with the rugged Mongolian terrain.\n\nZaisan 18 has two towers, where the apartments and communal facilities such as the gym, children's area, sky lounge and meeting rooms are housed. At the bottom of the two towers are the commercial areas, for the mini-mart, restaurant and clinic. It is expected to be completed in two years.\n\nMongolia is uncharted territory for Mr Lim, but even on his first visit, \"I fell in love with this fast emerging market.\"\n\nThe country is fast developing, with most of the activities concentrated in its capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Zaisan is located on the southern side of the city, in an area on the slope of a hill. \"It has clean air and blue skies, without the city noise and congestion - while flaunting a full view of the city,\" says Mr Lim.\n\nHe cites communication as a challenge when working there. \"The Mongolian language is not easy to master,\" says Mr Lim, who is getting informal lessons. When communicating with the locals, his friends and staff from the office help to translate.\n\nThe harsh weather is also new for him. Temperatures in the summer are about 30 deg C, but it can fall to as low as minus 40 degrees in the winter. Mr Lim has since cultivated the habit of checking the weather forecast and always being prepared. \"Thankfully, after some time, my body has adjusted to the weather,\" he says. He also had to get used to the food and culture.\n\nBut there are similarities between Singapore and Mongolia. \"Both countries are constantly working towards developing the population, improving infrastructure and providing a better standard of living,\" says Mr Lim.\n\nMr Lim is overseeing two more projects in Mongolia: Zaisan Towers, another mixed-use development and Steppez, a residential development project currently at its planning stage.\n\n\"The Mongolians are eager to learn and improve, and their enthusiasm attracted me to stay in Mongolia.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More should be done to preserve the interests of small investors and to give them at least a fighting chance in a market which is already dominated by house traders, proprietary desks and algorithmic players using super-fast computers.\n\nOne suggestion made by a remisier with 20 years' experience is worth considering. In an email to BT this week, he called for SGX to uniformly implement a stop-loss feature in its GL trading system for retail players and to constantly emphasise the need to use this feature in its educational seminars.\n\nA stop-loss level is the price beyond which losses will be too painful. So if someone buys a stock at $1 and will only tolerate a 10 per cent loss, then the stop-loss will be pegged at 90 cents.\n\nIn effect, having such a facility amounts to allowing each retail player to tailor their own circuit breaker based on their individual risk tolerance. In this way, every small trader has a better chance of preserving his or her capital and managing the finances.\n\nAccording to dealers, SGX's GL system does have a stop-loss option under the \"Tactics\" column on the trading screen but this is not activated for all houses. SGX should look at correcting this and at actively encouraging retail investors to use it in their day-to-day trading.\n\nA second suggestion is one that's been made in this column before, and that is to revive the cash market.\n\nFor those who remember it, this was a segment that existed for years throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, running in tandem with the \"ready\" and \"odd-lot\" markets. For reasons unknown, it was scrapped in 1994 and repeated calls over the years to resurrect it have not been successful.\n\nYet the cash market offered investors many benefits. It was a segment where scrip could be obtained at very short notice if cash was paid upfront. So where the ready market initially operated on (T+5) delivery before it was shortened to the present (T+3) in 2000, delivery in the cash market was (T+1), with T being the transaction day.\n\nHaving a cash market readily on hand offers retail traders many advantages. Perhaps the most relevant is that those with outstanding short-sold positions at the end of each day would not have to worry about the exchange forcibly filling those positions via its \"buying-in\" - a daily exercise which, despite having been fine- tuned over the years, is still criticised for being overly heavy-handed on inadvertent errors.\n\nWith a cash market, anyone who had oversold a position on date T could immediately fill it the next day and avoid being caught short on (T+3) - and thereby escape a potentially large loss when the exchange's buying-in was executed.\n\nIn addition, having a segment on hand where settlement and payment are based on (T+1) offers investors greater choice and flexibility in daily money management - surely an advantageous feature of any developed capital market.\n\nIt is important to note that a cash or immediate-delivery market would only complement - not replace - the exchange's buying-in process, because the latter would still be needed for positions that might not be covered via cash market purchases.\n\nSo if revived, the cash market would run in tandem with buying- in, simply offering market players a viable alternative to obtaining scrip at short notice.\n\nAgain, the main beneficiaries of such a segment would likely be retail players. In a market becoming more and more lopsided in favour of the big boys, this is surely a worthwhile pursuit.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The value of M&A investments in the world's high-growth economies has totalled more than US$723 billion since 2008.\n\nFreshfields found that the higher the stakes in a deal, the greater the chances of it hitting a problem. Thirty-eight per cent of the deals valued at US$2 billion or more encountered an issue, compared with 21 per cent of deals valued at between US$1 billion and US$2 billion, and 26 per cent of those between US$750 million and US$1 billion.\n\nRegulatory probes were the most common among the issues faced, affecting half of the troubled deals. Litigation impacted 35 per cent of the affected deals, while disputes such as activist protests and quarrels with landowners and employees were also prevalent, impacting 22 per cent of the deals.\n\n\"M&A deals in growth markets usually have a different risk/reward profile when compared to M&A transactions in more mature markets,\" said Freshfields corporate partner Stephen Revell. \"This research underscores the importance of thinking through the likely issues, and putting in place effective and resilient risk mitigation solutions. No deal team at any listed company wants to deliver the message to the board that its big emerging market investment has hit an unexpected and significant obstacle.\"\n\nNotably, there are particular markets in Asia that are more susceptible to difficulties during a transaction than others.\n\nIndia has proved particularly challenging, with 83 per cent of the deals there encountering problems - regulatory issues proved the biggest setback, affecting half of the troubled deals.\n\nMeanwhile, 60 per cent of deals that took place in Indonesia encountered a setback, while 25 per cent of deals in China faced issues.\n\nMr Revell said that, as the volume and size of deals in the region (in particular, South-east Asia) increase, buyers and sellers alike will have to react to the heightened risks of doing business in particular countries.\n\n\"As the developing markets in our region continue to grow, we will see far more large-scale transactions taking place. This means that the stakes are increasing for global players looking to expand their businesses in South-east Asia. They will need to pay particular attention to the specific challenges within a jurisdiction.\n\n\"Ultimately, the only way to mitigate trouble in deals is through an abundance of expertise during the execution,\" he said.\n\nOf the cross-border M&A deals that faced significant issues, Indian telecom giant Bharti Airtel's US$10.7 billion acquisition of Nigeria's Zain Africa in 2010 encountered four major hurdles. Nigeria's High Court declared its ownership null and void, the Congo Republic launched a regulatory dispute over its telecom licence, an employee attempted to block the sale, and the Kenyan government initiated a tax investigation.\n\nVodafone ran into trouble when it acquired Ghana Telecom in 2008. Dismissed Ghana Telecoms workers filed a writ of summons against Vodafone Ghana over termination of their appointments, the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office asked officials to investigate allegations of irregularities in Vodafone's African dealings, activists staged a protest, and the deal faced heavy government opposition.\n\nAnd US retail giant Wal- Mart faced opposition from the South African government when it acquired Massmart Holdings in 2010. After a two-year battle, Walmart had to set up a US$27.5 million supplier development fund for the acquisition to go ahead.\n\nFreshfields says there are six recurring themes that any investor should consider before making its move:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But for U-Theatre's artistic director Liu Ruo-Yu, it has resulted in a tangible piece of work - Meeting with Bodhisattva (literally meaning \"enlightened being\").\n\nThe production tells the story of a warrior who goes through the six stages of the path to self-actualisation, and the fears he has to overcome along the way. It is based on the teachings of the god of wisdom, Vajrasattva.\n\nLiu explains that she first got the idea after a 36-day meditation retreat that she attended on a small island just outside of Taiwan.\n\n\"During the retreat I saw my absurd inner self, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, and started to understand some new selves I hadn't seen before in my life,\" she says.\n\nShe then worked with U-Theatre's musical director, Huang Chih-Chun to put together a production of dance and martial arts movements staged in a simple and modest set inspired by the architecture of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, where the Dalai Lama used to live.\n\nMeeting with Bodhisattva was first performed at the Taipei National Theatre in 2002, and has since travelled all over the world, from the US to Hong Kong, Belgium, and Australia.\n\nTrue to its Eastern roots, the show makes use of chants, live vocals and recorded music. One unique feature it incorporates is the use of live percussion sounds created with a technique that U-Theatre developed where long sticks are used to beat drums instead of the traditionally shorter and heavier sticks.\n\nIt may sound rather simple, but perfecting this drumming technique was actually the biggest challenge for U-Theatre performers as they had to train themselves to integrate the long sticks into their martial art forms.\n\nOn her rationale for creating this production, Liu says it was meant as a reminder, not just to her audiences but also to the U-Theatre performers, that the journey of \"self-cultivation needs great courage, and a strong heart.\"\n\nMeeting with Bodhisattva runs at 8pm on Dec 6, at The Star Performing Arts Centre on 1 Vista Exchange Green. Tickets cost from $118 to $168. Log on to\n\nthestar.sg\n\nfor more information or call 9185 2076 to purchase tickets\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Recurrent net profit excludes acquisition, divestment and performance fees, as well as finance income and costs.\n\nReit management fees for the quarter and the first nine months grew 6 per cent to $27.9 million and 13 per cent to $84 million respectively.\n\nWhile no dividends were declared for the third quarter, management highlighted that the group would continue to sustain its dividend policy of paying a total of five cents per share per annum, comprising 2.3 cents as interim dividends and 2.7 cents as final dividends.\n\nThe fund manager had recently formed a strategic alliance with The Straits Trading Company Ltd whereby the latter bought a 20.1 per cent stake in ARA, making Straits Trading its largest shareholder, followed by ARA CEO John Lim and Cheung Kong Holdings.\n\nAt a press teleconference, Mr Lim said that it would be exciting times ahead for the group as it embarks on the next growth phase with the joint alliance. However, he said that it was too early to comment when asked if the Straits Trading Building, the shareholder's flagship office asset at Battery Road, would be injected into Suntec Reit.\n\nHe also said that the group was unlikely to relaunch its long suspended Dynasty Reit IPO in the next 12 months given the still weak market conditions. Instead, he said, the group would look at new markets in South Korea, Australia and Japan.\n\nThe Dynasty Reit IPO was suspended in late October last year due to weak market conditions and waning demand. The IPO would have been Singapore's first yuan denominated Reit offering.\n\nARA said that its assets under management (AUM) grew 3.6 per cent from Dec 31, 2012 to $23.4 billion as at Sept 30, 2013. With the Straits Trading strategic alliance, AUM growth is expected to be bolstered with $100 million in seed capital for a new development fund, as well as $830 million in a real estate portfolio to be managed on a separate account.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSmells like Brit spirit\n\nALTHOUGH its pedigree may have been overpowered by that of the French, the British perfumery industry in fact boasts an ambrosial history. From Grossmith, one of England's oldest perfume houses, to the successfully revived house of Penhaligon's, which has set up shop here at ION Orchard and Marina Bay Sands, British fragrance institutions are as highly regarded for their fine scents as they are for their storied heritage. Now, Atkinsons is another fragrance brand hoping to draw upon its 200 years of English eccentricity, style and impeccable manners to entice new devotees to its unique concoctions.\n\nAnd while Queen Victoria and Kate Middleton were said to have been inspired by The Nuptial Bouquet scent for their own wedding bouquets, why not try the house's signature blend, 24 Old Bond Street, as a primer to the marque? A cocktail of juniper, rose and black tea, deepened with an eccentric note of oak-casked whisky, this is as close to English elegance as you can get, short of a night's stay at Claridge's.\n\nUp-Scale jewels\n\nHERMES has long been known for its use of exotic skins, with crocodile being one of its most precious materials. After all, major fashion houses use only the top 10 per cent of the predators' skins, and with frequent snapping at one another being very much a part of a croc's life, harvesting bite-free, quality skins doesn't come easy. Now, the French luxury label has further elevated the status of the ferocious beast, unveiling a jewellery collection named Niloticus, inspired by the Latin name of the Nile Crocodile. Its fine jewellery designer Pierre Hardy has created rings, bracelets, necklaces and ear studs from mesh-jointed rose-gold scales, which move with the slightest tremble of its wearer. And as if to highlight the delicacy of the fine hinges, diamond studs adorn the corners where the scales meet.\n\nTaking 10 months of artistic and technical development to create, the pieces are wearable works of art. In particular, the Plastron necklace, a head-turning statement accessory studded with tourmalines, red jasper, water sapphire and peridot at its centre, took 420 hours to create. Who still covets a croco Birkin when you can flaunt such a decadent take on the exotic hide?\n\nKnotty and nice\n\nTHIS is so not an adaptation of Granny's favourite macrame wall hanging. Instead, fashion newcomer Joyce Wong has created a complex woven pattern for her signature dress, which accentuates one's hourglass figure.\n\nThe designer of the label Duo took eight hours to braid the embellishment by hand, and another 15 to hand-stitch it to the garment. Meanwhile, black side and back contrast panels create a visually slimming effect so you don't actually have to hit the gym to look like a wasp-waisted knock-out.\n\nThat's not all, the best part about spotting a design newbie is that insider cachet, which almost guarantees that you won't be seeing your hot new buy on just about everyone else. Ms Wong's body-flattering designs have only just been launched for the Fall/Winter season, after she honed her design skills working alongside a renowned Malaysian designer for the past four years. The Raffles Design Institute grad also crafted some artsy-looking necklaces for those who want to ease into this woven trend without breaking the bank.\n\nThrills afoot\n\nWITH the current reign of menswear e-stores, aspiring street-style blog stars and discerning old-world dressers alike could own a pair of John Lobbs or George Cleverleys with just a click of the mouse. So what's a home-grown footwear start-up got to do to stand out from the international competition?\n\nFor a start, the \"Goodyear-welted\" tag is practically de rigueur for any self-respecting men's shoe brand; and serves as a selling point for Singapore-designed label Atelier LLYER. (Aside to cobbling neophytes: note that the particular method of construction has nothing to do with car tyres). Rather than being glued, the technique requires for the outer and inner soles to be sewn together with a strip of material for waterproofing and durability.\n\nCryptic nomenclature aside (pronounced \"ley-yer\", the label is named after a Welsh mythological figure), the less-than-a-year-old company also boasts hand-finishing and the use of full-grain Italian calf leather for its upper and outsoles, all while maintaining a price range starting from $365 - practically a steal considering the price of a super-simple Celine shopper (sorry, ladies). Slightly more adventurous dressers can try the Tristan, a longwing brogue in muted-tan leather on grey suede. Its two-tone design and details like burnished toe and bevelled waist makes it perfect for a dandy-esque get-up, so show them off with ankle-hitting trousers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Oxley picked up the site, which houses six bungalow buildings known as 149 to 159 Jalan Ampang, at RM446.7 million (S$174 million) from an estate sale.\n\nThe group intends to redevelop the land, subject to obtaining all the necessary approvals, said Oxley yesterday. The site is in close proximity to Petronas Twin Towers, Suria KLCC, Grand Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, and various luxury condominiums, such as Four Seasons Place, Dua Residency, Binjai Residency and The Troika. There is also a diverse array of amenities including shopping malls, upmarket restaurants, nightspots and international schools.\n\nThe developer, which made its name in shoebox developments here, has within a few months groomed an impressive stable of overseas pipeline projects.\n\nThese include a mixed-development site which will proffer more than 3,400 residential units along with a mix of commercial, retail, leisure and educational facilities. It will sit on a site with a gross effective area of about 363,000 sq m, at London's Royal Wharf.\n\nOver in China, Oxley, through a 10 per cent stake in GD Capital, also has land use rights for two plots in the Xuancheng Economic and Techncial Development Zone in Anhui province.\n\nThe deal, which was valued at 35.71 million yuan (S$7.3 million), also allows Oxley to participate, with up to 30 per cent interest, in the development of five other land parcels in the same economic zone.\n\nThe developer marked its first overseas acquisition on May 29, when it announced that it had bought a Malaysia-incorporated company that had clinched the rights to acquire a 99-year-leasehold mixed-development site measuring about 1.9 hectares on Jalan Hang Tuah in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe deal, which was valued at RM267.9 million, was quickly followed by a 2.2 ha plot acquisition in Sungai Buluh in Selangor, which is zoned for commercial development.\n\nIncluding the latest acquisition, this brings to six the total number of its pipeline projects in Malaysia.\n\nAlso within South-east Asia, Oxley picked up three plots in quick succession in Phnom Penh in July and entered into a joint venture to develop a fourth. One of the sites picked up in July is to be amalgamated with another plot acquired in June; this brings the total number of pipeline projects in Cambodia to four.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oxley surprised the market by announcing that its net profit for the first quarter ended September surged to $250.8 million, from $6.6 million a year ago, on the back of a 13-fold leap in revenue to $686 million, from $50 million a year ago.\n\nOxley's counter ended trading yesterday up four cents at 47.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But operating expenses rose 9.5 per cent to $213.52 million from a year earlier resulting in operating profit falling 39.1 per cent to $5.33 million.\n\nItems contributing to higher operating expenses include staff costs (up 12.6 per cent at $98.84 million), repairs and maintenance (up 14.7 per cent at $28.33 million) and higher energy costs (up 2.7 per cent at $44.82 million).\n\nSBST is Singapore's biggest bus operator. The unit of land transport giant ComfortDelGro also runs a smaller rail network.\n\nEarnings per share were 1.15 cents, down from 2.04 cents in the same period a year ago. No dividend has been proposed.\n\nRevenue from bus operations climbed 8.7 per cent to $167.43 million on an increase in average daily ridership. But there was an operating loss of $880,000 - down from a $1.8 million loss in the same period a year ago - stemming from higher staff costs, repairs and maintenance costs, fuel cost, depreciation, premises costs and other operating expenses.\n\nRevenue from rail operations was up 8.3 per cent at $37.94 million on increases in average daily ridership and average fare.\n\nBut rail suffered an operating loss of $2.6 million - versus an operating profit of $371,000 previously - because of higher staff costs largely from the preparation for the start-up of the Downtown Line (DTL) and higher repairs and maintenance costs. SBST said that excluding DTL start-up costs, operating profit for rail would have risen 10.4 per cent to $2.5 million.\n\nRevenue from the advertisement and rental businesses was down 18 per cent at $8.44 million and up 15.3 per cent at $5.04 million, respectively. Operating profit for advertisements was 31.1 per cent lower at $4.76 million, while operating profit for rental was up 22.2 per cent at $4.05 million.\n\nFor the first nine months ended Sept 30, net profit was down 39.3 per cent at $9.52 million, though year-to-date revenue climbed 7 per cent to $632.95 million.\n\nEarnings per share for the nine-month period was 3.09 cents, down from 5.08 cents previously.\n\nThe group's net asset value per ordinary share was $1.11, unchanged from nine months earlier.\n\nSBST said it expected bus and rail riderships to increase at slower rates. Staff costs are also expected to be higher due to headcount increases, salary adjustments and increases in foreign workers' levy.\n\nWith the renewal and expansion of the bus fleet, depreciation and financing costs are expected to increase. More costs will also be incurred with the gearing up of DTL1.\n\nSBST shares closed two cents lower at $1.36 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding vehicles, retail sales fell 2.5 per cent.\n\n\"September car sales were boosted after the announced recategorisation of certificate of entitlements (COEs) - Category A will now have an additional criterion of 130 brake horsepower (bhp), which would push nearly half the cars in Category A to the more expensive Category B - as car buyers brought forward their purchases of affected cars,\" Citi economists Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan said in a research note.\n\nThis offset the negative impact from the government's introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework in late June, they added.\n\nCompared with a year ago, sales of motor vehicles and telecommunications apparatus and computers slumped 26.3 per cent and 13.4 per cent respectively in September.\n\nOther categories which reported lower sales included furniture and household equipment (-5.9 per cent) and wearing apparel and footwear (-1.4 per cent).\n\n\"The softness in sales was particularly concentrated in furniture and household equipment, and information and communications technology (ICT) products, and we think this is related to lower transaction volume in the housing market,\" said Barclays economist Joey Chew.\n\nCategories which chalked up stronger year-on-year growth in sales included food and beverages, up 5.4 per cent, and medical goods and toiletries, which were up 4.1 per cent.\n\nThose which saw lower sales in September over August include recreational goods, which went down 7.7 per cent, and wearing apparel and footwear, which fell 5.7 per cent.\n\nBarclays's Ms Chew noted that the volume of sales for the third quarter as a whole, stripping out cars and adjusted for inflation, was 0.8 per cent lower quarter-on-quarter (seasonally adjusted), owing to lower sales of luxury watches and jewellery.\n\nThis was likely to have been caused by waning expenditure by Asean tourists as a result of the strong Singapore dollar. Locals also appear to be curtailing spending on non-essential items, she said, noting the lower sales for ICT.\n\nHowever, Citi's Mr Kit and Mr Tan expect that the slight softening in consumption will be cushioned by the tight labour market.\n\nFor the Food & Beverage Services Index, sales of F&B services increased 2.2 per cent year on year in September, and inched up 0.4 per cent month on month (seasonally adjusted).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We had expected them to hold off for another month, but were happily surprised by the decision.\n\nMeanwhile, US data, while still difficult to read because of the government shutdown, was better than expected. A large majority of commentators are now arguing that \"good news is bad news\". In that line of thinking, good news on the economy is bad news for financial markets as it makes early tapering of asset purchases by the Fed more likely and we have seen over the summer what the effects will be. I think the \"good news is bad news\" argument will prove to be wrong.\n\n'Good news is bad news': rubbish\n\nMarkets have recently regularly responded negatively to good economic data, unleashing a new religion: the \"good news is bad news\" faith. In that line of thinking, good economic news triggers expectations of tightening of monetary policy, which is considered bad for markets for risky assets. The supporters of this view point at what happened after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke first mentioned tapering of asset purchases in early May.\n\nYields on 10-year US government bonds rose by 140 basis points over a four-month period. This was actually similar to the bond market's response to the unexpected rise in official rates in February 1994. That period has gone down in the history books as a savage bear market in bonds.\n\nThe rise in yields earlier this year had a big impact on capital flows in the world. Emerging markets saw large outflows and the S&P 500 lost 100 points (initially, and then recovered all of the lost ground, and more.) The good-news-is-bad-news school teaches that something similar will happen when the Fed actually tapers and strong data brings that moment closer.\n\nI think this argument makes no sense whatsoever. I have several reasons for this. First, tapering is not a matter of if, but of when. That makes the recovery of markets for risky assets after the Fed's failure to taper in September all the more surprising.\n\nWhy would holders of risky assets stay in them and, in fact, rebuild positions, knowing that the moment of truth is coming anyway, be it in December or a couple of months later? One would be pushing one's luck if one tried to stay until the last day before a big correction starts.\n\nMy colleague Nick Kounis has referred to the period following the first mention of tapering as a \"dry run\". Markets responded strongly and nervously, but in the end nothing happened, the Fed did not taper. The dry run gave everybody time to reflect.\n\nVirtually all emerging market economists that I have read responded by arguing that the negative reaction of the market was overdone as most emerging economies are in a much better position now than they were before previous US tightening cycles.\n\nMarket participants appear to have taken that view on board, and emerging equities have regained more ground than they had originally lost. So why would they panic again when the tapering actually starts?\n\nPushing up emerging equity markets in the meantime seems a stupid thing to do unless one is convinced of the argument that emerging economies will be better able than before to cope with a change in the direction of US monetary policy.\n\nA second argument for not fearing the tapering is what happened to borrowing costs during the various programmes of quantitative easing. Just before and at the very beginning of the first QE programme, US government bond yields fell sharply. That however, was largely an announcement effect. Bond yields subsequently rose during the programme.\n\nThe knee-jerk announcement effect of lower yields was much smaller in the case of QE2 and QE3. In fact, bond yields were higher at the end of QE2 than at the beginning and the same seems likely in the case of QE3.\n\nMuted impact\n\nThe conclusion I draw is that the effect of QE on bond yields is less impressive than people think and the reversal of the QE programme may equally have little impact.\n\nA third argument is that the Fed must have been unpleasantly surprised by the market's response to Mr Bernanke's remarks in May. As it turned out to have been only a dry run, the Fed can study the consequences carefully. One of their findings surely will be that the economy cannot cope with a rise in borrowing costs as large as occurred over such a short period of time and therefore the process of tapering must be cautious and well managed.\n\nMarkets for risky assets have done well in recent months and it is only natural that they would take a breather. But the case for risky assets remains overwhelmingly strong and is not weakened by the prospect of tapering in my view.\n\nAccelerating growth will improve credit quality and provide another push to profit growth. And with central banks now perhaps a little more mindful of inflation undershooting their targets, it seems very unlikely that they will follow a particularly restrictive monetary policy.\n\nThe combination of accelerating growth, easing inflation, at best modestly rising borrowing costs and return prospects for other assets looking unattractive, mean that the appeal of risky assets continues to be strong.\n\nThe writer is chief economist of ABN Amro Bank\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Another said that the issue had good institutional participation.\n\nThe initial indication was that the coupon would be in around 4.9 per cent, according to a term sheet sent to investors yesterday.\n\nThe subordinated, unsecured, non-cumulative, non-convertible perpetual capital securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for the bank and are Basel III-compliant.\n\nThe proceeds will be used for general business purposes.\n\nUOB, Credit Suisse, Nomura, Standard Chartered Bank and UBS are handling the sale.\n\nUOB's July transaction was the first Basel III-compliant issue by a local bank. The proceeds were used to redeem preference shares which were callable on Sept 16, 2013.\n\nBoth the July deal and yesterday's $500 million issue can be written down in full or in part upon notification of non-viability by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nUnder Basel III rules, bank investors must share the burden in the event of a bank failure before public money is used to rescue the bank.\n\nFollowing the 2008 global financial crisis, which saw governments bailing out many Western banks, regulators tightened rules to shift the burden of losses to investors.\n\nUnder MAS Notice 637 effective Jan 1, 2013, Tier-1 securities have a point of non-viability (PONV) loss-absorbing feature. What this means is that investors or debt-holders will have to face a partial principal writedown or conversion into common equity when the PONV is triggered by MAS.\n\nPONV is triggered when MAS decides that a bank is no longer viable, or when public sector support is required.\n\nDBS Group Holdings last week offered to buy back $800 million of an outstanding $1.7 billion preference share issue in exchange for new notes that will be Basel III compliant.\n\nExisting note holders can, via a tender, exchange at par the new notes, which will pay out 4.7-4.9 per cent, and has a call date in November 2019, DBS said.\n\nThe callable date for the existing preference shares is 2020.

Some 39 million travellers are expected on the roads between Wednesday and Sunday, centring on Thanksgiving Day, travel group AAA said.\n\n\"The timing of the storm could not come at a worst time,\" said Alex Sosnowski, Accuweather.com senior meteorologist.\n\nSnow on the flanks of the rainstorm is likely to cause travel delays in Boston, Columbus, Ohio, Pittsburgh and Buffalo, New York, while the storm's wind-driven rain will slow travel from Atlanta to New York, Accuweather.com said.\n\nLate on Tuesday, flight delays were reported in Charlotte, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Memphis and Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nWhere the start of the holiday travel period was smooth, travellers were bracing for trouble.\n\nAt New York's LaGuardia Airport, Terry Colley, 59, an operations manager for a company in Memphis, said he and his wife came to the airport four hours early in case of delays, although their fears were as yet unfounded. \"So far, so good,\" he said.\n\nAt Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest, Michelle Duncan, a 26- year-old graduate student from Chicago, arrived to spend Thanksgiving with a friend.\n\nShe expressed surprise that her trip had been relatively hassle-free. \"I'm sure tomorrow it's going to be chaos,\" she said.\n\nForecasters added that freezing rain was expected to coat the Appalachian Mountains in Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nMore than 30cm of snow could fall in western Pennsylvania, western New York and Vermont before skies clear today, they said.\n\nBut those clear skies will bring winds of 25-40 kph, gusting higher, and temperatures below freezing in the northeastern United States, said Bruce Terry, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service.\n\n\"We've got everything with this - real heavy rains, (at) the lower elevations a band of freezing rain, heavy snows and then behind it, wind,\" he said.\n\nThe giant character balloons in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York may be grounded if the winds are too strong.

The examples quoted were a Mouton Rothschild 1993 magnum and one of Trimbach's Riesling Clos Ste Hune 1981. Last week two more such bottles were enjoyed which so strongly exemplified this that they deserve to appear in this column.\n\nNuits St Georges 1er cru Les Vaucrains 1978, Domaine Henri Gouges\n\nNotes: Colour a transparent medium-hued orangey-red, with a magical and beautiful aroma, indeed an ethereal perfume of pure Pinot Noir with strawberries and a light touch of ripe oranges. Haunting. It made you return to stick your nose in the glass repeatedly. On the palate, a delicately light taste of perfectly ripe fruit, with a gossamer transparency. An exquisite wine.\n\nThe wines of Nuits St Georges are difficult to characterise, at least for me, compared to those of Vosne-Romanee, Chambolle-Musigny.\n\nThey are, to put it in a colloquial way, not quite \"user-friendly\", rather closed and tight in their youth, although unmistakably Pinot Noir in origin. They are therefore not as often seen on the table.\n\nNuits wines are not soft and lush like those of Vosne-Romanee, they do not possess the seductiveness and ethereal beauty of the Chambolle-Musigny. They are not deep and dense as those from Gevrey-Chambertin, nor do they show the soft fruitiness of the Volnays. They are Pinot Noirs with a gravity of countenance, always showing good minerality, but requiring lots of bottle age before they sing.\n\nStudents of Burgundy know that 1978 was one of the greatest vintages for both Burgundy and Bordeaux. It was the most recent great vintage to look for, in Bordeaux, red and white Burgundy. I recall scouring the lists and stocks of wine merchants in Central London - Loeb, Justerini & Brooks, Berry Brothers, etc - every time I happened to be in London at that time in the mid-1980s when this collection started. This was a truly great bottle, purchased while in London from the venerable old wine firm of OW Loeb. The only bottle left, sadly.\n\nHenri Gouges was Mayor of Nuits-St-Georges and his Domaine one of the oldest and most respected Domaines there. Its wines were never easy to approach when young, needing long bottle age. Now run by his grandsons Pierre and Christian Gouges, the Domaine's reputation remains capably upheld by wines which continue to be made in the same way.\n\nCorton-Charlemagne Grand Cru 1988, Domaine Joseph Faiveley\n\nOne of the last remaining bottles of a case purchased from the local distributor in 1991.\n\nI had opened the first few bottles when the wine was seven to 10 years old, and they were not ready. I put the rest away - and forgot about them. Last week scouring around looking for a mature white, I saw this bottle! Drank it last week with Cantonese cuisine.\n\nBright, shining light golden colour, its bouquet full of fresh ripe oranges announced a great chardonnay wine at the height of its maturity. Not a sign of age.\n\nFirst sip revealed a wine at the height of its development, delicate and refined in its texture, rapier-like in its freshness, very rich and intense on the palate, leaving a long lingering taste of dried orange peel. A beautiful Corton Charlemagne in full flight.\n\nThis wine from Faiveley came from the era of the elder Faiveley, Erwan's father Francois. I had in a previous column remarked on the great length of time that Faiveley's wines of the 80's and 90's needed in bottle to mature.\n\nThis Corton Charlemagne well exemplifies that at 25 years! On the basis of this bottle, it was well worth it. And that, in turn, raises the question, will the current style of Faiveley's wines develop with the same excellence that this bottle has? A question that can only be answered in another 25 years.\n\nThese two bottles also raise the same question discussed in an earlier column. How to get them and where? Regular wine merchants even the big ones in UK hardly stock these wines today.\n\nThere are a small handful of wine merchants who specialise in old vintages. Peter Wylie in the UK and Jan Paulson in Germany. Another source is wine auctions, such as Sotheby's and Christies. The big problem apart from availability is provenance.\n\nPeter Wylie and Jan Paulson are very careful about provenance. My experience with them has been favourable. With auction wines it would be advisable to check with the auction house.\n\nI know Sotheby's is very careful and their catalogues can be relied on. If more information is required, it is always available by contacting them by email or telephone.\n\nFinally there is a sure recourse but this is for the future. Buy young and store for 10 to 20 years. I am aware that most wine lovers here resort to wine-cooler cabinets. Purpose-built wine cellars are the exception, except with landed properties.\n\nApartment dwellers have the additional problem, apart from spare space, of the load-bearing capacity of the floor of their apartments, unless they happen to be on the ground floor. Having been there before, it would not be a good thing to happen to you to have a neighbour immediately below you complain about the cracks in his ceiling! Can be very painful on the pocket.\n\nI had suggested in an earlier column that the use of two wine-chillers of 100-bottle capacity each would seem a fairly attainable compromise. Designate one for current drinking and the other for long-term storage.\n\nAlso, if you buy in small lots, such as six bottles you could design a strategy. Decide to drink up to three or four bottles in the coming year, so as to check if worthy of long-term storage - and, of course, to enjoy them in their youth.imp Set aside the other three or four bottles for long-term storage, put a sticker on them: Do Not Open Before 10 Years -an invaluable reminder!\n\nA 100-bottle capacity would be able to hold 25 to 30 different wines for long-term maturing. I know of friends who possess three to four coolers, giving a reasonable storage capacity depending on individual capacity.\n\nWith the maximum size of 200 bottles, that allows for an 800-bottle cellar. Very adequate but well worthwhile to check floor-loading capacity in this case. Dealing with an angry neighbour below you is best avoided!\n\nOne final point. There are only great bottles, not great wines. Because there is bottle variation even with bottles from the same case.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be moving out of 77 Robinson Road. DTZ is said to have advised Rabobank.\n\nAt Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3, Booking.com has inked a lease for 45,000 sq ft. It is expected to relocate from its existing premises at Suntec City. CBRE brokered the deal.\n\nBT understands that another recent tenant which has signed up in the building, which was completed last year, is Gunvor. The Europe-based commodity trading group, which provides integrated trading products and logistics services for the global oil and energy markets, is taking 22,000 sq ft.\n\nAt Asia Square Tower 2, financial services firm Citco has agreed to lease 11,000 sq ft.\n\nChris Archibold, head of markets at Jones Lang LaSalle, said the Singapore office market is experiencing strong leasing activity for spaces under 30,000 sq ft, with demand coming primarily from smaller financial institutions, such as fund managers, and business consulting groups.\n\n\"Petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals are still strong. So is insurance,\" he added.\n\nThere is also good demand for clinic space, especially from specialists, in locations within 10 minutes' walking distance from hospitals. \"In the Orchard area, we're seeing clinics displacing office tenants in some buildings as doctors can pay $13-15 psf (per square foot) in monthly rent, compared with probably $8-10 psf for a typical office occupier,\" said Mr Archibold.\n\nWord on the street is that vacancies seem to be falling in a number of older CBD office buildings as existing and new tenants absorb space vacated by occupiers who have moved to newly completed projects.\n\nThis has led to landlords starting to push up rents. For instance, a year ago, Centennial and Millenia Towers were achieving monthly rents of $8-9 psf. Today, the figure is $10-12 psf.\n\nA seasoned office leasing agent said rents at older CBD office buildings were being driven up by leases for small areas. For instance, in buildings such as Six Battery Road and Tung Centre, signing rents are about $11-12 psf for areas below 2,000 sq ft.\n\nHowever, for bigger spaces, tenants enjoy lower monthly rental, by about 50 cents to $1 psf.\n\nAt Orchard Gateway, serviced office operator Regus is believed to have signed a lease for two floors, adding up to around 12,000 sq ft. The remaining 24,000 sq ft of office space in the development is expected to be signed up soon.\n\nMarket watchers believe rents are around the $9 psf mark for Orchard Gateway's office component, which is coming up on the former Orchard Emerald site and is expected to be completed around March next year. Savills is the sole marketing agent for Orchard Gateway.\n\nOpposite Raffles Hotel, where the South Beach Tower is expected to rise by early 2015, rents are said to be nearly $10 psf a month. It will have 34 levels of office space, adding up to about 520,000 sq ft of net lettable area. Floor plates will range from 15,000-19,000 sq ft.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle, the sole marketing agent for South Beach's office and retail space, confirmed that more than 100,000 sq ft of office space in the development was under negotiations but declined to comment on the Rabobank transaction.\n\nIn a report issued this week, Savills said the office leasing market will continue to favour landlords due to the improving occupancy rates of CBD Grade A buildings, currently hovering above 95 per cent.\n\nNet absorption of CBD Grade A office space for the first nine months of this year totalled 958,000 sq ft, slightly shy of the average annual take-up of nearly one million sq ft in the past five years.\n\n\"If the momentum in the leasing market continues in the last quarter, the net annual take-up of CBD Grade A office space is expected to surpass 2012's 1.17 million sq ft,\" it added.\n\nThe average monthly rental value for Savills' basket of CBD Grade A office buildings rose for the third successive quarter, increasing 0.7 per cent quarter- on-quarter to $8.48 psf in Q3. Savills said the average monthly rent for AAA Grade office buildings located mainly in the Marina Bay area stabilised at $10.29 psf, while those for AA and A Grade office space climbed to $9 psf and $7.94 psf, respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, with a resurgence of home equity lending, they're ready to pay for the best.\n\n\"People don't want granite countertops - they want marble costing at least 25 per cent more,\" said Mr Mroz, owner of Michael Robert Construction in Westfield, an affluent town less than an hour's commute to Manhattan. \"Money is so cheap today, people can splurge on US$1,000 faucets.\"\n\nSpending on home renovation is rising to record levels as banks such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase increase lending for home equity lines of credit, or Helocs, after US property prices this year gained at a pace not seen since the last housing boom.\n\nHeloc originations could rise 16 per cent this year and reach another five- year high next year, according to Mustafa Akcay, an economist for Moody's Analytics, powering the earnings of Home Depot and boosting the economic expansion.\n\nHelocs are making a comeback as the US housing market recovers enough to make the junior mortgages a safer bet for banks more than seven years after the beginning of the housing crash that saddled them with billions of dollars of losses.\n\nThe median price for an existing home probably will gain 11 per cent this year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, after plunging about 33 per cent during the crash.\n\n\"The biggest use of Helocs is renovations, and the biggest spur for renovations is Helocs,\" said Kermit Baker, director of Harvard University's Remodelling Futures programme in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"When the two fuel each other, it has an enormous impact on the economy.\"\n\nAfter home prices began rising last year, the number of Americans with negative home equity - those who owe more on their properties than they are worth - began tumbling.\n\nAt the beginning of last year, that was the case with almost 16 million home loans. By the third quarter of this year, that number had dropped to 10.8 million, property data firm Zillow said in a report last week.\n\n\"There is an increase in the amount people are willing to spend on their homes as the values go up,\" said Joe Emison, chief technology officer at BuildFax, a real estate data company. \"A lot of them feel in a better position today as the job market and the economy have improved.\"\n\nHelocs typically are held by banks in their mortgage portfolios rather than being sold in the secondary market to be securitised by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, common for primary home loans, said Keith Gumbinger, vice-president of HSH.com, a mortgage data firm in Riverdale, New Jersey.\n\nLenders use them as a hedge against rising rates because they rise in tandem with bank borrowing costs, Mr Gumbinger said.\n\nHeloc financing costs usually are tied to prime rates, the interest charged by banks to their most creditworthy customers, with the addition of a margin predetermined by the lender that often is around two percentage points.\n\nThe biggest Heloc holders are Bank of America, with US$81.4 billion in the third quarter, Wells Fargo with US$79.8 billion, and JPMorgan with US$70.1 billion, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\nHelocs were used during the housing boom to cash in on surging property values to spend on cars or take vacations. Often, lenders allowed the loans to exceed property values by 25 per cent on the supposition that home prices were only going up, Mr Gumbinger said.\n\n\"If you walk into a bank today and apply for a home equity loan, they are going to want to know what you're using it for,\" Mr Gumbinger said. \"In addition to requiring you to have the best credit and retain at least 20 per cent equity in your house, they want to know your intentions are good. No more using your home as a cash register to have some fun.\"\n\nUS banks hold US$529 billion of home equity loans on their books. That's down from a record US$674 billion in early 2009 as banks wrote off Helocs made worthless by foreclosures, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance.\n\n\"These loans usually are in second-lien position, so they don't recoup any money until primary mortgage investors get all their money back,\" Mr Gumbinger said. \"The money just disappeared as home prices went down.\"\n\nThe national average prime rate has been 3.25 per cent since the end of 2008, as measured by Bloomberg. The average rate for a US$30,000 Heloc was 5.18 per cent last week, the lowest since 2009, according to Bankrate, an interest-rate aggregator based in North Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 4.22 per cent from an eight-week high of 4.35 per cent, Freddie Mac said in a statement last week, as investors speculated that the Federal Reserve will keep buying mortgage bonds to push down borrowing costs.\n\nHeloc originations will increase to US$91 billion this year and rise to US$97 billion next year, according to an estimate by Mr Akcay, the Moody's economist. Both are the highest levels since 2008.\n\nIn 2007, banks originated a record US$310 billion in Helocs, Mr Akcay said.\n\nPatrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, said: \"The difference between today and 2007, besides volume, is the quality of loans. Banks were making really bad loans back then, with very loose standards. Today, they're more cautious.\"\n\nHome equity production at Bank of America for the first nine months of this year was US$4.4 billion, an increase of 69 per cent from the first nine months of last year when production stood at US$2.6 billion, according to Terry Francisco, a spokesman.\n\nVeronica Clemons, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, and Jason Lobo, a JPMorgan spokesman, said that their firms also have increased home equity lending, without providing specifics.\n\nThe gains won't be enough to offset this year's industry-wide plunge in loan refinancings, said Mr Francisco.\n\nApplications for mortgage refinancing fell 71 per cent to a four-year low between May and September, according to Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n\"We've seen the number of closed loans increase over the past year, but not to the point it could make up for the significant drop in refinancing,\" Mr Francisco said.\n\nRenovation spending this year probably will rise to an all-time high of US$146.1 billion, according to Harvard's Mr Baker. Last year, the spending was US$126 billion, he said.\n\nAccording to Remodeling magazine, a trade publication, most projects don't add the full cost to the value of the home.\n\nRemodeling a basement probably would recoup 70 per cent of the outlay when it's time to sell, and a family room addition likely would see a 63 per cent return.\n\nA major kitchen renovation is worth 69 per cent when the house is on the market, and a master suite addition will return 63 per cent, the publication estimates on its website.\n\nSpending on renovations is benefiting retailers who sell construction supplies. Home Depot, the largest, last week boosted its fiscal 2014 earnings forecast after reporting that its third-quarter profit was 43 per cent higher than a year ago. That compares with a 17 per cent year-over-year gain in the prior quarter, the Atlanta-based company said.\n\nMr Mroz, the New Jersey contractor, is working on a two-storey addition in Westfield that expands a home's kitchen and family room. Most of his customers last year wanted crawl spaces under additions as a cost-saving measure, Mr Mroz said.

Many of these diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in the area of heart disease involve the use of ionising radiation (harmful radiation) which includes X-rays and radiation from radioactive isotopes injected into the body. While the use of these diagnostic and therapeutic options with ionising radiation in the management of heart diseases have both been indispensable to physicians and beneficial to patients, resulting in decreasing death rates and prolonging survival, repeated exposure to significant doses of radiation may have adverse consequences.\n\nRadiation risks from cardiac procedures\n\nThere is no absolute consensus as to what the limit of radiation is that can be deemed harmful to the body although there is complete consensus that high radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer.\n\nMuch of the data on the impact of radiation on humans comes from the Life Span study (published in Radiation Research journal in 2007) which examined the survivors of the atomic explosions in Japan and who had a mean radiation dose exposure of 29 mSv; and the 15 Country Study on more than 400,000 radiation workers (published in British Medical Journal in 2005 and Radiation Research journal in 2007) whose average radiation dose exposure was more than 19 mSv. Both these studies demonstrated an incremental risk of cancer of about 2 per cent.\n\nThere is also epidemiological data from patients who have suffered a heart attack. In a publication in the American Journal of Cardiology in 2012, Canadian researchers reported on the radiation exposure for patients suffering their first heart attack during a 10-year period.\n\nThe paper showed a doubling of radiation doses over the years for patients who were admitted to hospital with an acute heart attack. This was due to an increasing trend to attempt to immediately open blocked heart arteries using balloon and stent techniques upon admission to the hospital - resulting in an average radiation exposure dose of about 12 millisieverts (mSv) within the first month of an acute heart attack.\n\nThe increase in radiation exposure is balanced by the life saving benefits of opening a blocked artery as quickly as possible. In the subsequent two years of the acute heart attack, the average cumulative radiation in this study group from heart scans and procedures was about 19 mSv.\n\nIn an earlier 2011 publication by the same team of Canadian researchers, from 1996 to 2006, of the close to 64,000 patients in the study who had their first heart attack, slightly more than 12,000 (about 19 per cent) were diagnosed to have new cancers. The authors concluded that increased exposure to radiation from cardiac procedures was associated with an increased risk of subsequent cancer. The authors estimated that for every 10 mSv of harmful radiation, there was a 3 per cent increase in the risk of cancer over a five-year period.\n\nBenefits of cardiac diagnostic procedures\n\nHowever, the risks of radiation exposure have to be compared to the risk of dying from a heart condition. In a 2012 publication in the European Heart Journal which examined radiation from cardiac imaging, the authors provided estimates of cancer risk from cardiac procedures as compared to risks from underlying heart disease.\n\nFor example, males in their sixth decade with no symptoms but who have more than one risk factor for heart disease, the 10-year risk of dying from heart disease is 1,000 per 10,000. For these patients, the lifetime incremental cancer risk resulting from radiation exposure from a low-dose cardiac imaging test, such as a low radiation dose coronary CT angiogram using the appropriate techniques, is about 2 per 10000.\n\nSimply put, in this example, if 10,000 patients with this profile were to undergo a low radiation dose heart scan, 1,000 heart deaths may potentially be prevented at the risk of two additional persons developing cancer. While the calculated risk from radiation is a lifetime risk, the heart risk given in this example is only based on a 10-year risk and hence, will also increase substantially when a longer period is considered.\n\nFor patients with chest symptoms, the likelihood of finding significant heart disease is much higher than in those with no symptoms. Hence, the benefits of doing heart scans when compared to radiation risks are even more substantial.\n\nBenefits and risks of therapeutic cardiac procedures\n\nCardiac procedures that are used to treat heart conditions may sometimes carry significant risks. In a recent 2013 editorial in Circulation Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology journal, the author addressed the issue of treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), the commonest abnormal heart rhythm in the elderly.\n\nAs AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, one of the techniques currently being used is radiofrequency ablation which involves the insertion of catheters into the heart and burning a ring around the heart tissue to isolate foci which trigger AF. However, in recent years, concerns have been raised about the presence of asymptomatic strokes following radiofrequency ablation, with a reported incidence of asymptomatic stroke as high as 39 per cent. In a worldwide survey by Cappato published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in 2009, the major complication rate was 4.5 per cent. For every 10,000 procedures, there were 15 deaths, 23 major strokes and 71 transient strokes. In addition, the success rate is about 2 out of 3 and there is a high rate of recurrence of AF following radiofrequency ablation.\n\nHence, given the risks of the procedure and the high recurrence rate, medication should be considered first before considering radiofrequency ablation as an option. In contrast, there is very little doubt that opening the blocked heart artery during an acute heart attack with balloon and stent techniques has substantial benefits for the patient as compared to the risks.\n\nGolden rules\n\nWhen you are required to do a heart test or procedure, do remember a few Golden rules: Firstly, when a diagnostic heart test is required, a non-invasive option which has no harmful radiation is preferred.\n\nSecond, if blockage of the heart artery is suspected, always opt for a non-invasive test first before considering an invasive test.\n\nThird, if invasive coronary angiography is proposed to confirm the presence of significant blockage of the heart artery, a CT scan of the heart arteries may be considered as an alternative as it is non-invasive. For young adults and women, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the heart arteries, if available, will be a good alternative for women and young adults as the procedure carries no radiation risk and does not require any injection.\n\nFourthly, before undergoing any non-invasive scan of the heart that has harmful radiation, it may be good to understand the amount of radiation exposure from the test.\n\nLastly, if you are undergoing a heart procedure, you may want to understand the risk of both major complications and the risk of \"silent\" complications such as \"silent\" strokes. While the \"silent\" strokes may not be obvious, they can contribute to memory and cognitive impairment in later years.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

They took everything - everything that we had - including clothes, toiletries, electronics.\"\n\nThey also took the ship's cargo. The Maltese-flagged vessel was carrying about 10,000 tonnes of fuel oil belonging to France's largest oil company when it was attacked by 15 pirates off the coast of Gabon in West Africa. The hijackers kept control of the tanker for seven days as they siphoned off the fuel.\n\nWhile Total SA eventually got its fuel oil back with the help of Ghana's navy, Mr Varma's story is becoming increasingly typical as Africa's west coast replaces Somalia as the world's most piracy-prone area. The attacks, which are getting more frequent and more violent, threaten shipping in sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil-producing region.\n\nWest Africa's Gulf of Guinea had 40 piracy attacks in the first nine months of the year, compared with 10 incidents in waters around Somalia, according to data from the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre (IMB PRC). As well as stealing from ships, kidnappings are on the rise. Last month, two US citizens were seized from a supply ship before being released after more than two weeks.\n\n\"Initially they were interested in holding the ships, stealing the cargo, taking this ship's crew possessions and money, and leaving,\" said Roy Paul, a director at Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Program. \"This year, we've seen an increase in taking hostages\" for ransom.\n\nNigeria, Gabon, Ghana and other countries around the Gulf of Guinea produce more than 3 million barrels a day, or about one-third of Africa's output, according to data compiled by BP Plc. The region's crude, often so-called sweet grades that are refined into high-value motor fuels, is shipped to refiners in the US, Europe and Asia. Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea are also leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters.\n\nThis year, piracy has spread through the region from Nigeria, where theft from ships has long been common, and ships are being attacked further offshore, according to the IMB. Boardings or hijacks have been reported off Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Guinea.\n\nPiracy's rise in West Africa has been mirrored by its decline off Somalia, where kidnappings spurred a response from shipowners and Western governments. The deployment of warships and the use of armed guards has resulted in the number of incidents plunge this year.\n\nThe use of private security may be less appropriate in the Gulf of Guinea because the pirates are more violent, said Jan Fritz Hansen, who chairs the piracy task force at the European Community Shipowners' Association.\n\n\"They are becoming more and more organised,\" Mr Hansen said in an interview. \"You can't really rely on private armed guards. It should be a stronger force from governments. The criminals down there are a bit better equipped and armed.\"\n\nInternational oil companies exporting from the region are taking steps to protect ships from attack. \"We take extra precautions on all our LNG tankers for security,\" said Andrew Gould, chairman of UK- based producer BG Group Plc, which exports all of Equatorial Guinea's natural gas. \"We have a procedure in place.

Ms Yingluck might, analysts say, seek to bolster her legitimacy by calling an election she would likely win, as Thaksin has done before, but that could be risky.\n\n\"She would first need to be absolutely sure there were no undemocratic forces preparing to fill the power vacuum that would be created,\" said Kan Yuenyong, director of the Siam Intelligence Unit think-tank. \"Right now, it's brinkmanship. The other side knows an election would only create another Thaksin government . . . The best scenario for both sides is negotiations, but the problem is, they don't trust each other.\"\n\nThe uncertainty is driving foreign investors out of Thai financial markets, making the baht the second-worst performing emerging Asian currency in November, having lost 2.7 per cent this month. Thai stocks have retreated about 6 per cent.\n\nA court issued a warrant yesterday for the arrest of Mr Suthep in connection with the raid on the Finance Ministry. Together with former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, he has been charged with murder for allowing troops to open fire in 2010 protests by Thaksin's supporters.\n\nA year later, their Democrat Party was routed in an election that swept Ms Yingluck to power. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Another 21 airports are to be built within a decade.\n\nOverseas interest in Indonesia has been rising for years.\n\nFrance's Vinci, Germany's Fraport AG, South Korea's Incheon, Japan's Mitsubishi Corp and Sojitz Corp have recently approached Indonesian companies about possible investment opportunities, said two senior officials with state-owned air operator Angkasa Pura I.\n\nBut no foreign firm has been able to grab a major stake in any of Indonesia's major airports due to restrictive government regulations and land acquisition issues. The country's airports are currently operated by either the government or state-owned companies. \"Many foreign companies have come to us. They are asking and waiting for their opportunity,\" Tommy Soemoto, president director of Angkasa Pura I, said earlier this month. \"It is up to the government now.\"\n\nIndonesia's airports are on a \"negative investment list\", which limits foreign involvement in areas deemed sensitive. Under the regulations, foreign companies are limited to owning no more than 49 per cent of domestic airports.\n\nIndonesian officials have proposed removing airports, ports and airport services from this list to help revive a slowing economy. The measures need the approval of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.\n\nIndonesia's investment chief Mahendra Siregar said that minor details of the proposal were still being finalised, and should be approved in early December.\n\nIndia's GVK Power & Infrastructure said that Indonesia's plan to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in airport development would \"facilitate not only capital infusion but also the much needed management, technical and operation expertise\". India's largest private airport operator is expected to become the first foreign company to hold a major stake in an Indonesian airport when it teams up with Angkasa Pura I next year to build a second airport in the central Java city of Yogyakarta.\n\nThe US$700 million project is expected to be finalised next year with operations starting as early as 2017.\n\nAngkasa Pura I also hopes next year to spin-off five of its most profitable airports, including the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali, to enable foreign investment for its expansion plans, Yudhaprana Sugarda, head of corporate planning, said earlier this month. \"Up to 900 new planes will be delivered into Indonesia in the next decade,\" he said. \"We must seek cooperation to improve our infrastructure to be ready.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Ship owners ordered large numbers of new vessels between 2007 and 2009, just as the global economy ran into its biggest crisis since the 1930s.\n\n\"A big chunk (of the shipping portfolio) will go into the bad bank and the intention is to sell it down as quickly as possible,\" one source said. \"They will definitely also exit a number of relationships, even on performing loans. It will be a much smaller exposure for a much smaller bank. This is coming from outside of the shipping business.\"\n\nThe sources said that an estimated US$4 billion to US$5 billion of shipping loans are expected to go into the bad bank, with the total shipping portfolio now standing at an estimated US$16 billion.\n\nRBS declined to comment on its shipping business on Friday.\n\nThe bank, 81 per cent owned by British taxpayers, said this month that it would create an internal \"bad bank\" to fence off its riskiest assets, part of a series of measures designed to heal its relationship with the government and speed its eventual privatisation.\n\nTrade sources last week said that RBS was in discussions to sell a shipping loan worth close to US$800 million.\n\nBritain aims to offload its stakes in RBS and state-backed rival Lloyds Banking Group as soon as possible, having pumped in a combined \u00a366 billion (S$132.6 billion) to keep the banks afloat during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEarlier in the week, sources said that Lloyds had sold between US$500 million and US$550 million of shipping loans after divesting a separate US$750 million tranche last year.\n\n\"RBS may try the Lloyds approach to selectively sell or package loans down the road - US$500 million now, US$500 million in six months - and get the best pricing, especially if the market keeps improving,\" another source said. \"Or they could select the most toxic assets in the bad bank and have a fire sale, get 20 per cent on the dollar and take a huge loss on a small part of the toxic stuff. That would help their overall ratios and buy some more time. It's a huge portfolio and it would be very difficult to sell wholesale.\"\n\nSeveral European banks including RBS and Lloyds are seeking drastic reductions to their shipping loan portfolios as they clean up their balance sheets to become less risky while regulators demand that they hold more capital.\n\nRBS had been among the top lenders to the sector, with its shipping boss, Lambros Varnavides, one of the industry's most influential players. Mr Varnavides helped the bank to build a particularly strong presence in the lucrative Greek market.\n\nSeveral industry sources said Mr Varnavides is expected to retire soon. RBS declined to comment.\n\n\"Lambros has been such a huge industry figure for so long. It is unclear who will be his successor or whether there will be another separate head of shipping,\" a source said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The ratings remain on CreditWatch with negative implications.\n\n\"We lowered our ratings to reflect FSL's increasing liquidity pressure resulting from its covenant breach,\" said S&P.\n\nThe agency changed its liquidity assessment to \"weak\" from \"less than adequate\", according to its criteria, where a company with \"weak\" liquidity assessment should be rated \"B-\" or lower.\n\n\"The ratings remain on CreditWatch because of the limited clarity over FSL's treatment of its bank loan covenants and its bank relationship,\" it added.\n\nFSL said on Nov 14, 2013 that it had not met conditions for the extension of covenants relaxation dated July 31, 2013.\n\nIt is also in discussion with lender banks about conditions relating to that extension. The auditor report released on the same day also said that the company had breached covenants on its debt service coverage ratio as of Sept 30, 2013, even if the relaxation extension is deemed effective.\n\nThe company had reclassified its loan balance of US$388 million from long term to current liabilities to reflect the possibility of lenders accelerating the loan.\n\nS&P's credit analyst Katsuyuki Nakai said: \"In our view, these events significantly increase the uncertainty on FSL's short-term liquidity. We believe FSL will continue to face earnings pressure in the fourth quarter because of expected costs for redelivery of repossessed vessels and other technical works.\"\n\nS&P added: \"We expect to resolve the CreditWatch after we get more information on FSL's liquidity situation. We need to assess its extension and renegotiation on the bank loan covenants and its relationships with lender banks.

So it is with both excitement and some sorrow that theatre lovers get to see the last title of the much celebrated series next week.\n\nAdapted from a short story by Can Themba, The Suit is an unusual tale of infidelity set in the apartheid era of 1950s in South Africa.\n\nNonhlanhla Kheswa plays a woman who is married to an honest man played by Ivanno Jeremiah. One day, he comes home to find her in bed with another man. The latter flees in his underwear, leaving his suit behind.\n\nInstead of throwing away the lover's suit, the cuckolded husband decides to punish his wife by insisting that she keep the suit and bring it with her wherever she goes. The suit becomes a painful reminder of the woman's infidelity and eventually tears their union apart.\n\nActor Jordan Barbour plays the man's best friend who becomes the story's moral conscience as he witnesses the tragedy unfold but can't decide how he should help the couple.\n\nHe explains: \"This is no ordinary story of infidelity, because it is set in South Africa, where the horrible discrimination that the blacks face affect the way they treat each other.\n\n\"Here, the man chooses to not physically abuse his wife because, in a way, he wants to rebel against his oppressors' methods. But instead, he ends up playing this mental game of humiliation with her as a way of getting back at her, which ultimately brings about the same kind of destruction to their lives.\"\n\nAs an African-American, Barbour says that he understands how the history of subjugation and humiliation runs deep in the psyche of black South Africans.\n\n\"In America, it's common for black kids to receive spanking and beating from their families. Scholarship points to the beating of black slaves by their slave masters, and how these black slaves in turn beat their children, who grow up and beat their own children . . . The cycle of violence becomes commonplace and not questioned.\"\n\nCrucial to the production of The Suit is the live band on stage, which plays a wide range of music from Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday to Schubert.\n\nBarbour says: \"Music was remarkably important to the South African people because it helped them survive, it helped them smile through this horrible thing that they were going through. Hence, The Suit is told with a lot of music and singing - which doesn't so much support the storytelling as to be a crucial element in the story.\"\n\nBarbour gets to sing only one song - but it's perhaps the most affecting number of them all: the classic song Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday, which is about the lynching of blacks by whites racists in America's south.\n\nThe lyrics go: Southern trees bear a strange fruit/ Blood on the leaves and blood at the root/ Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze/ Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.\n\nBarbour says: \"The story of The Suit may be quite unique to this specific couple. But the story of struggle is not, and the story of subjugation is not, and the story of colonialism and imperialism is not.\"\n\nThe Suit directed by Peter Brook and presented by the Esplanade and the Singapore Repertory Theatre plays at the DBS Arts Centre - Home of SRT, Robertson Quay, from Nov 22 to Nov 25, Fri-Mon: 8pm, Mon and Sat: 4pm.

The British brought with them to Singapore Scotch whisky (naturally!), gin, cognac, port, champagne and French red and white wines. And British dining culture. For readers too young to know what that means, it meant that the evening would generally begin with cocktails, or brandy or whisky with soda, or the ubiquitous gin and tonic, champagne being considered a great luxury and reserved for very special occasions, eg birthdays or weddings. Dinner would then begin with a sherry, usually a dry amontillado to accompany the soup, almost de rigeur. This was followed by a white, a burgundy generally, with the seafood. A red, usually Bordeaux, would be standard practice with the main (usually beef or lamb) course.\n\nThe next and very civilised custom would be the after-dinner practice of retiring to the library for port with cigars or cigarettes while the ladies retired to the dressing room to repair their make-up. Standard English culture; all by the book. Boring? Not really at the time. For us natives, rank amateurs, all this dining culture was totally foreign, but very useful and stands us in good stead when travelling in Europe.\n\nFast-forward three decades and the scene here has changed beyond recognition. Wine is part of the dining culture today as we know it. To say we have become more sophisticated in our dining culture smacks of elitism and smugness. Rather, it is that we do not even think about it and drink wine as we would water. The results are very interesting. Take the subject of wine and food matching. Those of us who first tiptoed into the wine culture three decades ago were given to understand that you do not drink red wine with seafood as the tannins in red wine would clash with some substances in seafood, especially seafood with shells. This we duly noted and kept the faith. Red wine with red meat was another dictum which was \"no sweat!\" as that was what we liked to hear. And so on . . .\n\nNow. what has happened is that as our experience with the use of wine with food grew, our tastes and perceptions began to change, undergoing adaptation and acceptance. This phenomenon of adaptation is well-known and understood. A sensory experience initially perceived as unpleasant, distasteful, or even painful, if experienced repetitively and for a long-enough period, becomes tolerable to varying degrees, and sometimes to the extent of eventually being perceived as the norm. One's sensory capacity comes to accept the new environment as the norm. Thus, the sensory clash between oysters, for instance, with anything else other than a dry white wine, eg Chablis, becomes tolerable, acceptable, allowing therefore drinking a red with shellfish.\n\nTo a varying extent, we have formulated our own rules, which in many cases are more of personal rules, the result of our individual experiences with adaptation. The new adage, \"drink the wine you like with the food you like\", has replaced the ones we were initiated with, \"white with seafood, and red with red meat\" and \"no red wine with shell fish\". With that new acquired culture and new approach to the subject of wine with food, anything goes - almost! One cannot go far wrong if you drink the wine you like with the food you like because you will mentally and sensually accept the combination and think that is the norm, even if at first it jars. Because you want to eat the food you like with the wine you like. And that is the driving reason. Deriving from my own experience, it is almost as if I was dealing with the different tastes with two difference centres in my brain.\n\nTake our fondness for spicy foods or chillis and accompanying them with wine. \"Mon dieu!\" the French would say. I have long held the view that we, Asians, who are used to spicy chilli-hot food and who drink wine with it, have developed a most useful mental capability of evaluating the taste of the wine against a background of spicy hot tastes. It is as if we use two different parts of the sensory cortex, one that handles and interprets the sensory reception of nerve impulses set off by the taste of curry, and a separate one which does that for nerve impulses set off by the wines. At least, it seems to me that is how my brain behaves! I can sense the taste of curry in the background as I drink and taste the wine. It always appears to me that I am using two different parts of my brain.\n\nHow does this impact our dining culture? Quite simple. We do not hesitate to drink what we like with our meals. Take sashimi. I like sake but I do not know enough about it - something to be rectified in the near future - and besides this, it is drunk in small mouthfuls which does not quite quench one's thirst after the wasabi. So wine it is. Fish. White wine? Yes, of course, but red? The obvious answer is \"Pinot Noir\". Its soft tannins do not clash with the fish.\n\nI am reminded of our experience with a very famous tempura chef in Osaka. The first time I went there, two years ago, I spotted on the kitchen counter behind him a bottle of German Pinot Noir among the sake, a Friedrich Becker Spaetburgunder. Right place for dinner! When asked for wine/sake choice, I pointed to the Becker Spaetburgunder, asking if we could have that. It turned out that it was not on the restaurant list but was the chef's personal wine! My spirits sank. But back came the cheerful reply: \"Yes, of course!\" It was a lovely German Pinot Noir; we drank just about two-thirds of it and left the balance to the chef. All I can remember of the wine was that it was a typical Becker Pinot Noir, and very good indeed if you adjust your mental band-wave and do not expect a Burgundy red.\n\nPost-script:\n\nLast year, we went back to Osaka and to the same tempura restaurant. I brought the chef a French Burgundy, Nuits St Georges 1er cru Clos de la Marechale 2006, Domaine J F Mugnier.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tea industry creates employment for almost two million people, or 10 per cent of the population, directly and indirectly. Export earnings in 2012 contributed 17.5 per cent to government coffers and at US$1.5 billion, it's the highest among all tea-producing countries of the world.\n\nIn terms of global production, Sri Lanka is the fourth largest manufacturer of tea after China, India and Kenya, but it's the second largest tea exporter after Kenya since China and India have a large domestic consumption.\n\nMost of the tea (76 per cent) is produced by smallholders while 24 per cent is produced on corporate estates. For now, the majority of Sri Lanka's teas are shipped to Russia and the Middle East. Japan is also a key market.\n\nValue-added tea exports - which encompass the blending, bagging and branding of teas - account for 45 per cent of Sri Lanka's total export volume, which is about 22 million kilos of teabags a year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Higgs managed some US$250 million and invested in energy, metals and agriculture markets, Mr Shear said. \"Over the life of the fund, we made money,\" he said. \"Our closing is largely a factor of redemptions that are happening in the commodity market and lack of stability of our capital.\"\n\nThe fund could have continued to manage money into next year but would have had to cut expenses and restructure the fund, the pair said in the note. This would result in having to change the product that it had initially marketed to its clients as well as its \"strong risk management culture\". \"These changes would have handicapped our performance going forward which would have been detrimental to existing investors and employees.\"\n\nMr Shear and Mr Bourlot are long-time commodity traders. Mr Shear spent 25 years at Morgan Stanley where he helped build the firm's commodity trading business until his departure in 2008. He joined UBS in 2010 for a short time after working for more than a year at private equity fund Apollo Global Management.\n\nMr Bourlot headed agriculture trading at Morgan Stanley before he moved to UBS as global head of commodities. He departed at the end of 2011 after about 18 months.\n\nThe pair left UBS to start Higgs, which was based in London.\n\nIt has been a tough year for the commodity investment community as a whole.\n\nBanks faced unprecedented regulatory requirements and hedge fund investors sought to redeem capital from underperforming funds. Low volatility has plagued markets, adding to sluggish returns.\n\nHedge Fund Research Inc, which tracks funds' performance, said that losses in commodities have forced its HFRI Macro Index down 2 per cent through the third quarter.\n\nLondon-based commodity fund Clive Capital, which primarily traded oil, announced that it was closing in September, citing a lack of investment opportunities. That same month, commodity fund Arbalet Capital, run by 30-year-old Jennifer Fan, announced it was shutting, citing investor redemptions after slack returns.\n\nLarge banks, once active and profitable in the sector, announced this year they would sell off physical commodity businesses, pressured by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Morgan Stanley announced that it would sell its global physical oil trading business to Russian oil giant Rosneft, after much conjecture throughout the year of what the bank might do with the business in the face of declining returns.\n\nIn July, JPMorgan Chase & Co said that it would exit its physical commodities business, due to regulatory pressure.\n\nEarlier this month, Deutsche Bank said that it would close its global commodities trading business and cut some 200 jobs as it faced increased regulatory scrutiny and pressure to hold onto capital.

Without the exemption order, it's an all-or-nothing approach.\"\n\nThis would have meant that consumers could miss out on relevant marketing information from service providers with whom they have existing relationships, such as credit card issuers who offer promotional deals with certain retailers.\n\nMr Leong, addressing the storm of criticism about \"back pedalling\" from consumers and also the consumer body Case, said that without the exemption order, businesses would have \"too many lists\" to check. \"The exemption order is least disruptive to consumers and businesses,\" he said.\n\nWith the DNC Registry and the exemption becoming effective this Thursday, consumers who register their phone number signal that they do not want unsolicited calls, messages or faxes from telemarketers. Businesses must check with the registry - on pain of penalties for failing to do so - to ensure that they do not disturb consumers on the list.\n\nThe exemption introduced last week allows businesses with \"ongoing relationships\" with these consumers - say, as providers of credit cards, insurance or home loans - to send out text and fax messages on their products and services, even to individuals listed on the DNC Registry.\n\nThe exemption, however, does not apply to voice calls.\n\nThe PDPC said the exemption order was crafted from feedback from consumers, businesses and trade groups during the weekly roadshows and workshops held since September. It stressed that the exemption order was not aimed at opening a back door for indiscriminate marketing, as some upset consumers have charged.\n\nThe PDPC added that it was not in organisations' interest to take advantage of the exemption, and that it would not hesitate to \"take enforcement action\" against those who do so.\n\nThe PDPC stressed that companies must have an ongoing relationship with the individual, and that past relationships or encounters from one-off transactions are excluded.\n\nThe message sent out must also relate only to the service the company provides. For example, a credit card company cannot rely on this exemption to notify its customer of a launch of its property development, said the PDPC.\n\nAnother condition tied to the exemption is that businesses must provide an opt-out facility in their marketing message at no extra charge to the recipient.\n\nAs at yesterday, the DNC Registry had amassed 380,000 phone numbers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, while this year is being represented as Mr Annus Horribilis by The Business Times, it has in fact featured several people - Blowtorch Man, Plaid Shirt Man and Samurai Man. All three have more in common than you would have thought possible, for the first man used too much heat, the second urged rioters to cool down and the third lost his cool on the train. At the same time, the person behind the Guy Fawkes mask turned out to be several men, some of whom claim to be part of hacking collective Anonymous, whose cause is associated with the November celebration - a white-knuckled month for corporate Singapore. This culminated in the unsettling discovery of the statements of 647 Standard Chartered private bank customers on then laptop of alleged hacker James Raj Arokiasamy. For all the temptation to bemoan the state of 2013, the year really could have been worse, especially when the state of the rest of the world is considered. In a year that has contained the horror of Homs, the tragedy of typhoon Haiyan and the heartbreak of high school shootings, Singapore's troubles have been more farcical in nature than catastrophic. And as the year winds to a close, the conclusion that is reached is one that is not necessarily intuitive but no less comforting - as a country, we've done alright. Nonetheless, good riddance, 2013.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is timely as the facility's first customer, Jurong Aromatics Corporation (JAC), is set to start up its US$2.4 billion aromatics complex on Jurong Island in the second quarter of next year.\n\nThe name of the winning operator has not yet been disclosed, with JTC Corporation expected to release details of the operatorship deal shortly.\n\nThe award of the operatorship - which had been expected in June this year - comes after JTC called for a two-stage request for proposals (RFP) in December 2011. It subsequently launched the second stage of the RFP last December after shortlisting four potential groups, though it also opened \"prequalification\" to others who had missed the first-stage RFP.\n\nThe 2011 RFP exercise was the second time JTC had embarked on a search for an operator for the underground storage. It had called off an earlier exercise because of the 2008 global financial crisis which delayed petrochemical projects on Jurong Island.\n\nThe first two caverns will offer 480,000 cubic metres of JRC's first phase 1.47 million cu m of storage. They are ready and undergoing pre-commissioning, which will take a couple of months.\n\nThe caverns will be occupied by JAC, which is taking up about 450,000 cu m.\n\nThe entire JRC phase 1 project comprising five caverns - one of 150,000 cu m and four of 330,000 cu m storage each - is set to be completed next year.\n\nThe underground JRC facility - like the planned \"very large floating structures\" to store oil at Pulau Sebarok - is among the measures Singapore is taking to address the shortage of on-shore land to build oil/petrochemicals storage.\n\nLike the just-announced investment in an LPG terminal by Vopak to import alternative liquefied petroleum gas feedstock for Singapore's largely naphtha- fuelled petrochemical crackers, the Jurong 2.0 initiative projects are meant to boost the competitiveness of the oil/ petrochemicals industry in the face of new gas-advantaged petrochemical complexes coming up, such as those in the Gulf States and the US.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The counter was the most actively traded, with 780.7 million shares changing hands.\n\nIt closed the day at 10.8 cents apiece, up 2.8 cents or 35 per cent.\n\nYesterday was the first day of trading for HanKore's stock following news of the deal; the counter had been suspended from trade on Monday for the announcement.\n\nHanKore had said it planned to buy environmental water assets of China Everbright Water Investments in a deal that would turn HanKore into CEWI's subsidiary.\n\nCEWI is wholly owned by Hong Kong-listed China Everbright International. The group is involved in construction, environmental protection and alternative energy, property investments and investment holding.\n\nThe acquisition will be paid for through the issue of new HanKore shares to CEWI, priced at 7.03 cents each.\n\nWhile the value of the assets has yet to be determined, CEWI is expected to hold more than 50 per cent of HanKore's enlarged share capital after the acquisition. If not, it can also subscribe for more new HanKore shares in cash at the same price to achieve this holding.\n\nCEWI said it intended to seek a waiver of its obligation to make a mandatory general offer, should the deal be completed.\n\nCurrently, the largest single shareholder of HanKore is its executive chairman, Chen Dawei.\n\nHanKore and CEWI will each appoint an independent valuer to determine the valuation of the assets. The deal is also subject to mutual due diligence being conducted, among other things.\n\nHanKore said it will make more announcements on the acquisition in due course.\n\nThe company is mainly involved in municipal wastewater treatment in China with 11 water plants.\n\nHanKore has turned itself around after a spate of corporate governance and financial troubles between 2007 and 2009, when its former chairman accused the company of committing disclosure breaches and the firm defaulted on its convertible bonds.\n\nAfter a series of developments including debt restructuring (2008), the appointment of new management (2011) and liquidation of some non-performing assets (2011), HanKore successfully recovered from a net loss of 407 million yuan (S$85.1 million) in FY2011 to a profit of over 100 million yuan in FY2012.\n\nPrivate equity firm RRJ Capital, run by former Goldman Sachs partner Richard Ong, bought a 7.85 per cent stake in China Everbright International for US$350 million earlier this month.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A typical carton has 200 cigarettes.\n\nFedEx's activity violated various federal and state laws, including an anti-racketeering statute, the complaint said.\n\nThe city wants FedEx to pay a US$49.5 million fine, equal to US$5,000 per shipment, plus US$2.48 million representing triple the lost tax revenue. It also wants FedEx to hire an independent monitor to ensure future compliance and provide training.\n\nIn a statement, Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx said that it has stopped doing business with known shippers of untaxed cigarettes. \"Through its contracts with customers, FedEx prohibits the shipment of tobacco direct to consumers and believes the claims made by the city are overstated and not founded in law,\" it said. \"FedEx intends to defend this case while continuing to work with authorities to stop prohibited tobacco shipments.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

But unable to meet the New Year's Day deadline, the Benoist airboat will be on display at St Petersburg instead and will still fly sometime in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) - one of the sponsors of Flight 2014, as it is dubbed - has launched a website (www.flying100years.com) which will be updated throughout the course of the year as part of the centennial celebrations.\n\nOn Jan 1, 1914, the first commercial flight was piloted by American Tony Jannus on Thomas Benoist's airboat in front of some 3,000 spectators. The plane was conceived by engineer Percival Fansler who roped in Mr Benoist, a manufacturer. Former St Petersburg mayor Abram Pheil won the right to be the only passenger onboard the historic flight after offering the highest bid of US$400 in an auction.\n\nAt an average speed of 60 miles per hour, the St Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line - as it came to be known - went on to operate at least two round trips a day between St Petersburg and Tampa carrying both passengers and cargo before the airline shut down in May. Each passenger ticket was US$5 each way, the equivalent of US$115 in 2012 after adjusting for inflation.\n\nA hundred years on, more than eight million people on average travel by air each day while 140,000 tonnes of cargo is carried daily. Iata estimates that a record 3.1 billion people were carried by airlines in 2013, crossing the three billion threshold for the first time.\n\n\"The potential of commercial flight to keep changing the world for the better is almost unlimited,\" said Iata director-general Tony Tyler. \"Growing and sustainably spreading the benefits of connectivity will require the industry, governments, regulators and local communities to keep true to the 'all-in-it-together' ethos that was the bedrock of that pioneering first flight.\"\n\nThis year, Iata projects the industry will chalk up the highest net profit ever, US$19.7 billion, which comes on the back of revenues of US$743 billion.\n\nWill Michaels, president of Flight 2014 Inc, was quoted as saying: \"Kermit will fly sometime in 2014, and we will have another celebration for that. It's kind of like those Christmas presents that don't arrive on Christmas Day. They arrive a few days later, but they're still delightful when you open them.\"\n\nFlight 2014 will be streamed live at www.airlinecentennial.org.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Saying that higher pay means better jobs and new opportunities for workers, he added: \"It also means that we can do more to make ours a gracious city for all.\"\n\nThe official growth forecast for this year stays. Mr Lee said the economy is likely to grow by between 2 and 4 per cent - the range which the Ministry of Trade and Industry cited when it raised the 2013 growth forecast of between one and 3 per cent to between 3.5 and 4 per cent.\n\nThe 3.7 per cent economic growth has turned out to be largely in line with market expectations. Private-sector economists polled ahead of the New Year Message were pretty bullish and had predicted the growth to be at least close to the top end of the government's forecast.\n\nANZ's Asia-Pacific chief economist Glenn Maguire said on Monday: \"We are expecting the 2013 full year Gross Domestic Product growth to be 4 per cent, towards the upper end of the official target, given the ongoing strength in the services sector.\"\n\nStronger growth in the US, China, Japan and Europe should build up greater momentum for Singapore's economy this year, but ANZ has eased its expectations to a more modest 3.2 per cent growth for Singapore in 2014. In reference to the tighter foreign worker policy and global bank borrowings, the bank said: \"Though external demand will be improving, it will be difficult for the Singapore economy to grow at the same rate seen in 2013, as the supply side of the economy is squeezed.\"\n\nOthers point out that rising business costs on the home front could also dampen Singapore's growth prospects this year.\n\nMr Lee sounded more upbeat in his New Year message: \"Provided nothing untoward happens in Asia, I am confident that Singapore will do well. We are investing in our future and developing new capabilities for tomorrow's economy, like 3D printing, data analytics and consumer insights research.\"\n\nSingapore is taking a \"balanced approach\" in letting in foreign workers, he said; it is reducing - not cutting off - the inflow.\n\nHe conceded that companies - small- and medium-sized enterprises especially - are finding it hard to hire the workers they need, but he said the government is helping them to adapt by exploiting technology and becoming more productive.\n\nMr Lee reiterated that Singapore still needs foreign workers to keep its economy running and to build critical infrastructure.\n\nStill, he cautioned that while the US and European economies are stabilising and Asian prospects staying positive, there are problems and tensions, especially in North-east Asia where the disputes between China, Japan and South Korea over historical issues and ownership of various islands have sharpened - and where the stability of the Korean peninsula is a serious worry.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The coverage of Glass focused mostly on its privacy implications - not its ability to change the world. And iPhone and Twitter were just more of the same. So we could end the year really disappointed because nothing dramatic seems to have happened on the technology front.\n\nBut look again, at the stories we missed. So much happened, in fact, that I believe we have set the stage for the transformation of entire industries.\n\nSmaller has become cooler in computers. Tablet sales continued to increase and have eclipsed PCs and desktops. The iPad mini, which at first seemed to be a disappointment, was a major success. Prices are continuing to plunge as computing power and functionality grow exponentially. With the US availability of the India-made US$37.99 Datawind tablet, there will be greater downward pressure. It won't be long before Amazon gives you a free tablet for signing up for Amazon Prime.\n\nThis will spell disaster for old-line computer companies such as Dell, Acer and Microsoft.\n\nElectric cars proved their mettle. Despite a disparaging review by The New York Times, which it later conceded had \"problems with precision and judgment\", and negative rumours about safely, range and reliability, Tesla achieved astonishing success. Its customers, who include me, lauded the car. Its stock rose to new heights. Consumer Reports gave Tesla's Model S its highest ranking ever. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reaffirmed its 5-star safety ratings. Tesla has proven the viability of electric cars and demonstrated their superiority. All major car manufacturers are now developing electric cars.\n\nTechnology is improving health care. Quantified Self devices such as Fitbit and Nike Fuelband are becoming widely available. You even see these on the shelves of Apple Stores. Companies are running contests using these devices to encourage employees to get more exercise. Smartphone add-ons such as the Alivecor heart monitor are being prescribed by doctors. Interestingly, Apple recently patented a heart monitor sensor for the iPhone.\n\nOur smartphones are destined to become our prime medical advisers. I expect they will one day chide us to get more exercise, drink less alcohol and watch our calorie intake. They will tell us when we are about to get sick and which medicines to take. We will only turn to doctors for refuge.\n\nRosie the Robot came one step closer to reality. We have long been waiting for robots such as the housekeeper in The Jetsons. These weren't practical to build because of the massive computing power required to understand human words and the sensors needed for the robots to \"see\" and move. Smartphones such as the iPhone 5S now have more computing power than the supercomputers of yesteryear, which fit into large buildings and required water cooling. With the shrinking of computers and sensors and their dramatic drops in price, we can now build the robots we dreamed of.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Google just purchased robotics developer Boston Dynamics as well as seven others. With its self-driving car and these acquisitions, it seems Google sees robots as big business. Amazon is also installing robots made by Kiva Systems to move boxes in its warehouses. Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos said Amazon plans to use robotic drones to deliver goods.\n\nWhether we realise it or not, the robotic revolution is underway. Robots have advanced to the point that for some types of goods, it is cheaper to manufacture in the United States than China. One such robot is Baxter from Rethink Robotics. It has two arms, a face that displays simulated emotion, and cameras and sensors that detect the motion of human beings who work next to it. It can perform assembly and move boxes - just as humans do. It will work 24 hours a day and not complain. It costs only US$22,000. I expect that what is a trickle of manufacturing returning to the United States from China will later in this decade become a flood. I also expect to place my order for Rosie sometime in 2020 and have it delivered by an Amazon drone.\n\nThe space race is on again. In 2013, India launched a spacecraft that is headed to Mars and China landed a six-wheel rover on the moon. China also announced that it is planning to land a man on the moon by 2025. Add to this the success that private companies SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Moon Express have had and you realise that we are at the cusp of a new era in space travel.\n\nNasa once again has competition from governments abroad so there will be a new sense of urgency. Now it has the advantage of being able to collaborate with entrepreneurs and take advantage of the technology advances that they have created.\n\nNow let me give you the bad news: we still have a few more years of disappointment before we marvel at all these advances. The base of an exponential curve is flat. When it turns upwards, dramatic developments happen, but for the longest time nothing seems to change. This is where we are with robotics, sensors, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, 3D printing and medicine - all of which are exponential technologies.\n\nWe were disappointed, too, when cellphones first came out. They were big, expensive and clumsy. For many years, these were just for the rich - a symbol of wealth and power. Today, there are close to one billion cellphones in use in both India and China. Almost everyone has one.\n\nIn 1977, the president of Digital Equipment Corp, Ken Olsen, famously said \"there is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home\". The first PCs were just for geeks and nerds. Then they were for the rich. About two decades ago, we began to question their usefulness and productivity. Now they are transforming industries, and we can buy a tablet for US$37.99 plus shipping.\n\nMore recently, we became disappointed with solar energy and electric cars. The good news is that this disappointment will soon turn into amazement as well. I know because I live in a solar home and drive a Tesla electric car that I say is a spaceship that travels on land. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The purchase price translates into a hefty $1.5 million per room, possibly a new record for a hotel here.\n\nEarlier this year, Bright Ruby Resources, a company controlled by a family from China, was reported to have paid between $1.4 million-$1.5 million per room for the freehold Grand Park Orchard Hotel, smashing the previous $1.1 million per room record.\n\nBT understands that The Westin Singapore transaction was sealed just before Christmas. The seller is a fund managed under MGPA, a private-equity property investment advisory firm. MGPA's original asking price was $2 million per room, or about $610 million in total.\n\nMGPA is currently owned by asset manager BlackRock, which bought over the firm for an undisclosed sum in a deal that was completed in October.\n\nDaisho Development Singapore director Mamoru Kohda said that Daisho decided to acquire the hotel because of its location and the group's view on room demand in the area.\n\n\"We think that there are not enough hotel rooms here. Also, the Marina Bay area is developing very quickly and has a very strong pool of office tenants, so we will be strongly supported by a corporate clientele,\" he said.\n\n\"We've also worked with Starwood in Malaysia and our working relationship with them was strong, so these are the reasons why we decided to buy The Westin Singapore. Daisho is a long-time asset holder, therefore we will work with Westin for a long time.\"\n\nThe Westin Singapore is the first hotel property to be managed under the Westin brand after the latter left the country more than 10 years ago, in 2001. It occupies levels 32 to 46 of Asia Square Tower 2, with offices taking up the bulk of the remaining floors. It is the first hotel in Singapore to be located within an office building, and has the highest hotel lobby here, on the 32nd floor.\n\nLance Ourednik, general manager of The Westin Singapore, said: \"The sale and ownership change does not affect the daily operation and management of the hotel. The Westin Singapore continues to fly the Westin flag and be managed by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.\"\n\nDaisho's purchase at a record price on a per room basis comes as the Singapore hotel sector faces headwinds such as declining room rates and new completions coming onstream.\n\nHowever, market experts that BT spoke to say that the amount paid represents its expectations for strong future earnings, and a premium for a brand new hotel.\n\nTan Tiong Cheng, executive chairman of Knight Frank, said: \"The hotel is brand new and already fitted out, so that merits a premium. Fitting out a hotel can be very expensive.\"\n\nIts location on the top floors of Asia Square Tower 2 also merits a premium, he added.\n\nAnother market expert, who declined to be named, noted that much of the new and upcoming supply of hotel rooms is largely in the mid-tier section and not the high-end market.\n\n\"In the Marina Bay area, there aren't enough hotels, there is in fact a slight under-supply. And as the area develops and more corporations are located there, demand for hotel rooms could rise and this could, in turn, raise room rates.\n\n\"So Daisho is buying into the future,\" said the veteran industry player, adding that he believes room rates would have to average between $400 and $500 per night for the deal to be lucrative for Daisho.\n\nPublished room rates at The Westin Singapore start at $650 per night for a standard room, but actual rates vary depending on demand and supply, so a standard room can be booked at between $300 and $400 a night currently.\n\nThe Westin Singapore declined to provide occupancy rates so far. Mr Ourednik would only say that it has been \"enjoying good occupancy rates since we opened on 12 November and are optimistic about our business in 2014\".\n\nApart from upscale The Westin Singapore, hotel properties which came onstream this year include Parkroyal@Pickering, Ramada Hotel Singapore and Carlton City Hotel. In 2014, the Sofitel So, The Patina and another hotel under the Holiday Inn Express brand are slated to open.\n\nPreliminary statistics from the Singapore Tourism Board showed that hotel occupancies were at 87 per cent for January to October this year. Luxury hotels were the only category to post an increase in revenue per available room (RevPar), which was up 9 per cent.\n\nRevPar declines were seen in upscale (-12 per cent), mid-tier (-3 per cent) and economy (-8 per cent) hotels.\n\nDaisho currently owns a range of retail, office and hotel developments across Australia, Malaysia and Japan. The total value of its current property holdings exceeds US$1.5 billion.\n\nIts portfolio includes a 510-room hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which is managed by the Hilton Group, the AO retail complex in central Tokyo and Park Hyatt Sydney.\n\nIt is also in the middle of constructing 180 Brisbane, an office tower development in Brisbane, Australia, that is due for completion in 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SingTel, for example, rose 3 cents to $3.66 with 25 million shares traded, adding $91 million to the market's total value traded. In total, the value of trades in index stocks was $787 million - 66 per cent of the whole market.\n\nIn the penny segment, there was a flurry of interest in the shares of water treatment firm HanKore Environment, following the announcement of a deal with China Everbright Water Investments, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed China Everbright International. HanKore's shares, which traded at five cents in September, yesterday jumped 2.8 cents to 10.8 cents with 781 million shares done, contributing $77 million to turnover.\n\nShipbuilder Vard Holdings' shares ended one cent higher at 81.5 cents with 3.2 million shares changing hands after it announced it has secured a contract worth one billion Norwegian kroner. In its \"neutral\" recommendation on Vard, OSK DMG said it has raised Vard's forecast EPS for 2014 and 2015 by 1-2 per cent because the company's 2013 order wins were ahead of OSK's estimates.\n\n\"Over FY13/14F/15F, we forecast Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins of 6.7/7.6/8.2 per cent,\" said the broker. \"Our earnings estimates for FY14F-15F are 17-23 per cent below consensus, as we have factored in lower margins. We keep our 'neutral' rating with an unchanged target of 85 cents based on 10x FY14F P/E (price/earnings)...\"\n\nPossibly of interest to readers is that Nomura's global strategy team is forecasting that Japanese equities will provide the greatest return of all global stocks in 2014.\n\n\"We think the driver of global equities in 2014 will be EPS growth rather than waning risk or higher stock valuations,\" said Nomura in its 2014 Japanese Equity Outlook.\n\n\"We forecast EPS growth of 19 per cent for Japanese equities in 2014, the highest of all, followed by European equities at 14 per cent.\n\n\"We expect the Topix to reach 1,500 and the Nikkei to reach 18,000 at end-2014 ... further yen depreciation would increase upside ... we estimate that every one yen weakening against the US dollar would push the Topix's EPS up by around 0.65 per cent and the Nikkei by 377 points.\"\n\nThe broker also said that if the government's policies - known as Abenomics - prove successful, the Nikkei could reach 25,000 by 2018.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The trusts will be incorporated as non-profit companies under Section 8 of the new Companies Act, 2013.\n\nThe new initiative, say analysts, will inject a measure of transparency in the country's political funding system. \"Elections are a hugely expensive affair in India, and political parties can't survive without donations,\" Vivek Bhambri, a political analyst, told BT. \"Hopefully by institutionalising company funding, the new measure will help cleanse the system through increased vigilance and transparency.\"\n\n\"Under the new regulations, the original company's contribution would not reflect the name of political parties who are beneficiaries of donations made by them,\" a government official told BT. Those contributing to such trusts, added the official, will be entitled to 100 per cent tax deduction but only when the electoral trusts distribute 95 per cent of their annual contribution to eligible political parties.\n\nThese electoral trust companies would operate only for funding political outfits for their election-related expenses and are not allowed to receive any contribution in cash. They will also have to take the Permanent Account Number of all contributors who are resident Indians, and passport number of non-resident Indian citizens at the time of receiving the contribution. Contributions from foreign citizens or companies will not be allowed for the trusts.\n\nIt is estimated that election expenditure for political parties in India hovers around US$3 billion. The issue of electoral funding by businesses has always been a fraught one in India. Key policy decisions are occasionally seen to be influenced in favour of certain business groups, thereby impacting democratic norms. Recently, the Aditya Birla Group was caught in one such crossfire, although the business house has denied any violations in its donation of funds to political outfits through a trust.\n\nThe cozy relationship between business houses and political parties is of great significance in the current politically-charged milieu. However, it can be traced back to the pre-independence era (before 1947), when India's oldest political party - the 127-year-old Congress (currently at the helm) - started receiving funding from the industrial group of the Birlas. Following this, the Tata group too contributed to the Congress coffers. Consequently, the Companies Act was put in place in 1956 to bring business houses' financial largesse to political outfits under the ambit of law.\n\nHowever, in 1960, the Companies Act was amended by the government to allow companies to donate to political parties only up to a certain limit. The ability of big businesses to influence governments through money power - and their use of \"black money\" (income on which income tax hasn't been paid) to fund such donations - came under attack.\n\nSo in 1969, the Companies Act underwent another amendment to not only prohibit corporate funding but also make it punishable. The Act was re-introduced in 1985 with amendments but this legislation too, suffered from a deficit of clarity on mechanisms available to corporates to contribute to political parties.\n\nDue to the continued general disenchantment with the Companies Act, the industry lobby group - the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India - advocated earlier this year that corporate funding of elections be made more \"transparent and legal\".\n\nFollowing this, it was made mandatory for corporates - under the latest Companies Act, 2013 - to disclose in their profit and loss account contributions made to political parties. The companies also have to furnish particulars of the total amount contributed as well as name of the party to which they are donating.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Japanese retail sales rose by 4 per cent in November from a year earlier while wage earners' total cash earnings rose by 0.5 per cent and factory output edged further upwards.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The gauge, which is finance professionals' favourite measure of the US market, has not had a year that strong since 1997, when it rose 31 per cent. If the S&P 500 can match that performance and rise a further 2 per cent today and on Tuesday, 2013 would be one of the five best years for stock investors since World War II.\n\nThe main driver of those gains has been the acceleration of the US economic recovery, with the latest boost coming in the form of the Dec 20 upward revision to third-quarter gross domestic product growth. This week's Standard & Poor's Case Shiller home price index, a manufacturing survey and weekly jobless claims will likely emulate positive surprises in home sales, durable goods orders and jobs data last week.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member in 2 minutes to keep reading.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\nS$9.90\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nsave 50%\n\nYearly recurring\n\nS$4.95\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nBilled yearly\n\n118.8\n\nS$59.40\n\nContinue reading\n\nCancel anytime\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/hopes-better-market-after-year-doubt", "site_title": "Hopes for better market after a year of doubt", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHopes for better market after a year of doubt\n\nAnalysts target STI of 3,000 to 3,500 points; banks, oil and gas continue to be favoured over property\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Dec 31, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nDOUBT slipped into the local market in the Year of the Snake amid tapering talk, property-cooling measures and a penny-stock crash. At the end of the half-day trading session yesterday, the total value of 770 companies listed on Singapore Exchange (SGX) tracked by The Business Times was $899 billion, up from $887 billion at the end of\n\n2012 but down substantially from the close to $1 trillion reached in April and May 2013.\n\nThe benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) closed at 3,167.43 points at end-2013, almost unchanged from 3,167.08 points a year earlier. Singapore was left out in 2013's developed markets rally, with the STI 8 per cent lower than its peak of 3,450 points in May. The bulls sought greener pastures in the United States and Japan, with the S&P 500 up 32 per cent and the Nikkei 225 up 60 per cent for the year.\n\nOn the local bourse, a full-fledged gallop is not expected in the Year of the Horse, with analysts' expectations ranging from a complete standstill to a tiny trot.\n\nSumming up 2013, CIMB head of research Kenneth Ng said: \"It was a tale of two halves. The Singapore market started brightly for the first five months and then weakened as US tapering talk came on.\"\n\nFears of rising rates from the US Federal Reserve slowing down or \"tapering\" its bond purchases since May had hit property counters and conglomerates operating regional businesses. Worries over emerging-market debt added to general market woes, though banks, telcos and some offshore and marine counters such as Ezion Holdings and Mermaid Maritime did well.\n\nFund managers such as Schroders and Baring Asset Management are steering clear of Singapore stocks this year, predicting a real estate slump hitting a number of companies.\n\nUBS Wealth Management regional chief investment officer Kelvin Tay expects home prices to dip by 3 to 6 per cent this year. He told BT that the STI might be \"range-bound\" between 3,000 and 3,300 points this year. In an environment of tapering and global economic growth, exports look to have bottomed out but a recovery is likely to come only after its North Asian counterparts. Domestically, companies are grappling with slower growth, wage inflation and a labour shortage, he said.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, cyclical stocks with revenues leveraged to the global economic growth are likely to perform well,\" he said. \"In contrast, pure yield plays with no growth prospects as well as domestically oriented companies are likely to underperform.\"\n\nCarmen Lee, head of OCBC Investment Research, expects the STI to trade between 3,000 and 3,400 points, \"supported on the low side by undemanding valuations and capped on the upper end by uncertainty on the global front\".\n\nBanks, oil and gas might outperform while property stocks might ease in the first half, she said.\n\nComeback prediction\n\nOthers are predicting a comeback for the local bourse, driven by better earnings, improved global economic growth and a flight to safety amid political and currency turmoil in the region.\n\nPatrick Yau, Citi Singapore's head of research, said he expected 5 to 10 per cent returns this year, from companies finally making more profits as a result of stronger exports especially to Europe. This is compared to tepid growth in the past three years.\n\n\"In 2013, there was hardly any earnings growth, it was -2 per cent among the 60 companies we cover. Next year, there could be 9 per cent due to the base effect. It's the first time in three years where I'm thinking there's some upside,\" Mr Yau noted.\n\nCiti Research has a 3,278-point target price for the STI in 2014, translating to a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.6 times. It prefers oil and gas play Keppel Corp, China-exposed Wilmar International and CapitaMalls Asia, DBS Bank, Keppel Land, as well as industrial plays ST Engineering and Venture Corp, which he reckons can benefit from a strengthening US dollar.\n\nCIMB's Mr Ng is overweight on banks, capital goods and commodities.\n\nSmall-cap specialist DMG & Securities is among the most bullish, with a 3,480-point STI target for 2014. Referring to the penny-stock crash a few months ago, DMG said that \"while some counters got their 'just desserts', many others were punished unjustifiably\". DMG added that the small caps it covers are trading at nine times forecast 2014 earnings while growing more than 20 per cent.\n\nIn the small-cap space, construction sector stocks and S-chips should see investor interest, DMG said. Its top picks for the local market include Eu Yan Sang, King Wan, Lian Beng, Midas, MTQ, Nam Cheong and OSIM.\n\nFor Mr Yau, three sectors now look cheap: commodities, transport and real estate developers. Commodity firms such as Olam International, Wilmar International and Noble Group have been reducing their capital expenditure and cutting costs, so their financial situation might improve even though their outlook is not great, he said.\n\nOil prices are still high and affecting airlines and shipping companies. As for developers which have been hit by higher consumer debt and potentially rising rates, potential upside can come if property prices and volumes do not fall as much as feared.\n\n\"Stocks that are cheap can surprise on the upside if operating factors are better than expected,\" Mr Yau said. \"With the market at an average level, if you want to outperform the market, you have to look at stocks growing much faster, or trading much cheaper than the market.\"\n\nIn terms of valuations, consumer stocks stand out as expensive, DBS Group Research said. They have corrected from valuations at two standard deviations above average after May and are now at one standard deviation above, and could correct further if earnings miss expectations.\n\nOne example is instant beverage maker Super Group, which took a tumble in November after unveiling disappointing Q3 results. Super fell from around $4.50 earlier in the year to a low of about $3. It traded at $3.80 yesterday.\n\nValue fluctuations\n\nSGX attracted a number of new listings in 2013, with notable players in property, energy and resources. The five biggest - SPH Reit, Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust, KrisEnergy, OUE Hospitality Trust and Asian Pay TV Trust - added $8.2 billion to the local bourse.\n\nWhile STI stalwarts SingTel, DBS, Thai Beverage and UOB were among the top five in the most value gained, it was secondary-listed insurance giant Prudential plc that stole the show, adding $13.4 billion to its market value, up 35 per cent from a year ago. The company had recently raised expectations for higher dividends by announcing ambitious growth and cash targets.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum were stocks which suffered the greatest losses in value. All three Jardine conglomerate stocks languished in the bottom 10, along with property counters CapitaLand, City Development, Hongkong Land and Keppel Land. Other property plays - Yanlord, CapitaMall Trust, CapitaCommercial Trust - were not far behind. These companies lost a total of about $25 billion in value last year.\n\nThen there were Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold, the penny-stocks trio which collectively lost $8 billion of market value last October just as suddenly after adding billions of dollars to their values months before.\n\nFraser & Neave, meanwhile, lost $9 billion of market value. This was because of a property business spin-off as well as capital distributions from a business segment review and from proceeds of its Asia Pacific Breweries sale.\n\nSmall, mid-cap plays\n\nIn the small to mid-cap segment, industrial waste gas treatment firm China Environment was an outperformer, rising more than seven times in value. Investors flocked to the firm amid rising profits and China's massive drive to clean up its air pollution problem.\n\nRowsley, Oxley Holdings and SIIC Environment were three notable mid-caps which vaulted over the $1 billion market value mark, with investors seeing these companies double, treble, even quadruple in price.\n\nRowsley is transforming itself into an Iskandar property play, while Oxley has pursued a string of overseas property acquisitions. SIIC Environment has reported significantly better earnings and is pursuing an expansion plan that includes a share placement and additional investments.\n\nAside from the three penny stocks, a prominent crash was bedlinen retailer Aussino, whose shops, until recently, could be sighted at local shopping malls. An unprofitable company over the past three years and on SGX's watchlist, Aussino made the news in mid-2012 when it seized on a hyped-up lifeline. It eyed a Myanmar petrol venture through a controversial reverse takeover deal with US-blacklisted Myanmar tycoon Zaw Zaw. Investor speculation reached fever pitch last Jan 31 when the stock traded at 29 cents.\n\nBut the deal ran into regulatory hurdles last April when SGX did not give the green light. Last July, the Myanmar deal was terminated. SGX subsequently rejected the company's bid for a time extension to meet listing requirements and the company was suspended after Dec 20 pending delisting.\n\nA number of Aussino outlets, such as in Causeway Point and Junction 8, have closed. Its shares last traded at 0.6 cent - down 98 per cent from its peak, and down 96 per cent for the year. Something sobering to remember 2013 by, as you wake up to a new 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is the reason they are always looking for the next posting, next transfer. I never looked at the next posting or transfer. Come what may, we will deal with it. That's why I say I am self-reliant.\"\n\nFor her, essential to getting the job done is going to the ground - or, as she puts it, to the periphery or grassroots - to get feedback on issues and problems so that they can be corrected at the core.\n\n\"I go to the periphery, whether the home, school or barracks. I don't take reports. It is inherent in women. Man stays at the core, but a woman goes behind the kitchen to find what is wrong,\" she says.\n\nA leader determined to seek solutions will find the time. \"You can be satisfied with 70 per cent . . . but if I want 100 per cent, then I will go to the periphery every day.\"\n\nTime management for her is simple. \"I manage it in a way that I will only do what I can do. For me, time is of essence and of value. I would not do minor things which others can do for me.\"\n\nThe 63-year-old grandmother is unapologetic about social or traditional expectations. \"I've never cooked and cleaned for my husband. It's like being friends, as equals, without any expectations. So he never expected me to do things that a normal housewife does but it was a very organised home because I go for a lot of support systems. I would rather spend on those investments that recover me my time, and with that time I do what I like to do.\n\n\"I would be a misfit if I were a homemaker, like being a round peg in a square hole. But if you put me in an office and make me work 18 hours a day, I would love it because that is the way I am. So without being judgmental, choose your inclination, then be happy in what you do.\"\n\nGreatly influenced by her parents, Prakash Lal and Prem Lata Peshawaria, Ms Bedi and her three sisters attended a convent school in Amritsar in the Indian state of Punjab and were given the best education her parents could afford.\n\n\"Home was an oasis of values, discipline, character building, peace, knowledge, harmony, love - a charging station,\" says the former Indian tennis champion.\n\n\"Children born to wonderful parents have an unequal start in life\" - she offered this profound insight to participants at the recent Iclif Leadership Energy Summit Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHer advice to those who do not get it by birth is to get it through education \"and write their own script\".\n\n\"Absorb and imbibe education in the right spirit. After all, education is a sense of freedom; an education that liberates you helps you to grow in your mind. My education was not exam-oriented but knowledge giving.\"\n\nWhether tackling crime, prison reform, traffic or corruption - she and anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare are now at the forefront of an anti-corruption movement in India - she maintains she would do it all over again. \"There was never any compulsion for me to do anything (I did not want to).\"\n\nHowever, despite offers to run for office, politics holds little interest. \"Politics is divisive. I am nationally accepted today. But the moment I go into politics, I will be partially accepted because I am competing. There have been interesting opportunities, but I didn't take them because it's not my nature.\"\n\nTurning point\n\nBelieving she can achieve more as a social activist, her non-governmental organisations Navjyoti and India Vision Foundation help underserved children, women and men, in education, vocational skills and healthcare.\n\nA turning point in her life occurred when a milkmaid pleaded with Ms Bedi's father to obtain the release of a relative she said was wrongly imprisoned.\n\nMr Bedi managed to procure the help of the police commissioner and the man was subsequently released.\n\n\"The power to undo injustice\" left an indelible imprint on her, and inspired her to apply for the IPS.\n\nOf tremendous satisfaction to her is \"to be in a position of power where you can drive the change\".\n\nMore than anything, she says a leader must be trustworthy. \"Any leader, even if very educated, brilliant, speaks well and is skilled and knowledgeable, without trust he is not reliable.\"\n\nSecondly, he must empower people, as it means he is leading future leaders, creating leadership. \"When you empower people, you are transparent, value- based. Otherwise you would not do it, as you would feel threatened.\"\n\nLastly, a leader's vision must be aligned with his or her organisation's mission.\n\nAsked about her failures, she retorts: \"What is that?\"\n\n\"Failure would be if I had not made the effort. Effort may not give you whatever you want, but that is inherent in the effort.

Today, it was massively jammed.\n\n\" I had to compete with the heavy vehicles going to Marina South, the cargo vehicles going to the PSA area, in a two-lane exit,\" he said.\n\n\"Many Shenton Way workers are still on vacation (yesterday). Heaven forbid when they get back to work on Jan 2.\"\n\nAnother lawyer, Peter Madhavan said there was a lack of signage that clearly spelt out where or what landmark buildings new roads such as the Marina Coastal Drive will lead to.\n\n\"There should be signs saying where those new roads lead, which buildings they go to. What's Marina Coastal Drive? Where does it go?\"\n\nOne motorist, who declined to be named, said there were already bad jams when he exited the MCE at 8.15 am yesterday to get to the Marina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC), and that it took him half an hour to get there.\n\n\"Normally, it only takes five minutes to get to MBFC from the old exit,\" he said. \"By 10.30 am I could see from my office at MBFC that traffic at the Central Boulevard exit was really bad.\"\n\nHe noted that there were \"multiple choke points after exiting the MCE into the MBFC area, all within a short distance of each other. MCE traffic into CBD from both east and west is ending up at these multiple choke points. The situation calls for urgent resolution. No serious financial centre can countenance such major traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe $4.3 billion, 5km MCE, which opened on Sunday, will serve as the main expressway connecting traffic travelling between the east and the west. It connects the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) and the East Coast Parkway (ECP) to the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE).\n\nCommon reasons cited for slow traffic include motorists' lack of familiarity with how the MCE connects with other roads and expressways, as well as road signs that were confusing or unclear.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said that traffic in the MCE tunnel has generally been smooth flowing. But it acknowledged there had been \"traffic congestion and tail-backs at certain locations as motorists adjust to the new expressway and road network configuration\".\n\nLTA said that some westbound motorists on the ECP did not enter the MCE directly from the ECP near Fort Road, but instead proceeded along Sheares Bridge into the city area before heading out to the MCE, thereby adding to the traffic in the city.\n\nThere was also congestion along some key roads at the Marina South area as many motorists chose to enter the CBD using the MCE exits that lead to Central Boulevard, LTA said.\n\nIt said that it will be making road and traffic flow adjustments to ease congestion. For instance, a short stretch of Central Boulevard will be immediately converted from two lanes to four lanes, to facilitate better traffic flow into and along Central Boulevard toward Shenton Way.\n\nMore temporary signs at key approaches will be put up to alert motorists of the road network changes and the best way to get to their destination. It will also put out travel advisories at more locations, and on radio, to guide motorists.\n\nLTA said that traffic wardens will continue to be deployed to help direct motorists, even though some said this slowed traffic more as motorists stopped to ask for directions.\n\nBut one motorist, Fanny Leong, who commutes from Dover to her workplace at Changi, said it was a \"smooth ride\" when she got on the MCE at 6am yesterday as there was very little traffic.\n\nWhen announcing the MCE's scheduled opening on Dec 29, the LTA had said that with traffic currently using the ECP channelled to the MCE, these changes \"will free up valuable land space in the city centre currently occupied by the ECP and allow for future development of the downtown at Marina South\".\n\nLTA said that the MCE will link motorists directly to the heart of downtown Marina South through new connections with Central Boulevard, Marina Boulevard and Maxwell Road. \"This will also enhance the overall quality of the downtown at Marina South as a live-work-play precinct,\" LTA said on Nov 13.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But as the global economy turned on its head, it dragged the asset class down further.\n\nAfter five years of commodity prices being driven mainly by macroeconomic factors such as quantitative easing (QE), industry observers noticed that correlations between commodities and equities started falling this year.\n\nAccording to research by Societe Generale, supply and demand fundamentals accounted for about 80 per cent of commodity price movements on average before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, however, macroeconomic factors gained an upper hand, accounting for about 60 per cent of price movements, and fundamentals only 30-40 per cent.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

The six-week festival will debut in August with Facing Goya, an opera by British composer Michael Nyman that will be directed by Ong himself, and close with the New York experimental theatre company The Wooster Group's version of Shakespeare's Troilus And Cressida.\n\n\"WHAT I see in the arts scene right now is that there is quite a lot of fear among companies of trying to break even. Previously, there was a fear of politics and censorship, but now the fear has turned into a financial one. (I must add, though, that censorship is still practised through the granting or withdrawing of government funding.)\n\nBecause of this fear, arts companies are trying not to overspend. They're making edgy, smaller-scale shows that deal with topical issues. I also see a lot of youth-oriented works.\n\nNow with the Singapore International Festival of Arts, we want to go a different direction. We want to bring shows of a certain scale. We won't shy away from putting a large cast of 50 people on stage, or bringing something like Warhorse to the stage.\n\nAs a given statement, it's not possible for us to break even with shows of that scale, but we're a festival that receives public funding even though we are independent, so we want to do it.\n\nThis year's Three Titans of Theatre series created such excitement among arts lovers. To have Ninagawa, Peter Brook and Simon McBurney present these plays was a big thing. But I say, why can't we have shows like these every year?\n\nI've been doing theatre since the 1980s with plays like Army Daze and Beauty World, and the audiences numbers have stayed the same over the decades. Audience come and go; the scene has expanded, but the audience numbers have stayed pretty much the same.\n\nI want to bring back the people who have stopped coming to the theatre. I used to watch theatre with people I knew in law school. But most of them got married, had kids and stopped going to the theatre. Where are they? Why have they stopped coming?\n\nIf we staged classic plays by theatre greats the likes of Brecht or Pinter - as one finds in places like West End and Broadway - would these adult audiences return to watch sophisticated grown-up theatre? If we staged Waiting for Godot, would they come?\n\nOne issue that worries me still is the lack of suitable theatre venues. When I was looking for shows to come to Singapore for the arts festival, I was quite shocked by the number of arts companies that rejected us on the grounds that our theatre venues are too small.\n\nThe newly renovated Victoria Theatre has a proscenium opening of 10 metres when most theatre companies require a minimum of 12 to 14m. When the Esplanade Theatre goes under renovation from May to October next year, there's no longer a large theatre in Singapore. So finding suitable venues will be a problem we'll face for some time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while the light at the end of the tunnel remains unclear for mid-stream traders, plantation stocks are set to ride on rising crude palm oil prices.\n\nEven as the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) climbed upwards in the first half of 2013, shares for the largest commodity trading firms in Asia - Noble Group, Olam International and Wilmar International - slumped.\n\nOnly in September did more upbeat market sentiments and a recovery in the prices of some commodities such as sugar, together with positive third-quarter results at Noble and Wilmar, give a boost to their share prices.\n\nStill, Noble will end the year as one of the worst performers on the STI for the third year running, its price having fallen 8.23 per cent this year compared to the STI which dropped by a smaller 0.55 per cent.\n\n\"The mid-stream trading companies have performed poorly for most of this year as they had to deal with challenges related to past diversification investments. Noble's and Olam's results have been especially volatile,\" said Macquarie analyst Conrad Werner.\n\nNoble had invested in Brazilian sugar mills in 2010, which returned to the black only in the latest quarter.\n\nOlam has trimmed its capital expenditure and is looking to sell stakes in some of its assets to release cash from its balance sheet.\n\nThe muted economic outlook in the first half of the year also kept investors away from them, said OCBC Investment Research analyst Carey Wong.\n\nBut with a US economy on stronger footing, investors could adopt a more \"risk on\" approach, he opined, upgrading his call on the sector to \"neutral\" from \"underweight\".\n\n\"With the valuations of some of the commodity plays still looking relatively inexpensive, we could see potential upgrades for some of them if there is an over-correction in the market,\" he said.\n\nOf the three stocks, Wilmar is by analysts' consensus the top pick.\n\nSoybean crushing margins in China, which dragged down the group's performance in the past two years, are stabilising, and the current low crude palm oil prices will also benefit Wilmar, said Maybank Kim Eng analyst Wei Bin.\n\nPhillip Securities analyst Nicholas Ong also chose Wilmar for its exposure to emerging markets, such as China, India and South- east Asia, and resilient vertically integrated business model. The stock is a good proxy for the growing food demand in Asia, he said.\n\nBut Macquarie's Mr Werner cautioned that next year is likely to be a tough year again for the three traders.\n\n\"We will have an over- capacity issue in agricultural products. Because they're more exposed to the processing and upstream side than in the past, lower prices affect them more,\" he said.\n\nIt will also be \"a slow arduous process\" for the firms to demonstrate that they can consistently manage their assets better, and bring up their returns to equity, he added. \"For Noble and Olam, they should be getting mid-teens returns. They're around the 10 per cent mark right now.\"\n\nIn the palm oil sector, Golden Agri-Resources also joined Noble in the ranks of the worst performing stocks on the STI this year, with its price down 16.9 per cent.\n\nShare prices for palm plantation firms such as Golden Agri, First Resources and IndoFood Agri had similarly fallen before picking up in the second half, following the trajectory of crude palm oil prices.\n\nAnalysts are positive on the sector, on expectations that higher biodiesel mandates in Indonesia and lower palm oil inventories will lift crude palm oil prices next year. CIMB and Citi Research forecast that crude palm oil will hit RM2,700 (S$1,040) per tonne next year, up 12.5 per cent from the average this year.\n\nBut this will be capped by rising supplies of oilseeds such as sunflower and soy oil, and lower demand for biodiesel in the US and Europe, said CIMB.\n\nRabobank also warned that the implementation of biodiesel programmes in Indonesia and Malaysia remains uncertain.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, biodiesel programmes are among the strongest bullish driver for palm prices in 2014, but delays in implementing these mandates and a decline in crude oil prices could dampen the impact of these programmes and reduce bullishness,\" it said in its outlook for agri-commodity markets in 2014. The bank is neutral on palm oil prices.\n\nFirst Resources and Wilmar are analysts' favourites in the palm oil sector, for their young estates and strong business model respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Thursday, Wall Street hit yet another all-time high, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing at its 50th all-time high for 2013 and the S&P 500 ending at its 43rd record close.\n\nEqually likely, however, is that prior to the Dec 18 announcement, the STI was in danger of sinking to its worst close for the year and that since then, funds have seized the chance to prop the index up in order to pad their own performance.\n\nWhatever the case, volume has been depressed for more than three months now and so it was again this week. In yesterday's session some 3.1 billion units worth $793.3 million were traded, of which $358 million or 45 per cent was done in the 30 index components.\n\nMeanwhile, the penny stock segment which has been in the doldrums for about two months has started to show signs of life. It also has a new leader - Charisma Energy, which has topped the actives list for several days now. In yesterday's session, the counter fell 0.4 cent to 7.8 cents with 622 million shares traded. Others in heavy play included Otto Marine, Albedo and HanKore.\n\nIn its Dec 23 Economics & Strategy Viewpoint, Schroders said investor concerns next year will shift from growth and \"tail risks\" to rising bond yields as the US economy reaches take-off velocity and the Fed reduces monetary stimulus.\n\n\"Whilst the growth picture should continue to improve in the US and the UK, the eurozone and Japan are expected to struggle to reach a self-sustaining growth path,\" said Schroders. \"The emerging markets picture is more mixed, but overall a firm US dollar and weaker commodity prices will weigh on the region.\"\n\nIt added that growth in China is likely to be subdued as reforms are introduced to bring more market discipline into the banking sector and that higher bond yields will squeeze the equity risk premium.\n\n\"If US Treasury yields were to rise to 4 per cent, the equity risk premium would go back to the 2007 level and would challenge equity markets as global growth was considerably stronger before the crisis,\" said Schroders. On Thursday, the 10-year US Treasury yield stood at 3 per cent.\n\nIn its Dec 23 \"Back to the Economy\" report, Rabobank said it is optimistic for the US economy because substantial progress has been made in the recovery process after the Great Recession.\n\n\"The excess supply in the housing market has largely disappeared and house prices have been rising since February 2012,\" said Rabobank.\n\n\"Residential investment has rebounded and is actually contributing to economic growth. The US has also been very aggressive in recapitalising the banking system. Consumers have been deleveraging significantly and have benefited from rising house and stock prices. What's more, employment growth has picked up in recent months and that should ultimately lead to income gains.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Our strength is in integration (of the components).\"\n\nMr Wong said that even though Japan would provide Keppel with a high-quality option, it would not be costly. \"They (the Japanese yards) are pretty hungry right now and they are prepared to work on a long-term basis with us.\"\n\nHe also appeared unfazed by the prospect that collaborating with Japanese partners would allow them to build their own capabilities and they may consequently become Keppel's direct competitors over time. Mr Wong said he was not concerned by that possibility for now, even though he noted that the Japanese rigbuilders have been expanding their presence in Brazil, as it would be difficult for them to gain much ground in an already competitive sector.\n\nThe topside of the drillship, which is due to be completed in 2016, will be built in Singapore, with its hull to be built by a Japanese sub-contractor.\n\nSingapore's two rigbuilders - Keppel and Sembcorp Marine - have had to deal with increased competition with Chinese yards offering cheaper and more attractive financing options. To address this price competition, Keppel has had to focus on quality, while remaining competitive.\n\nMr Wong illustrated that the general price of jackup rigs has increased marginally from about US$180 million in 2010 to about US$215 million in 2013 and that it has managed to keep price increases in check because Keppel has good and efficient methods of building, in addition to the large volumes it builds which allow it to reap the benefits of economies of scale.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 27, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGET ready to do the Samba. It's no secret that Singaporeans love to travel, and not even thoughts of a 30-hour flight crammed into economy class will dampen their enthusiasm.\n\nNo surprises for guessing the next hot destination for 2014 then - travel agents are already betting on South America as the top destination for adventure seekers this year.\n\n\"South America is definitely a big one for 2014 especially in the run-up and aftermath of the World Cup,\" says Nikki Pang, regional marketing manager at Lightfoot Travel, a luxury tour operator.\n\nShe adds that while people may not travel specifically for the tournament which takes place from June 12 to July 13, \"it's definitely on people's radar a lot more due to all the hype, and we've seen our enquiries to South America increase significantly in the past six months.\" Peru and the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador are the two most popular destinations, with Brazil a close third.\n\nHotels.com's managing director Abhiram Chowdhry notes that the recent World Cup match draw has prompted an increase in accommodation searches for many of the host cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia. \"As we draw closer to the event, we can expect an even bigger booking boom,\" he adds.\n\nBut South America isn't the only hot destination for next year. Kathmandu, Sapporo, Hanoi and Siem Reap top the list of TripAdvisor's 2013 Travellers' Choice Awards for Destinations on the Rise in Asia.\n\nTripAdvisor's spokesman Jean Ow-Yeong explains that these travel spots have seen the greatest increase in positive traveller feedback and interest in the past year. \"They provide inspiration for travellers planning their 2014 trips,\" says Ms Ow-Yeong.\n\nCurrency and travel patterns\n\nTravel experts also say that countries which have always been a favourite with Singaporeans will still continue to be popular.\n\nAustralia is one such example, especially with the Aussie dollar at an all-time low since 2010. Japan is another hot spot, again because of the weakening yen. But rather than the usual Tokyo, Kyoto or Hokkaido, travellers are heading out to lesser-known islands such as Shikoku and Okinawa. Mr Chowdhry says, \"In 2014, we can expect currency fluctuations to continue to have an impact on travel patterns.\"\n\nTravel insiders also expect film locations such as New Zealand to be popular again, now that The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is in theatres.\n\nMr Rufus Tan, director of product development at Quotient Travelplanner has been getting enquiries about travel to Iceland. He admits he isn't completely sure why Iceland is gaining in popularity, but \"I think that exposure in recent films could have played a part.\" The more prominent movies featuring Iceland include Thor: The Dark World, the Game of Thrones series, which was partially filmed in Iceland and also the upcoming movie Noah, starring Russell Crowe. \"Even though Noah has not been released, shots of the filming have already been tweeted by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, which would have generated interest in the country,\" says Mr Tan.\n\nGoing around in a country on a coach bus may be the easiest way to get around, but Buck Low, chief executive of Prime Touch and Feel, the online arm of Prime Travel & Tour, believes self-drive tours will be even more popular next year.\n\n\"With cars being so expensive in Singapore, the urge to get behind the wheel takes on a more entertaining form with self-drive holidays. For first-time holiday drivers, it is good to start with a drive in Japan, and move on to Australia, the US and Europe where the transport networks, courteous drivers and relatively shorter distance between towns will make anyone feel it is even easier driving there than in Singapore,\" says Mr Low.\n\nSelf-drive tours allow you to pick the stops and more importantly have control of your time. There's no need to wake up at 6am to hop onto the coach - you can even sleep in till 10am if you wish. Perhaps this desire for leisurely travel is also what's fuelling the new-found popularity of train travel and cruises.\n\nHajar Ali, founder of luxury travel company Urbane Nomads says train travel is becoming more fashionable as it represents the golden age of travel when it was a glamourous affair. \"There is a greater interest in slow travel, which includes cruises,\" she adds. \"Luxury trains, steamships and traditional ships offer the romance of the old style of travel with contemporary luxury.\"\n\nChan Brothers' marketing communications manager Jane Chang notes that rail holidays are \"definitely up and coming with an average 20 per cent year-on-year increase in demand\". The agency's rail holidays in Europe feature high-speed trains conveniently operating from one city centre to another, allowing travellers to make the most of their trip with the flexibility of extension in each city.\n\nRegional appeal\n\nOn the cruise front, fly/cruise travel to Alaska, as well as river cruising along European rivers, such as the Danube, Seine and Rhine will continue to be popular next year, says Kelly Toh, marketing manager at CTC Travel.\n\nCloser to home, \"regional cruises will take off even more now that the new Marina Bay Cruise Centre can berth larger ships,\" says Alicia Seah, marketing communications director for Dynasty Travel.\n\nFor some travellers it is not the destination that matters but the experiences and, naturally, the more exotic the greater the bragging rights.\n\nNext year, Urbane Nomads' Ms Hajar will launch heli-skiing trips in Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Russia, Greenland and Iceland. Heli-skiing is off-trail, downhill skiing that is accessed by a helicopter, versus a ski lift. \"For those new to heli-skiing, there will be lessons and their first heli-ski runs in Canada,\" says Ms Hajar.\n\nShe is also planning for gourmet-skiing trips to Japan, Italy and Switzerland. \"These trips will combine skiing with meals at some of the best restaurants and private ski chalets,\" she says.\n\nWhile hotels remain the main accommodation choice for most travellers, others are picking more unusual ones.\n\nAlan Chang, managing director for Airbnb Northeast Asia says, in 2014, he expects travellers not just to be making their holiday choices by destination, but by accommodation type, too. \"At Airbnb, we've been seeing a growing trend of travellers opting for more unusual spaces, like castles, boats and igloos,\" he says. Airbnb's most popular property is a treehouse in California, and the site now has about 300 treehouses listed globally.\n\n\"This shift is ultimately changing the way that people travel. As people get more adventurous, they search out an authentic local experience where they can really immerse themselves in a culture and feel the soul of a place,\" says Mr Chang.\n\nWith hot destinations and new travel experiences lined up, all that is left is to decide what to pack.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 60 per cent of all corn, soya beans and wheat exports exit the country via the Gulf.\n\nThe Mississippi River is already closed for the season north of the Iowa-Missouri border.\n\nA major lock repair project will close lock 22 near Saverton, Missouri, for about two months beginning in early January so barge operators have moved most of their fleets south of that point already.\n\nThe Illinois River typically remains open through the winter, but low water on the Mississippi River has created a river navigation bottleneck near St Louis.\n\nDespite shippers loading less grain on each barge so vessels ride higher in the water, several tows have grounded in the area over the past two weeks, prompting sporadic river closures for emergency dredging by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe Mississippi River gauge at St Louis was at minus-1.47 feet (-44.8cm) at midmorning on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe river was forecast to rise slightly by Friday before steadily falling to minus-3.6 feet over the next two weeks, just a foot above the 24-year low hit January.\n\nIce was also likely to build more quickly on the lower-than-normal rivers. \"I haven't heard of any new problems today, but if it stays this cold for three or four days it's going to be a challenge getting in and out of the Illinois River come next week,\" a barge broker said.\n\n\"Fortunately we had some warm weather last week and some moisture which allowed that river ice to get cleared up before this cold snap.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Many in the industry are bemoaning it, but it did result in two positive outcomes.\n\nFirst, the advent of creative tech solutions for productivity: 2013 is the year that online reservations became mainstream along with app-based ordering and payment. There are even wait-list and automated payment solutions on the way.\n\nThe second positive outcome is a renewed focus on attracting and retaining talent. Our group has approached this by adopting a staff-first strategy and focusing our efforts on building a culture of hospitality, training plans and career development. Many companies stop at defining a customer experience, but we also work to define our ideal employee experience. Happy staff are key to creating the great customer experiences that have helped us stand out from the crowd.\n\nBut the biggest impediment to the industry is real estate-related, and it is a challenge that is very structurally ingrained. The average lease term in Singapore is three years, which is insufficient to allow an entrepreneur to plan and build a long-term business. Compare this to the 10 to 15-year leases in New York and London. Even entrepreneurs attracted by government grants or a good initial rental offer in Singapore can run into continuity issues once the initial lease term is up.\n\nAn emerging trend I've noticed this year is the quest for authenticity. We're seeing more concepts that draw heavily from the heritage of a location. We were one of the first to do this when we opened The White Rabbit in a restored 1940s chapel and we did it again this year with The Black Swan, bringing a beautiful old Art Deco space back to life. It's something I hope to continue seeing in Singapore even as we become more cosmopolitan.\n\nInterestingly, the Central Business District is evolving into something more than a pure work environment. It's quickly becoming an area for lifestyle and the success of The Black Swan is testament to that. I'd love to see our CBD achieve the vibrancy of those in cities like Sydney and London and I really hope we can be a catalyst for that.\n\nFood-wise, \"fusion\" is still a dirty word but, ironically, it has returned as a dominant style of cooking. Melding East and West flavours has produced some truly remarkable cuisine in the past year and I think it's high time the concept is fully re-embraced.\n\nIn terms of drinks, we've found that the Singapore consumer has become as adventurous as he is discriminating. Cocktails are now more spirit forward, with geographically distinctive spirits such as pisco, mezcal, sake and bourbon starting to take the spotlight.\n\nAs for the group, The Black Swan will continue to be our focus for the first half of 2014. The concept has been successful for lunch and dinner but our vision for it remains as an iconic all-day destination. To that end we'll be launching high tea and late night supper offerings soon.\n\nLater in the year we'll be working on adding a charming new dimension to The White Rabbit by shaping The Rabbit Hole into a beautiful, colonial-style garden bar with lush landscaping.\n\nLastly, Tanjong Beach Club will be launching a new seafood barbecue programme created in collaboration with The Naked Finn. Its focus will be on sourcing and serving the freshest and very best seafood. Tanjong Beach Club sits on Singapore's most picturesque stretch of beach and a seafront dining option will complete that amazing experience.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

South Korea's three biggest shipping companies all face a cash crunch as three trillion won of bonds are due for repayment in the next two years amid mounting losses from a global slump in rates to carry cargo.\n\nHahn & Co, which will also invest 100 billion won into the venture, will control a company that has 36 vessels that Hanjin Shipping operates under long-term contracts.\n\nHanjin Shipping's debt-to-equity ratio will fall to 673 per cent from 987 per cent at the end of September, once the venture starts operations as early as in April, according to the statement. The 1.4 trillion won debt associated with the 36 vessels will be transferred to the venture, it said.\n\nKorean Air Lines, an affiliate of the shipping company, said last week it will provide 100 billion won in loans, on top of the 150 billion won it gave to Hanjin Shipping in October. KAL will also buy 400 billion won of new shares the shipping company plans to sell next year.\n\nHanjin Shipping has about 1.56 trillion won of debt, including bonds and loans, coming due next year and 1.08 trillion won in 2015, according to the company. At the end of September, it had cash and near-cash items of 382 billion won.\n\nHahn & Co currently manages about 850 billion won in assets in cement, auto parts and electronics components. The fund dropped a bid in February to buy Korea Line Corp, the country's second-biggest operator of bulk ships that was then under court receivership. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The \"tsunami of price hikes\" is expected to place a significant strain on consumers and businesses, although the Malaysian government maintains that short-term pain is necessary for the longer-term good.\n\nCritics, however, see Putrajaya as the profligate consumer that has maxed out on its credit card and overdraft facilities and now expects the public to shoulder the burden.\n\nHow the price increases will impact consumer demand, which has helped boost growth in years past, remains to be seen. But consumers and businesses are undoubtedly approaching 2014 with a great deal of trepidation, the official projections of 5-5.5 per cent GDP growth notwithstanding.\n\nAfter putting off the tough decisions in the past 2-3 years to win public support ahead of the 13th General Election in May this year, the incumbent Barisan Nasional (BN) federal government has had to introduce a slew of price increases to ward off a sovereign ratings downgrade and higher borrowing costs.\n\nGiven the scheduled implementation of a 6 per cent goods & services tax (GST) in April 2015, Putrajaya does not have much time to push increases through as they will be even more unpopular after the tax kicks in.\n\nTo add to the recent extension of the early retirement age and the implementation of a minimum wage, fuel prices were raised by 20 sen a litre in September, but another hike or two cannot be discounted in 2014.\n\nPower tariffs will jump by an average 15 per cent in January and most toll roads are also due for scheduled increases. Logistics players and school and public transport operators are demanding higher fares as well.\n\nPutrajaya has argued that the measures are essential to whittle down the enormous fuel subsidies that put a great strain on the budget deficit (expected at 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2014) and soaring public debt (just under 55 per cent of GDP). To be sure, fuel and power tariffs continue to be heavily subsidised even after the latest round of increases.\n\nSince 1997, Malaysia's national oil company Petronas has foregone an astounding RM200 billion (S$77 billion) as a result of oil and gas subsidies, underscoring the great misallocation of resources as well as how long such populist policies have been in place even though the economic costs had been growing.\n\nThe Kuala Lumpur municipal council has also been guilty of foot dragging. Saying property assessment charges had not been reviewed in 21 years, it has proposed an increase - which in some cases is as much as 600 per cent - earning the ire of residents.\n\nComing all at once, Malaysia's lower and middle-income earners will have to bite the bullet especially hard even though the government has assured them of targeted aid. The consumer price index (CPI), slightly over 2 per cent in 2013, is forecast to climb to 3.8 per cent in 2014.\n\nWith household debt already at 83 per cent of GDP - one of the highest in emerging economies - a hike of 25-50 basis points in the key overnight policy rate of 3 per cent could be detrimental if borrowers are already stretched.\n\nAnd businesses, long dependent on subsidies, may strain to weather the challenges. A weaker ringgit - currently at about 3.22 to the US dollar but projected to slide towards 3.3 next year - will worsen the anticipated chain reaction although it should benefit exporters.\n\nEquity investors have already shied away from sectors perceived to be hurt most by the price hikes, including steel manufacturers, retail, real estate investment trusts (Reits) and building materials.\n\nEven so, the benchmark FBMKLCI is expected to see gains in the low teens in 2014, having gained about a tenth year to date. Year-end targets next year range from 1,910 to 1,970 points. The KLCI is trading at the 1,840 level.\n\nInitial public offerings performed reasonably well in 2013, albeit after a slow first half owing to political uncertainties over the general election.\n\nThe public share sale of long-haul budget airline AirAsia X was one of the biggest for the year, raising US$310 million. But despite waiting out the GE, it still fared miserably and is one of the worst-performing IPOs, about a fifth below its offer price. Founder Tony Fernandes put it eloquently recently, when he said: \"The shares are in the toilet.\"\n\nThe largest IPO, Westports Holdings, raised about US$680 million, but has also been lacklustre. It remains little changed from its RM2.50 offer price.\n\nSmaller IPOs proved far more rewarding, yielding generous double-digit percentage gains. They include developer Matrix Concept, oil & gas player UMW Oil & Gas, and condom maker Karex.\n\nThe IPO pipeline in 2014 is expected to be reasonably interesting with two large property companies - both \"Iskandar plays\" - looking to raise funds for future expansion.\n\nBut how soon government-owned Iskandar Investment Bhd (IIB) and Iskandar Waterfront Holdings (IWH) go public remains to be seen. IWH's corporate restructuring exercise has been time- consuming and, in the interim, new property measures have been introduced to cool the market.\n\nGrowth in the property sector after 8-9 solid years - particularly in more recent years - is anticipated to be more pedestrian in 2014 following the introduction of higher property taxes, more stringent financing and limits to easy financing schemes.\n\nHow much property speculation or flipping contributed to the robust demand will be better known in the coming months. Prices in the secondary market could slip if these buyers lack holding power but in the primary market, prices are not expected to slip given the sharp escalation in power tariffs, raw materials, land, labour and nearly everything else that goes into building a house.\n\nThe most popular real estate hubs - Klang Valley, Penang and Iskandar Malaysia in Johor - will be closely watched.

Under extreme circumstances, reserves can be used to provide finance.\n\nThis makes the four countries \"very exposed in the event of a sudden stop (in foreign financing)\", said Mr Wade.\n\nIn contrast, the \"thrifty three\" comprising South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines have improved their deficit position and will also stand to benefit from export recoveries to the US and Europe, he added.\n\nA reduction in the US monetary stimulus would also affect emerging market equities, as a stronger US dollar leads to lower commodity price and therefore the performance of equities in these markets.\n\nThis could delay the recovery in emerging market equities, said Mr Wade.\n\nBut he added: \"It should be said though that the current underperformance by the EM equity market is either building in a future appreciation of the USD already, or is getting overdone.\"\n\nGlobally, higher US treasury yields would reduce the equity risk premium as the gap narrows between equity and bond yields.\n\nTo counter the more challenging equity markets, Schroders expects companies to step up share buy-backs next year to reduce their equity base and boost earnings per share.\n\nInvestors will also move away from bond-proxies in the equity market next year, as higher treasury yields cause them to reconsider the merits of utilities and Reits, said Schroders.\n\n\"Economic recovery should bring increased focus on cyclical stocks such as industrials and materials.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, the search for yield will continue, but will be less of a driver of markets as investors buy into the upswing and focus more on rising activity,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With that in mind, what should one be looking to buy in 2014? One should look at it from two points of view: first, in the context of one's personal cellar and second, from an investment point of view.\n\nViewing with one's personal cellar in mind is simpler (and saner). The key questions being (1) what to replenish; and (2) what to stock up, in terms of laying down of young wines to mature. One's drinking habits (both from preferences and from actual consumption patterns) will influence choices, but it would be fairly general practice to fill up the spaces emptied by the year's consumption, and also to provide a reasonable estimation of increase in drinking volumes.\n\nThe investment angle combines pleasure and business, killing two birds with one stone! Right now, it has taken a bit of a hit - a downturn amounting almost to a crash. But then, we forgot Newton's law of gravity. What goes up must come down!\n\nChampagnes\n\nBuying ahead and laying down my favourite non-vintage Champagne aperitif, Laurent Perrier NV, allows me to serve (and drink) non-vintage champagnes which taste like its vintage brother. Many guests have mistaken it for vintage, giving me great pleasure to reveal that it is only a simple NV. Vintage champagnes when laid down undergo development and maturation in the same way as vintage wines. What is not as well realised is that this also applies to non-vintage champagne when laid down. A non-vintage champagne drunk soon after it is released is youthful, and fresh, sometimes on the sharp side.\n\nLay it down for at least a year to develop and the result is astonishingly good. It takes on the character of vintage champagne - less sharp, more rounded and fuller, and riper on the palate. It will not taste the same as a vintage champagne laid down the same period, but it will certainly taste better than a freshly released non-vintage champagne.\n\nAvailable cellar space is needed however, but that is a small price to pay for years of more pleasurable drinking ahead. It is also more than made up by the money saved at time of purchase - NV is cheaper than Vintage!\n\nRed wines\n\nThis is the time to stock up on Bordeaux. Prices are well down, in some instances up to 40 per cent. It amounts to a stock market crash in wine! Most affected are the First Growths, especially Lafite which in the dizzy days of the boom reached stratospheric heights. Still expensive but within striking range for wine lovers.\n\nFor the less ambitious, all the lower Growths are also more affordably priced and that is where good opportunities lie, for example, the top Seconds such as Pichon Lalande, Cos d'Estournel, Ducru Beaucaillou, and Leoville Lascases. Leoville Barton has always been sensibly priced even in the halcyon days of the Bordeaux boom. Owner Anthony Barton's reply to my congratulating him on his very affordable pricing was \"that is what my wine is worth\".\n\nOn the right bank, similar price drops have occurred except that the recent promotion of Angelus and Pavie from the rank of Premier Grand Cru Classe 'B' to Premier Grand Cru Classe 'A' has seen significant price increases, keeping them in line with those of Cheval Blanc.\n\nUnfortunately for burgundy lovers, Burgundies have gone the other way. They have followed the current trend in computer storage, using \"iCloud\" storage! Up in the clouds. DRC being in a class by itself, top favourites such as Comtes de Vogue, JF Mugnier, Christophe Roumier, Armand Rousseau, Dujac, Ponsot, Leroy, etc, are now where Lafite was. Top burgundies have always commanded their own market - productions are small, minute in comparison to those of First Growth Lafite, for instance, and demand is insatiably high. \"You have to wait until someone in my current list of customers dies\" is the answer I once got from a top Burgundian grower. The other unwelcome development is that mainlanders have discovered Burgundy. And they are not only after the wines, they are after the vineyards!\n\nThere are some less well known Burgundian producers well worth looking at, such as Folin Arbelet, Fourrier, Robert Groffier, as well as newer ones such as Domaine Roche de Bellene and Philippe Pacalet. They are making good to excellent wines at affordable prices. It would be tantamount to wine snobbery to ignore the excellent wines from the big Burgundian houses of Drouhin, Faiveley, and Jadot. These may be called Maisons but in reality they are more Domaines than Maisons. Their vineyard holdings are very extensive, and include all the Premiers and Grand Crus they produce. I cannot commend them too highly - indeed they are firm fixtures on my annual vineyard-crawl list.\n\nRhone wines constitute another group which is much neglected, to our loss. Apart from a small group of stratospheric-priced wines, eg \"La-Las\" of Guigal and the Reserve de Celestins of Henry Bonneau, both Northern and Southern Rhone wines are reasonably priced. Furthermore, Rhone wines, both North and South, full-bodied, lush and fruity are admirably suited to our spicy cuisines. Hermitage La Chapelle and Jaboulet were made famous worldwide by the annual visits of the late peripatetic Gerard Jaboulet. Jaboulet is now owned by the Frere family but not withstanding the inevitable change in wine style, their wines still command attention. Guigal and Chave in Northern Rhone, Beaucastel, Domaine Pegau and Ch\u00e2teau Rayas in Southern Rhone. Rayas proper is scarce and very expensive. Highly recommended is their second wine, Pignan, and their Southern Rhone, La Pialade.\n\nFinally, it is time to discover the excellent and well-priced wines of Italy and Spain.\n\nThe advent of Sassicaia heralded the \"Super-Tuscan\" fashion. Sassicaia was rapidly followed by Solaia, and the rest is history. It brought home to the wine consumer that some excellent wines were also to be found in Italy. This also gave impetus to the rest of Tuscany, Montalcino in particular, and to the other main wine region, Piedmont. Tuscany's Chianti Classico DOCG, and Piedmont's Barbera and Dolcetto are for daily drinking and at excellent prices. Worthy of long-term cellaring are the top Chianti Classicos - eg Castello di Ama, Isole e Olena and the rest. In Piedmont, names such as Giacomo Conterno, Gaja, Altare, Paolo Scavino, Sandrone, Voerzio, Clerico, and Guido Fantino command attention. Barolos are not cheap but the Barberas and Dolcettos are, and delicious too.\n\nSpain is still somewhat of well-kept secret. Vega Sicilia still stands out but has been joined by Pingus also from the Ribera, and Alvaro Palacios, who now manages three properties spread throughout the breadth of Spain - the family winery Palacios Remondo in the Rioja, his own Alvaro Palacios in Priorato, and his trail-breaking Descendientes de Palacios in Bierzo.\n\nVega's other Bodegas, Alion in the Ribera, Pintia in Toro, and now the newest member of the Vega family, Macan in the Rioja, are producing lovely fruity-soft and reasonably priced wines which are delicious and highly recommended. As indeed are all the wines of Palacios and Pingus, but be advised that their top wines are Spain's most expensive wines!\n\nWe are well spoilt for choice, and perhaps more knowledgeable about selection than in most other Asian cities. In the words of a famous English wine critic and wine writer, Singapore wine consumers are more educated than in other Asian cities.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Eurekahedge Japan Hedge Fund Index, which tracks about 80 funds, returned 24 per cent in the 11 months through November, heading for the best year since the Singapore-based researcher began compiling data in 2000.\n\nJapanese hedge funds swung from the world's worst performers in 2012 to the best as the central bank's reflation efforts put the benchmark Topix index on course for the biggest increase in 14 years and weakened the yen by 17 per cent versus the dollar. Assets at the Japan-focused funds tracked by Eurekahedge increased US$451 million in the second half of 2013 - the most since the six months ended August 2011.\n\n\"Japan has come full circle for a lot of investors,\" said David Baran, co-chief executive officer of Tokyo-based Symphony Financial Partners. \"Many investors felt that all Japanese companies were bad investments, which was patently inaccurate. Those investors who have dismissed Japan have been motivated to come back to the market by Abenomics.\" Mr Baran's US$300 million SFP Value Realization Fund returned 73 per cent this year through November, net of fees, according to a letter to investors.\n\nThe Eurekahedge Japan Index returned 6 per cent in 2012 - the worst performer among five geographical region indexes tracked by the data provider. This year's 24 per cent return through November compares with a 7 per cent advance in the global index, an 8.5 per cent return by the measure tracking North American funds, and a 12 per cent increase in the Asian index excluding Japan.\n\nMr Abe took office in December 2012 pledging a three- pronged strategy of aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and deregulation that investors have welcomed. The Topix has surged 49 per cent this year, heading for the best year since 1999, when it gained 58 per cent.\n\nBank of Japan (BOJ) governor Haruhiko Kuroda, whom Mr Abe picked for the job, began a monetary easing campaign of unprecedented size in April, pledging to double Japan's monetary base by boosting purchases of bonds and other financial assets to generate 2 per cent inflation in about two years.\n\nThe slide in the yen's value helped bolster sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers to the highest level since 2007, a quarterly BOJ report on Dec 16 showed.\n\n\"Abenomics has played a major role in the comeback of Japanese hedge funds but, equally important, is the gradual return of risk appetite among investors in the US and Asia,\" said Ed Rogers, CEO of Tokyo-based Rogers Investment Advisors. \"The best-performing Japanese hedge funds have been a significant source of alpha for many years, and 2013 will hopefully serve as a catalyst for growth in the industry in 2014.\" (Alpha refers to returns in excess of those of the benchmarks.)\n\nAmong the best performers were warrant funds, which benefited from an increase in convertible-bond sales. Japanese companies raised a combined 631 billion yen (S$7.6 billion) through convertible-bond offerings this year, the most since 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStratton Street's Japan Synthetic Warrant Fund returned 359 per cent this year through November. The fund, which is offered in yen, benefited from a pick-up in the convertible bond market, according to the company.\n\nThe fund seeks to create geared exposure to the Japanese equity market through investments in asset-swapped convertible bonds and listed and over- the-counter warrants in companies that are quoted on Japanese stock exchanges, according to the UK manager.\n\nThe US$33.3 million Northwest Warrant Fund Ltd also benefited from the revival in Japan's convertible-bond market. It returned 208 per cent this year through November, according to the firm.

Sadly, many music fans in Singapore turn to piracy as an option. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, between 45 and 50 per cent of Internet users in Singapore accessed unlicensed sites earlier last year to download files such as music and movies. Globally, 28 per cent of Internet users accessed unauthorised sites on a monthly basis. This proves that piracy is a local and global concern. Music piracy ultimately hurts record sales for the artist.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": [{"image_url": null, "alt_text": null}]}

It's important to note that we are not ending Mosaic - while Mosaic Music Festival will see its final edition in its current format (where a series of gigs are spread over 10 days), the Esplanade will continually look into presenting music experiences in a different way. (We are) a mission-driven organisation that aims to bring the arts to diverse segments of audiences; evolving Mosaic is part of our mission.\n\nWhen the Festival began in 2005, it presented a diverse range of music in one festival, something which was not available in Singapore at the time. (Back then) Singapore's music scene was vastly different - it was focused on the mainstream and nowhere near as vibrant. Mosaic was the first to bring such a large and diverse range of performers and genres to Singapore, and we have helped to develop music audiences here. Now that there is a growing number of commercial concerts and festivals, it is a good time for the Esplanade to look at how we can contribute to the music scene in ways that others are not or cannot.\n\nThe vibrancy of the music scene today is not about one major festival or the individual concerts; (it's) the collective result of these various efforts.\n\nSingapore's music scene has been growing - with many new concerts and festivals being announced just this year alone. It is good that artists are beginning to see Singapore as an important audience for their music. They will continue to perform here as long as they are presented in a way that best brings out their music and talent, and if their shows here continue to do well.\n\nFor us, Mosaic has always been about the music. The concert experience that we offer has always put the music at the forefront, putting the music in the best possible setting. Ten years on, Singapore's music scene is now vastly different and we can now think about how to push the boundaries even further, to offer audiences an experience with music at a much deeper level. Mosaic has allowed audiences to experience a wide range of concerts over the years. We have contributed to the diversity of music available in the Singapore calendar, and this World of Music can be seen in our 2014 line-up.\n\nThe highlights of Mosaic will be captured in 10 years of Mosaic Moments - an exhibition that we are putting up to celebrate the festival's 10th year. Mosaic highlights come alive again in the form of videos, audio clips and photographs. You can expect to see images of great concert moments: behind- the-scene photos, autographed posters and photographs as well as artist messages, to name a few.\n\nThese include autographed posters of past Mosaic artists such as Hiromi, Tortoise, Kings of Convenience, Jason Mraz and more. You'll also see photographs of James Moody, who celebrated his 80th birthday with us at Mosaic Music Festival 2005; Miriam Makeba, who sang at our 2006 press conference; Shirley Horn and Montreux Jazz Festival founder and general manager Claude Nobs.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This means that when Asia-Pacific stocks increase one per cent, Singapore stocks increase 0.81 per cent. Unlike correlation, beta not just takes into account the strength of the direction of the relationship between two variables but also the magnitude.\n\nSingapore's stock market is the most sensitive to movements in Asia-Pacific markets, followed by world markets (beta 0.8) and Europe (0.65). This is followed by the US (about 0.64), Malaysia (about 0.61) and Hong Kong (about 0.59). It is least sensitive to Japan (about 0.31), Indonesia (about 0.32) and Thailand (about 0.36).\n\nIllustrating SIMSCI futures as a good hedging tool for Singapore and other Asia-Pacific indices, SGX said that selling one SIMSCI futures contract while staying invested in 25,000 units of the Nikko AM Singapore Straits Times Index exchange-traded fund (STI ETF) from Nov 29 to Dec 13 resulted in a net gain of $170, compared with a loss of $3,250 without the futures hedge. Futures allow investors to lock in a price today for an asset to be delivered at a future date.\n\nIn that time period, the Nikko STI ETF declined from 3.22 to 3.09. The SIMSCI index futures price fell from 368.11 to 351.01. Going short (selling) on one futures contract on Nov 29 and covering (buying it back) on Dec 13 would mean a gain of 17.1 index points at the contract multiplier of $200 per index point, or $3,420.\n\nSIMSCI futures are also highly correlated with other Asia contracts such as MSCI India Index futures, MSCI Thailand Index futures and SGX CNX Nifty Index futures, SGX added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition, Takenaka will also carry out road improvement works and build a 68-metre Ramp Control Tower to facilitate air traffic control.\n\nWith a passenger handling capacity of 16 million per year, T4 will boost Changi's existing passenger handling capacity which now stands at 66 million passengers each year.\n\nAside from T1, the Japan-based firm was also involved in upgrading works at T2 in 2006 and at T1 last year. Beyond Singapore, Takenaka has played a part in constructing various airports in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, including Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi and Narita International.\n\n\"There were very competitive bids from local and international companies with vast experience in the construction of major infrastructure projects,\" said CAG chief executive Lee Seow Hiang. \"The past few months have seen an intensive process for the CAG team, as it went through several rounds of evaluation. Takenaka Corporation delivered the best overall proposal, which included an innovative construction methodology.\"\n\nFour other firms took part in the tender, said CAG, without divulging names.\n\nTakenaka will work with the consortium that is drawing up design plans for the terminal, a team that includes SAA Architects, Benoy, AECOM Singapore and Beca Carter Hollings & Ferner (SEA).\n\n\"Being fully aware that Changi Airport shall continue to stay ahead as the air hub of the region, we are committed to deliver T4 of excellent quality, on time and with optimum safety,\" said Shoichiro Shibuta, general manager of Takenaka Corp (Singapore).\n\nFaced with increasing competition from other airports in the region, Changi is beefing up capacity and working at improving the passenger travel experience to remain the air hub of choice.\n\nThe new terminal will roll out more automated initiatives such as self-service check-in, bag drop, immigration clearance and boarding gate services, partly in a bid to better utilise manpower resources in a tight labour market.\n\nTo cut boarding time, CAG has already started to introduce self boarding gates in T2, as part of a trial run, which will be extended to more gates and terminals from April next year.\n\nMeanwhile, planning for a fifth terminal has already begun, with an eye on having Terminal 5 operational by the mid-2020s. In addition, a $1.47 billion mixed-use development, dubbed Project Jewel, will offer airport operations, retail and leisure offerings as well as hotel space when it opens in 2018.\n\nAnd a third runway will be introduced by 2020 to help tackle runway congestion as passenger traffic continues to grow on an annual basis, underpinned by robust travel demand in Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will enable organisations to send text or fax messages on related products and services to customers and members with whom they have an ongoing relationship, without the need to check the DNC Registry.\n\n\"Ongoing relationships\" between the individual and the sender could be in the form of commercial or non-commercial relationships, the commission said.\n\n\"These may include, for example, a subscription, membership, account, loan or comparable relationships involving the ongoing purchase or use of goods and services supplied by the sender to the individual. Relationships which may arise from regular participation in the activities of an organisation, such as students of a school or a donor with a standing order to regularly donate to a charity, may also be considered to be an ongoing relationship between the individual and the sender.\"\n\nThis means that a bank or a credit card company, for example, will be able to send its existing credit card holders telemarketing messages about related services like a rewards programme for credit card holders. Banks will be allowed to alert their existing home loan customers on a new refinancing package.\n\nTelcos will be able to message their existing home fixed-line broadband service subscribers new promotional packages with text messages like \"Enjoy faster speeds with fibre broadband at only $X a month\".\n\nBut as the new exemption order does not apply to voice calls, organisations are still required to check against the DNC Registry before making telemarketing calls to promote related products and services.\n\n\"In that regard, the Commission considers there to be a distinction between receiving this information in the form of a voice call, text message and fax message. As a voice call requires the immediate attention of an individual receiving it, it is arguably the most intrusive medium. On the other hand, text and fax messages do not require immediate attention, and individuals may choose to access them at a convenient time,\" the commission said.\n\nOn the exemption, the PDPC said it recognised that consumers may wish to continue receiving information in a minimally intrusive manner, via text or fax messages. It has also received feedback from organisations on their customers' expectation for such messages to be sent.\n\n\"Without this exemption, individuals may miss such messages if they are registered with the DNC Registry, and if the organisation, which they have an ongoing relationship with, did not obtain clear consent to send telemarketing messages to their telephone numbers,\" the PDPC said.\n\nTo rely on the exemption, organisations are required to provide information in their messages on how consumers can opt out of such messages, and allow consumers to opt out using the same medium by which the message is received. Upon receiving an individual's opt-out request, organisations must stop sending such messages to that individual within a specified time frame.\n\n\"The exemption order provides greater flexibility for organisations to serve their customers in a minimally intrusive manner, and the DNC Registry advisory guidelines aim to help them along with respect to telemarketing,\" said PDPC chairman Leong Keng Thai.\n\nThe new exemption and guidelines will complement those that were issued in September on key concepts and selected topics on the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).\n\nCome Jan 2, provisions under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the PDPA) requiring companies to check the Do Not Call Registry before sending telemarketing messages to consumers with Singapore telephone numbers via voice call, text message or fax will become effective. The Data Protection Provisions will kick in only on July 2, 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tycoon, 77, bought the firm in 2002 from its former owner businessman Wan Azmi Wan Hamzah and took it private the following year.\n\nAt the time, it was making RM50 million on sales of RM250 million a year. Between 2008 and 2010, however, the firm grew its earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation at a whopping compounded annual growth rate of 54 per cent. At the time of its relisting in 2011, Bumi Armada was making RM350 million on sales of RM1.24 billion a year.\n\nFor the nine months to end-October 2013, Bumi Armada made RM452 million on sales of almost RM2 billion. The firm is valued at close to RM9 billion today. More to the point, it has become a global player with operations spanning five continents.\n\nIt is the third largest operator of offshore support vessels in South-east Asia with the most modern fleet in the region. Bumi Armada is also the eighth ranked FPSO operator by fleet size globally.\n\nIn Monday's announcement, the firm said that it signed both contracts with British independent oil producer EnQuest plc and other partners to work on the Kraken field in the North Sea.\n\nThe contracts are for eight years, each with options for 17 annual extensions with the FSPO to be delivered to the Kraken field by 2016.\n\nSome 140 million barrels of heavy oil are expected to be extracted from the Kraken oil field over 25 years, Bumi Armada said.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Enquest specialises in extending the life of old oil fields and focuses on the North Sea. It is expected to spend about US$6.4 billion on developing Kraken.\n\nWith earnings at 25 times current prices, it isn't clear if Bumi Armada's shares are fairly valued. Analysts think not, however. A review of 11 analyst reports showed an average \"price target\" of RM4.59. For the record, its offer price upon listing was RM3.15.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Straits Times Index was the worst-performing developed market in 2013, dropping 9.5 per cent since Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said in May that bond purchases may be reduced on signs of sustainable US recovery.\n\nCapital has been fleeing South-east Asia as investors seek higher returns in North America. The market value of Singapore shares fell 5.6 per cent to US$567 billion this year as at Monday as 10-year US bond yields climbed to a two-year high in September, making dividends from the city-state's real-estate investment trusts less attractive.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose to a record after the Fed announced last Wednesday it was cutting stimulus, citing optimism about the labour market.\n\n\"Property companies will do badly, particularly in Singapore where there's a perceived housing bubble,\" said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-based fund manager at Schroders, which oversees about US$420 billion.\n\n\"If higher bond yields cause property prices to fall, there's an immediate impact on earnings. Cost pressure on banks will also increase as bond yields rise.\"\n\nThe Singapore's STI traded at 1.38 times book value as at Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 2.49 for the Philippine's PSEi Index, 2.37 for Indonesia's Jakarta Composite Index, 2.34 for the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index, and 2.07 for the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the data showed.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee said after its Dec 17-18 meeting that it will cut its US$85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds, also known as quantitative easing, to US$75 billion in January.\n\nThe central bank will reduce asset buying in US$10 billion increments over the next seven policy meetings before ending the programme in December 2014, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists last Thursday.\n\nThe STI surged 94 per cent from when the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate in December 2008 to this year's peak in May.\n\nReal estate and financial companies account for 47 per cent of the STI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSingapore's biggest property companies were among the worst performers in 2013, with City Developments Ltd plunging 25 per cent and CapitaLand Ltd falling 18 per cent. Jardine Cycle & Carriage Ltd, an automotive distributor that gets about 89 per cent of sales from Indonesia, fell 27 per cent to lead declines on the benchmark equity gauge.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund lowered its growth target for Indonesia, South-east Asia's biggest economy, to between 5 per cent and 5.5 per cent this year and next after 6.2 per cent expansion in 2012.\n\nSingapore's GDP is expected to grow 3.9 per cent in 2014 after an estimated 3.8 per cent rise this year, according to a quarterly survey released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore this month.\n\n\"Singapore's neighbours have not been doing so well, particularly Indonesia, where many of the property buyers in the city come from,\" said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd, which oversees about US$60 billion.\n\n\"The Singapore government has also been implementing tough property measures because they don't want housing prices to go through the roof.\"\n\nSingapore home prices increased at the slowest pace in six quarters in the three months ended Sept 30 after the government introduced new curbs to cool prices in Asia's second-most expensive property market.\n\n\"There's no driver to spur investor interest in Singapore,\" Baring's Mr Do said. \"The recent penny stock crash isn't really helping the case for investing in Singapore.\"\n\nAbout US$6.9 billion was wiped from the market value of three commodity companies over three days in October, prompting an investigation by the monetary authority and Singapore Exchange Ltd.\n\nThe average value of shares traded daily on SGX in the three months through December fell to S$1 billion, compared with S$1.24 billion a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBlumont Group Ltd, which invests in minerals and energy, soared more than 1,000 per cent this year through the end of September to lead gains on the FTSE Straits Times All-Share Index. The stock plunged from an all-time closing high of S$2.45 on Sept 30 to 7.8 Singapore cents on Dec 24.\n\nAsiasons Capital Ltd, the second-best performer, slumped 96 per cent from its record close of S$2.83 on Oct 1 through Dec 24. LionGold Corp tumbled 91 per cent from its S$1.725 peak on Aug 29 after deals to acquire gold assets fell through.\n\nThe plunge in shares prompted the bourse to seek approval to establish circuit breakers to minimise market volatility.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

So this year did not need to be excellent to seem much better than the last. In any case, 2013 didn't turn out to be outstanding. But was it better?\n\nThe sinking of the Costa Concordia in January gave 2012 a melancholy start. With 32 deaths, the incident put the cruise industry on the defensive and under intense political scrutiny. Then in July last year, the MSC Flaminia episode claimed three lives and showed several northern European coastal countries in their worst light as they refused to provide a place of refuge until the ship was eventually towed to a German port.\n\nUnfortunately, 2013 has also not been a good year where accidents are concerned. The Philippine domestic ferry St Thomas Aquinas sank after colliding with a cargo ship, the Sulpicio Express 7, in July. At least 116 people died.\n\nIn June, there was a stark reminder that large containerships can still have structural problems. The 8,110 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) post-panamax containership MOL Comfort suffered a crack amidships in bad weather about 200 nautical miles off the coast of Yemen and finally broke into two. The crew of 26 abandoned ship safely but the two sections of the ship eventually sank.\n\nThere have been, as in every year, numerous other accidents. As the year closes, we have had a nasty accident involving a barge, the Bolivian-flag barge Heng Hong 168, which capsized in Singapore waters about three nautical miles west of Horsburgh Lighthouse. At the time of writing, four of the 11 crew are still missing. The others have been rescued, with one making a near-miraculous escape from the upturned hull of the barge after being trapped inside for four days.\n\nThis incident underlined the fact that seafarers still face dangers on an everyday basis. This is something the rest of us should bear in mind, especially at festive times like Christmas.\n\nThis has been an especially difficult year for the Filipinos, who account for about a quarter of all seafarers on the international trading fleet. The devastation caused by November's Typhoon Haiyan was a big blow for some and gave cause for worry for many more. On the positive side, it does appear that the shipping industry responded well and provided effective support.\n\nThe shipping business also seems to be in a slightly better state than a year ago. Overall confidence levels in the industry rose to their highest in more than three years in the three months ended November, according to the latest Shipping Confidence Survey from international accountant and shipping adviser Moore Stephens.\n\nThe firm also noted encouraging news on freight rates, and evidence of an increased willingness to invest. But the good news was tempered by concerns over overtonnaging, operating costs and the cost of regulation.\n\nOne respondent to Moore Stephens' survey said: \"We clearly see an upswing in the markets when talking to various people at various locations in the last couple of months. There is, for the first time in a long while, a general feeling of optimism. Furthermore, the economic indicators, both small and large, all over the world, are pointing in the direction of recovery. We cannot expect it to reach the same levels as in 2007/2008, but a sustainable level of confidence is much better than skyrocketing markets - because the higher you climb, the lower you might fall.\"\n\nSaid Moore Stephens' shipping partner Richard Greiner: \"The findings of this latest survey provide more good news for the shipping industry. It is now 15 months since we recorded a decline in shipping confidence. There is an old adage which says that confidence is contagious. If that is true, shipping certainly seems to have caught the bug.\"\n\nMr Greiner added that there were still too many ships for the cargoes available on many trades. There was not the ready access to bank finance \"that many would like\". Operating costs were expected to rise over the next two years, following their decline last year. Crew wages were \"only moving in one direction\". The cost of keeping up with regulatory compliance had become a big-ticket item while liability insurance premiums were on the increase.\n\nHe concluded: \"These problems will not go away. But the prospect of being able to fund them properly is brighter now than for some time. Expectations of improved rates in the dry bulk sector are now higher than at any time in the last five years, while in the tanker market, the mood is at its most bullish for two-and-a- half years. In the container trades, things are meanwhile holding up well. In short, there should be more money about next year, although no shortage of things to spend it on.\"\n\nSo perhaps it is fair to say that the industry bids farewell to 2013 in better shape than it welcomed it. But it is an industry that is relearning the cyclical nature of its trade.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yet it has still outpaced almost two-thirds of its peers.\n\nInvestors yanked US$1.4 billion as at Nov 30, after it started the year with about US$5.3 billion, the second-biggest outflow as a percentage of assets among muni funds larger than US$1 billion, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund's 1.4 per cent loss in 2013 up to Dec 20 compares with an average drop of 1.9 per cent for its peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe fund weathered the withdrawals by choosing higher-quality, frequently traded debt, said Rick Taormina, head of muni strategies in New York. Half the fund's top 12 holdings as at Sept 30, including North Carolina general obligations, either had AAA ratings or were refunded, Bloomberg data show. Top-rated bonds are beating the US$3.7 trillion local market this year for the first time since 2008, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.\n\n\"Anytime we see markets really in turmoil, we tend to have better years,\" said Mr Taormina, who oversees about US$30 billion of local debt at J P Morgan Asset Management. \"The funds are built and managed to handle these kinds of flows because we know advisers and clients are looking at multiple asset classes. We're very conscious of having enough liquidity within the portfolios.\"\n\nMutual funds control about 17 per cent of the market for city and state debt. Individuals haven't discriminated in pulling US$59.2 billion from the investments this year, the most since at least 1992, when Lipper US Fund Flows data begin. The five vehicles with the most withdrawals as a percentage of assets include a long-term fund, an ultra-short option, as well as choices focusing on high-yield and investment-grade bonds, Morningstar data show.\n\nThe current streak of 30 straight weekly outflows began in May as investors bet that a stronger economy would lead the Federal Reserve to curb its bond buying, a decision it announced last week. Bondholders are betting the move will cause interest rates to rise, especially on securities with weaker ratings.\n\nDetroit's record bankruptcy in July and mounting concern that Puerto Rico's shrinking economy will crimp its ability to repay its debt propelled withdrawals. Munis are set to fall this year for the first time since 2008, Bank of America data show.\n\nOne segment of the market that has benefited is short-term debt, which tends to be penalised less than longer-maturity securities when investors bet on rising interest rates.\n\nAlpine Woods Capital Investors' Ultra Short Tax Optimized Income Fund has earned 0.5 per cent this year as at Dec 20, beating 69 per cent of its peers, Bloomberg data show.\n\nYet the fund, which started the year with US$1.7 billion in assets, faced US$467 million in outflows, the biggest proportion among the open-end funds tracked by Morningstar.\n\nSteven Shachat, who manages the fund from Purchase, New York, declined to comment.\n\nOther funds experiencing similar outflows trailed competitors. OppenheimerFunds' AMT-Free Municipals Fund and Eaton Vance Management's National Municipal Income Fund have lagged behind 94 per cent and 99 per cent of similar funds this year, respectively, Bloomberg data show. They experienced the fourth-largest and fifth-largest outflows relative to their size, Morningstar data show.\n\nDuring the past five years on average, OppenheimerFunds' holdings beat 99 per cent of comparable funds, while Eaton Vance's long-term investments outpaced 95 per cent.\n\n\"I'm holding onto the bonds that hurt me the most, because If I sell them now, I never have the chance to get back\" the price declines, said Tom Metzold, co-director of munis in Boston at Eaton Vance, which oversees about US$28 billion in local debt. \"I'm willing to experience greater volatility in the short term for five-year type of numbers.\"\n\nOppenheimerFunds managers weren't available to comment, said Kristen Prestano, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company at Prosek Partners.\n\nTom Weyl, director of muni research at Barclays plc, and Michael Zezas, chief muni strategist at Morgan Stanley, predict another year of negative returns for local debt in 2014. The securities have dropped 2.9 per cent this year, Bank of America data show.\n\nBonds in the lowest investment-grade tier have plunged 8.2 per cent, according to a Bank of America index.\n\nNext year will be another \"very volatile year\", Mr Taormina said. Bonds rated A to AA will probably fare best as their extra yield cushions against rising interest rates while, at the same time, the ratings aren't so low that any worsening of situations in places such as Puerto Rico will hurt the debt, he said.\n\nThe JPMorgan Intermediate fund has historically defeated its competition during volatile periods. It outperformed 75 per cent of peers in 2007 and 82 per cent in 2008, the first full year of the recession, Bloomberg data show.\n\nTop holdings as at Sept 30 included zero-coupon bonds issued by Adams County, Colorado, that have been refunded, and North Carolina general obligations maturing in March 2017. The state has top credit ratings.\n\nThe market closes today for Christmas and again on Jan 1. Issuers have set US$3.1 billion of long-term bond sales in the next 30 days, the least in about a year.\n\nThe interest rate on AAA 10-year munis is 2.95 per cent, compared with 2.93 per cent on similar-maturity Treasuries.\n\nThe ratio of the yields, a measure of relative value, is about 101 per cent, less than its five-year average of 102 per cent. The smaller the number, the costlier munis are in comparison.

By Lee Meixian\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Dec 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN one fell swoop, Tigerair has struck strategic alliances with three airlines, a move aimed at accelerating the budget airline group's business growth in key Asian markets without overstretching its resources.\n\nAnalysts by and large see the development as financially prudent. Saddled with receivables from its poorly performing Singapore, Australia, Indonesia and Philippines carriers, Tigerair's minimal equity investment in its tie-ups is its way of expanding its footprint without putting pressure on its balance sheet, they say.\n\nThe question uppermost in investors' minds is how effective this strategy will be in helping the struggling group to turn around. Or are the tie-ups more \"meow\" than \"roar\" as one analyst suggested?\n\nTwo of Tigerair's three partnerships - its interline agreement with India's SpiceJet and joint marketing deal with Singapore Airline's (SIA) Scoot - are non-equity strategic alliances, meaning they do not involve any financial investment, at least for now. Rather, they are more focused on sharing resources and capabilities to create a competitive advantage.\n\nThis less formal, lower commitment partnership works to Tigerair's favour because it does not require hefty fund and infrastructure investment, and mitigates the risk of entering a new market like India.\n\nAs UOBKayHian analyst K Ajith puts it, there is \"little to lose and a lot more to gain\".\n\nTigerair's most substantive partnership of the three - its joint venture with China Airlines to set up budget carrier Tigerair Taiwan - is the only one involving an equity investment, albeit a slight one of NT$200 million (S$8.4 million), for an initial one-tenth stake in the JV.\n\nThis stake pales in comparison to Tigerair's much larger stakes in its other affiliates, but group CEO Koay Peng Yen said during a conference call on Dec 16 that Tigerair could discuss increasing its commitment later. Meanwhile, it remains an \"asset-light\", \"win-win proposition\" to expand its \"paw print\" into the North Asian market.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, Tigerair Taiwan is expected to operate 12 aircraft in two to three years, starting with three A320s from Tigerair Group's 10 A320s slated for delivery during the fiscal year beginning April 2014.\n\nThere is also talk that Tigerair eventually plans to acquire up to another 39 per cent of the JV to reach the maximum stake allowed for a foreign shareholder, possibly by converting aircraft to equity.\n\nWhile UOB's Mr Ajith sees the initial stake as too small to make a meaningful contribution to Tigerair's bottom line, he believes the airline could benefit from leasing aircraft to the JV. \"Twelve aircraft by the end of 2016 is substantial, although it remains to be seen if the full number will be leased from Tigerair,\" he said.\n\nThis income is on top of the branding, licensing and marketing fees which Tigerair will receive from the JV that will operate under the Tigerair brand.\n\nCAPA, or the Centre for Aviation, reckons Tigerair's entry into Taiwanese skies will help to better distribute its fleet all round. Tigerair Singapore has taken most of the group's aircraft deliveries in 2013, leading to a rapid increase in capacity that has hurt load factor, yields and profitability, CAPA said. \"Having the option of placing some aircraft with a new affiliate will alleviate the pressure in Singapore and should improve the overall outlook for the group,\" it added.\n\nBut Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Ross, in jest, called the move \"really only a paw in the water\" and \"more meow than roar\". \"While we applaud China Airline's involvement in what we view as a growth element of Asian aviation . . . we do not perceive it as 'moving the needle'.\" He noted that while the North Asian market is under-penetrated by low-cost carriers, Tigerair Taiwan would still only account for 4 per cent of Taiwan's short-haul market and 1 per cent of the total market, even with five flights a day per aircraft.\n\nStill, if it's any comfort, China Airlines chairman Sun Hung-hsiang has given Tigerair Taiwan one year of operation to break even and told media that it will \"absolutely\" turn in a profit after three years of operation.\n\nMeanwhile, in India, while market observers welcome the greater connectivity that accompanies Tigerair's interline deal with SpiceJet, some were disappointed for the latter since it puts to rest speculation that Tigerair might be injecting equity investment into the debt-laden Indian carrier.\n\nSpiceJet, India's second-largest LCC, has been on a frantic hunt for a suitable foreign investor to acquire a minority stake to help it pay off its debts and expand its fleet, against a background of escalating costs, currency weakness and passenger slowdown.\n\nSL Narayanan, group CFO of Sun Group, which owns SpiceJet, told CNBC that the agreement would \"feed the travellers into each other's aircraft and in the process improve load factors. That is about it at this point in time.\"\n\nThe hope is that higher loads will translate into more income for Tigerair, but even if it doesn't, there are other benefits to the deal.\n\nFor one, with Tigerair passengers' access to India on SpiceJet's network, Tigerair is able to worry less about bilateral seat restrictions which currently allow Indian and Singaporean airlines to fly only 29,400 seats weekly between the two countries. These are mostly used up by SIA and its regional arm SilkAir.\n\nSecondly, this interline agreement gives Tigerair a first-mover advantage over its rival, AirAsia, in the India-South-east Asia market.\n\nThe agreement comes just months before AirAsia is set to launch a low-cost domestic airline in India, with a base in Chennai. The interline deal will be crucial in pre-empting AirAsia from ambitiously adding more cities from where it can connect passengers to destinations through its Chennai hub, India's Business Standard reported.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the partnership could later be extended to Tigerair's five other existing India routes and support the launch of new routes to India from Singapore or Indonesia, where Tigerair Mandala is based, CAPA said.\n\nOf course, the possibility that the interline agreement could be a precursor to an eventual equity stake acquisition cannot be ruled out, it added.\n\nThe potential synergies from the joint marketing deal with Scoot is harder to determine, but again, the obvious aim is to boost its top and bottom lines.\n\nCo-marketing with Scoot on parallel routes could remove excess capacity and subsequently improve passenger loads and yields. A better branding alongside Scoot could also enable it to raise fares and thus sales, market observers say.\n\nJoint ticket sales would also increase from the $740,000 collected in the quarter ending Sept 30, 2013 under their interline agreement.\n\nTo sum up, the partnerships - to help Tigerair expand its network, achieve greater cost-savings and build a stronger regional brand presence - appear to be a shrewd move.\n\nBut investors will need to be patient. As Credit Suisse analyst Annuar Aziz put it: While these initiatives are potentially positive for Tigerair, they have a long gestation period.\n\nleemx@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And it is, exceptfor one minor detail - it's made of human hair.\n\nAfter the initial jolt of surprise, curiosity takes over as you take a close look at what ink made from pulverised human hair looks like, as well as the texture of the green tea paper it's painted on.\n\nUS-based Chinese contemporary artist Gu Wenda's 27-metre long work for the upcoming Art Stage Singapore in January has a blockbuster air that befits international art fairs but as he shares, his aim is really to show how classical Chinese traditional art can be made contemporary and relevant to the art world today.\n\n\"Chinese ink has a long history and it's really the equivalent of oil painting in the Western art world. There's no other format in Chinese art with its unique aesthetics and cultural identity,\" explains the 58-year-old artist who was one of the leaders of the '85 avant garde art movement in China - an artistic response to the decades-long Cultural Revolution which purged China of its traditions.\n\nGu has been trying to widen the application of Chinese ink and calligraphy as much as possible since then.\n\n\"It's crucial to bring ink out of its traditional context so that it continues to be relevant to current society,\" he says, adding that he's also tried to do that with calligraphy and landscape paintings.\n\nFor the period between 1999 to 2001, Gu has been experimenting with ink and other materials. It's this \"ink alchemy\" period that provided the backdrop to his current practice - of using ink made from hair, he explains.\n\nThe idea behind this was derived from the concept of powdered hair in Chinese medicine. The Shanghai Medical Factory produces hair powder to treat anxiety. Gu re-appropriated that to symbolise how human hair-made ink can conceptually cure cultural anxiety. He also got a rice paper factory to use green tea to make paper, giving these national treasures a new meaning and life. From that period on, Gu became known for his works using genetic material.\n\n\"Since 2001, I've been thinking about how to use that human hair ink and green tea again, before deciding on the idea of the landscape,\" he says in a telephone interview from New York.\n\nHis Yanhuang DNA Landscape series will be one of the monumental pieces confronting visitors to Art Stage Singapore when they first enter the hall.\n\nThe last time Gu had a major art work in Singapore was just over a decade ago - at the 2002 opening of the Esplanade-Theatres by the Bay. His then United Nations - Man and Space installation was the talk of the town, with its 188 flags made of human hair, symbolising the DNA of people all over the world.\n\nThis time at Art Stage Singapore, where he is represented by Gajah Gallery, Gu's works aren't so controversial or eye-popping, but more symbolically intriguing, featuring also his calligraphic works.\n\nGu's experimentation with \"fake\" calligraphy in the 1980s in China, is what got him into hot water with the Chinese authorities and subsequently famous in the international art world.\n\n\"The officials who couldn't read the calligraphy that I invented felt that I could have been criticising the government. At that time though, as a young artist, I was just trying to create a new identity for Chinese art,\" recalls the China Academy of Art graduate, who was a student of classical landscape painting master Lu Yanshao.\n\nWith both feet entrenched in the Western and the Asian contemporary art worlds today, Gu is one of the leading Chinese artists to attain international status, with works that are culturally-rich and yet resonate globally.\n\nHe has been pushing for Chinese and Asian artists to know their classical traditions deeper but also better understand contemporary western art. \"It's a chance to create our own contemporary culture.'\n\nGu Wenda will be represented by Gajah Gallery at Art Stage Singapore, Jan 15-19, 2014, at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In Finland, they're trying to do something about this.\n\nPetri Paarnio, director of Santa Claus Licensing, the firm that holds the rights to market the Santa Claus name in Finland, wants to see him bring joy to children's hearts but also to generate business - all year round and all around the world, starting with China.\n\n\"Santa Claus is an icon. He stands for symbols like good health, solidarity, and values like giving without always expecting something in return,\" he said.\n\nSanta Claus Licensing and Finnish tourist authorities both feel the iconic brand could spawn a multi-million euro industry including computer games, international events, theme parks and merchandising.\n\nAs it is, thousands of tourists flock each Christmas to the Arctic city of Rovaniemi, the capital of Finland's northernmost Lapland region, in search of the \"authentic\" Santa Claus experience.\n\nBut the sparsely populated area, which claims the North Pole's most famous resident as their own, is not content with only filling hotels, activity centres, stores and restaurants over the holiday period.\n\n\"Father Christmas is Finland's best known brand but we've not made the most of his image as Finnish,\" Mr Paarnio said. \"Maybe because Christmas just takes place over a short period.\"\n\nAlthough the country is in the grip of recession and budgetary austerity, the Finnish parliament in December gave the green light for 300,000 euros (S$520,130) in funding to promote Finnish Santa Claus in China.\n\n\"In Europe Christmas is traditionally seen as a short period. But in Asia Father Christmas could be promoted as a completely separate character,\" said Mr Paarnio.\n\nSelling Santa has been made easier by national airline Finnair's increased links between Helsinki and Asia.\n\n\"We've always had very large numbers of Japanese visitors but China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore are growing in importance. And Russians fill the hotels after Christmas until early January.\"\n\nAnd the traffic has not just been one way.\n\nFor the past two years the white-bearded man of the north has made the trip from Rovaniemi to Fukushima in Japan to raise the spirits of children affected by the 2011 tsunami.\n\nIn contrast to the roly-poly American Santa, the Finnish variety has no black boots or belt but wears light brown boots made in Lapland, said Mr Paarnio.\n\nHe also wears a long red cloak - not the red suit of the well-known American character - and sports a much longer white beard. \"The length of his beard is strictly regulated and he's in much better health - he is slimmer - and moreover he doesn't say 'ho, ho, ho!' like his US counterpart,\" Mr Paarnio added.\n\nThe challenge, however, will be to convince consumers that the Finnish Santa is the real thing. But putting a price tag on his worth may be going a step too far - even for those who do it for a living.\n\n\"The concept of Santa Claus is not protected by copyright so its market value is next to zero,\" said Mika Maliranta, head of research at the economic think-tank ETLA.\n\nAnd trying to put a market value on Father Christmas may be seen as offensive in a country that takes the festive season very seriously.\n\n\"It might go against the values he stands for,\" said Finnish stock market analyst Mikael Rautanen at Inderes. \"And maybe the Christmas period is commercial enough already.\" AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/app-makers-get-set-christmas-day-rush", "site_title": "App makers get set for Christmas Day rush", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nApp makers get set for Christmas Day rush\n\nDec 25 has become the most lucrative day of the year for mobile app developers, when people unwrap shiny new gadgets and load 'em up\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Dec 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSan Francisco\n\nWHEN Walt Disney Co began considering the best time to release an iPad version of its popular online kids game \"Club Penguin\" this year, only one date came to mind.\n\n\"It was all designed to lead up to Christmas,\" said Chris Heatherly, the head of Club Penguin. Disney anticipates getting about half of its yearly subscribers for the virtual-world game during the week of Christmas - and especially on the holiday itself. \"It's definitely our prime time,\" he said.\n\nDisney's strategy illustrates how Christmas has become the most lucrative day of the year for makers of mobile applications, in what is now the equivalent of a Black Friday for US retailers or a Cyber Monday for e-commerce companies. That's because Dec 25 is the day that people take the wraps off gifts of smartphones and tablets - immediately spurring many to download games, productivity tools and other apps from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.\n\nThis Christmas is projected to set another record for app downloads, following 328 million downloads last Dec 25 - the busiest day ever - and 36 per cent above 2011, according to analytics firm Flurry. According to a Harris survey commissioned by mobile-app and website-testing company Soasta, 30 per cent of Americans plan to download an app on Dec 25.\n\n\"One of the first things you do when you get a shiny new present is you want to take it for a test run,\" said Marcos Sanchez, vice-president at App Annie, a company that measures app downloads. \"It's the magical trifecta of something new, time to waste and wanting to fill your time with fun stuff.\"\n\nWhile many developers like Disney plan all year for a Christmas rush, a final blitz comes in the last few weeks. Apple's offices close between Dec 21 and Dec 27, leading app makers to rush to get their updates submitted and approved before the deadline. A plug from Apple on the front page of the App Store guarantees a flood of downloads.\n\nApple said earlier this year that two billion apps were downloaded last December, a monthly record. Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for the Cupertino, California-based company, declined to comment further. Christopher Katsaros, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-based Google, didn't return requests for comment.\n\nThe holiday surge has created a dogfight among developers to get noticed in an increasingly crowded market. Apple's App Store and Google Play each have more than a million apps available.\n\nSome developers use straightforward tactics to grab attention, such as introducing new titles, cutting prices and hunting for press. Others use digital-advertising campaigns to manipulate Apple's rankings by guaranteeing a certain number of downloads and better visibility in the App Store. While Apple has attempted to clamp down on that strategy, the practice persists.\n\n\"There's competition to make sure your app is ranked and app developers go to every distribution platform they can get their hands on,\" said Siqi Chen, co-founder of Heyday, which released its journal-taking app this month to capitalise on the Christmas spike. He said his company doesn't pay for downloads.\n\nMaking it harder for smaller outfits to stand out is the fact that deep-pocketed bigger companies like Disney and video-game publisher Electronic Arts are prioritising mobile entertainment as an important revenue source, said Fernando Pizarro, general manager for PapayaMobile, an advertising platform.\n\nSteve Stamstad, vice-president of marketing for EA Mobile, said the game publisher made changes to all its phone and tablet titles ahead of Christmas. The publisher of \"FIFA Soccer\" will get five billion different \"marketing impressions\" in front of consumers for the Christmas rush, be it ads on Facebook and phones, or promotions done by partners like Twenty-First Century Fox for its app themed after The Simpsons.\n\nSpending heavily on advertising creates financial risks. The cost of acquiring an iPhone user through an ad network is about US$2.30 in December, more than double the cost in June, according to a report by SuperData, an analysis firm for mobile-game publishers. For that spending to be worthwhile, a game publisher needs to keep a new user playing for at least two months before a profit can be made, a period that's an \"eon in mobile game time\", the report said.\n\nSome app makers give away their apps to lure consumers. Tomek Sarnowski, co-founder of Byss Mobile, said his company is offering its InstaWeather app - which usually costs 99 cents - for free around Christmas so that the company can use it to cross-promote other paid apps it publishes.\n\nMike Maser, the co-founder of fitness application FitStar, isn't using advertising or free downloads. Instead, he is counting on appealing to people anxious to exercise after a calorie-rich holiday. His San Francisco-based company recently released an iPhone app in time for Christmas that features Atlanta Falcons football star Tony Gonzalez walking users through different workouts tailored to their fitness level. The company also cut prices by 40 per cent to US$29.99 through January for a year of access to its workouts.\n\n\"It's not unlike a gym membership,\" he said. \"We marked this time of year to be ready for the Christmas rush and the New Year's resolution time frame.\"\n\nSome companies go to great lengths to ensure their app is prepared for a flood of users. Mikael Berner, creator of the personal assistant app EasilyDo, last year paid to have his servers experience a burst of 10,000 downloads in an hour to be sure it could withstand the rush of consumers. The test went through without a hitch, and the company celebrated with Mr Berner donning a Christmas vest and serving homemade eggnog.\n\nThis Christmas, Mr Berner said he will have people in the office to monitor downloads, especially at around 9am in each time zone when gift unwrapping is in full swing. \"If you disappoint somebody during that euphoric moment when they are downloading the app on Christmas, they are going to remember,\" he said.

Not only has MND chopped supply on both the confirmed and reserve lists but it will be pushing out mostly not-so-hot sites on the confirmed list to prevent benchmark bids from being set and hence pushing up prices of other sites.\n\nThe industry is bracing itself for record numbers of private housing completions. And with the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework in late June, developers' private housing sales have, on the whole, slowed. CBRE estimates that 2013 will end with around 15,000 units (excluding executive condominiums) sold - down from last year's record of 22,197. Next year, the figure is likely to shrink further to 10,000-12,000.\n\nWith sales down, some developers have started trimming prices. The goal is to launch projects as soon as possible - on fears of worsening sentiment as a housing glut builds up. In the public housing market too, prices of HDB resale flats have begun to soften. If the trend continues, that will clip HDB flat owners' capacity to upgrade to a mass-market private condo.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

That volatility, and doubts about the US Federal Reserve's US$85 billion a month bond-buying programme, prolonged the deal execution cycle as windows of opportunity opened and shut rapidly.\n\nThe volatility, however, did not prevent issuance hitting a new high with issuers determined to take advantage of rock bottom interest rates and investors hungry for rising yields on investments.\n\nDeal volumes rose to a peak of US$143.8 billion this year, eclipsing the previous high of US$133.8 billion last year, with HSBC and Deutsche Bank leading the league tables. Asia's debt demand is expected to moderate, with the US central bank's plan to trim its monthly purchases among the key factors behind the likely pullback.\n\n\"It will be difficult for 2014 to register another record year for new issuance,\" said Thomas Kwan, Hong Kong-based head of fixed income at Harvest Global Investments, who expects outflows in retail funds to continue next year, reversing a trend from early last year.\n\nIn the debt capital markets league table standings, HSBC retained the top spot this year. Among the key deals was helping the Asian Development Bank raise US$2.5 billion through a three-year bond. Deutsche Bank jumped from fourth to second place, helped by deals such as Indonesia's US$1.5 billion sukuk. Coming in third was Citigroup.\n\nOne factor that Asia's debt bankers hope will override the US taper is the need for Asian corporates to repay bonds issued five years ago when bumper volumes of debt were raised. The five-year tenor is the most-preferred debt maturity among Asian issuers.\n\nAccording to Societe Generale, Asian issuers are faced with a record US$43 billion in redemptions next year, compared with less than US$25 billion this year. The sustained yield gap between dollar and domestic currency assets would also provide the impetus to new borrowers.\n\nBut waning volumes of liquidity and the availability of other funding options lead most in the Asian debt markets to predict a slowdown. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

Through this, China Mobile has been a notable hold-out. In a market where Apple is only ranked fifth with a 6 per cent share, the world' largest wireless player could afford to continue the stand-off.\n\nNow, though, the balance of power has shifted. In October, China Mobile's nine-month net profit slipped 1.9 per cent as its market share shrank, which some have blamed on the absence of an iPhone offering. In the tug-of-war between margin protection and market share retention, the latter finally won out.\n\nChina Mobile, it turns out, needs Apple after all. Very little has been said about China Mobile's iPhone pricing, but a few days before the Apple announcement, the telco said it was bracing itself for a greater subsidy expenditure next year, as it tries to get subscribers on its new 4G network.\n\nThis reversion to the subsidy mean is an interesting development, because for the past year, subsidy cutbacks and eliminations have caught on elsewhere. Spain's Telefonica cut subsidies last year, as did Vodafone Spain.\n\nThe results have been mixed - Telefonica had to slash prices on its smartphone in March, which it insists does not herald a return to handset subsidies. Vodafone, however, had to re-introduce handset subsidies on a promotional basis over the summer last year.\n\nAt the same time, Apple is not the company it once was. It faces stiff competition from cheaper handsets in a world where the poor greatly outnumber the rich and relies on subsidies to stay popular. In the ebb and flow of the subsidy wars, the victor will be determined by whether Apple needs the carriers more than the other way around.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The US gold jewellery industry is on track for its highest sales for the fourth quarter since 2010 and its first annual increase in gold sales in more than a decade, precious metal consultant Thomson Reuters GFMS estimates.\n\n\"I always look for the price of gold in the news and pay attention to discounts and deals,\" John Mora Gonzalez, a 31-year-old mechanic in New York, said after purchasing a necklace for his wife for Christmas. He had spotted J C Penney Co's 20 per cent discount on fine jewellery, and paid US$40 for a 10-carat gold necklace.\n\nGold prices have plunged almost a third this year, halting a 12-year run of gains. Bullion lost favour with institutional and retail investors as they braced for the US Federal Reserve to reduce its monthly US$85 billion bond buying programme, moving funds to equities and other riskier assets.\n\nRenewed consumer appetite for gold is unlikely to counteract the lack of investment dollars and reverse the downward trend for prices. But US demand is a bright spot in a global gold market where import restrictions in India have slowed buying in that country, one of the world's biggest consumers.\n\nWith the US economy growing at its fastest pace in nearly two years and the unemployment rate hitting a five-year low in November, shoppers are more willing to fork out for \"bigger-ticket items\" during this year's critical holiday season, Dennis Marlow, who owns Solitaire Creations, told Reuters last week. \"People are saying 'Wow, gold is down. I can finally get the ring or piece of jewellery I want',\" he said.\n\nHe estimated sales in his store in Manhattan's Diamond District will rise by 15 to 20 per cent this holiday from 2012.\n\nLow prices have given big retailers more wiggle room to offer discounts to attract customers this year, jewellers said.\n\nJewellery sales from Thanksgiving until the new year account for as much as half of the annual total, according to estimates.\n\nUS gold jewellery demand in the final three months of the year will increase 15 to 20 per cent to between 44 and 48 tonnes, Thomson Reuters GFMS expects. The country's consumption is only one-tenth the size of China and India combined, but analysts expect US demand will outpace other Western developed markets in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis year's buying spree will likely help gold jewellery win back some market share lost after Americans shunned gold as prices soared over the past 10 years. Jewellery accounts for about half of total gold demand.\n\nEven so, fourth-quarter sales this year will be a fraction of the more than 150 tonnes seen in the same period of 2004.\n\nInvestors have pulled over US$36 billion from gold exchange-traded funds, sending holdings to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis. Institutional selling accelerated after the Fed outlined last week the first concrete details of its plans to reduce the bond buying, or quantitative easing, programme, that has bolstered prices.\n\nOn Friday, spot gold sank as low as US$1,185 per ounce, close to a 31/2-year lows and down 40 per cent from all-time highs of US$1,920 in September 2011. On Monday, prices had recovered some, but remained below US$1,200 per ounce, and the market is expected to remain under pressure into the new year.\n\nProspects for jewellery demand appear more promising if prices remain weak and jewellers continue to slash prices. \"If that's the case, I'm more likely to buy more gold jewellery,\" said Tara Higgins, 48, a lawyer from New Jersey who bought a US$5,000 gold bracelet with diamonds on Thursday.

Electronics - that's a bit of a challenge.\"\n\nSure, children still want and receive trains and dolls and Legos and other playthings of the type that Santa might make in his North Pole workshop.\n\nBut their passion for playing with toys seems to be diminishing at earlier and earlier ages; after all, this is a generation that has learned to amuse itself practically from babyhood with the smartphone and tablet swiped from their parents' hands.\n\nFor Hanukkah this year, Maddon Segall asked for iTunes gift cards and the new iPad Mini. He is three years old.\n\n\"I hate to tell you, but we got it for him,\" said his mother, Elyse Bender-Segall, of Livingston, New Jersey.\n\nShe added: \"He doesn't like the toys. I buy him every toy. He's just not interested in them the way he is with the tech.\"\n\nA recent survey of 1,000 parents in the US with children between the ages of two and 10 found that more than half planned to buy a tech item for their children this holiday season. About two-thirds of those planned to give a tablet or smartphone, according to the survey, which was taken for PBS Kids, the brand of the public broadcasting network aimed at young children.\n\n\"Smarter Giving With Apps!\" shouted the December cover of Manhattan Family, a monthly publication geared to families with young children. The article, written by a kindergarten teacher, noted that \"traditional gifts, like clothes and toys\" can be costly \"and not always what children are wishing for\".\n\nApps, on the other hand, she wrote, are cost-effective, educational and fun: the perfect gift.\n\nIt is a confounding situation for toymakers, which - according to the Toy Industry Association and statistics compiled by NPD Group - have barely managed to eke out any gains in the past few years. Contributing to the doldrums is the fact that there is no super-hot, must-have toy this holiday season - no 2013 equivalent of the Cabbage Patch doll or the Tickle Me Elmo or even the Zhu Zhu Pet.\n\nInstead, some in the industry are trying to get a piece of the tech action. While electronic games have long been a staple of toy stores, this year, for the first time, Toys 'R' Us introduced hands-on tablet displays in many of its stores, including iPads and Samsung tablets.\n\nThe company has also designed and developed its own tablet for young children, the Tabeo e2, which, a spokeswoman said, \"comes right out the box with 30 premium apps\".\n\nOn a recent snowy morning, the first thing holiday shoppers saw after entering the Toys 'R' Us flagship store in Times Square (after being welcomed by a man in a giraffe costume) was a sign advertising the iPad.\n\n\"Increasingly, tablets are a key growth category for the company,\" said Adrienne O'Hara, the company's director of consumer public relations.\n\nBut as the holiday shopping season is wrapping up, some parents have resisted.\n\nThe Easy Bake Oven, which celebrated its 50th birthday this year, has been a strong seller at Wal-Mart in recent weeks. Hot Wheels are having a good season, industry experts say, as are the Barbie Dream House and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Even Mr Potato Head is still around.\n\n\"In many ways, retro is being fuelled by the virtualization of toys,\" said M Eric Johnson, dean of the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University, who has studied the toy industry.\n\n\"I think there's a mindset in a lot of young moms that a physical toy is a good thing. It's almost a backlash to the popularity of the app,\" he said. \"So they head down the toy aisle, and they find something they remember.\"\n\nIndeed, nostalgia can be a powerful tool for retailers. Part of that is brand recognition, because just like finding a familiar box of Cheerios in the grocery store, Barbie and GI Joe need no introduction. But there is also something more emotional at play.\n\n\"When you look at things like Cabbage Patch, to Hot Wheels, to Elmo, parents see these things they had and they loved,\" said Jim Silver, editor in chief of TimetoPlayMag.com. \"If it was one of their favourites, they want to share that experience with their child.\"\n\nA parent's experience as an adult is also relevant. Plenty of people love a good game of Angry Birds, but less pleasant associations also attach to tablets and phones, like late-night emails from the boss.\n\n\"I think for parents, these kind of adult toys symbolise work and other things that don't necessarily symbolise childhood,\" Owen's Mr Johnson said of apps and tablets. \"But Mr. Potato Head is childhood and carefree.\"\n\nSome newer toys popular this year are decidedly low-tech, like Rainbow Looms. \"You use looming sticks to create bracelets,\" said Gerrick Johnson, a toy industry analyst at BMO Capital Markets. \"It is the most basic, the most low-tech item in the world, and it's the hottest toy out there.\"\n\nBut even retro toys must be constantly updated.\n\nThere have been 12 Easy Bake Oven models, according to Hasbro, available in colours including silver, yellow, purple and teal. Baby Alive has new features every year - in the spring, a version was introduced that cuddles, and also kicks. And this year's Elmo, Big Hugs Elmo, will hug, dance and offer game suggestions by saying things like, \"Let's pretend we are horses!\" In many ways, he is a very different toy from the Tickle Me Elmo who set off a craze in the mid-1990s, but he is still Elmo.\n\n\"Elmo is all about his personality,\" Mr Silver of TimetoPlayMag.com said. \"You don't want to lose that. You can't lose the brand's core.\"\n\nWhile such evergreen toys generally do better in a season that does not have a new blockbuster, their popularity this year may also be related to economics. BMO's Mr Johnson said more classic toys appealed to parents during tough economic times.\n\nThe downside is that so much of what is available is already familiar.\n\n\"There's not a lot of innovation out there, not a lot of newness,\" he said. \"Not a lot to pull kids away from digital entertainment.\"\n\nBut even the nostalgic toy is going digital: the Easy Bake Oven has an app. NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

It will have the capacity to produce up to 49 megawatts of gross power or 190 tonnes per hour of steam using municipal and commercial waste.\n\nThe Singapore-listed conglomerate will hold a 40 per cent stake in the project while joint venture partners SITA UK (a unit of Suez Environment) and I-Environment Investments Ltd (a unit of Itochu Corporation) will hold 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.\n\nThe joint venture will also develop a separate waste transfer station in Knowsley, Merseyside, to transport waste by rail from Merseyside to the energy-from-waste plant in Teesside. Both facilities are expected to begin operations in 2016.\n\nThe facility will use up to 430,000 tonnes per year of municipal waste, which would otherwise have gone to landfill, to produce sustainable power and steam. It will reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 130,000 tonnes per year.\n\n\"This energy-from-waste pro-ject is in line with Sembcorp's strategy to focus on green businesses and transform the Wilton International site into a green hub,\" the group stated. Its first project, the Sembcorp Biomass Power Station, completed its first full year of operations in 2012, and is the UK's largest biomass renewable energy project.\n\nWhile SCI's UK utilities operations posted a 55 per cent increase in net profit to $18.6 million for the 9M FY13 period, it also suffered a hefty $48.5 million impairment loss.

Short holdings climbed 1.2 per cent to 75,199, within 6 per cent of the record reached in July. Net-bullish holdings across 18 US-traded commodities rose 8.5 per cent to a seven-week high, led by soybeans, natural gas and cotton.\n\nInvestors pulled US$38.8 billion from gold funds this year, the most in data going back through 2000, according to EPFR Global, a research company. Futures settled at a three-year low last Thursday in New York, a day after the Federal Reserve cut the pace of its monthly bond purchases. Prices plunged 37 per cent since reaching a record in September 2011, US equities climbed to an all-time high and the dollar is poised for its strongest annual performance since 2008.\n\n\"Gold was probably one of the easiest shorts of all time,\" said Uri Landesman, the president of New York-based hedge fund Platinum Partners who helps manage about US$1.3 billion of assets. \"It has fallen out of favour because people felt its general security wasn't needed in this market. People wanted to take on risk this year.\"\n\nBullion reached US$1,186 an ounce on Thursday, within US$6.60 of this year's low reached in June. Thirteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect gold to fall this week, 10 are bullish and four neutral. That's the fourth bearish outlook in five weeks.\n\nFutures for February delivery slumped 28 per cent this year, poised for the first loss since 2000. The Standard & Poor's GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities slid 1.5 per cent, while the MSCI All-Country World index of equities jumped 18 per cent. The Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, rose 3.5 per cent. The Bloomberg Treasury Bond Index fell 2.9 per cent.\n\nGold \"is now likely to grind lower throughout 2014\", Jeffrey Currie, the head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc in New York, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. Prices will reach US$1,050 by the end of 2014, the bank said in a Nov 20 report. Societe Generale SA and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are also forecasting more declines.\n\nThe Fed said last Wednesday that it will cut monthly asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, to US$75 billion from US$85 billion. Policymakers raised their assessment of the employment outlook, predicting the jobless rate will fall as low as 6.3 per cent by the end of next year, compared with a September forecast of 6.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent.\n\nGold rose 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the US central bank pumped more than US$2 trillion into the financial system by purchasing debt, increasing concern that inflation would accelerate.\n\nAccelerating economic growth may eventually bring higher consumer prices and revive demand for gold as a hedge against inflation, said Tom Winmill, who helps manage about US$250 million of assets in Walpole, New Hampshire, for Midas Funds.\n\nPolicymakers may hold interest rates near zero per cent even if unemployment falls below the 6.5 per cent rate the central bank previously cited as a likely catalyst for an increase, \"especially if projected inflation continues to run below\" the 2 per cent goal, the Fed said in its statement.\n\n\"We expect that as the economy recovers, which is the reason they're tapering, inflation will come back,\" Mr Winmill said. \"The long-term outlook is exceedingly bullish for gold.\"\n\nPrices fell after some investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value. Bullion held in exchange-traded products plunged 32 percent in 2013, heading for the first decrease since the funds started trading in 2003. The slump wiped US$72.7 billion from the value of the assets.\n\nGlobal equities have advanced to the highest in almost six years, and US inflation is running at 1.2 per cent, almost half the rate of the past decade. US gross domestic product climbed at a 4.1 per cent annualised rate in the third quarter, the strongest since the final three months of 2011, Commerce Department data showed last Friday.\n\nWithdrawals from gold ETPs are driving record outflows of US$36.3 billion from commodity investments, according to Barclays plc. Assets under management declined US$88 billion since the start of the year through last month, the bank said in a report last Tuesday. Excluding withdrawals from precious-metal ETPs, commodities had an inflow of US$4 billion.\n\nBullish bets on crude oil climbed 0.3 per cent to 252,910 contracts, the highest since mid-October, the CFTC data shows. US fuel consumption surged 13 per cent to 21 million barrels a day as of Dec 13, the highest since April 2008, an Energy Information Administration report on Thursday showed.\n\nSpeculators are holding a net-long position in copper of 20,688 contracts. That compares with a net- short holding of 1,223 a week earlier. Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange have fallen to the lowest since February. US housing starts jumped in November to the highest since February 2008, data from the Commerce Department showed last Wednesday. Builders put about 181 kilograms of copper into the average home.\n\nA measure of speculative positions across 11 agricultural products slid 8.4 per cent to 245,071 contracts, the CFTC data shows. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

If you hold GLL shares on the New Zealand branch register on the delisting date, your shares will be transferred to the Singapore branch register,\" said GLL. \"Following the delisting date, GLL shares may be traded on only the SGX (Singapore Exchange), where GLL maintains its primary listing.\"\n\nGLL is an investment holding company with principal investments in hotel management & operations, gaming, oil & gas, property development and other areas in the leisure industry. It is majority owned by Guoco Group, which is controlled by billionaire Malaysian businessman Quek Leng Chan of the Hong Leong Group.\n\nFormerly BIL International Ltd, GuocoLeisure was established in New Zealand in 1961 by Ronald Brierley. Its initial focus was to acquire substantial shareholdings in public companies in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBy the 1980s, the company acquired numerous global investments with shareholdings in more than 300 companies.\n\nBIL hit problems in the late 1990s when firms it had invested in, such as Air New Zealand, got into trouble. There were extensive management changes and BIL moved its headquarters to Singapore, though it retained a New Zealand market listing.\n\nGuocoLeisure shares closed 1.5 cents lower at 86.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Hyundai Merchant plans to raise about 1.5 trillion won selling stakes in container terminals and restructuring its bulk-cargo operations, the group said.\n\nShares of Hyundai Merchant jumped the most in more than six months in Seoul trading as Hyundai Group followed Hanjin Group, which owns Korean Air Lines Co, in announcing plans to sell assets to boost cash. South Korea's three biggest shipping companies face a cash crunch as three trillion won of bonds are due for repayment in the next two years amid mounting losses from a global slump in rates to carry sea cargo.\n\n\"The announcement has helped ease shareholders' concerns,\" Kim Min Ji, an analyst at E*Trade Securities Co, said from Seoul. \"The sale of financial units seems realistic and will help Hyundai Group raise cash it needs.\"\n\nHyundai Merchant advanced by the daily 15 per cent limit, the most since June 10, to close at 11,600 won. That helped trim the declines this year to 50 per cent. Hyundai Elevator Co, the biggest shareholder of the shipping company, rose 15 per cent, and Hyundai Securities climbed 3.1 per cent. The Kospi index gained 0.7 per cent.\n\nThe group plans to seek foreign investment for Hyundai Merchant, and sell additional Hyundai Elevator shares and carry out an initial public offering of Hyundai Logistics Co.\n\n\"While the company has sufficient funds to last until the first half of next year, we've decided to come up with a restructuring plan to calm investors' concerns,\" Hyundai Group said in the statement. \"We plan to continue restructuring the group next year.\"\n\nHyundai Merchant has one trillion won of bonds to pay in the next two years, compared with 678 billion won in cash at the end of September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHyundai Group's plan comes after Korean Air said last week that it aims to raise 3.5 trillion won by selling assets, including shares in refiner S-Oil Corp and airplanes. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

A plan to tax overseas buyers' capital gains may also crimp demand.\n\nPrices of houses and apartments in the UK capital's most expensive neighbourhoods will climb 4 per cent next year after a 7.5 per cent jump this year, the London-based broker said in a Dec 21 report. Prices in Chelsea, Mayfair and Knightsbridge in 2013 underperformed the rest of London's best areas for the first time in a decade.\n\n\"There are limits to pricing growth in London,\" Liam Bailey, Knight Frank's global head of research, said by phone.\n\n\"Central London prices have recovered from the crash and there is resistance from buyers.\"\n\nOverseas buyers helped London's luxury homes outperform other UK real estate for the last four years as investors sought safe assets. An investor-friendly tax system and the pound's depreciation after the financial crisis sparked a 62 per cent surge in prime London prices since a low point in March 2009.\n\nPrices have exceeded the previous peak in 2008 by 26 per cent, according to Knight Frank.\n\nA capital-gains tax on home sales by people living abroad may dim London's allure to property buyers from abroad, Bailey said.\n\n\"A few buyers have had second thoughts about London, particularly if they were thinking of being based outside the UK,\" he said. New Tax Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced the tax on Dec 5.\n\nIt will apply to \"future gains\" after the tax takes effect in April 2015, he said, without specifying the levy's size. Capital-gains tax rates for second homes of UK residents currently range from 18 per cent to 28 per cent.\n\nLondon luxury-home prices climbed 0.8 per cent in December from the previous month, the most since March, according to the report. Prices in the City of London financial district and its fringes rose the most this year, gaining 16 per cent.

The emergence of \"Abenomics\" has attracted far more attention internationally than has Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's rather reactionary and nationalistic brand of politics.\n\nAbenomics, a set of policy prescriptions involving huge fiscal and monetary stimulus to the Japanese economy followed (in theory at least) by fundamental structural reforms, are not the invention of Mr Abe himself. He is first and last a politician and idealogue, not an economist.\n\nA team of academic and other advisers are the true architects of Abenomics. But in this as in other areas, the prime minister has encouraged a kind of personality cult that makes him appear as a strong leader able to give direction to a nation in need of salvation.\n\nSome see Abenomics as a means to an end - a means to gain and retain political popularity while Mr Abe begins to implement a far more radical agenda. But the notion of a Japan that regains its erstwhile economic vigour and vitality is also very appealing for Mr Abe.\n\nTo understand the reactionary mood that has swept through Japan this year, it is necessary to see things in the context of the loss of economic and political confidence that has overtaken the country in the past 20 or so years.\n\nThe trauma of the bubble economy's collapse two decades ago lingered long and even though the bad debt mountain it left behind has long been cleared, an overly tight monetary policy by a once timid central bank choked off any sign of recovery and plunged the economy into deflation.\n\nA rising China pushed Japan into third place behind the US (and China) in world economic league tables, and then came the triple disaster of a mega earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in March 2011 - all capped by a stream of ineffective \"revolving door\" prime ministers.\n\nDespite his own short-lived and rather ineffective tenure as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and prime minister in 2006, Mr Abe somehow managed to become a lightning rod for conducting energy and anger (especially from the right wing of the LDP) into political action.\n\nThe LDP did not so much \"sweep to power\" in Lower House election late last year as ride upon the failure of voters to turn out for what they saw as ineffective and short-term Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)-led administrations. Apathy was rife among voters at large.\n\nFormer DPJ voters again stayed away in droves from the Upper House election in mid-year 2013 and the LDP was able to consolidate its hold on power to what political commentators saw as an alarming extent. History may show that such alarm was well founded, judging from recent developments.\n\nOn the Abenomics front, things have gone quite well since the appointment of former Asian Development Bank president Haruhiko Kuroda as governor of the Bank of Japan. He has pledged to turn deflation into 2 per cent annual inflation within two years and is making progress towards that goal.\n\nThe yen has plunged with Mr Kuroda's willingness to throw money at the deflation problem while corporate profits - in the export sector at least - have soared and Tokyo stocks along with them. Property prices are rising and there are signs of returning business confidence.\n\nEconomic growth, meanwhile, has improved to the point where the Asian Development Bank is predicting 1.7 per cent real GDP growth for this year, slowing to around one per cent in 2014 in the light of a proposed hike in the national consumption tax.\n\nGrowth is being boosted by not only monetary but also fiscal stimulus, a risky strategy for Japan where government debt is already double the size of the nation's economy and where Tokyo is under strong external pressure to put its fiscal house in order to avoid a possible fiscal crisis.\n\nBut the big question mark hanging over Abenomics is whether Mr Abe can deliver on his pledge to implement sweeping structural reforms that would change employment practices, de-regulate the economy and open up its more protected sectors.\n\nSo far, there is little apparent progress on this front and Mr Abe seems to be relying on experimenting with reforms within the narrow and politically safe confines of special deregulation zones, while also exposing Japan to competition via Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) membership.\n\nWhile economists may differ over the merits or demerits of Abenomics, the subject is relatively uncontroversial compared with the considerable ruckus that Mr Abe has created by his decisions to take Japan down new paths in terms of its security and diplomatic policies.\n\nIn pursuit of what he claims is a process of turning Japan into a \"normal\" nation, he has created a new National Security Council, ordered a beefing up of military spending and rammed through a new State Secrets Act which is seen as a threat to democratic freedom in Japan.\n\nAll this is taking place against the background of a proposed revision in the country's \"pacifist\" postwar constitution which could see the nation abandon its self-imposed ban on collective self-defence and also see Japan projecting military power well beyond its own shores in time.\n\nMeanwhile, territorial disputes have flared with China and South Korea to the point where observers fear a possible confrontation between Japanese and Chinese maritime vessels or aircraft engaged in a dangerous daily cat-and-mouse game of shadowing each other's movements.\n\nMr Abe's high popularity with voters during most of this year has taken a knock with the controversy that has erupted over the Secrets Act and and some voters have begun to question their own wisdom in awarding the LDP an almost absolute hold on power for the next few years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such reports were being distributed by courier to the doctors who were not stationed in the facility, and some got lost on the way.\n\nFinding point-to-point encryption solutions too expensive then, he turned to his Singaporean friend Kwok-Yan Lam, who has been teaching security in universities since 1990, for help. His request was that the solution had to be robust for the enterprise, yet simple enough for the consumer to use.\n\nThe result was a Singapore-developed application that allows users to encrypt information easily on the fly by saving it in a password-protected folder.\n\nCalled Soda, which stands for Safe of Data App, it acts as a \"digital safe\" in which encrypted files are organised into folders that can only be read by their intended users.\n\nSoda comes with a cross-platform capability, which means that data such as photos, videos and documents can be encrypted using an Android phone, saved to the cloud, then downloaded and decrypted even in an iPhone, iPad or PC. The file is automatically decrypted when opened in the Soda folder.\n\n\"Encryption is quite easy to do nowadays - there is a lot of freeware. The difficult part is how to do it in such a way that people use it easily without having to deal with technical interfaces,\" said Professor Lam, who is an exco member of the Singapore Association of Information Security Professionals and an Adjunct Professor at the National University of Singapore. He has served as chief security consultant and architect for many local and regional projects on e-commerce and border control systems.\n\nProf Lam noted that most users try to avoid encryption as it is too difficult to use. Yet mobile devices, which are goldmines of information due to the myriad personal and work-related activities that they are used for, can be easy targets for cyber criminals.\n\nTo ensure a high level of security even for enterprise users, Soda was built on the same proven cryptography platform (certified to The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Federal Information Processing Standards) used by banks and governments.\n\nThe application is free for download in the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store.\n\n\"People are not aware, or even if they are aware, they have no easy tool to protect their data. That is why the basic version is free of charge - we wanted to start something to educate people about personal privacy protection,\" said Prof Lam.\n\nA premium version, which allows individual users or small-sized businesses to enjoy unlimited sending of encrypted data, costs just US$4.99 per user a year.\n\nThere is also a corporate version - Soda Enterprise - that is designed to work seamlessly with existing corporate IT infrastructure and offers more advanced features such as secure P2P sharing of confidential files, as well as secure file exchange and group messaging.\n\n\"To enterprises, Soda is not only an app but a software platform that supports mobile and cloud applications requiring strong privacy and confidentiality protection,\" said Mr Tse.\n\nPiloted among 300 users in Asia a year ago, the security application has been downloaded almost 1,000 times by users not just in Asia but also in the US and Europe. Mr Tse expects 500,000 downloads by the end of 2014.\n\nSoda has been used by the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Centre to encrypt and send screening results to doctors since January.\n\nTo promote the software, the duo set up Soda Pte Ltd in Singapore in January 2012.\n\nThe start-up, which employs 12 people, also has sales and marketing offices in Hong Kong and Malaysia, and plans to expand its presence in South-east Asia in the near term.\n\nIt is targeting telecommunications service providers offering cloud storage, banks that need to issue electronic statements and government agencies, among others.\n\nIn all, over $1 million have been injected into the company, and Mr Tse, who serves as its chairman, hopes to achieve 50-100 corporate sign-ups and break even by the end of 2014. Customers currently include organisations in the telecommunications and public sectors.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The concept was coined more than a decade ago, but is now starting to gather momentum because of the wireless connectivity built into more and more devices today.\n\nSpeaking at an event hosted by the Singapore Chapter of the Internet Society, CK Lim, CEO of Ascent Solutions, said that the local electronics manufacturer is currently researching a self-tuning, self-sensing RFID (radio frequency identification) chip.\n\nThe project is underway in a collaboration with US RFID sensor maker RF Micron with the objective of developing a chip that can sense properties in its surroundings, and deliver data to connected devices.\n\nThe chip can be embedded in everyday devices. Mr Lim said that, for example, the chip can be placed in adult diapers, to alert caretakers if it is soiled, without the need and hassle of manually checking.\n\nThis is possible today, because RFID prices have come down so dramatically in the past decade, he said. \"We're getting accurate devices in the couple-of-hundred- dollars range today, where it would have cost thousands before,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nNCS strategic business development director Ching Yin Sing said that the SingTel-owned IT firm has begun work with an international retailer to implement smart video sensors in its stores in four Asian cities: Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Shanghai.\n\nThe client carries garments, and NCS has placed video cameras on its clothes racks. The cameras feed the image information to a central server which crunches that data, and is able to reach 96 per cent accuracy in counting the number of people moving to the rack, said Mr Ching. The camera data will also be able to tell the store which racks are popular, based on how long people hover in that area.\n\nHe also cited the example of Tesco in the UK, where the company has placed video cameras behind its point-of-sale counters at petrol stations. The cameras are able to detect the gender and approximate age of the patron, and that influences the ads shown to the customer behind the cashier based on their demographic slice.\n\n\"Cameras can do intrusion detection by detecting motion, and make up crowd-density heat maps, profile audiences and chart human traffic footfall patterns, to name some uses,\" Mr Ching said.\n\nAccording to ABI Research, more than 30 billion devices will be wirelessly connected to the Internet of Things patchwork by 2020.\n\nFellow research agency Gartner has a similar estimate - 26 billion connected devices in that year, representing an almost 30-fold increase from 2009's 900 million devices.\n\nLack of standardisation\n\nGartner also estimates that product and service suppliers to this network will make up a US$300 billion market in 2020. It expects that the leading verticals pushing the development of the Internet of Things will be manufacturing, healthcare and insurance.\n\nBut while the applications continue to grow as companies discover new uses for sensors, the industry suffers from a lack of standardisation, said Mr Ching.\n\n\"There's very little work being done to get sensors connected easily,\" he said.\n\nTan Geok Leng, executive director of the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) at A*Star (the Agency for Science, Technology and Research), echoed this point. He said that the research institution is currently focused on helping to establish a standard communication platform between different sensors.\n\n\"Imagine if you could get traffic readings from the ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) gantries, and feed that to traffic reports. That would be a valuable source of data, but that information isn't easily obtainable right now,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that most applications are written and deployed in silos, in part because that allows them to deliver business objectives more quickly, since they don't need to work well with other applications.\n\n\"But in the long run, that's not efficient,\" he said. Data sharing could lead to powerful analytics being done across siloed applications, greatly lifting the IT industry's contribution as a whole.\n\n\"Still, it will take time to work well with others. Nobody wants to be the first,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even so, this gain comes after previous writedowns on the asset's book value as CSL battled a brutal and competitive market over the last decade.\n\n\"Telstra invested in this business in early-2000s for gross investment of around A$4 billion and then gradually wrote it down,\" a Nomura Equity Research report noted yesterday.\n\nHKT, which will buy all of CSL for a total of US$2.425 billion - 76.4 per cent from Telstra and the remaining 23.6 per cent from New World Development - is a part of the PCCW group, which is chaired by Richard Li, the son of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.\n\nWhen the deal is completed, CSL will have come full circle. Before the turn of the millennium, PCCW had owned CSL. Over 2001 and 2002, Telstra progressively bought stakes in CSL from PCCW, eventually owning all of the former. In 2006, however, CSL and New World PCS Limited were merged in a deal that reduced Telstra's stake in CSL to 76.4 per cent.\n\nExplaining the decision to exit the business yesterday, Telstra chief executive David Thodey said that \"there are a number of dynamics in the Hong Kong mobiles market that means this is the right opportunity for Telstra to maximise our return on this successful asset\".\n\nHe noted that CSL's compounded annual growth rate over the last three years stood at 9.4 per cent, calling it a \"strongly performing business\".\n\nIn its last financial year ended June 30, 2013, CSL took in A$1.01 billion in revenue - 17.6 per cent more than in the previous year - which accounted for about 4 per cent of total revenue. In Hong Kong dollar terms, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 14.9 per cent to HK$2.06 billion (S$336.6 million).\n\nAccording to the Nomura report, the sale might be for the best as \"the market is competitive (five players) and becoming saturated, too, so this is a good outcome, we think\".\n\nThe market also welcomed the move yesterday, with Telstra's counter gaining nine Australian cents or 1.76 per cent to A$5.20 in trading.\n\nTelstra kept mum on how it would use the proceeds from the sale, saying only: \"Following completion, Telstra will address the net proceeds from the transaction consistent with its capital management framework.\"\n\nThe Nomura report said: \"More dividends is one possibility, but we understand there is no additional tax paid on this sale due to accumulated losses, hence the franking balance may not change. The preference of Telstra management and board is to pay fully franked dividends.\n\n\"Telstra is still open to pursuing other opportunities, too - so the proceeds may be deployed/ preserved for other investments as well.\"\n\nTelstra's involvement elsewhere in the region continues. Recently, it upped its stake in Autohome Inc, an online portal for automobile buyers in China, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. Its investment in Autohome Inc is now valued at US$1.9 billion.\n\nOver the last 18 months, the telco also entered into two new submarine cable investments and opened a new data centre in Singapore, among other things.\n\nYesterday, Telstra's Mr Thodey said that his team will focus on \"refining and enhancing our strategy across Asia\".\n\nRegulatory approval of the sale is expected to take around 90 days and the deal is estimated to be finalised by the first quarter of 2014, according to media reports.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The region's economy, however, has experienced only a gingerly revival so far, with Germany the leader, but France a growing problem.\n\nThe only major scare in 2013 came from events on the small island of Cyprus, but predictions that the crisis would envelop Greece and other weak nations in the eurozone proved to be wrong.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the outlook was dire. Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, reported that the eurozone economy had plunged in the final quarter of 2012. Gross domestic product of the region had fallen 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the third, and it was the fifth quarter in which the currency bloc had failed to expand. For 2012 as a whole, GDP of the eurozone contracted 0.5 per cent.\n\nAs 2013 began, GDP in Germany, Europe's largest economy, was down 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with the previous quarter, and there were worries about declining exports and investment.\n\nFrance contracted 0.3 per cent and other sizeable economies - notably Italy, Spain and the Netherlands - also shrank. Italy's GDP plummeted 0.9 per cent, Spain's downturn also deepened, and Portugal's GDP slid 1.8 per cent.\n\nThe dismal performance - which was accompanied by a further rise in already high unemployment of 10.7 per cent or some 26 million - led to protests and government changes, notably in Italy and Greece. Economists predicted that at best there would be a gingerly revival in 2013.\n\nIn March, a botched Cyprus bailout deal precipitated sharp European and global stockmarket declines as investors feared a run on the island's banks and Greek and other financial institutions that were exposed to a possible default.\n\nIn an adjusted agreement, international lenders were forced to accept the closure of a major Cypriot bank, Laiki, and the seizure of savings from large depositors to recapitalise a second troubled lender, Bank of Cyprus.\n\nBoth banks had suffered huge losses from a write-down in the value of Greek government bonds, an arrangement brokered by EU leaders in late 2011 to make Greece's debts more manageable.\n\nAt the time, Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the world's largest bond investor, commented that the Cyprus bailout could \"well undermine the recent tranquil behaviour of depositors and creditors in other vulnerable European economies - in particular Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain\". Indeed, as markets tumbled, the euro sank to around 1.28 against the US dollar.\n\nThe euro and European stock and bond markets rallied after the last-minute rescue averted a potential Cypriot exit from the eurozone, a financial meltdown, massive devaluation and rampant inflation. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades accepted the new terms from the \"Troika\" comprising the European Union, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) for a loan of 10 billion euros, and that eventually reduced tensions.\n\nCyprus proved to be a hiccup as once again markets took the lead from ECB president Mario Draghi who in the late summer of 2012 had promised to do \"whatever it takes\" within the central bank's mandate to preserve the euro.\n\nThe market assumed the ECB would be buying dud bonds of zombie banks and indebted Southern European nations. Instead, Mr Draghi's \"jawboning\" improved sentiment and the euro recovered, and bond and equity markets began to take off, baffling even the most bullish forecasters.\n\nSince its mid-year low point, the euro has risen by 7 per cent, and sterling - boosted by rising UK property prices and higher consumption and growth - by 10 per cent. Greece and Ireland have been the best performing European stock markets, beating Germany and the UK - both the best performing economies, by a wide margin.\n\nAlso, bond yields of the so-called \"Club Med\" nations have fallen sharply as banks rather than the ECB have purchased the bonds.\n\nThis improvement helped lift growth of the average of the 28 European Union economies to 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, but sadly the eurozone still contracted 0.4 per cent. The UK has been the star economy growing 1.5 per cent in the September quarter compared with the same period in 2012, after a rise of 1.3 per cent in Q2. Germany's growth was 0.6 per cent, but France's was only 0.2 per cent. Italy, Spain and Portugal contracted, and Greece and Cyprus remained in deep recession.\n\nRuth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, contends that the eurozone will \"muddle through for the foreseeable future\" without any cataclysmic policy change.\n\nOn Dec 15, Ireland formally exited its rescue plan, after three years of austerity. Spain has announced that, following Ireland's lead, it intends to exit its bank bailout plan in January without seeking a precautionary credit line.\n\nThe \"Grand Coalition\" government, under Chancellor Angela Merkel, has agreed that Germany should still be \"tough on austerity\". But that is at a severe price. The eurozone's GDP is still 3 per cent below pre-financial crisis 2008 levels, and a recent study of the International Institute for Strategic Studies maintains that it faces a lost decade.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Yingluck, now caretaker premier, is not in Bangkok and has been visiting the north-east, her party's stronghold.\n\nThe protest movement's main leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, a former Democrat heavyweight, wants a suspension of democracy and the installation of an appointed \"people's council\". \"I don't know what Yingluck is thinking. But, what I know for sure now is that all civil servants, the army, the police have realised all Thai people are rising up against the government,\" Mr Suthep told Blue Sky, an anti-government cable television station.\n\nMr Suthep has earned a reputation for overstated rhetoric during fiery nightly speeches, where he has told police and civil servants to report to him, promised to retire to the beach and issued deadlines to army leaders to meet him to discuss ousting Ms Yingluck.\n\nMs Yingluck and Thaksin remain hugely popular in the north and north-east, but Mr Suthep's movement is backed by a powerful minority - Bangkok's middle class, bureaucrats, conservative elites and top army generals.\n\nThaksin's mainly rural-based supporters see him as a benevolent billionaire committed to raising their living standards, but his enemies call him an authoritarian crony capitalist who exploited the poor and abused his power by helping wealthy business friends and family.\n\nThe protests enjoy big support from Bangkok and though the size of the crowd often dwindles, Mr Suthep has managed to mobilise more than 100,000 on some marches.\n\nThe Election Commission on Friday ruled out postponing the vote, having earlier said that it was concerned the polls could be marred by violence.\n\nSeparately, more than 20 people were wounded when a car bomb went off near a hotel in the Sadao district of Songkhla province.\n\nNational Security Council chief Paradorn Pattanatabut told AFP the culprits may have been linked to the Thai rebellion in the south, as peace talks faltered.\n\n\"A second theory is it was related to the domestic political situation - to discredit the government,\" he added. - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/expedia-trims-backend-code-fly-higher", "site_title": "Expedia trims backend code to fly higher", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nExpedia trims backend code to fly higher\n\nIts flight-booking application is much more flexible today than it was 3 years ago\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Dec 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Flight booking giant Expedia is one of the older travel websites, and over the past three years, it has gone through an extensive diet on its backend code so that it can fight with leaner start-ups that have come on the scene.\n\nThe Nasdaq-listed firm brought in revenues of US$4 billion in 2012, and employs over 12,000 globally across its various Web properties like Hotels.com and Hotwire.com.\n\nThe Expedia property itself specialises in providing a meta-search across airline carriers and aggregates flights so that users can easily compare prices.\n\nIn recent years, however, the travel space has seen the entrance of players like Wego, Webjet, Skyscanner and Farecompare, which provide similar meta-search services. Many of these sites make money by charging a referral fee for bookings directed from their sites.\n\nIn an interview with BizIT, Expedia's technical director for Southeast Asia, Lorin Kobashigawa-Bates, said the company's flight- booking application is much more flexible today than it was three years ago.\n\n\"Expedia is a 15-year- old company, and so we have code that is just as old. Back then, the code wasn't designed to be flexible, and a lot of it is written from scratch. So when you hire someone off the street, there is a long learning curve for them,\" he explained.\n\nOver the past three years, Expedia has invested heavily in its tech team and in modernising its Web code. This has helped accelerate the time-to-market for new features and services on the website, in order to stay fresh in light of growing competition.\n\n\"Almost our entire app has been rewritten over the past few years. We emphasised speed-to-market, and now huge chunks of our development process are automated,\" the technical director said. This speed-to-market is important because the company wants to tap customer feedback as soon as possible, so that it can refine its app faster, he added.\n\n\"The process of overhauling was a bit rough at first, and these investments were a huge spend in the IT department,\" he said.\n\nBut crossing that initial hump has paid off, because the Expedia team is able to much more quickly build mobile products and reuse large components of its Web kit for mobile platforms, he said.\n\nThis has been timely, because the mobile space has taken off in a big way in the past few years. \"The mobile space is a whole new market that wasn't there before, such as last-minute hotel bookings which are made on the go,\" he said.\n\nAs a result, the volume of deals targeted at mobile users continues to grow, he said.\n\nAnd in Southeast Asia, where credit card penetration and desktop online penetration remains low, the mobile provides a gateway to a new market of mobile- first users, he noted.\n\nMr Kobashigawa-Bates heads software development for Expedia.com Asia-Pacific, as well as Air- AsiaGo.com. AirAsiaGo is the portal that was formed through a partnership with Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia. The two companies also have an exclusive third-party arrangement to distribute AirAsia's flights only through Expedia.\n\nSuch arrangements are possible because of Expedia's size and clout in the market, which help it stay ahead of the smaller competition, he said.\n\n\"While there has been an explosion in the number of meta-searchers out there, it's harder to re-create an Expedia because we have so many tight supplier relationships,\" he said.\n\nBut one of the challenges facing the tech team in trying to be aggressive in Asia is that all of Expedia's data centres are in the US. The team decided to launch on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has a data centre in Singapore, in order for its site to load faster because it's being served out of a geographically nearer data centre to customers.\n\n\"Speed of loading really matters. We deal with live, on-the-minute price fluctuations,\" and the company relies on regional hosting partners to keep its website performance snappy, Mr Kobashigawa-Bates said.\n\nHis team for Southeast Asia is spread out over the region, with 12 developers in Singapore, eight in Gurgaon, India, and 18 in Shenzhen, China. The team's main function is to customise the company's products for the Asian market.\n\nThe team is now working on bringing the company's Scratchpad product to Asia, scheduled for next year.\n\nScratchpad is a feature on Expedia that it launched just late this year. It allows users to save hotels and flights onto one page, so that they can come back and review their research done on prices.\n\n\"It sounds simple, but a lot of work on the backend needs to be done, because the Scratchpad remembers your searches, and live-updates prices. We need to present that data in a rapid and interactive manner, which requires a lot of muscle on backend servers,\" he said, noting again the company's reliance on the AWS cloud for that performance boost.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
