Called seifu senyo ki, or Japanese Air Force One in English, the jets were introduced in 1991, and are also used for transporting Japanese nationals in the event of emergencies.\n\n\"With such a long history of using the 747, the government is likely to go with Boeing again,\" said Haruo Ushiba, chief analyst at Japan Aviation Management Research. \"They'll most probably go with another wide-body, such as the 777.\" Boeing and Airbus Group NV said they are both interested in pitching for the order.\n\n\"Boeing is excited for the opportunity to work together again on the head of state aircraft programme with the Japanese government,\" said George Maffeo, head of the planemaker's Japan operations. \"We have a long and enduring relationship with the Japanese government and industry.\"\n\nAirbus, which won its first plane order from Japan Airlines Co in October, will decide whether to submit a proposal after receiving more details, Stephane Ginoux, head of Airbus Japan unit, said on Jan 28.\n\nThe 2013 list price for a wide-body Boeing 777-300ER is US$320.2 million, according to the company's website. An Airbus A350-1000 costs US$340.7 million, the planemaker said.\n\nJapan got its current Boeing 747s in 1991 when it first created a Japanese Air Force One, according to the defense ministry website. The planes, flown by Japanese Self-Defense pilots, have a capacity to transport about 150 passengers. They are equipped with an administrative office, meeting room and a media area, according to the website.\n\nThe US also uses 747s to carry the president. The planes, called Air Force One when carrying the president, are capable of refuelling midair and have an unlimited range. They are equipped with communication gear that allows the aircraft to function as a mobile command centre in the event of an attack on the US, according to the White House's website.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe uses Japanese Air Force One on overseas visits, while Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko also flew the plane for a state visit to India last year.

Many resorted to deep discounts to drum up business, apparently with little success.\n\nThe year before was already bad. Among the top 15 markets for Swiss luxury timepieces in 2012, Singapore was the only one in which imports took a dip. Big local watch dealers such as The Hour Glass (THG) and F J Benjamin (FJB) reported drops in profits and sales.\n\nIt looks like last year, the Year of the Snake, was also a bad year for the luxury-watch business here.\n\nThe numbers, however, do not back this up fully.\n\nThe latest quarterly balance sheets of THG and FJB indicate that sales were up between July and September, though net profits were down. New stores outside Singapore partly contributed to THG's higher sales; FJB's double-digit jump in sales, on the other hand, came from expansion at home.\n\nThere is little doubt that the local luxury watch market remains tough.\n\nCortina, another major retail chain, reported big gains in profits and sales in the financial half-year ending September, but its gains came mainly from its growth in Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nThe latest export figures from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry (FSWI) show that the Singapore market did turn around last year, after a 1.9 per cent dip in 2012.\n\nShipments from Switzerland, which has a near-monopoly of the global production of high-end mechanical timepieces, inched up 0.9 per cent for the January-to-November 2012 period, to 1.04 billion Swiss francs (S$1.48 billion) over the same period last year.\n\nOverall, Swiss watch exports, hampered by cautious consumers (especially the Chinese) and a strong Swiss currency, were largely flat last year; they rose just 1.7 per cent year on year to nearly 20 billion Swiss francs in the first 11 months, following a 12.7 per cent jump in the same period in 2012.\n\nJean-Daniel Pache, head of the FSWI, told Bloomberg News recently that full-year shipments probably inched to a new high, beating 2012's level of 21 billion Swiss francs. Exact figures are due next week.\n\nHong Kong, the United States and China - in that order - kept their positions as the top three markets, but Swiss exports to Hong Kong slipped 6 per cent to 3.78 billion Swiss francs between January and November 2013. Shipments to China, dampened by an official anti-corruption drive, plunged 15.0 per cent.\n\nSwiss watch exports to France and Taiwan also fell in the first 11 months of last year - by -11.6 per cent for France and -2.0 per cent for Taiwan.\n\nYet the picture isn't as bad as the figures suggest. The Swatch Group, which accounted for nearly half of Swiss watch exports, reported revenue growth of 8.3 per cent to a record 8.82 billion Swiss francs last year.\n\nThe bosses of luxury brands Panerai, Parmigiani and Hublot said their sales also did better last year.\n\nSwatch is upbeat about this year, predicting \"dynamic\" growth. It said in a statement a fortnight ago: \"Based on the strong start by all brands in the first few days of January, dynamic growth is expected for the entire year of 2014.\"\n\nJean-Christophe Babin, the new chief executive of the Italian jewellery and watch brand Bulgari, tipped Swiss watch-export growth to pick up by between 5 and 10 per cent this year. Macroeconomic indicators are improving, and restocking at watch retailers is coming to an end, he said in an interview with Swiss French newspaper Le Temps.\n\nAlready, in anticipation of higher market growth ahead, luxury watch brands such as Jaquet Droz, Piaget, Chopard, Panerai, Ulysse Nardin and Vacheron Constantin have launched special-edition timepieces to cash in on the Year of the Horse.\n\nVacheron unveiled the Metiers d' Art The Legend of the Chinese Zodiac, which comes in a limited edition of 12 pieces in platinum and another 12 in pink gold. The platinum model is retailing at $197,900 and the pink gold one, at $163,000.\n\nUlysse Nardin's Classico Horse, at $72,100, comes only in rose gold; only 88 pieces are available.\n\nPanerai has launched 100 pieces of a special-edition, Year of the Horse model in steel, costing $32,000.\n\nChopard's LUC XP 2014 Year of the Horse model is also a special-edition one, but not limited in number. The rose gold model costs $30,970.\n\nPiaget's Altiplano 38mm Cloisonne Enamel is limited to 38 pieces in pink gold ($92,060) and another 38 in white gold ($93,600).\n\nJaquet Droz's The Horses Les Ateliers d' Art has three models with cases in different sizes: 39 mm ($49,000), 41 mm ($99,000) and 43 mm ($92,000). These are limited to 88 pieces each.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unsurprisingly, the watch survives unscathed but a cushion which it is flung towards doesn't and is starting to fall apart. The test is repeated 50 times before it's transported to another space where the prototype is attached to a special machine to simulate a fall from 10m for the same number of times.\n\nThat's not all, a centrifugal force and vibration test makes sure the watch stays in one piece even under the most extreme of conditions. When all that is done, it's put on another special device with a cloth rubbing against the resin 24-7 for a full week to test the resin's durability.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/independents", "site_title": "The independents", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe independents\n\nThe founders of two avant-garde, rule-breaking watch companies share their vision. By Dylan Tan\n\nPublished Thu, Jan 30, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE'S one name watch aficionados trust when they're looking for cutting-edge horological masterpieces. Yafriro, the multi-brand luxury timepiece boutique founded by ex-tailor Iwan Hew, has been breaking independent brands such as Richard Mille, Parmigiani Fleurier and Glashutte since 2001 here and turning them into the household names they are today.\n\nIts flagship boutique at Paragon was recently renovated for an undisclosed sum and the space is now not only roomier but it has also been further brightened up by its glittery shop-in-shop concept for haute jewellery brand Leviev.\n\nBut one thing remains the same though; Yafriro continues to champion independents and three new brands - Antoine Martin, Breva and Hysek - have recently been introduced.\n\nEach possesses its own avant-garde DNA strand and are leaders in their fields for breaking watchmaking rules. The founders of two of the brands, Antoine Martin and Breva, were in town late last year to meet with collectors and sat down with The Business Times to discuss their vision for the brands.\n\nANTOINE MARTIN\n\nThe name Antoine Martin might sound unfamiliar but the name Martin Braun is bound to ring a bell with watch collectors because of the latter's work for various big brands over the last three decades as well as the revolutionary sunrise-sunset watch he created in the mid-1990s before launching it in the 2001 with his namesake brand.\n\nThis despite the fact that Braun's thunder was slightly stolen by Audemars Piguet (AP) who also unveiled its Equation of Time timepiece - a high-complication perpetual calendar watch that had a similar sunrise-sunset function - the same year to celebrate its 125th anniversary.\n\nBut the German watchmaker says the bad timing might have worked in his favour because critics and collectors lauded the newcomer instead for matching up to AP's expertise and technical prowess despite being relatively a newcomer.\n\nIt also led to a stint where Braun operated his brand under the Franck Muller group though that was short-lived.\n\nHe's since joined forces with another watch industry veteran, Bruno Jufer, as CEO to launch his new brand, Antoine Martin, to realise his decade-old vision of a technologically advanced watch movement featuring his own High Performance Escapement that uses silicium for increased energy yield.\n\nBraun also \"slowed down\" time last year with the Slow Runner - a watch that beats at a very unconventional 7,200 beats per hour. It also features something unique in most Antoine Martin timepieces - a bier-than-usual exposed balance wheel.\n\n\"I always tell people the Slow Runner is a magic watch because when they first see it with the dial faced up, it looks like a normal watch,\" says Braun. \"But the moment they flip it over (and see the balance wheel spinning), you see a huge smile being formed on their faces.\"\n\nBREVA\n\nNot every luxury watch needs to be pampered with tender loving care 24/7; Breva's timepieces are tough enough to survive any climate and can even forecast the weather. Its Genie 01 is the world's first mechanical wristwatch with an altimeter and barometer to forecast the weather. The proprietary movement is the brainchild of Jean-Francois Mojon, founder of creative watchmaking collective Chronode.\n\nIt all started when Vincent Dupontreue decided he wanted to own a nice timepiece on his 33rd birthday in 2010. That inspired him to start his own high-end Swiss watch company; the name comes from La Breva, a warm southern wind that contributes to the mild micro-climate around Lake Como in Northern Italy where Dupontreue was vacationing.\n\nAfter three years of R&D led by Mojon, Breva launched the Genie 01 last year. It's a highly sophisticated watch that will require its owner to at least browse the instruction manual once to know how to operate it but Dupontreue says that's exactly the point.\n\n\"We want the owner to touch and play with it; it's like giving a new toy to a child,\" he explains, while screwing and unscrewing the various crowns on the Genie 01 to demonstrate how the difference in air pressures measured by the watch over different periods of the day allow the watch to forecast the weather.\n\nMojon reveals the biggest challenge was to try and squeeze all the components into the watch's 45mm case so as to keep it at a wearable size; as well as using materials that are not traditionally found in watchmaking for the timepiece to perform its weather forecast function.\n\nDupontreue, who comes from a fashion background having worked for the likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Ermenegildo Zegna, insists that's all in a day's work for Breva. \"We want to be radical and not be like the rest of the Swiss watch industry (which can be very traditional),\" he says. \"I like to think outside of the watch case.\"\n\nYafriro Paragon\n\n290 Orchard Road, #01-28A/29\n\nTel: 6333 6663/8 | Email:\n\ninfo@yafriro.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last year, it said that it would ease the roadblocks to Chinese banks opening branches in the British capital.\n\n\"This transaction will elevate ICBC's global markets capabilities in business development, risk management, operations, and innovation in order to better serve our clients' needs,\" said Jiang Jianqing, chairman of the Chinese bank.\n\nUnder the deal, Standard Bank, the largest bank in Africa, will sell a 60 per cent stake in its London markets business to ICBC and grant the Chinese bank a five-year option to buy another 20 per cent of the unit. The entity being sold focuses on commodities, fixed income, currency, credit and equities trading.\n\nICBC is Standard Bank's largest shareholder, with a 20.1 per cent stake. ICBC has more than 4.6 million corporate clients and 410 million individual customers. Britain said in October that it would begin discussions to allow Chinese banks to open wholesale branches, rather than subsidiaries, for the first time.\n\nOpening branches would let a Chinese bank use its parent company's capital to meet British rules for reserves and other financial requirements. The five largest banks in China, including ICBC, already have subsidiaries in Britain.\n\nIn October, the British government also reached an agreement that allows investors in London to apply for a licence to invest directly in Chinese stocks and bonds in the Chinese currency, the renminbi. It is the first Western country to reach such an agreement.\n\nIn the past, investors had to go through an intermediary in Hong Kong to invest in Chinese stocks and bonds, which could carry a higher cost.\n\nBritain is also a Western trading hub for the renminbi, accounting for 62 per cent of global trading in that currency outside China and Hong Kong.\n\nAfter the deal, Standard Bank will retain the investment banking, investment management and London-based services businesses. Those business lines remain a crucial part of Standard Bank's business in Africa and will be incorporated in a new British-based entity or other Standard Bank units.

Held at Capella Singapore, the event was kickstarted with a gala charity dinner and wine auction, followed by 11/2 days of tastings. In total, the event raised $1 million for the three beneficiaries - St Andrew's Autism Centre (SAAC), the Autism Association (Singapore) Eden Centre for Adults and the Autism Resource Centre (Singapore).\n\nDr Yong shared, \"Wine is about people but more important it is about sharing. And a Paulee, which begun originally as a gathering of wine growers and friends to celebrate the end of the harvest, is for us a gathering of friends to celebrate life and love. And while we celebrate our friendships, we do not forget to share also with those less fortunate in our community who need our help.\"\n\nMost of the wines were generously donated by the vintners, while others offered their wines at very special prices. While the La Paulee event traditionally focused on Burgundy wines, some of Spain's top wine producers also congregated to support the Singapore edition.\n\nThe list of who's who in the wine world included names such as Alvaro Palacios (Alvaro Palacios, Spain), Pablo Alvarez (Vega Siclia, Spain), Veronique Drouhin (Domaine Drouhin), Pierre Henry Gagey (Domaine Louis Jadot), Erwan Faiveley (Domaine Faiveley), Jean Luc Pepin (Domaine Comte Georges de Vgue), Domainique Lafon (Domaine Comtes Lafon), Jean Charles le Bault de la Moriniere (Domaine Bonneau du Martray) and Nicolas Potel (Maison Roche de Bellene).\n\nSerena Sutcliffe MW, head of International Wine Department of Sotheby's London and New York, also graced the event to auction an unbelievable clutch of rare wines.\n\nThe Unico Reserva 1989 by Bodega Vega Sicilia (in a very special double magnum format and shipped directly from the winery's cellar) topped the auction charts. At a reserve price of $4,500, the wine by one of Spain's most famous wineries fetched a final price of $29,000. This was followed by the salamanzer (9 litres) format of Romanee-St Vivant 2009 Grand Cru from Domaine/Maison Roche de Bellene, which escalated rapidly from $8,000 to $28,000.\n\nAt the end of the auction Serena Sutcliffe commented, \"This is such a unique event, as it is not every day you can get these top producers together and such generous donations.\"\n\nPairing the riveting wine action was a team made up of Singapore's top chefs, led by Tetsuya Wakuda (Waku Ghin). The men in chef's whites cooked up a storm for the gala dinner, and upped the ante by putting themselves up for auction as a surprise item.\n\nThe chefs - Tetsuya Wakuda, Melina Yong, Beppe de Vito (ilLido, Latteria Mozzarella Bar, &SONS Bacaro) and Nam Q Nguyen (Annam Pte Ltd) raised $40,000 with a private dinner for 10 pax, paired with wines.\n\nThe Singapore National Culinary Team, the Bocuse d'Or Singapore competitor Yew Eng Tong and Janice Wong (2am: Dessertbar) also put up live stations showing their best canapes.\n\nPerhaps the greatest twist came at the end of the night. With the final amount just over $970,000, a guest, who had flown in from Shanghai for this event - generously topped up the remainder of $27,000 so that the event could raise a final sum of $1,000,000.\n\nDr Yong, surprised and pleased at the final amount raised, added at the end of the night, \"Our gathering tonight reaffirms our faith that there is a central force for good in all of us, a central power of love which binds us into one single community.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

Details of the package, which is likely to involve covering their medical needs, will be revealed in Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam's Budget Speech next month.\n\nIn his message, Mr Lee said that Singapore as a society has been making a special effort to take care of its elders, ensuring they lead active and fulfilling lives.\n\n\"Beyond infrastructure and financial help, we are creating a social environment where people can age with peace of mind, and be valued and respected for their contributions,\" he said.\n\nThe pioneer generation deserves special recognition because it saw Singapore through its most difficult times, Mr Lee pointed out.\n\n\"They worked hard to build Singapore and transform it from Third World to First. All of us today benefit from their efforts and achievements.\"\n\nMr Lee kicked off his message by noting that Singapore made good progress last year despite some tough moments. \"I am confident that we will continue to move forward in the Year of the Horse,\" he said.\n\nWhile there is still a need to improve public transport, he noted that housing queues have shortened and low-wage workers such as cleaners are getting more help.\n\nHe said Singaporeans must ensure that Singapore is the best home to raise children and fulfil their aspirations.\n\n\"We want to pass on to them a better Singapore than the one we inherited,\" Mr Lee said. \"We hope that our children will build on what they will inherit and will create a brighter future for themselves and their children, just as the pioneer generation did for us.\"\n\nFor this to work, he said that Singapore needs enough children to form the next generation. Mr Lee hoped that the Year of the Horse will see some improvement in the birth rate, which is still too low despite efforts to raise it.\n\n\"This year we have a 'double spring',\" he said. \"Valentine's Day coincides with Chap Goh Mei, the 15th day of Chinese New Year. Almost 300 couples have registered to marry on this auspicious day, so we are off to a galloping start.\"\n\nMr Lee reminded Singaporeans that Chinese New Year is a time to boost family bonds, and that families are the foundation of a cohesive, harmonious society.\n\n\"Strong families and close ties with our fellow Singaporeans have underpinned our success and will continue to be the foundation for a brighter future,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has defiantly rejected repeated calls by the opposition and the Election Commission (EC) to delay the snap election, arguing that doing so would be unconstitutional. This despite growing threats by anti-government protesters to disrupt the polls to prevent Ms Yingluck's ruling Puea Thai Party from being returned to power.\n\nBangkok - currently in a 60-day state of emergency - has been ravaged by street protests since last November which have seen at least 10 people killed and hundreds more injured in grenade attacks, shootings and clashes.\n\nThailand, South-east Asia's second largest economy, can ill afford more setbacks if it is to remain competitive in the region and beyond. The government estimates that tourist arrivals will fall by half to one million in January - a big blow for the industry ahead of the busy Chinese New Year holiday that begins tomorrow. The Tourism Council of Thailand predicts that revenue loss this month could reach up to 22.5 billion baht (S$870 million) as scores of countries, including the United States and China, have warned their citizens to avoid protest sites and reconsider non-essential travel to the country.\n\nThe big question is what this Sunday's election will achieve. Ms Yingluck has maintained that Thais who are unhappy with her and her administration should make their voices heard at the election. But even if Puea Thai wins by a landslide (as is expected), given that the leading opposition Democrat Party is boycotting the poll, it remains highly unlikely Ms Yingluck will have enough numbers to form a new government.\n\nAccording to the Constitution, 475 MPs are needed to convene Parliament, but protesters have so far prevented candidates from registering in 28 out of 500 constituencies. The EC's head, Somchai Srisutthiyakorn, said earlier this week that should the election result fail to yield enough seats, it could take anywhere from 4-6 months to convene Parliament again.\n\nThailand is entrenched in a deep hole that it can't seem to dig its way out of. It is clear that a postponement of the polls will far from guarantee that the problems will end anytime soon. Any delay, however, will only increase the pressure on Ms Yingluck and make it harder for her to run the country because her caretaker administration is not supposed to make policy decisions that may commit the next government.\n\nThis election looks to be just another chapter in a lengthy power struggle that has plagued the country. Whatever the outcome on Sunday, it appears that the ruling party and the protest movement led by the firebrand opposition leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, are on yet another collision course - spelling even more trouble for Thailand.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was weaker than the 2.1 per cent month-on-month growth registered in November.\n\nThe gains refer to net growth, that is, new loans which have been granted, after deducting loans that have been paid off.\n\nOn a yearly basis, the value of DBU loans rose 17 per cent in December, a slight dip from the 17.4 per cent growth registered in November.\n\n\"One contributing reason is likely the US Fed's decision to start tapering its QE programme in January, and banks and corporates could have turned slightly more cautious,\" said OCBC economist Selena Ling.\n\n\"The recent softening in the property market due to TDSR (Total Debt Servicing Ratio) and other macro-prudential measures probably also weighed on near-term consumer sentiment,\" she added.\n\nConsumer loans edged up 0.3 per cent in December over the previous month to reach $225 billion, down from the one per cent growth recorded in November. The 0.3 per cent expansion also represents the smallest monthly growth since February 2009, data compiled by The Business Times showed.\n\nThe narrower gain in consumer loan growth in December may suggest that fewer or smaller loans have been granted for property purchases.\n\nHousing and bridging loans, which make up the largest chunk of consumer loans, crept up 0.4 per cent over the previous month to $166 billion, easing from November's 0.6 per cent growth.\n\nThis is the second consecutive time that loan growth in the segment has eased compared with the previous month.\n\nCar loans in December stood at $10.7 billion, down 1.8 per cent month on month. This compares with the 1.9 per cent decline registered in November.\n\nGrowth in the property and car loan segments have come under the scrutiny of regulators, who have imposed restrictions to prevent borrowers from taking on too much cheap debt.\n\nConsumer loans grew 8.9 per cent year on year, a weaker performance compared with the 9.6 gain seen in November.\n\nLoans to businesses in December grew 2.3 per cent month on month to $349 billion, compared with a 2.8 per cent growth in November.\n\nGrowth was dragged down by an easing in general commerce loans, though a stronger performance in loans to manufacturers offered some buffer.\n\nManufacturing loans grew 0.9 per cent from the previous month, compared with a decline of 0.7 per cent in November.\n\nBusiness loans grew 22.9 per cent over the year, down a touch from the 23.3 per cent growth in November.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 15 per cent gain took Dubai past European No 2 Charles de Gaulle, which attracted 62 million passengers, and the No 3 Frankfurt, with 58 million.\n\nA similar growth rate at Dubai in 2014 would allow the hub to surpass Heathrow. The London airport, whose passenger numbers rose 3.4 per cent to 72.3 million last year, is already operating close to the limits of its two runways. The Gulf hub is being expanded to serve 90 million travellers annually, even as Dubai builds the new Al Maktoum base designed to handle 150 million people and with a potential capacity for 200 million.\n\n\"It was truly a historic year for Dubai's aviation sector,\" chief executive officer Paul Griffiths said in a statement. \"2014 is set to be another eventful year, one featuring continued traffic growth, network expansion and the ongoing enlargement and upgrade of our facilities and runways.\"\n\nIn 2012, Dubai International attracted four million fewer passengers than Paris Charles de Gaulle and was neck and neck with Frankfurt, which handled 57.5 million that year.\n\nEurope's major airports are also under pressure from Istanbul Ataturk, where the passenger count surged 14 per cent in 2014 to 51.3 million, taking it past Madrid and almost level with Amsterdam Schiphol, the continent's fourth-busiest hub.\n\nLike Emirates and Gulf rivals Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways PJSC of Abu Dhabi, Turk Hava Yollari (Turkish Airlines) is exploiting the position of its home base at a crossroads for intercontinental air routes to grab an increasing share of a transfer market that's long been central to the business models of West European airports. Ataturk's owner is part-controlled by the parent of Charles de Gaulle, helping to hedge against the eastward shift in hub traffic.\n\nDubai also saw the average number of people per plane rise to 198, it said in a statement, because of its status as the biggest global base for Airbus Group NV's A380 superjumbo, for which Emirates is far and away the No 1 customer. That compares with a figure of 154.8 passengers at Heathrow, itself one of the biggest bases for the double-decker model.\n\nAircraft movements at Dubai gained 7.5 per cent to 369,953, compared to 469,552 at Heathrow, while 28 destinations were added, bringing the total to 239, with India ranking as Dubai's single-largest market. The Qatari capital Doha and London were the most popular destination cities.\n\nAbu Dhabi International airport boosted passenger numbers 12 per cent last year to 16.5 million, with 135,000 aircraft movements, it said on Wednesday in a separate statement.

The group is also considering additional fund raising options, it said in a statement yesterday.\n\nDays earlier, GRP said it had signed a letter of intent with MGS Resort & Entertainment Co to acquire the participation rights to a 37,287 square feet plot of land in Yangon, Myanmar for US$12 million. It had paid US$800,000 upon the signing of the letter of intent.\n\nThe private placement made to Mr Teo represents 4.98 per cent of the existing issued share capital of the GRP, and 4.75 per cent of the enlarged issued share capital of the firm when the proposed placement is completed. The 10 cent per share price is a discount of approximately 8.26 per cent to the volume-weighted average price of 10.9 cents per share that GRP's shares were trading at on Jan 29, 2014 - the last full market day before the placement agreement was signed. After deducting $8,000 in placement fees, GRP will have about $2.77 million to grow its business.\n\nGRP has three main businesses: it is a manufacturer of hoses and fittings for the marine, oil and industrial sectors, a supplier of precision measuring instruments and a manufacturer of uPVC pipes and fittings for China's construction industry.\n\nGRP's shares were on a trading halt yesterday.

Singapore was not included in the inaugural report last year.\n\nSingapore managed 25.1 points out of a possible 30, behind the US (28.5), the UK (27.6) and France (27.2).\n\nThey were evaluated on 30 different factors, including the protection and enforcement of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and participation in relevant international treaties.\n\nAccording to the report, Singapore did well because it had an advanced national IP framework in place, as well as an adequate regime for legal software in the government.\n\nSingapore also has a legal framework that provides for the protection of un-registered marks, and exclusive trademark rights are in place and generally enforced, the report noted.\n\nHowever, the country had one of the highest per capita incidents of peer-to-peer file sharing infringements in all of Asia, according to research conducted by the Motion Picture Association of America.\n\n\"Singapore's Copyright Act provides rights holders with exclusive rights, including in the online space,\" said the report. \"Despite this, rights holders face a challenging environment with regard to the spread of online piracy, particularly in light of the extraordinary penetration of wireless devices and high-speed broadband.\"\n\nThe report noted that the government had announced last year that it was studying ways to block websites that offer pirated content in an effort to make copyright infringing material less accessible online.\n\nAmong Singapore's other weaknesses flagged by the GIPC: Internet service providers here are also unresponsive to rights holder notices for online copyright infringement, and the relatively high rates of trademark counterfeiting.\n\nOn the whole, the GIPC's assessment was that Singapore had in place a \"highly robust and efficient framework\" for civil remedies, criminal standards and pre-established damages.\n\n\"Overall the law enforcement, judicial environment, and legal framework are efficient, with notable shortcomings only in relation to the relatively low level of penalties for the trafficking of circumvention devices,\" it said.\n\nGIPC president and chief executive David Hirschmann said that governments around the world want to create an environment that embraces growth and maps the path to further progress.\n\n\"A robust IP system provides the critical foundation needed for nations wishing to advance their economic and social progress, and provide assurances to consumers that the products they use are authentic, safe and effective,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has approved six test sites for civilian drone development.\n\nBecause the FAA hasn't yet drafted regulations allowing routine unmanned-aircraft use, government agencies can only operate drones if they receive special permits.\n\nCBP uses its aircraft to patrol both US coasts and the borders with Mexico and Canada, Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman, said. The agency had 10 drones, including the one that crashed, Ms Burke added.\n\nCustoms notified the FAA about the accident as required, the aviation regulator said in a statement.\n\nThe Predator B, also known as the MQ-9 Reaper in the US Air Force, can fly as many as 27 hours and reach an altitude of 15,240 metres, according to the website of Poway, California-based General Atomics. It has a wingspan of 20 metres and can carry more than 1,361 kilogrammes of cameras, weapons or other payload, according to the company. Each Predator costs about US$18 million.\n\nAt least some of the aircraft was recovered from the water while a US Coast Guard cutter stood watch, petty officer Connie Terrell said in an interview.\n\nThe NTSB has assigned an agency specialist in unmanned aircraft to the case, Mr Holloway said. The FAA will assist.\n\nAfter a Customs Predator B crashed into a hillside near Nogales, Arizona, on April 25, 2006, the NTSB concluded that an operator inadvertently shut off the plane's engine while trying to deal with a radio-link failure. Investigators found that the Predator's pilot, who was supposed to be monitored by an instructor, had been allowed to fly it by himself. The operator, a General Atomics employee, didn't follow the company's procedures for addressing radio-control issues, the NTSB found.\n\n\"The investigation also revealed that the CBP was providing a minimal amount of operational oversight,\" the NTSB said in its findings.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM", "images": []}

This is the lowest month-end aggregate since November 2012, which closed with total market cap of $860 billion.\n\nThe decline was broad-based. Ranking the market by market cap, every decile showed a decline in market value, with the largest and smallest stocks falling by the largest percentages. The number of stocks worth more than $1 billion slipped to 110 from 112.\n\nThere were four initial public offerings during the month, which added $1.5 billion of value to the market.\n\nFrasers Centrepoint Ltd (FCL) also listed by way of introduction after it split from Fraser and Neave. FCL contributed a market cap of $4.3 billion, while F&N's market cap was a shade lower at $5 billion.\n\nThe market was hit on several fronts during the month.\n\n\"There were some results, some macro worries about the US not recovering as fast as expected, and China slowing down,\" DMG & Partners head of research Terence Wong said.\n\nUOB Kay Hian head of research Andrew Chow also noted concerns about emerging markets.\n\n\"The blues have seen weakness because of funds moving out from emerging markets,\" Mr Chow said. \"If you look at the Jardine group in Singapore, the price has come off a cliff because of exposure to Indonesia. The weakness in the rupee will affect SingTel. There are a lot of concerns about emerging market currencies.\"\n\nBut the analysts remained bullish on the Singapore stock market for the rest of the year despite the rocky start.\n\n\"I think this is still going to be a good year for the market,\" Mr Wong said. \"The position hasn't changed. In terms of macro, I believe the macro or recovery story is still there. . . We've underperformed the past few years and companies still remain relatively strong, and the Singapore market is not expensive.\"\n\nMr Wong had a preference for smaller cap stocks over larger ones, given the hit to small-cap prices following October's selloff. The plantation, consumer, and offshore and marine sectors are also growth themes preferred by DMG.\n\nMr Chow expects the Straits Times Index to hit 3,400 this year.\n\n\"Globally, we should be seeing a recovery of sorts,\" he said. \"In the meantime there will be a lot of noises, be it currencies or China's shadow banking. Our advice to clients is to buy on weakness.\"\n\nBlue chips with good earnings visibility, such as Keppel Corp, could be attractive pick-ups following selldowns.\n\n\"For selective companies like Keppel Corp, I don't think things have changed that much over the last one month,\" Mr Chow said.\n\nCompanies that will benefit from the US Federal Reserve's tapering, such as banks, could also offer value buys. Even among real estate investment trusts, which typically get punished in rising-rate environments, undervalued gems exist.\n\n\"Those with good growth, like Suntec and CCT (CapitaCommercial Trust), are attractive when there's a bit of selldown on the market,\" Mr Chow said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Having successfully run two art galleries in Shanghai and Hong Kong, she's now making a bid for the market here.\n\nFor her first show, she's put on works by five terrific asbtract artists from around the world - Indonesia's Christine Ay Tjoe, China's Su Xiaobai and Zhi Jinshi, American Pat Steir and Briton Peter Peri.\n\nLam has exquisite taste in abstracts and the selection doesn't disappoint. Ay Tjoe's sensuous canvases brim with bouquet-like splashes of reds and pinks, all expressions of pure spirit - even if one of her works titled Conscientious Gluttony veers uncharacteristically towards the figurative.\n\nIn contrast, the wood and lacquer painted panels by Su bear a Rothko-esque minimalist intensity with nary a brushstroke out of place.\n\nThe real draw of the exhibition, however, are Zhu Jinshi's canvases with their thick impasto build-up of paint, so dense and textural they resemble sculptures in their three-dimensionality.\n\nLam's gallery is substantially larger than many of the galleries in Gillman. So most of the works sit on their own walls, preventing the common problem of strong works diminishing each other's when they're placed too close together.\n\nAll we're left to say - after putting our eyeballs back into their sockets - is: Welcome to Singapore, Ms Lam.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was primarily due to the rental contribution from the completed redevelopment of 20 Gul Way Phases One & Two, said Koh Wee Lih, chief executive officer of AIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit Management, the manager of the trust.\n\nOn the portfolio management front, the trust secured 12 new and renewal leases (representing 1.9 per cent of the portfolio's net lettable area), pushing the trust's occupancy up to 98.2 per cent, with a weighted average land lease expiry of 38.4 years. The leases were secured at a weighted average rental increase of 27.2 per cent.\n\n\"In addition to active property and lease management, we remain committed to enhancing value within our portfolio. In September, we commenced the next development phase of 20 Gul Way (Phase Two Extension and Phase 3), which will add 496,949 sq ft gross floor area to the site. With master tenant CWT Ltd leasing the entire floor space, the development is expected to contribute an additional $6.3 million rental income per annum once completed,\" added Mr Koh.\n\nEarlier this year, the trust received unitholders approval to acquire a 49 per cent indirect interest in Optus Centre, its first overseas acquisition.\n\nMoving ahead, the trust said it was turning its attention back to Singapore, and will focus on development and acquisition opportunities here. In addition to 20 Gul Way, it has Defu Lane lined up as part of its committed pipeline.\n\nAs at Dec 30, portfolio value stood at $1.13 billion.\n\nThe trust's counter ended 1.5 cents higher at $1.44 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After a couple of forgettable sequels, a TV series and a slew of comic books and video games, the iconic man-machine returns: RoboCop is back, badder (but not exactly better) than before.\n\nRevisiting a well-known character in search of franchise riches can be a perilous exercise (look no further than RoboCop 2, 1990 and RoboCop 3, 1993) but - given the movie-going public's insatiable appetite for action flicks featuring crime-busting superheroes - dressing up the \"future of law enforcement\" in a shiny new suit again is perhaps a box-office risk worth taking.\n\nThe latest Robocop, directed by Jose Padilha and written by Joshua Zetumer, endured several false starts before making it to the big screen - yet this big-budget retool is no one-dimensional thriller. The central character's struggle for identity, the socio-political commentary and the satirical humour - punctuated, of course, with large doses of flashy, futuristic violence - make this film an exception to the genre.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

The transaction will almost double the Bethesda, Maryland-based company's rooms in Africa to about 23,000 and help it expand further in the region, where a growing middle class and rising travel are fueling the fastest pace of hotel development in the world.\n\nMarriott is \"opportunistic\" in its choice of possible acquisitions, and its growth strategy has changed over the years, Mr Sorenson said. The company in March announced it would start a European budget chain called Moxy Hotels with the parent company of the Ikea furniture chain, and in 2011 formed a joint venture with Spanish lodging group AC Hotels. Marriott in June said it would introduce the brand in the US.\n\n\"If you had told me five years ago that we would go into the economy space in Europe, I would have not believed it,\" Mr Sorenson said of the Moxy transaction.\n\nMarriott shares have increased 24 per cent in the past 12 months, greater than the 19 per cent advance in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Hotel companies have gained as US revenue per available room, a measure of rates and occupancies, climbed 5.3 per cent last year through November, according to Hendersonville, Tennessee-based research company STR.\n\nMr Sorenson said he expects lodging companies to benefit from further economic growth this year because of a lesser degree of political uncertainty compared with 2013 and a modest recovery among middle-income US households.\n\nMarriott, the largest publicly traded hotel chain after Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc, opened about 26,000 new rooms in 2013 and expects new hotel openings to accelerate this year and next, the company said in a statement on Monday. As part of this growth, Marriott earlier this month announced a second project in New York City under its luxury Edition brand, which it created with hotelier Ian Schrager.\n\n\"The sectors that still struggle the most, like construction, are typically not our customers,\" Mr Sorenson said. \"The middle class is by and large employed and has been reducing household debt. A consequence of that is, there is more travel. There is greater economic strength the higher up you go.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

This was largely aided by a $5 million contribution from its Angsana Velavaru resort in the Maldives bought early last year, which offset slight declines in revenue from its hotels in Singapore and Australia.\n\nThe stapled group operates in Singapore, Australia, the Maldives and New Zealand. Its Singapore portfolio, the biggest contributor to revenue, fell as more hotel rooms came to the market and as companies worldwide cut back on travel budgets. Revenue per available room fell 6 per cent to $187, while the average occupancy fell to 87 per cent from 88.9 per cent.\n\nGross revenue was also affected by tenants moving out of Orchard Hotel Shopping Arcade, now renamed Claymore Link, due to refurbishment works.\n\nNet property income in Q4 was 2.5 per cent higher at $36.5 million.\n\nFor the full year ended last December, CDLHT reported a DPS of 10.97 cents, down 3.2 per cent from the previous year, for a yield of 6.8 per cent. This came on the back of a 2.6 per cent decline in distributable income to $118.6 million.\n\nFull-year revenue fell 0.5 per cent to $148.8 million, primarily due to lower contributions from its Singapore hotels, amid increased hotel room supply, economic uncertainty and as Claymore Link closed for refurbishment. Rental contribution from Australia also dipped. Helping to mitigate this was the strong contribution from the Angsana Velavaru resort.\n\nNet property income fell 1.4 per cent to $137.4 million, in tandem with the lower revenue.\n\nAs at Dec 31 last year, the stapled group had a gearing of 29.7 per cent. Vincent Yeo, CEO of CDLHT, said that the management will be comfortable if gearing rises to around the 40 per cent mark. This would translate to about $400 million of debt headroom.\n\nIn the near term, he said that it could focus on overseas acquisitions, and that it likes Japan, Dubai, Sydney and the Maldives.\n\n\"Generally we like destinations with a very healthy macro picture, and we like to find value in our acquisitions.\"\n\nTurning to the Singapore market, Mr Yeo believes the fundamentals are strong and \"it's just a matter of digesting\" the pipeline of new supply over the next few years. He cited recent record deals for hotels as a sign that buyers are looking beyond the immediate time horizon.\n\nMeanwhile, CDLHT's newly acquired Jumeirah Dhevanafushi resort in the Maldives should start contributing to revenue this year. Asset enhancement works at Claymore Link are due to complete by the end of this year, and could contribute more than $2 million in rental income on an annualised basis.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They would only say that three-year-old Iglu's property portfolio is valued at A$150 million (S$167 million), and that it comprises more than 900 beds across three properties - two in Sydney and one in Brisbane.\n\nGIC and Macquarie Capital said that they expect further funding to be put into building additional high-quality Iglu-managed properties near educational institutions and public transport in cities with a shortage of suitable student accommodation.\n\nOf Iglu's two properties in Sydney, the one located near Sydney's Central Station, called Iglu Central, has 98 beds and has been fully occupied since its completion last year.\n\nIts other Sydney property is the 395-bedder Iglu Chatswood, which has just opened to meet demand for the 2014 academic year. It is the only off-campus, purpose-built student accommodation asset on Sydney's North Shore, the primarily residential area of northern metropolitan Sydney.\n\nIglu's Brisbane property, Iglu Brisbane, will open in the heart of Brisbane's Central Business District in 2016, kitted out with more than 400 beds.\n\nCommenting on the acquisition through a joint statement issued with GIC, Macquarie Capital Real Estate's global head Chris Green said: \"The student-accommodation sector has excellent investment fundamentals with a well-documented supply shortage.\n\n\"We believe Iglu is an outstanding developer and operator of off-campus student accommodation in Australia, and so it is the ideal business to work with us to build a portfolio of premium assets in the best locations across the country.\"\n\nJones Lang LaSalle provided valuation services to GIC and Macquarie for the acquisition. Conal Newland, its director of student-accommodation services, said: \"Our analysis of this latest transaction in the market on an individual-asset basis indicates net initial yields in the range of 7 per cent to 7.5 per cent for stabilised student-accommodation income streams on good-quality, purpose-built residences.\n\n\"There is currently over A$1 billion of potential investment looking to enter the Australian student-accommodation market to capitalise on the strong fundamentals that currently exist, such as the gap in supply and the demand for existing good-quality accommodation, the high occupancy rates, the annual real rental increases and the attractive total returns offered, relative to core asset classes.\"\n\nTraditionally, the sector is not one that attracts investment from institutional investors, but this has been changing, said Mr Newland.\n\n\"We are seeing a number of investors increasing their exposure to alternative asset classes and the Australian student-accommodation market is offering some exciting opportunities.\n\n\"These investors are primarily focused on prime assets and experienced operators, with a view to benefiting from yield compression as more liquidity enters the market,\" he said.\n\nGIC, in its recent acquisition spree, has snapped up stakes in both real estate and firms.\n\nThis month, it confirmed that it is partnering the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and US real estate firm Related Companies to buy 1.1 million square feet of office space in New York City's Time Warner Center for US$1.3 billion.\n\nLast month, it bought a large stake in mega-office complex Broadgate in London's main financial district; in August, it snapped up a 47-storey Grade A office tower in the heart of Jakarta's Central Business District.

Last year, the carrier took delivery of a ninth leased A320.\n\nThe letter of intent was for 14 of the current single-aisle A320 model and 42 of the new A320Neo due to enter service in 2015, which promises airlines considerably better fuel efficiency.\n\nAnother six planes will be the longer A321 version, which can be configured with up to 220 seats.\n\nWhile VietJetAir has a good foothold in the Vietnamese market, analysts say it is facing stiff competition in the low-cost segment in South-east Asia, behind Malaysia's AirAsia, Lion Air of Indonesia, Singapore's Tiger Airways and Jetstar of Australia. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

When we build new hospitals that are state-of-the-art, these will require people who are skilled, and will also involve the PME (professionals, managers and executives) community,\" he said.\n\nOCBC's Ms Ling added that if social spending is done sustainably and effectively, it can \"promote growth, facilitate greater efficiency and alleviate some of the potential negative externalities associated with an ageing population\".\n\nArguably the most anticipated portion of Budget 2014, set for Feb 21, will be what Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will reveal about the new Pioneer Generation Package.\n\nIt was at last year's National Day Rally that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong broached the move to develop such a package to recognise and help a special group of elderly and deserving Singaporeans.\n\nIn his annual Chinese New Year Message released this morning, he said that these are the seniors who saw Singapore through its most difficult times, having worked hard to build the country into what it is today.\n\nMP David Ong, a businessman by profession who has championed issues facing the elderly since his entry into politics in 2011, said many of these \"pioneers\" have, in many ways, been left behind as Singapore progressed over the years.\n\n\"Many would have missed out on the fruits of the nation's progress as their salaries were much lower then, and they have few safety nets such as savings and CPF.\n\n\"It is only right that we do what we can now for this group of people and share with them the successes of the country they helped to build,\" he said.\n\nOCBC's Ms Ling, while conceding that no one would begrudge having such a package for seniors, wondered whether this would be an ad hoc package or one that would pave the way for a more comprehensive support system for seniors and seniors-to-be on a rolling basis, as is the case with the Workfare scheme.\n\nAt a community event earlier this month, Mr Tharman disclosed that the Pioneer Generation Package would not be a \"one-year bonanza\"; rather, it would give its recipients sustainable help so that they can lead long, happy lives.\n\nKalyani Mehta, a social work academic who teaches Singapore's first Master's programme in gerontology at SIM University, expressed hope that the government would look beyond just healthcare provisions for the pioneers of this country.\n\nShe said: \"There should be more transport concessions or subsidies for their conservancy charges and PUB bills. These costs are going up, and any help would be most welcome.\"\n\nMr Ong said he would like to see the government restore the CPF contribution rate for older workers to plump up their retirement savings, and more incentives given to companies to retain and hire them.\n\nMr Tay said this is the right time for Singapore to invest more, given that the country is facing the twin challenges of an ageing society and a low fertility rate.\n\n\"We are making ourselves future-ready and future-proof. Now that we have a reasonably stable economy, we should start preparing while we can. We don't know how the global economy will turn out in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Customers can book flights on both airlines, for instance, and loyalty programme members can earn miles when travelling on either network. The carrier recently selected a new reservations system.\n\n\"It's really early in the merger but we are off to a great start,\" chief executive Doug Parker said during a conference call. \"We have a lot of work ahead.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines Group said on Tuesday that it had a net loss of US$2 billion, or US$8.66 a share, in the fourth quarter, after charges of US$2.4 billion tied to AMR Corp's emergence from Chapter 11 protection and merger costs.\n\nStill, excluding those charges, combined profit for AMR, American's former parent company, and US Airways, was US$436 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of US$42 million. Adjusted profit was 59 cents a share, higher than the 55 cents a share expected by analysts surveyed by Reuters.\n\nThe merger of American and US Airways was the fourth major union in the US airline industry since 2008. American significantly pared costs in bankruptcy, and the merger gave its biggest unions equity stakes in the new company.\n\nCombined revenue grew 8.7 per cent to US$9.98 billion, better than the US$9.9 billion expected by analysts. Yield, a measure of the average fare, rose 5 per cent.\n\nFuel costs, the carrier's biggest expense, fell 1.7 per cent, while operating expenses rose 7 per cent on a combined basis.\n\nThe results were similar to those of other airlines in the fourth quarter, which tends to be aided by year-end holiday travel. Revenue gains and lower fuel costs helped Delta Air Lines, United Continental and Southwest Airlines post better-than-expected profits last week. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/3585f6d3894e7226a20dea85d9cb9081c6fa0eb979587d630635f530177969a6?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Merger benefits: American plans to improve Q4 results by combining operations with US Airways after the recent merger.

Around 70 per cent of the exhibitors are returning ones, with 60 of the top 100 aerospace companies present.\n\nOrders at this year's event are not expected to exceed the record US$200 billion at the Dubai Airshow last November.\n\nMr Lau said it would be difficult to match the Middle Eastern numbers as airlines there have procured a lot of new aircraft, while Asia-Pacific carriers are carrying out fleet upgrading and buying fewer new planes.\n\nNevertheless, the Singapore Airshow is still the largest aviation event in the Asia Pacific, Mr Lau said.\n\n\"We are cautiously optimistic that there will be some deals coming through,\" he said. \"If we can hit 70-80 per cent of what we did at the last show, we'll be very happy.\"\n\nThe 2012 show saw around US$30 billion in deals, most of which came from Indonesia's Lion Air.\n\nBesides the events at Changi, the Singapore Airshow also has other conferences lined up during the week.\n\nThe first is the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit (SAALS), to be held at the Raffles City Convention Centre on Feb 9-10. Around 300 attendees are expected at the invitation-only event.\n\nEmeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong will speak at the opening dinner of the summit, themed \"Shaping the next century of commercial aviation\".\n\nThree panels will discuss matters ranging from the future of regulation to moving towards carbon-neutral growth during the summit.\n\nOther speakers include Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew, and Olumuyiwa Bernard Aliu, president of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) council.\n\nMeanwhile, the Asia Pacific Security Conference (APSEC) geared towards policymakers and military professionals will take place on Feb 10.\n\nThe half-day event will discuss matters such as air power and security in the region, and rethinking Sino- US strategies in East Asia. Minister for Social and Family Development and Second Minister for Defence Chan Chun Sing will make the keynote speech at APSEC.\n\nOn top of the strategic conferences, there are also two co-located events scheduled: the A*Star Aerospace Technology Leadership Forum, and the Singapore Aerospace Technology and Engineering Conference.\n\n\"Together, these events address issues across a multitude of commercial aviation and strategic events around the world,\" Mr Lau said.\n\nThree business forums - focusing on China, the US and Asia - will take place during the week as well.\n\nAnother highlight of the week will be the flight of the A350 XWB in its first full display at an international airshow. The aircraft will be present on the first two days of the show.\n\nAlso confirmed for the aerial ballet are the Black Knights, Singapore's sole aerobatics team.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control, part of the US Treasury, declined to clarify whether claims would be recoverable after July even if the incident happened before then, Gard said.\n\nThe US and its allies agreed to ease some sanctions against Iran for six months starting Jan 20, part of a deal designed to curb the Middle East country's nuclear programme. The relaxation included suspending an EU insurance and reinsurance ban that had barred most international tanker owners from getting coverage to carry Iranian oil. The EU prohibition helped limit Iran's oil exports, which the US estimated fell 60 per cent since the measures started in 2012.\n\n\"This ongoing insurance-claims ambiguity places a cautious cloud on the willingness of carriers to ply this route, eventually restricting the pace of growth in Iranian oil exports during this six-month window,\" Miswin Mahesh, an analyst at Barclays in London, said on Tuesday.\n\nOFAC spokeswoman Hagar Chemali didn't immediately respond to an e-mail and phone call seeking comment.\n\nThe US estimates that Iran is exporting one million barrels a day and says that the nation cannot expand sales beyond that figure under the deal, which was negotiated in November in Geneva. Iran's own estimate for sales was about 1.5 million barrels a day in November, according to a submission by the country to the Joint Organisations Data Initiative. US officials say that the Iranian estimate is inflated.\n\nAndrew Bardot, the executive officer of the International Group of P&I Clubs, a London-based umbrella organisation that includes Gard as a member and covers 95 per cent of the world's tankers, said before the easing of the EU ban that OFAC was \"on the same track\" as the European Commission concerning relaxing the measures.\n\n\"Members and clubs should proceed on the basis that beyond July 20, 2014, clubs will not be able to respond to any claims presented in respect of liabilities arising during the Jan 20/July 20 suspension period,\" Gard, the largest P&I provider, said in its notice. \"This has the effect of rendering the current suspension of sanctions on insurance cover, and in particular P&I cover, of very limited, if any, value to shipowners.\"\n\nP&I refers to protection and indemnity insurance.

Last December, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 3.2 per cent year-on-year, said the central bank; for the year as a whole, the average growth was 2.1 per cent compared to a year ago.\n\nOn the ground, buffeted by rising living costs, consumers have been pulling back on their spending.\n\nThe survey findings, released on Tuesday, underscore many analysts' belief that a disconnect has developed between Malaysia's strong macroeconomic numbers - a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5 to 5.5 per cent is expected this year - and the reality as experienced by consumers.\n\nOver the last decade, the Malaysian economy has been driven by domestic demand and, to a lesser extent, net exports. Exports are now recovering, but a decline in demand-driven growth could crimp the economy.\n\nFuel prices have spiked as a result of the government's trimming of fuel subsidies - arguably too quickly. Add to this the fact that electricity tariffs were raised by 15 per cent from the start of this year; the government is also contemplating raising tolls on the country's highways.\n\nThe MIER report noted: \"Pay gains are not boosting household balance sheets, as creeping inflation caused by the recent series of price hikes are crimping household finances and their purchasing power.\"\n\nForty per cent of the households surveyed said their financial standing had deteriorated at year's end. Another 44 per cent said their financial position was unchanged, and only 15 per cent reported an improvement in their finances in the fourth quarter.\n\nMost people think it will get worse. Almost 92 per cent of households - the highest percentage since MIER began such surveys in the 1990s - expect prices to go up more. The most worried are the low-income urban households in the central region.\n\nConsumers believe that now is not a good time to buy or invest in major consumer durables; only 27 per cent think otherwise.\n\nMIER's Business Conditions Index also declined, extending its declining trend to end at 92 points in the fourth quarter of last year, down 6.6 points from the previous quarter.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He said he was confident of the company's performance in the current third quarter, which is traditionally the company's strongest because of the Chinese New Year period.\n\nRising distribution, sales and administrative expenses were caused by increased spending in new markets and on new corporate initiatives, he said.\n\nInterest expense for the quarter more than doubled to $1.4 million from $616,000 as a result of coupon payments on the $75 million, 4.1 per cent notes issued last June to fund general corporate purposes. The company also faced higher effective tax rates over the quarter due to changes in the composition of profit and loss positions for its subsidiaries.\n\nEu Yan Sang has 253 company-operated retail outlets and 45 franchise outlets as at end-2013. It added outlets to Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore and closed outlets in China and Australia over the quarter. At end-2013, it had 28 TCM clinics, two premier TCM clinics and two integrative medical centres.\n\nOverall, Singapore sales weakened 5 per cent for the quarter due to a challenging retail environment, while Hong Kong, its largest geographical segment by revenue, surged 31 per cent.\n\nFor the half year, revenue was up 15 per cent at $171.4 million and net profit down 7 per cent at $4.6 million.\n\nEarnings per share were 1.04 cents for the half year, down from 1.13 cents the same period a year ago. Net asset value was 32.2 cents at end-2013, down from 33.6 cents at end-June 2013.\n\nYesterday, Eu Yan Sang closed at 81.5 cents, up half a cent, before results were released. According to Bloomberg, the consensus 12-month target price for the company is 95 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For Singapore lenders, it identified the property price index, and the composite leading index, on top of that for retail spending and industrial production.\n\nMoody's cited data from the retail sales index that showed spending had declined in 2013 over the year. The recovery between the second half of 2010 and the second half of 2012 still put retail spending below the height in the pre-crisis period.\n\nThis sign of \"pressure on households' cash flow\", will likely correlate with an increase in consumer problem loans, Moody's said. Some of that pressure could be eased by government intervention, though, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) curbing aggressive consumer borrowing for property investment and cars, it added.\n\nMoody's sounded concern over the industrial production index. Its muted performance over the last two years has indicated a moderate weakening in the corporate sector, it noted.\n\nCorporate loans denominated in both Singapore dollar and foreign currency made up 66 per cent of the total loan book for the three local banks, data compiled by Moody's showed. Of these, 14 per cent consists of loans taken by manufacturing companies - the fourth-highest proportion after general commerce, building and construction, and financial institutions, respectively.\n\nStill, industrial production numbers - released last week - showed surprising strength in December, with the manufacturing sector expanding by 6.2 per cent last month compared to a year ago. Economists now forecast a higher-than-expected revision to Singapore's full-year GDP growth.\n\nLooking at the property price index from the Urban Redevelopment Authority, Moody's noted that property sector not only reflects household wealth, but also indicates investment sentiment, since about 30 per cent of home purchases are for investments.\n\nDespite existing caution over a housing bubble, Moody's expects the asset quality of housing loans to remain stable.\n\n\"Property prices have risen in the past few years, though recent MAS measures had a stabilising effect on prices in anticipation of potential interest rate increase,\" it said.\n\nMoody's has also reviewed Singapore's composite leading index, which captures indicators such as the number of new companies formed, business expectations of wholesale trade, and US purchasing managers' index.\n\nIt said that the index was relatively stable in 2012 and 2013, which should reflect stable general-commerce problem loans in the next 12-18 months.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The agency added, however, that the 2013 figure was well within its forecast of between $11 billion and $13 billion.\n\nIn any case, EDB chairman Leo Yip said at a press conference that the 2012 investment number had been inflated by one-off chunky projects, making the year an aberration from recent years.\n\n\"If you look at the trend over the last five to 10 years, you will see that $12 billion is actually well within the range we have secured.\n\n\"There were several spikes - including that in 2012 - and those spikes were big investments.\"\n\nBetween 2004 and last year, there were three years when investments shot past that achieved last year: 2007 ($17.2 billion), 2008 ($18 billion) and 2012 ($16 billion). For the rest of the decade, investments were between $9.4 billion and $13.7 billion yearly.\n\nLast year's investments are likely to create value-added of $16.7 billion for the year, which is within the $16 billion to $18 billion projected.\n\nEDB said the investments are tipped to generate 21,400 skilled jobs and a record $7.8 billion yearly in total business expenditure (TBE), up from $6.2 billion in 2012.\n\nA big chunk of the TBE are salaries, said Mr Yip.\n\nEDB said the strong TBE commitment, sitting in the upper bound of its forecast of $6.5 billion to $8 billion, came from the setting up of several significant headquarters with regional and global functions in Singapore.\n\nMr Yip said: \"The investments achieved by EDB in 2013 reflect Singapore's strong position as a global business hub, as multinational corporations and other companies continue to be attracted to the market opportunities in Asia.\"\n\nHe said that EDB has not lost any investment projects as a result of the tightened labour market and changes to the foreign worker policy here. \"They have not as a factor swung their business decisions. No company has told us, 'Look, we don't want to come to Singapore because your manpower situation has made you less attractive than before.' \"\n\nHe maintained that overall, including ease of operation and capability, Singapore has stayed attractive to foreign investors.\n\nThis year, EDB is looking to attract investments of between $10 billion and $12 billion with TBE of between $6 billion and $7.5 billion. It also expects the number of new skilled jobs created this year to fall 25 to 35 per cent to between 14,000 and 16,000.\n\n\"It's a steady level of investments that's in keeping with where Singapore is today, in its phase of economic development,\" Mr Yip said. \"Our cost structure is approaching that of the advanced economies, so really, the growth we seek has got to be high-value-added, productivity-driven.\"\n\nThe investments projected for 2014 are at a steady level, also in keeping with Singapore's workforce growth rates and land considerations, he added.\n\nElectronics was the top investment sector last year, accounting for 27 per cent of total investments. But commitments in electronics fell to $3.3 billion, down 46.8 per cent from 2012.\n\nInvestments in the chemical sector, where the biggest chunk (42 per cent) of total investments went to in 2012, dropped 62.7 per cent to $2.5 billion last year.\n\nEDB's managing director Yeoh Keat Chuan said the sector is now in the down-cycle and companies there are now making smaller and more capital-efficient investments.\n\nMeanwhile, the semiconductor industry has entered a phase in which it was uncertain that the recovery is clearly on a strong track.\n\nHe said: \"They're holding off from making major greenfield investments. So what they are doing is making incremental expansions in order to be able to tweak and expand their existing capacity.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Today, 92 per cent of Singaporeans are covered under the existing MediShield scheme.\n\nLast November, an eleven-member review committee was tasked with studying how best to frame MediShield Life. It will be submitting its recommendations to the government in May.\n\nAt a press briefing yesterday, committee chairman Bobby Chin said that feedback from its consultation efforts so far shows that Singaporeans are largely in favour of the better and lifelong protection that MediShield Life will offer but are concerned about the affordability of the premiums, especially for those who are currently uninsured, and of the impact that bringing in the uninsured would have on their own premiums.\n\nBetter coverage under MediShield Life will likely lead to higher premiums.\n\n\"In all the focus group discussions, one call was very pronounced: that the government should help and provide support for the elderly and the low-income,\" Mr Chin added.\n\nAccording to Patrick Lee, a committee member and chairman of Sing Lun Holdings, one of the points raised during consultation exercises with the Chinese community was the preference to cover the premium with Medisave.\n\n\"Try not to top-up by cash - that's one point that many have touched on,\" he said.\n\nThe committee has carried out 14 focus group discussions so far with the public as well as key stakeholders such as academics, union groups, healthcare professionals and insurers.\n\nIn addition, the review committee has created three sub-committees to explore certain areas in greater depth - namely the parameters of the benefits under the plan, bringing in the uninsured under universal coverage as well as integrated shield plans.\n\nIntegrated shield plans, which are Medisave-approved, are those offered by private insurers. In this respect, the third sub-committee will look at whether there should be greater regulation and standardisation for such integrated plans.\n\nThe committee has also suggested the government carry out more public education as the consultations have shown there is a general lack of understanding where Singapore's healthcare financing framework is concerned.\n\nGoing forward, the committee plans to look into the merits and drawbacks of frontloading, which involves paying more of the premiums when a person is younger and working, as well as the cost of bringing the uninsured and unhealthy onboard the scheme.\n\nOn the latter, there were some mixed views on how costs should be shared - that is, whether premiums should be the same for everyone or higher for those with pre-existing conditions, for example.\n\nThe committee is now moving into the second phase, where it will also be seeking input from the Ministry of Health, actuaries and companies.\n\nMediShield Life is expected to be launched in 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also follows a handful of hedge funds and private equity firms that piled into the region last year.\n\nPrivate equity firms Apollo Global Management and the Blackstone Group have been fighting over assets in Spain, while hedge funds like John Paulson's Paulson & Co and Daniel Loeb's Third Point have been circling assets in Greece.\n\n\"The recovery and stabilisation of European sovereign credits, financial institutions and its economy dovetails with bank deleveraging and asset sales which is taking place,\" said Andrew Rabinowitz, chief operating officer at Marathon.\n\nMarathon plans to buy non-performing loans from local banks, distressed real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities.

It depends on who you ask.\n\nOn the one hand, advocates of QR such as regulators, auditors and investors argue that more frequent reporting helps the market keep tabs on companies and aids investment decision-making. On the other, companies argue that the costs of compliance outweigh the limited benefits because of the short-termism and share price volatility that QR encourages.\n\nTo arrive at some compromise and bridge this divide, some countries set a size requirement for QR. The rules here, for example, require only companies with market capitalisation above $75 million to release quarterly reports, which means shareholders of smaller firms have to make do with only interim updates. Even so, many exempt companies are still against the idea of QR, and ever so often the subject of scrapping the practice is raised for discussion.\n\nTo be honest, it's difficult to escape self-interest when evaluating the pros and cons of QR. You would hardly expect companies to say that QR is a fantastic boon to investors and should be encouraged; instead, you would quite reasonably expect them to complain about QR and find criticisms because they have to do the work, incur the expense and deal with the repercussions if the figures reported are below par.\n\nBy the same token, one could reasonably argue that for auditors, QR means more fees so they would logically argue in favour of the practice, while the same goes for shareholders and investors since more information is always preferable to less.\n\nThis is not to say that objections raised by QR detractors are trivial. On the contrary, QR does come at a price. For example, there are studies which suggest that jurisdictions with QR tend to exhibit greater share price volatility when compared to those with only interim reporting.\n\nAlso valid is the contention that if senior managers have to worry about preparing the accounts every three months, it means they have less time to spend on strategic, longer-term issues.\n\nEqually, some have argued that QR isn't able to deliver a meaningful picture of a company's fortunes since this may take more than three months to form, especially if the company in question has \"lumpy\" earnings, or an income stream that is not evenly distributed over time.\n\nBut you would have to ask, even with all these seemingly convincing arguments against QR, why have countries such as the US and Canada adopted QR as the norm? Why, despite pressure from the corporate sector and other lobby groups to switch to reporting every six months, do some developed markets persist with QR?\n\nApart from the fact that there is no conclusive evidence that QR's costs outweigh the benefits, there can only be one explanation - if markets are to be self-regulating and if the governance framework is to be disclosure-based, then it makes sense to require companies to provide as regular updates as possible on their financial performance and outlook.\n\nAnd this is why QR is needed, because it must be seen as an integral part of a regime underpinned by continuous disclosure and one which, on balance, should not be dismissed lightly.\n\nOf course, to some extent, the usefulness of QR depends on the efficiency of the market in question and the quality of the analysis available - the more efficient a market is, the quicker it would be able to incorporate information, so more timely information should be welcome.\n\nMoreover, it is well known that financial analysts prefer regular reports to track the companies they cover and to predict full-year earnings, and the better analysts are able to do their jobs, the faster share prices adjust to the latest information.\n\nConversely, studies have shown that relying on only interim earnings can lead to greater forecasting error and sometimes, greater volatility.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the Reit's results briefing last week, chief executive officer Ng Hsueh Ling, while stressing that it was \"too early to comment\", added that the Reit might consider the possibility of divesting one of its older assets to partially fund the Tower Three acquisition should there be such a transaction.\n\nEarlier this week, Bloomberg, citing sources, reported that the Reit had put a $531 million price tag ($2,400 psf) on its 30-storey Prudential Tower in Cecil Street. This is 8.3 per cent higher than its valuation of $490 million as at end-2013.\n\nCIMB analyst Pang Ti Wee said: \"This deal may be interesting, given that Prudential Tower is already at an optimal stage with 100 per cent occupancy. We believe that without a substantial asset enhancement initiative, K-Reit may have difficulty raising the yield or valuation of this property further.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, when compared with MBFC Tower 3, which is a very new building, currently with an occupancy rate north of 90 per cent, we believe there is still room for growth in terms of both occupancy and valuation, particularly on the back of an office rental market recovery.\"\n\nAccording to Sigrid Zialcita, managing director, research, Asia Pacific, at Cushman and Wakefield, Prudential Tower's pricing appears to be \"fairly valued\".\n\n\"With average Grade A rents expected to increase around 10 per cent over the next two years from the average of about $9.00 currently, the $2,400 price tag implies a net yield of around 4 per cent, indicative of current pricing levels,\" she said.\n\nSo whether the sale of Prudential Tower and the purchase of MBFC Tower 3 is yield and distribution per unit (DPU) accretive will depend on the price point at which Keppel Land decides to sell MBFC Tower 3.\n\nMr Pang said: \"In terms of financing MBFC Tower 3 (taking into account Prudential Tower's) asking price of $531 million, K-Reit is still looking at $620 million. Whether this acquisition is yield accretive or not will depend on the price and structure of the acquisition.\" The assumption is that a Tower 3 acquisition will be priced at about $1.15 billion.\n\nBased on a price tag of $1.24 billion and the assumption that K-Reit divests Prudential Tower for $490 million, the acquisition would be DPU-neutral, said Standard Chartered's analyst Yip Kai in a research report issued last week.\n\n\"K-Reit currently has $736 million of unutilised loan facilities, and we expect the trust to be able to obtain further loan facilities secured against Ocean Financial Centre. While this funding mix would raise K-Reit's leverage to about 47.6 per cent, we estimate that the 3.1 per cent organic NPI acquisition yield of MBFC Tower 3 would be DPU-neutral, given K-Reit's 2.15 per cent cost of debt,\" he said.\n\nReligare analyst Tata Goeyardi holds a more bearish view: \"Even if K-Reit sells Prudential and buys MBFC Tower 3, FY15 DPU is still likely to fall by 8-9 per cent as per our calculation (assuming MBFC is bought at 4 per cent cap rate) and, furthermore, gearing would rise to about 44-45 per cent.\"\n\nA Keppel Reit Management spokesman, when contacted yesterday, said: \"Keppel Reit does from time to time receive interest to acquire our properties.

Globally, \"the high-end smartphone and tablet markets are saturated, and that's not going to grow\".\n\nThe world's most valuable technology company sold a record 51 million iPhones in the quarter, but that was still shy of the 55 million or so that analysts had expected.\n\nThe company forecast sales of US$42 billion to US$44 billion this quarter, brisker than usual because of Apple's new deal to sell iPhones through China Mobile, the country's No 1 carrier. But Wall Street had expected even more - US$46 billion, on average.\n\nThe company on Monday recorded sales of US$57.6 billion in its December or fiscal first quarter, versus expectations for about US$57.5 billion. Net profit was flat from a year earlier at US$13.1 billion, or US$14.50 a share, compared to Thomson Reuters IBES estimate of US$14.07.\n\n\"After showing modest signs of improvement, we're back to a no-growth outlook,\" said JMP Securities' Alex Gauna. \"It's something Apple needs to find an answer to . . . If it can't prove that it's going to be a growth story again, the valuation is too high.\"\n\nChief financial officer Peter Oppenheimer told analysts that the March-quarter revenue outlook reflected the effects of a strong US dollar, and more balanced levels of demand and supply for iPhones at the start of this year than a year earlier, when demand outstripped available inventory.\n\nFor the December quarter, Apple recorded gross profit margins of 37.9 per cent, roughly in line with expectations.\n\nBut it was the iPhone sales and revenue outlook shortfall that drew attention.\n\nThe iPhone maker has been ceding ground to Samsung and other rivals in China, its No 2 market, but investors hope that its tie-up with the country's dominant mobile carrier will help reverse its fortunes in the world's largest cellular arena.\n\nIn the closely watched greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, revenue jumped 29 per cent from a year earlier to US$8.84 billion, bolstered by strong iPad sales and the iPhone's global launch in September, when China was included among launch countries for the first time.\n\nCompany executives did not talk about iPhone unit sales in the world's No 2 economy. But intense competition not just from Samsung but also lower-cost, local rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi is impeding its progress.\n\nIn the less competitive tablet arena, Apple sold a record 26 million iPads globally in the quarter, in line with Wall Street estimates. Mr Oppenheimer told Reuters that the company more than doubled sales of the tablet in mainland China during the December quarter, helping drive that milestone.\n\nThe iPod, which sparked the revival of Apple last decade, is now a waning product, selling just over six million in the quarter, less than half the year-ago tally. \"IPod sales declined by 52 per cent year-over-year in the December quarter and we would expect them to continue to decline year-over-year in the March quarter,\" said Mr Oppenheimer.\n\nLonger term, investors continue to hope that Apple, which last came out with a revolutionary new device - the iPad - in 2010, has something up its sleeve for this year. Speculation revolves around a smartwatch or even a long-rumoured TV product. Others say that Apple can use its huge iPhone and iTunes base to get into mobile payments or advertising.\n\n\"What we need to see from them is some sort of new product development and it would be likely in the area of software, mobile payments and advertisements that would get us thinking that there is an opportunity for accretion,\" Mr Gauna said. \"Hardware can only go in one direction and that's flat or down. It has to be something in the innovation space and they have a lot of things they can do.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The key three-month Sibor (Singapore interbank offered rate) has risen to 0.40503 per cent since Jan 15, a 52-week high, up from a low of 0.37083 last April.\n\nIt is why growth in deposits continues to shrink, plunging to 4.4 per cent last November year on year (y-o-y), from 8.3 per cent y-o-y last January, said the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nDeposits in banks are made up of three components - savings, demand deposits and fixed deposits.\n\nSavings and demand deposits are still growing at a decent clip, but growth in fixed deposits, the largest single component, has fallen into negative territory.\n\nOn the other hand, loans in November grew 17.4 per cent y-o-y.\n\nLast week, DBS launched a promotion for its most popular deposit account, which pays regular savers a top-up rate of 1.764 per cent in addition to the base rate of 0.25 per cent for those who save $1,000 every month.\n\nTok Geok Peng, DBS' senior vice-president for consumer deposits, said: \"MySavings Account (MSA) is our most popular deposit account as customers can save on a regular basis and enjoy higher yield on their savings.\n\n\"The majority of MSA account holders are between 30 and 45 years old and female,\" she noted.\n\nFor someone who saves $1,000 a month, the interest at the end of 12 months could be as much as 10 times that of a regular savings account, she said.\n\nUnited Overseas Bank (UOB), which offered a 999.9 gold-plated horse figurine (worth $238) for deposits of $350,000, said its stock of horses has been fully redeemed.\n\nOCBC Bank increased the interest rate for its 12-month fixed deposit to 1.1 per cent for $20,000 (from 1.08 per cent) and 1.18 per cent for $200,000 (up from 1.10 per cent).\n\nLing Seng Chuan, the bank's head of deposits, said the promotional interest rates are higher because the competition for deposits is keener, especially during the Chinese New Year festive period.\n\nANZ's 12-month fixed deposit for $150,000 pays 1.10 per cent as well as a cash gift of $160, giving an effective interest rate of 1.21 per cent.\n\nAnalysts expect the competition for funds to intensify through the year, given that deposits are falling and loans are growing in double-digit terms.\n\nKenneth Ng, CIMB's research head, said: \"The trend of low deposit growth is due to the fact that with low rates, savings are going into other assets (bonds, Reits, property).\"\n\nAs at end-September 2013, the Singapore dollar loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) was 73 per cent for DBS, 84 per cent for OCBC and 92 per cent for UOB.\n\nRising LDRs will mean funding pressure ahead, said Mr Ng.\n\nStill, it does not mean that the banks rely only on customer deposits to fund loan growth. Local banks have stepped up their borrowings via the US commercial paper market. Commercial paper refers to short-term bonds of less than 12 months' duration.\n\n\"So we shouldn't be too fixated on the pure loan-to-deposit ratios,\" said one analyst.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The deal was a cross-border foreign currency letter of credit financing solution to Jeans International Trading Co Ltd from Zhejiang which helped the firm with its funding objectives and better capital efficiency between its overseas and domestic affiliates, the bank said in a statement.\n\n\"As a pioneer foreign bank to commence operations in the FTZ, DBS has been working closely with clients such as Jeans International to capture opportunities in the FTZ, guided by latest policies and regulations,\" said Neil Ge, DBS Bank (China) chief executive.\n\nDBS (China) began its Shanghai pilot FTZ sub-branch operations on Jan 7.

The median estimate of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 1.8 per cent advance. Orders for non-military capital goods excluding aircraft also declined.\n\nYesterday's report is the first to indicate that the slowdown in growth last month went beyond the unusually cold temperatures. Stagnant wages and inconsistent job gains probably mean consumer spending, which accounts for almost 70 per cent of the economy, will not be able to sustain recent gains.\n\n\"Businesses see limited prospects for their consumers,\" Bricklin Dwyer, an economist at BNP Paribas in New York, said before the report. \"They're not willing to take the risk and invest when they know the consumer is not going to be there to pick up that added volume.\"\n\nForecasts for total durable goods orders in the Bloomberg survey of economists ranged from an increase of 10 per cent to a 1.2 per cent drop. The gain in November was revised from a previously reported 3.4 per cent advance.\n\nExcluding transportation equipment, where demand is often volatile month to month, orders decreased 1.6 per cent, the biggest decline since March, after a 0.1 per cent increase in November.\n\nYesterday's durable goods report is one of the last bits of data that economists will use to finalise their growth projections. The decline in demand and revisions to previous months may prompt some analysts to reduce forecasts.\n\nThe world's largest economy grew at a 3.2 percent annualised rate in the fourth quarter following a 4.1 per cent gain in the previous three months, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg ahead of a Commerce Department report on Friday. It would complete the strongest six months in almost two years.\n\nPurchases of durable goods such as cars, furniture and appliances have been a consumer spending bright spot as Americans replace the oldest household goods since the 1960s.

Despite the embargo, American farmers can sell food to Cuba as long as Havana pays in cash.\n\nCuba is hoping to establish itself as a regional hub for shipments from Asia after an expansion of the Panama Canal is completed in 2015, allowing for the passing of larger ships carrying up to 12,000 containers.\n\nThe largest infrastructure project ever launched by Cuba, Mariel will cover some 465 square kilometres and include a free trade zone where foreign-owned factories can produce goods for other markets.\n\nThe authorities are hoping that the goods redistributed across the Atlantic from Cuba would allow the island nation to reassume the status of commercial nerve centre it once held during the Spanish empire's grasp on Latin America.\n\nCuban authorities have already indicated that they will target high-tech businesses, particularly in agro-business, biotechnology and information technology.\n\nAccording to Ana Igarza, director of Mariel's Special Development Zone, \"investment proposals\" have already been put forth by businesses in Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, Chile and the Dominican Republic.\n\nMrs Rousseff said on Monday that Brazil wants to be a \"first-order economically to Cuba\". Her government has financed US$802 million of the first phase of the project and US$290 million towards its free-trade commercial zone.\n\nAnd a logistical base is already in place for foreign businesses related to oil. A highway and railway linking the port to Havana are under construction.\n\nBut all these projects require capital that is still largely lacking, particularly in light of the US embargo.\n\n\"We need investments of around US$3 billion per year,\" Cuban economist Juan Triana, of the University of Havana, recently estimated.\n\nBuilt by the Brazilian company Odebrecht with the help of a US$600 million credit from the state, the port will be managed by PSA International of Singapore, which already runs several of the world's largest ports. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Selling pressure came from a correction in US stock markets last Friday.\n\nObservers said that sentiment about emerging markets remains poor because of country-specific, non-systemic concerns: currency volatility in Argentina and Turkey, a political crisis in Thailand, unrest in Ukraine, and current account and fiscal deficits in countries such as South Africa and Indonesia. In China, concerns over growth and financial stability predominate.\n\nMarkets are also awaiting the outcome of a US Federal Reserve meeting later this week. If the Fed decides to cut back more on its bond purchases, higher yields for US bonds will put further price pressure on emerging market bonds.\n\nIn contrast, investor sentiment on Europe and the US remains positive, and observers said that this is likely to continue. These markets saw gains of 20 to 30 per cent last year. Western economies are recovering and liquidity remains relatively abundant. After last year's rally, stocks there are not cheap, but still not obviously overpriced, analysts said.\n\nOCBC Bank economist Selena Ling said at a market outlook briefing yesterday that stock market volatility could also be divorced from a positive global growth scenario.\n\n\"Economic fundamentals haven't changed much in the last two weeks. I don't think market gyrations will derail the economy,\" she said.\n\nThe global economic outlook this year is benign with no obvious tail risk for the year, compared to last year when investors fretted over fiscal problems in the US and a potential hard landing in China, she said.\n\nSimilarly, Citi strategist Mark Schofield said in a note yesterday that he expected global growth to be above average levels at 3.3 per cent this year and 3.4 per cent in the next. Equities continue to be favoured in an environment of moderate growth and low inflation, he said.\n\nBut there are distinctions to be made even among developed countries, he said. \"We also expect persistent disparity between the stronger US and UK economies and the weaker euro area and Japanese economies.\"\n\nA week of bad news for emerging markets culminated in Argentina's currency crash last Friday. Earlier in the week, a preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) reading of 49.6 from HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics indicated that China's manufacturing activity may contract for the first time in six months.\n\nAnother China-related worry was the potential default of a three billion yuan (S$633.3 million), high-yield product that raised funds for a failed coal mining firm. There could be ramifications for China's sizeable wealth management industry, where 10 trillion yuan is managed under trusts. Yesterday, the Chinese trust firm that created the product said, without giving details, that it had reached an agreement to repay investors.\n\nThe Argentinian peso plunged 12 per cent against the US dollar last Friday, after its central bank opted to hold on to its reserves and stopped propping up the currency. Investors have lost confidence in the country, which is facing an economic crisis and high inflation.\n\nBut the situation is \"not the end of the world\", private bank Coutts said in a note yesterday urging clients to buy instead of sell. China might face near-term stresses, but the bad news is well discounted, with equities having single-digit earnings multiples, it said.\n\nArgentina's currency sell-off is not directly relevant to most emerging market indices, said Jorge Mariscal, UBS regional chief investment officer of emerging markets.\n\n\"The current bout of emerging market currency volatility has only affected mostly small, peripheral economies,\" he said. \"Although US tapering is weighing on risk sentiment, we believe stronger US economic growth should mitigate the potential fallout.\"\n\nAnd in Turkey, where worries about external financing are compounded by political power struggles, decisive policy action could turn investor worries around, he said.\n\nSimilarly, Lorraine Tan, director of research at S&P Capital IQ, said that the risk of currency fears spreading in emerging markets is limited. \"The balance of payments deficits in Asia are mainly currently seen in Indonesia and India. Slowing growth in these countries, coupled by their weaker currencies, have actually helped to contain the deficits in recent months,\" she said.\n\nObservers have also called for investors to differentiate between more vulnerable \"deficit\" countries and stronger ones, including the North Asian economies of China, South Korea and Taiwan.\n\nAs at Jan 22, developed market funds are enjoying their fifth straight week of inflows while emerging market funds are having their 13th week of outflows, a Citi Research note said. European funds led inflows and China funds are also seeing inflows, it added.\n\nVasu Menon, OCBC Bank's vice-president of wealth management, said that even as developed markets look more attractive, emerging markets, trading at 10 times earnings compared to the global average of 15 times, cannot be ignored completely.\n\n\"What you want to do is to phase your investments in and hold for six to nine months as the market goes through turbulence. You must take the medium-term view,\" he said.\n\nMs Ling said that with European economies recovering and US growth back to 3 per cent, emerging Asia will eventually benefit and export more. \"Significant upside risk could come from the US and China. And I'm hopeful on the electronics recovery story. Maybe there's a lag, and we'll have a clearer picture in the second half,\" she said.\n\nIn Singapore, corporates will see decent earnings growth of 8 to 10 per cent this year, said Carmen Lee, head of OCBC Investment Research.\n\nWith the benchmark Straits Times Index falling 1.1 per cent to 3,042.43 points yesterday, there is value if it goes below 3,000 points, she said.\n\n\"Telcos can still do okay, not fantastic, with 2 to 3 per cent earnings growth. Banks are still okay, with 5 to 7 per cent of growth quite possible. The only key vulnerability is property. But I think the market has already included that into expectations.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

During the year, the airport handled 53.7 million passengers, a 5 per cent increase over 2012, which had been yet another record-breaking year.\n\nAbout 31 per cent of Changi's total traffic came from low-cost carriers, up from less than 20 per cent just five years ago.\n\nThis year, Changi Airport is projecting a growth rate of 3-5 per cent in passenger throughput, given the large base from which it is starting and the outlook for macroeconomic conditions.\n\n\"We expect our passenger growth rates to moderate,\" said Jeffrey Ng, vice- president for air hub strategy at Changi Airport Group.\n\nThe airport also hit a new kind of milestone, busting the five million mark for passengers carried in a month with 5.12 million passengers in December - the first time it has done so in its 32-year history, Changi Airport Group said yesterday.\n\nIts daily record was also broken on the Saturday just before Christmas, during which 191,800 passengers and 1,100 flights were registered over 24 hours.\n\nDuring the year, Changi recorded a 5.9 per cent increase in the number of aircraft landings and take-offs, at 343,800.\n\nOn the cargo front, airfreight movements inched up less than one per cent to 1.85 million tonnes, reflecting the state of the cargo industry and the fact that \"general macroeconomic conditions are quite fragile\", said Mr Ng.\n\nChangi's robust volume of passenger traffic bumped it up from seventh to fifth position where the world's busiest airports are concerned, according to data from Airports Council International, which used passenger figures for the 12 months ended October 2013.\n\nIts biggest market remained Indonesia, with the South-east Asian region showing the biggest growth in traffic - an 8.2 per cent increase to 23.7 million passenger movements. Even so, passenger movement declines were seen in long- haul sectors, namely three regions: Europe, the Americas and Africas.\n\n\"Some of the long-haul airlines that have departed from Changi, we are now winning them back,\" said Lim Ching Kiat, senior vice- president, market development, at Changi Airport Group. He cited the return of Switzerland's national carrier Swiss last year as well as the impending return of Air New Zealand later this year.\n\nAt the same time, Ethiopian Airlines joined the fold last year, while Uzbekistan Airways will come onboard this year. \"Both of these (airlines), they plug the gaps in our network. Ethiopian Airlines brings a new connection to eastern and central Africa, (and) Uzbekistan Airways brings a new link into central Asia,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nOn the capacity front, more is being done between now and 2020 when the three-runway system is slated to be up.\n\nCiting a study done in 2012, which found that an additional 40 per cent in capacity could be found in the current two-runway system, Mr Lim said a work group had been formed to look at increasing efficiency to free up this capacity.\n\nThese measures will include better utilisation of runways and working with airlines to spread out flights more evenly, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Earnings per share worked out to 0.9 cent in the quarter, down from 1.7 cents a year earlier.\n\nOperating expenses climbed 10.6 per cent to $283.82 million mainly on higher staff and depreciation expenses. Staff costs rose 21.4 per cent to $119.63 million, while depreciation of property, plant and equipment climbed 10.2 per cent to $45.78 million.\n\nThe group's fare business suffered a $9 million operating loss, versus an operating profit of $7.4 million the previous year, as operating costs outpaced the growth in fare revenue.\n\nOperating profit for its train operations plummeted 97.2 per cent to $411,000, while LRT operations chalked up an operating loss of $578,000, widening from a loss of $301,000 previously.\n\nMeanwhile, its bus operations recorded an operating loss of $8.86 million, deepening from a loss of $7 million in the corresponding quarter a year earlier.\n\nHowever, its non-fare business - which comprises its taxi operations, rental business, advertising business as well as engineering and other services - registered a 6.1 per cent increase in operating profit to $27.3 million. The non-fare business was boosted largely by the rental and advertising businesses.\n\n\"Our fare business continues to face cost pressures arising from ongoing efforts to meet heightened demands on service, reliability and capacity,\" said SMRT chief executive Desmond Kuek, adding that the higher costs will be partly offset next year by the fare adjustments and efforts to boost productivity.\n\n\"We will continue to leverage on SMRT's core engineering competency and commercial expertise to support business expansion in both fare and non-fare businesses. Sports Hub is expected to commence operations within the next few months and we will continue to explore rail business opportunities overseas,\" Mr Kuek said.\n\nThe group ended the quarter with a cash balance of $127.8 million. Net gearing increased to 0.64 with the payment of 17 trains and operating assets taken over from the Land Transport Authority, up from 0.08 as at March 31, 2013.\n\nFor the nine months, net profit dropped 52.8 per cent to $45 million while revenue rose 4.3 per cent to $874.4 million. SMRT's net asset value per share was 51.6 cents, against 50.5 cents at end-March 2013. The counter ended one cent higher at $1.19 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The group reported $647.6 million in revenue for FY2013, up 7.6 per cent and exceeding its previous high of $623 million in 2006. Profit for the year grew 16.9 per cent to $101.6 million, exceeding the $100 million mark for the first time.\n\nEarnings per share for the last quarter and full year rose to 3.82 cents and 14.03 cents respectively, up from 3.11 cents and 11.85 cents a year earlier.\n\n\"We believe the journey to building a more significant business is just beginning only,\" said its chief financial officer, Peter Lee.\n\nAll three brands, OSIM, GNC and TWG Tea, contributed well to the group, he added. Around 80 per cent of the sales come from OSIM, with 20 per cent from the other two brands.\n\nOSIM continued to be the dominant brand with a majority market share in key markets, achieved through product innovation and productive execution, the company said.\n\nIts record profit before taxes was achieved mainly through increased sales of new products, Mr Lee said.\n\n\"We are quite confident in delivering ongoing multi-year improvements in both productivity and profitability,\" he said.\n\nThe group said it would continue its focus in Asia, targeting mid to high-end customers. North Asia remained the group's most significant market with 53 per cent of sales. In China, OSIM has 272 outlets in 45 cities. The group opened 24 outlets there and closed 30 underperforming outlets.\n\nChina remained a very good market with double-digit growth, said OSIM's founder and CEO Ron Sim. The group is focused on gaining productivity to have higher sales per store there, he added.\n\nThe directors have recommended a final dividend of two cents per share. The total dividends of FY2013 were six cents per share, the same as the previous year, which included a special dividend of two cents per share.\n\nOSIM shares closed four cents lower at $2.39 yesterday, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such anxiety also reflects the impact of the US Federal Reserve slowing its monetary stimulus at a time when parts of the emerging world are vulnerable.\n\nThis has seen falls in emerging market shares and currencies. Moreover, fears about exposure to the emerging world and a possible threat to global growth have seen share markets in advanced countries fall nearly 4 per cent over the past week.

He sees investment opportunities in the second half of the year.\n\n\"Putting into perspective the view for EMs and in particular Asia, we would position ourselves selectively towards late Q2 as signs of distress impact valuations within Asia,\" said Mr Natarajan.\n\n\"This theory is widely supported by the recent BofA Merrill Lynch Fund Manager survey; we are about to see EM capitulation; rarely have such bullish growth expectations mixed with such bleak EM weightings.\"\n\nEM assets performed poorly in 2013, he said. \"Moving into 2014, investors remain generally sceptical towards the region - this despite many of the concerns already being reflected in the current discount valuation levels.\n\n\"This broad-based scepticism has allowed for very little differentiation between robust and vulnerable economies.\"\n\nLooking ahead, he said that investors were likely to start differentiating better, especially with respect to external adjustment needs, exposure to weak commodity prices and sensitivity to the current uptick in global manufacturing trade.\n\n\"As such, we prefer structurally robust economies with export-led, growth-sensitive markets such as South Korea or China. We avoid structurally weak economies with a dependence on foreign capital such as Turkey and South Africa.\"\n\nChina's slowdown actually augurs well for the longer term, said Mark Matthews, Julius Baer head of research Asia. As the economy becomes less driven by state investment and more driven by private consumption, growth should gradually decline to the 6-7 per cent range, he said.\n\nMore private sector competition and less government \"silver spoon\" will force state-owned enterprises to become more efficient, and therefore more profitable, he said.\n\n\"All in all, given the still large valuation gap that exists for Chinese equities on forward earnings, an appreciating currency, along with plus 7 per cent growth rates that have seen the economy grow its share of global output to 12 per cent from 7 per cent since 2009, Chinese equities can offer attractive value in 2014.\"\n\nOn South-east Asia, Mr Matthews said that the big panic last summer swept out most of the weaker holders, and those who remain are more sanguine about owning South-east Asia, even in an environment where rates are rising.\n\nSouth-east Asia has very strong structural stories - large and youthful populations, growing middle classes, improving infrastructure and expanding intra-regional trade, he said.\n\n\"All these stories remain intact, but they are also somewhat old. With the US economy likely to grow between 3-4 per cent this year, Europe coming out of its recession, reform afoot in China, and Japan shaken out of its 20-year stupor, South-east Asia will remain sidelined by these bigger markets and newer stories.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The chances of offsetting this cost by restarting nuclear reactors idled in the wake of the Fukushima disaster have diminished because of the anti-nuclear sentiment in the country.\n\nThe emergence of former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa on an anti-nuclear ticket for the Feb 9 Tokyo gubernatorial election has further complicated the issue.\n\nSignificantly, Japan's Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga made no mention yesterday of bringing the reactors back on line when he drew attention to soaring energy costs.\n\nInstead, he said the government would seek to cut costs by promoting use of renewable energy and increasing imports of cheaper shale gas.\n\nHe was reported by Kyodo news agency as saying: \"Energy imports have been rising significantly since the nuclear accident, causing per-capita costs of around 30,000 yen in Japan. It is important for us to ease such a burden as much as possible.\"\n\nAnother factor pushing up imports costs in Japan has been a rise in demand for various consumer goods ahead of the scheduled hike in the national consumption tax from its current level of 5 per cent to 8 per cent from April 1.\n\nThe total value of Japanese imports jumped by 15 per cent last year to a record 81.26 trillion yen; this was the fourth straight year of increase.\n\nThe total value of imported liquefied natural gas surged 17.5 per cent and that for crude oil, 16.3 per cent, the Ministry of Finance said.\n\nMeanwhile, the value of exports rose by 9.5 per cent last year to 69.79 trillion yen in the first rise in three years on the back of the yen's depreciation.\n\nThe overall trade balance was in deficit for a third successive year.\n\nShipments to China, Japan's biggest trade partner, rose by 9.7 per cent to 12.6 trillion yen in 2013; imports from there went up by 17.4 per cent to a record 17.7 trillion yen, Kyodo said.\n\nExports to the European Union rose by 8 per cent to seven trillion yen, but imports from there rose by 15 per cent to 7.7 trillion yen.\n\nJapanese shipments to the United States, where the economy has been picking up, expanded by 16 per cent to 13 trillion yen, while imports rose by 12 per cent to 6.8 trillion yen.\n\nIn December alone, Japan's trade balance racked up a deficit of 1.30 trillion yen, marking a record for the month and the 18th consecutive monthly deficit, Kyodo said.\n\nJapan's current account balance has also moved into deficit in recent months.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The restructuring will cut debt by more than US$600 million, Excel said in a statement.\n\nThe company should exit court protection by mid-February. Secured lenders who are owed about US$765 million will get new debt securities of US$300 million and about 83 per cent of the reorganised company's equity, according to the company's disclosure statement, a description of the plan. The lenders voted unanimously in favour of the plan.\n\nExcel's general unsecured creditors will receive about 8 per cent of the reorganised company's equity and the right to buy more for US$10 million, court papers show. The creditors will have the right to buy 1.5 per cent of the stock for US$16.25 a share and 1.4 per cent for US$17.25 a share. The unsecured creditors voted 92 per cent in support of the plan.\n\nThe reorganised Excel is projected to have an estimated enterprise value of US$605 million to US$655 million, according to court documents.\n\nExisting management, led by Gabriel Panayotides, will remain following Excel's exit from bankruptcy protection, with Mr Panayotides as chief executive officer, according to court filings.\n\nIvory Shipping, a company owned by members of Panayotides's family, will have the opportunity to buy 7.1 per cent to 10.1 per cent of the new Excel stock for US$25-35 million, court papers show.\n\nExcel listed assets of US$2.7 billion and debt of more than US$1 billion in a Chapter 11 petition filed in July.\n\nThe Athens-based company, which ships commodities including iron ore, coal and grains, said in June that it was forced to seek court protection by \"macro-economic conditions that have led to volatility and overall declines in charter rates\".\n\nMeanwhile, Freedom Industries, the chemical company whose leaky storage tank polluted the Elk River, reached a consent agreement with West Virginia's Department of Environmental Protection to remove materials from tanks at its Charleston plant.\n\nOn Jan 9, West Virginia officials discovered the leak from a tank of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, a chemical used in coal processing, which compromised the water for about 300,000 people and sent more than 100 to the hospital.\n\nIn another development, Global Aviation Holdings, the biggest charter-flight company for US troops, won court approval to hold a March 19 auction with its lender as the lead bidder.\n\nUS bankruptcy judge Mary Walrath approved bidding procedures governing the sale of virtually all the company's assets, according to court documents filed yesterday in Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nGlobal Aviation will seek court approval to sell the assets to the auction winner at a hearing scheduled for March 25. Its lender, Cerberus Business Finance, offered to sponsor a bankruptcy plan if it wins the auction and buy the assets through the forgiveness of debt, court documents showed.\n\nIn November, the company filed for bankruptcy for the second time in less than two years. Global Aviation previously went into bankruptcy in February 2012, saying it needed to shed more than half of its aircraft and citing the end of flights to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe following year, the company said, it \"continued to encounter various financial and operational hurdles, including decreased demand for military cargo and passenger services resulting from government budget constraints\". In its most recent bankruptcy petition, Global Aviation listed assets and liabilities of as much as US$1 billion each. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

ASL's existing Indonesia shipyard stretches across 35 hectares with three graving docks, two building berths and five fabrication shops.\n\nAccording to ASL, the proposed acquisition is in line with the group's overall strategy and its proximity to the group's existing premises will provide \"a good opportunity to expand its capacity and berthing space to support the growing demand for shiprepair and upgrading of ships and other floating structures\".\n\n\"The additional shipyard will also supplement the revenue stream of the group, and strengthen its ability to service customers in the South Asia region,\" said ASL.\n\nManagement also said the purchase price was arrived at on a willing buyer, willing seller basis and after a valuation report by property valuer KJPP, Sarwono, Indrastuti & Rekan estimated a market value of 310.6 billion rupiah (S$33 million).\n\nThe sale remains conditional upon the grant of a permit to transfer the property and a confirmation that the property is free from dispute.\n\nASL Marine's shipbuilding division gross profits increased by 54 per cent to $59 million in FY13, and accounted for 70 per cent of the group's FY13 gross profits of $84 million.\n\nGross profit margin improved significantly from 16 per cent in FY2012 to 29.4 per cent in FY2013 due to the write-back of subcontractor costs for prior year projects. Excluding the write-back, gross profit margin would have been 22 per cent in FY13.\n\nASL Marine's outstanding shipbuilding order book amounted to $370 million for 28 vessels, comprising mainly offshore service vessels, anchor handlers, dredges, tugs and barges.\n\nMiclyn had previously used the Batam shipyard to build, convert and customise vessels and service its fleet based in South-east Asia.\n\nIn its last available earnings update on the shipyard, the group made a US$4.2 million profit and revenue of US$16.6 million from the shipyard in FY12.\n\nWith the sale, the offshore services group will focus on its vessel chartering business.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/emerging-markets-no-big-threat", "site_title": "Emerging markets no big threat", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEmerging markets no big threat\n\nEconomists say developed countries can withstand last week's sell-offs and the pain will be limited to a few unbalanced economies\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jan 28, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nEMERGING markets aren't yet sneezing enough for the rest of the world to catch a cold. That's the diagnosis of economists from Deutsche Bank to Nomura International after the stocks of developing nations suffered their worst start to a year in five, raising concerns they are turning from the driver of global growth to a drag.\n\nThe optimistic take is the pain will be limited to a few unbalanced economies - including Turkey and Argentina - with little heft abroad, and developed countries now have domestic sources of growth and support from central banks. The risk is that slowdowns and sell-offs deepen in bigger economies, such as China, infecting the financial markets of industrial nations and depriving them of demand for exports and commodities.\n\n\"We view the past week as more a warning\" about what could happen \"should contagion become more entrenched and broadbased across emerging markets\", said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Nomura in London. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is down 7.1 per cent since Dec 31, compared with a 3.4 per cent decline for the MSCI World Index. Equity volatility in developing nations jumped the most in two years last week amid a sell-off in their currencies, with the Chicago Board Options Exchange Emerging Markets ETF Volatility Index rising 40 per cent to 28.26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe threats posed by developing nations are attracting debate, given these countries now account for almost 40 per cent of the world's gross domestic product, up from 18 per cent two decades ago. They also served as the world economy's engine when the West was reeling from the crisis of 2008 and subsequent recession and European debt woes.\n\n\"A broader emerging market crisis today would come with much greater ramifications\" for growth worldwide, said Michala Marcussen, global head of economics in London at Societe Generale.\n\nEven before last week's tumult, the International Monetary Fund estimated the growth gap between emerging and developed economies is the smallest since 2001, and IHS Inc calculated the one-time locomotives would contribute the least this year to worldwide expansion since 2010.\n\nThe concern is the rot lasts, adding a new challenge to a still-fragile world, even though the global economy has changed from the late 1990s - when crises from Asia to Latin America riled international markets - and is stronger after the financial turbulence of six years ago, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in London.\n\nThe US and UK are gathering strength, the euro region has emerged from its own slump, and central banks continue to keep interest rates at or near record lows. Rich countries have escaped contagion before.\n\nWhen Asia was roiled in the 1990s, US growth topped 4 per cent in 1997 and 1998, and the eurozone managed more than 2.5 per cent expansion each year. This means stress could be limited to countries with high current account deficits, political unrest or a reliance on commodities.\n\nBrazil, Indonesia, India, Turkey, Ukraine and South Africa are among nations meeting some or all of these characteristics. Argentina also falls in this category and began devaluing its peso on Jan 22 in a bid to stem a financial crisis. \"By the standards of emerging market crises, we do not expect this to be a particularly bad one,\" Mr Schmieding said.\n\nThe outlook would change if turbulence became longer-lasting and more widespread. That would put the US at risk, because emerging markets now drive 15 per cent of the sales of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, with China accounting for a third of that percentage, according to Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank.\n\nStill, the US domestic economy is improving, and it would take a more substantial stock market decline for the Federal Reserve to reconsider the plan it signalled in December to keep cutting monthly asset purchases from an original US$85 billion a month. \"Our central expectation is while US markets could take a temporary hit, the shock will not be a major one for the US economy,\" Mr Slok said.\n\nThe S&P 500 is down 3.6 per cent since Dec 31 after rising about 30 per cent last year. GDP grew at a 4.1 per cent annual pace in the third quarter after expanding 1.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent in the first and second.\n\nCornerstone Macro also isn't expecting the Fed to respond to recent market volatility - which some investors say the central bank's policies have exacerbated. Cornerstone economists told clients on Monday the Fed will continue slowing its quantitative easing after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, partly because officials ignore short-term market fluctuations and don't yet see a full-blown emerging market meltdown on the horizon.\n\n\"There is a big difference between isolated severe difficulties and a widespread crisis: The former don't change the outlook for the US economy much, while the latter does,\" Cornerstone said. \"For now, the Fed most likely thinks we are in the former situation, so no course change is warranted.\"\n\nSimilarly, Europe's recovery likely would be impaired only if a pervasive slowdown took hold in emerging markets, Nomura's Mr Cailloux said. That's even though the 18-country euro bloc has been lifted by developing nation demand in the last few years.\n\nNomura's calculations show that a protracted slump in Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela and Turkey would knock about 0.1 percentage point off euro-area growth, given they account for about 3 per cent of the region's exports. Spain may be in greater jeopardy because of its closer trade and banking ties with Latin America. \"There's no particular reason that Europe should be affected by the problems encountered by a small number of countries,\" Bank of France governor Christian Noyer said on Monday.\n\nMs Marcussen of Societe Generale cautions there still are reasons to worry about the outlook for emerging nations, though they now boast more flexible currencies, stronger trade positions, larger reserves and more-developed markets than in previous decades.\n\nChina's economy is the world's second largest, and its share of global GDP has jumped to 14 per cent from 4 per cent in two decades, she said. That's a problem if it struggles to refocus demand toward domestic sources, especially after a report last week showed manufacturing may contract for the first time in six months.\n\nLarge imbalances and poor policy choices that drove past crises also are prevalent in Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, Peru, South Africa, Ukraine, Turkey and Thailand, she said. Add Brazil, Indonesia, India and Russia, which have weak spots, and 13 per cent of global GDP are in question, says Ms Marcussen.\n\nThe outlook ultimately may pivot on how China fares, said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at HSBC Holdings.

The only thing standing in the way: a law dating back to the 1930s.\n\nIndia's aviation regulator invoked a provision under its Aircraft Rules 1937, for the first time, asking for public feedback on an application by an airline to start services in the country. That delayed plans for AirAsia, which had aimed to start operations by the end of December and offer free tickets for some seats.\n\n\"This is unfortunate, unwarranted and sets a dangerous precedent,\" said Amber Dubey, a Gurgaon, India-based partner at consultancy KPMG. \"Granting of airline licences cannot be done through opinion polls.\"\n\nThe regulator invoking a rule after the aviation ministry gave an initial go-ahead shows the difficulties companies face in India, ranked 134th out of 189 countries by the World Bank in June for ease of doing business. Policy flip-flops, disputes and delays for approvals have made Posco wait for about nine years to start a US$12 billion steel complex and caused tax squabbles for Vodafone Group Plc.\n\nIndia's Ministry of Civil Aviation gave AirAsia a so-called \"No Objection Certificate\" in September. That followed a March approval from India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board. The carrier, which announced its foray in February last year, needs other approvals such as an air operators' licence before it can start flights in the country.\n\nPrabhat Kumar, the director general of civil aviation who issues the final flying permit for an airline, said on Jan 15 the notice seeking any objections or suggestions from public on AirAsia's venture was issued to comply with the law.\n\nAviation Minister Ajit Singh said the same day that the notice is part of the process and doesn't mean a delay for the airline, which has already won preliminary approvals from India's foreign investment regulator and Mr Singh's ministry.\n\n\"It's particularly unusual,\" CAPA Centre for Aviation, which advises airlines, said in a Jan 16 report. \"Any public representations should have been raised at the earlier No Objection Certificate stage. The unpredictability and lack of transparency in India's regulatory framework continues to be the greatest strategic challenge in the market.\" If approvals are delayed until mid-year, a start as late as October can't be ruled out for the venture, CAPA said.\n\nMalaysia-based AirAsia expects India's approvals are imminent and flights are slated for as soon as March, its chief executive officer Tony Fernandes said in an interview in London on Jan 17. The airline declined to comment further.\n\nAirAsia will give give away a few seats for free when it starts flying, Mr Fernandes said last year. The CEO has said ticket prices will be the \"No. 1 differentiator\" in India.\n\nAccording to the law, the director general may in his discretion give \"an opportunity to the person or persons making representations against the application to appear before him\". The aviation regulator gave 30 days for the public to submit their feedback on AirAsia India, according to the notice initially issued on Jan 13. The company's application will be taken up after 30 days of the notice's issue.\n\nIndia ranks behind Ethiopia and Uganda when it comes to the ease of doing business, according to a World Bank report. The country is listed at 179th for starting a business.\n\nBureaucrats, unnerved by earlier graft probes that beset Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government, are trying to ensure their decisions don't lead to any controversy later, said Rajan Mehra, India head of Universal Weather and Aviation, a US-based business aviation trip management firm.\n\n\"After the string of scandals, the government is certainly in no mood for any further controversy,\" said Mr Mehra, who previously was a general manager for Qatar Airways's India operations. \"So they are keeping all their bases covered.\"\n\nAirAsia and Singapore Airlines Ltd have both tied up with India's Tata Group for separate ventures while Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways PJSC has bought a stake in Jet Airways (India) Ltd after the government eased investment rules in September 2012. They are seeking to tap a market where passenger numbers are forecast to triple to 452 million by 2020.\n\nAirAsia India will be based in the southern city of Chennai, and the budget carrier will fly Airbus A320 aircraft mainly to smaller cities. Mr Fernandes has said he is aiming to attract passengers from the about one million people who take trains every day in the country.\n\nThe carrier is the latest example of companies facing government delays and complex rules in India, which needs more investments to support growth and improve the livelihood of its 825 million people living on less than US$2 a day.\n\nPosco, South Korea's biggest steelmaker, is yet to start construction of its US$12 billion plant in the eastern Odisha state, which the company first proposed in 2005.\n\nEarlier this month, billionaire Anil Agarwal's Vedanta Resources Plc was stopped from mining in a hill range that holds bauxite earmarked for an US$8.1 billion aluminum complex following protests by local tribes, who say their God lives there.\n\nVodafone is battling Indian authorities over a US$2.2 billion tax claim for its 2007 acquisition of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd's local unit.\n\nAfter the nation's top court ruled in 2012 that the mobile phone operator isn't liable to pay the tax, the government unveiled an amendment to the law retrospectively to cross-border transactions dating back to April 1, 1962.\n\n\"India is increasingly being seen as a country where regulations are being pulled out of the hat and different government departments don't seem to be in sync,\" Universal Weather's Mr Mehra said.\n\n\"This move will further shake investors who are planning to enter the country.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The assessment of Singapore's existing regulation framework came in the face of recent liberalisation, which has drawn in more foreign-qualified lawyers and international interest.\n\nThe Ministry of Law said it has accepted these recommendations, which will likely make up legislative amendments to the Legal Profession Act. The proposed changes should be implemented by next year.\n\n\"The legal sector is evolving to meet the changing and increasingly varied needs of international trade and business,\" said Beh Swan Gin, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Law, in a press statement.\n\n\"We believe that the recommendations will enable Singapore's regulatory regime to keep pace with and, where possible, anticipate these changes so that the legal sector maintains its high professional standards even as it continues to grow as a high-value segment of the economy.\"\n\nThe committee, which was set up two years ago and chaired by then Attorney-General Sundaresh Menon, had deliberated on the use of alternative business structures for law firms, which are prevalent in parts of Australia and the United Kingdom.\n\nIt recommended that Singapore should allow a legal disciplinary practice (LDP) model, under which approved non-lawyer managers or employees can own equity of up to 25 per cent and share in the profits of an LDP.\n\nIn a report, the committee noted that there has been pressure on the local regulatory structure, as law firms from Australia and the UK with alternative business structures have tried, but failed, to register in Singapore in their original form.\n\n\"This pressure may also increase as SLPs (Singapore legal practices) look outward,\" said the report, adding that Singapore law firms may wish to tie up with foreign practices that have an alternative business structure in their home jurisdiction.\n\nKevin Wong, a partner at Linklaters Singapore, noted that this was something that was poised to happen, with lawyers needing to rope in specialists such as actuaries, tax accountants and economists.\n\nBut the committee stopped short of embracing a multi-disciplinary practice (MDP) model, which would allow a law firm to offer both legal and other services such as auditing. The committee saw no first- mover advantage in this area, noting that MDPs may create uncertainty over the lead regulator for such an evolved animal.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of a more liberalised legal industry, the committee has also proposed to close a regulatory gap between disciplinary rules for lawyers practising local law and those practising foreign law, who now make up about 20 per cent of the total lawyer population here.\n\nThose in the latter group, known as foreign- qualified lawyers, should soon come under the same disciplinary process - which includes facing a review and inquiry committee, as well as a disciplinary tribunal - that the remaining lawyers in Singapore undergo. The exception is that a foreign-qualified lawyer will be part of each relevant committee and tribunal at each stage of the disciplinary process.\n\nCurrently, foreign-qualified lawyers do not go through a formal disciplinary process. \"It was an odd situation, which the recommendations are going to address,\" said Mr Wong.\n\nA set of professional conduct rules will be updated, and applied to all lawyers here. These rules, which do not apply to foreign-qualified lawyers now, will be overseen by a professional conduct council.\n\nThe committee also recommended a new regulatory body, the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA), which will regulate business criteria for law practice entities. Relevant regulatory functions currently carried out by the Law Society of Singapore for Singapore law practices, and the Attorney-General's Chambers for foreign law practices, will be transferred to the LSRA.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bridge Alliance operates through Bridge Mobile Pte Ltd, in which SingTel has an effective equity interest of 33.8 per cent, as of its last annual report.\n\nWhile the Bridge Alliance has 31 operators as partners, its M2M iteration has 11 Asia-Pacific telcos, such as Airtel (India), AIS (Thailand), CSL (Hong Kong), Globe Telecom (Philippines), Maxis (Malaysia) and SingTel.\n\n\"Together, the group serves a combined base of over 500 million subscribers, making it the largest M2M alliance in the Asia Pacific region,\" Bridge Alliance said yesterday.\n\nThis alliance will offer M2M services in aggregate, doing away with the need to deal with multiple operators.\n\nCurrently, some multinational corporations use one operator that acts as an intermediary, leasing data usage from different operators in each country for products that need to be connected to the Internet, such as cars with computer chips and personal reading devices.\n\nBridge Alliance's approach, which touts \"significant commercial benefits and economies of scale\", will challenge the role of such an intermediary, at least for this region.\n\n\"Asia Pacific is made up of highly varied economies, uneven technological development and diversified regulatory requirements. As a result, multinational businesses find it extremely difficult to navigate the intricacies of the region and to fully capitalise on economies of scale,\" said Alessandro Adriani, CEO of Bridge Alliance.\n\n\"The evolution of Bridge Alliance in the M2M business is an indication of the commitment from the 11 operators to overcome these challenges for the success of customers' businesses.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

An increase in the quality of ore, from 1.1 grams a tonne to 2.4 grams, helped to offset the drop in resources in tonnage terms.\n\nBut reserves - the part of resources deemed commercially viable to extract - now appear less. While the earlier report stated probable reserves of 18.9 million tonnes at 1.3 grams per tonne for 787,000 ounces, new estimates now put it at 9.1 million tonnes at 2.4 grams for 701,000 ounces, an 11 per cent decrease in ounces terms.\n\nNevertheless, the higher ore quality enables the company to build a plant with smaller throughput for a similar production in ounces per year, LionGold said.\n\nThe first phase of the project involves a plant processing 0.55 million tonnes per annum (mtpa), using either a gravity or a leaching method to recover the gold. This will produce some 30,000 ounces of gold a year for the first three years, with a capital cost of US$37.4 million.\n\nIn the fourth year, LionGold will expand its mining and equipment fleet, as well as its gold processing plant, to process 1.55 mtpa from the fifth year. At this stage, it will produce an average of 95,000 ounces of gold each year for four years, at US$130.3 million.\n\nIn all, LionGold will spend about US$167.7 million in capital expenditure for 616,000 ounces of gold.\n\nBased on a higher gold price assumption of US$1,300 an ounce, compared with the earlier assumption of US$1,020, free cash generated from the project is estimated to be US$269 million, up from US$137 million.\n\nNet present value and the internal rate of return from the project also grows to US$110 million and 38 per cent, respectively, from US$81.7 million and 17 per cent.\n\nThe company is now evaluating bids for the design and construction of the processing plant, and expects production to start next year.\n\nLionGold acquired the owner of the mine, Minera Nueva Vista, in December 2012.

The extent of both cases of infringement and the quantum of damages will be assessed by the Singapore High Court, if not agreed by both parties.\n\nCryoviva will also pay Cordlife the total costs of the suit to date and the injunction application, if not agreed by both parties. A Cordlife spokesman said that as the company had yet to receive the billing from its legal advisers, it was unable to comment on suit costs.\n\nEarlier this month, Cordlife claimed that Cryoviva had \"deliberately and wilfully\" used Cordlife's proprietary information and intellectual property (IP) on Cryoviva's trial and actual websites, which included references to \"Cordlife\" and \"Cordlife Care360\u00b0 Safeguard Programme\", without Cordlife's knowledge or consent. On Jan 22, Cordlife started a suit in the High Court against Cryoviva and filed the injunction application to, among other things, restrain Cryoviva from continual infringement of Cordlife's IP rights. Since Jan 23, both of Cryoviva's websites have been taken down and are no longer in operation.\n\nOn Jan 24, the injunction application was placed before the High Court. Cryoviva responded with a \"Without Prejudice\" offer, and both parties agreed to resolve the matter without conducting a full hearing.\n\n\"The outcome has served to protect Cordlife's reputation and goodwill. It does not wish to be associated with a company new to Singapore and with no track record here,\" Cordlife said.\n\nSaid Cordlife's chief executive officer Jeremy Yee: \"Over the years, we have built up our reputation and earned the trust of parents to store their babies' precious cord blood with us. As such, it is imperative to ensure that our clients' trust in us is maintained and not misrepresented by other parties.\"\n\nIn a separate statement, Cryoviva said that it had promptly addressed the issue and removed the webpages in question after being alerted to them. \"Cryoviva Singapore cooperated fully in the case and took appropriate and swift action against its website vendor for the vendor's lapses. Cryoviva Singapore has not deliberately infringed on the IP rights of Cordlife and has also observed all legal requirements to ensure a prompt, smooth and amicable settlement.\"\n\nCordlife shares closed 0.83 per cent lower at $1.195 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Moreover, 2014 has been designated Visit Malaysia Year.\n\nDespite the double-digit rise in arrivals, MAHB's full-year earnings dipped 1.3 per cent from a year ago to about RM389 million (S$149 million).\n\nIn the last quarter, its earnings fell 38 per cent to RM48.5 million, mainly as a result of a 137 per cent jump in user fee, higher employee benefit expenses, depreciation and amortisation, and the impairment of investment in an associate company.\n\nFor the full year, its revenue rose 15.5 per cent to slightly over RM4 billion. Earnings per share dipped to 31.73 sen from 33.24 sen.\n\nThe company saw its operating costs spike by nearly 28 per cent.

In the corresponding period last year, the share of profit from Wing Tai Properties included one-off gains from the disposal of its apparel branded business and its listed subsidiary in Hong Kong.\n\nFor the half year, net profit was 55 per cent lower at $73 million, while revenue declined 17 per cent to $470.4 million.\n\nWing Tai noted in its financial statement that successive rounds of property cooling measures and the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) have caused demand for new residential units in Singapore to be \"adversely impacted\".\n\n\"The group will monitor the market closely and will at appropriate times launch new residential projects for sale in the current year,\" said Wing Tai.

Should the $75 million market capitalisation threshold be raised or should Singapore revert to half- yearly statements?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 26, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPhilip Yuen\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nDeloitte Singapore\n\nWE acknowledge that quarterly reporting does inflict costs on companies. However, weighing the costs and benefits is complex as there are many facets with varying degrees of impact.\n\nRather than eliminating it, standard setters could design or enhance standards flexible enough to be responsive to the costs and benefits companies face in different circumstances.\n\nWe believe that quarterly reporting helps shareholders identify, on a timely basis, changes and trends affecting a company. The absence of this means a lag to users that often arise from annual reporting. Quarterly reporting also reduces trading on inside information especially in the securities markets and should further be retained for listed companies. The current market capitalisation threshold at $75million is sufficiently high and in alignment with global standards.\n\nOlivia Lum\n\nChairman & Group CEO\n\nHyflux Ltd\n\nFINANCIAL scandals in recent years have cast a spotlight on the adequacy of company disclosure. While I support greater transparency in keeping shareholders informed of material developments in the companies in which they have invested, the value of quarterly financial reporting is certainly debatable. The pressure to consistently produce financial results quarter after quarter will inevitably lead to short-term trade-offs at the expense of long-term goals. There are many examples of newly-minted CEOs who cut research and development (R&D) budgets in favour of immediate higher profits, sacrificing future revenue streams in the process.\n\nQuarterly financial performance could also be misleading in some industries where revenue streams are project-based and consequently \"lumpy\", depending on the project cycle. This is common in the construction industry where a \"dry\" quarter between projects may not necessarily imply a gloomy outlook. In my view, both management and investors should be encouraged to take a longer-term view of a company's performance.\n\nHalf-yearly reporting provides a good balance but needs to be supplemented by timely disclosures of material developments. Resources saved from the elimination of quarterly reporting could also be channelled towards improving the bottom line.\n\nTan Chong Huat\n\nManaging Partner\n\nRHTLaw Taylor Wessing\n\nTHE merits and drawbacks of quarterly reporting have been dissected and laid out by commentators over the last decade. There has not, however, been international consensus on whether it is ultimately a boon or a bane. I believe that a more enlightened approach to this matter lies away from the question of whether quarterly or half-yearly reporting is more appropriate.\n\nAt the core, investors need timely, meaningful and accurate disclosures to make informed decisions. So I would suggest going back to basics. Efforts should instead be focused on the provision of timely and high-quality information to investors to assist in their investment decisions. The legislative framework is already in place. Perhaps we should look at carrots, rather than wielding the stick. More can be done to encourage listed companies to continuously disclose price-sensitive information, perhaps by recognising and rewarding firms that consistently do so.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nTRANSPARENCY and timely disclosure of relevant and reliable financial information are integral to strong corporate governance that underpins a robust capital markets ecosystem. Reversing the rule on quarterly financial reporting is akin to taking a step backward in embedding this fundamental principle. The key is to have an effective financial reporting system in place such that timely management reports are available and the cost of quarterly reporting minimised. The shortening of economic cycles and rapid changes in business environments suggest that a quarterly reporting frequency is reasonable.\n\nMeanwhile, when viewing a company's quarterly results, market participants must not just focus on short-term performance but recognise the company's longer-term outlook to assess its potential. As integrated reporting begins to pick up momentum, leading companies can endeavour to also include non-financial information in these quarterly reports, which will be valued by stakeholders.\n\nYong Yean Chau\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nParkway Trust Management Limited\n\nGIVEN the developments in Britain and the European Union, perhaps it is timely to consider fine-tuning the reporting requirement in Singapore to enhance not only corporate governance practices but also the market's understanding of businesses. Requiring listed companies - especially those with small market capitalisations - to report on a quarterly basis may skew perceptions on their financial performance. Due to business cycles unique to certain industries, it would be inaccurate to benchmark companies' performance solely on the quarterly reports.\n\nBetter appreciation of companies' financial performance can be achieved only when the investing community takes into consideration the nature of the industries in which the companies operate. But as an avenue for shareholders to keep abreast of the financial health and corporate developments of listed companies, quarterly financial reporting ensures greater transparency and good corporate governance, and could still be maintained for big caps.\n\nMark Billington FCA\n\nRegional Director - South East Asia\n\nICAEW\n\nTHERE are downsides to quarterly reporting, which is why the EU has decided not to employ it. There have been suggestions that it promotes short-termist views, gearing companies to the next set of figures rather than the bigger picture. Where businesses are cyclical, it might encourage an unrealistic picture - pessimistic in lean months but over-optimistic in boom times. More reporting also increases compliance costs, and could leave the finance professionals responsible overworked and under-resourced, affecting quality.\n\nBut there are benefits. Quarterly reporting delivers timely information to markets and compels company management to regularly review performance and adjust accordingly. It is also claimed that it promotes greater equality for minor investors, who may not command senior executives' attention to the same extent as major ones. And there is the issue of competitiveness in terms of transparency with neighbouring countries.\n\nUltimately, it is for each country to decide the reporting schedule most appropriate for its businesses. Quality is more important than frequency; regular reporting only helps users if it is of high quality.\n\nChris Wei\n\nGroup CEO\n\nGreat Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd\n\nAS Singapore's only public-listed insurance company, Great Eastern places top priority in providing relevant and accurate information to all our stakeholders in a timely and transparent manner. Insurance is a long-term business with long-term policy liabilities that must be backed by long-term assets. Our customers and shareholders place their trust in us for the long haul. In cognizance of this, we take a longer term view vis-\u00e0-vis our corporate strategies and investment decisions, which could extend over multiple decades.\n\nPerhaps it is timely to consider different strokes for different folks. Given that the insurance business is best measured on a long-term basis, quarterly reports may not necessarily be useful for measuring the company's real progress, particularly in today's environment where investment markets tend to be more volatile and results may be impacted by significant mark-to-market adjustments.\n\nHalf-yearly reporting does not necessarily translate to a reduction in transparency. Perhaps an alternate approach worth some consideration is semi-annual reporting supplemented by quarterly update reports, with key metrics that demonstrate how the company is managing its annual operating cycle.\n\nPeter Hill\n\nManaging Director\n\nSimCorp Asia\n\nIN a cut-throat market, many financial institutions are gearing up for growth and require a process that can scale and grow as business develops. The pace of change is bound to continue unabated and the industry must prepare for further changes such as tighter regulations, introduction of new financial instruments, entry into new markets and increasing transaction volumes.\n\nWhile financial reporting will effectively promote transparency, the lack of reliable financial tools will produce flawed data. Therefore, aligning technology and operational processes is critical to investment management success. If a company lacks good operational processes and data, there won't be a strong foundation on which to rest investment decision making. Consequently, executives end up making decisions based on faulty information. There's much talk about the need for sophisticated portfolio attribution capabilities. However, ultimately, if institutions lack good operational processes resulting in accurate data being fed into these tools, these attempts to encourage transparency for better decision making will be futile.\n\nRon Sim\n\nChairman & CEO\n\nOsim International\n\nCORPORATE governance and compliance are important but quarterly reporting does not help boost compliance; in fact, it takes away too much of the CEO's and CFO's time and causes them to be short-termist, focused on the wrong things. I'd say that quarterly reporting could undermine the long-term performance of Singapore companies.\n\nIt is not a matter of just costs. Indeed, market capitalisation is irrelevant if you are talking about compliance. In fact, the smaller the company, the bigger the risks. The bottom line is: Big or small, companies should not have to do quarterly reporting. It should be a voluntary, not mandatory, report. Quarterly reporting makes it more difficult for companies to manage long-term strategies, and does not necessarily make one a better or more compliant company. It is about honesty and cultivating investor ties. Have we not learned to be better companies in view of market happenings in the US and Europe?\n\nLet's be practical - the man in the street can easily get reports from analysts or brokers. Serious investors would certainly do their homework on the company and its management team and financial track record. So where are the merits of quarterly reporting ?\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nGIVEN the trending changes in legislation and corporate governance, more transparent financial reporting is continually being brought into focus. The global financial crisis has affected people's trust and confidence significantly. In today's environment, organisations are required to uphold good governance and transparent financial reporting in order to satisfy public scrutiny. I believe that these pressures will not go away anytime soon. Timely financial reporting is one way for companies to enhance transparency and increase investor confidence.\n\nFrom our position as an independent adviser to many large organisations and boards, I think that the advantages of quarterly reporting outweigh the shortcomings, especially for large corporates. Quarterly reporting helps improve transparency and timelines in financial reporting and maintain overall corporate governance in Singapore. In addition, independent reviews, if done on a quarterly basis, will help keep board members updated and reassured on the company's reporting controls to better mitigate financial and operational risks. The independent reviews will also enhance investor confidence. However, the likely increase in compliance costs may be taxing for smaller companies, but the benefits would outweigh the costs, especially for the larger listed companies.\n\nWith the revised SGX mainboard listing requirements in 2012 being raised to the minimum market capitalisation of $150 million, it would also make sense to increase the threshold for quarterly reporting from $75 million to $150 million.\n\nAllen Ang\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd\n\nSOME investors and commentators may argue that quarterly reporting imposes compliance discipline and enforces more transparency on the dealings of listed companies. But no one can argue that quarterly financial reporting is both onerous and costly for companies of every size. Yet some companies voluntarily provide quarterly financial reports for better investor relations.\n\nIn the final analysis, the yardstick for evaluating the merits of quarterly financial reporting is the benefit to investors. Some studies have shown that the quarterly reporting regime tends to induce greater capital market volatility than semi-annual reporting, although the degree of volatility varies from market to market. I doubt that there is any clear-cut evidence, quantitative or qualitative, to offer a definitive answer to what is the best reporting regime. I suggest that quarterly reports be made optional for listed companies.\n\nMagnus Bocker\n\nCEO\n\nSGX\n\nQUARTERLY financial reporting has been an ongoing global debate for a while, and some reports even question whether quarterly reporting has contributed to short-termism and should be revised. We at SGX are closely monitoring this debate and its relevance and impact to our market. With the backdrop of changes in legislation and regulations, there has been significant improvements in corporate governance practice and disclosure standards since the introduction of quarterly financial reporting a decade ago. We also note that some European jurisdictions have already revised the quarterly reporting regime.\n\nWe will therefore continue to engage our investors, listed companies and other stakeholders to listen to their needs, as part of our ongoing commitment to enhance the quality of our markets. We remain steadfast in our ongoing commitment in enhancing the quality of our markets. There isn't anything more important than to safeguard the best interests of our investors.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nQUARTERLY reporting puts tremendous pressure on companies to deliver good results. Because of this persistent pressure, companies are sometimes forced to do \"unnatural\" things just to deliver the numbers. This cannot be good for shareholders, as it often distorts the market and hurts the company in the long term. As an example, to maximise revenue and to improve profitability, companies often compromise in the areas of revenue recognition and capitalisation of development expenses. There are many lessons that we can learn from NYSE and Nasdaq. Both exchanges have an entrenched culture of quarterly reporting. Many shareholders of Enron and Lucent had been unfortunate victims of this culture in the past.\n\nIn my opinion, half-yearly statements are sufficient. Shareholders should take a long-term view of their investments, as opposed to being short-term driven or being speculative. There are already sufficient provisions for companies to disclose material developments to keep shareholders informed. Companies that do well and can sustain growth often follow a regime of strict compliance with corporate governance and financial regulations or acts. Shareholders and the market should insist on this rather than quarterly reporting, as this is the best insurance to protect their investments.\n\nJames Stewart\n\nGeneral Manager, Compliance, APAC\n\nWolters Kluwer Financial Services\n\nINCREASED transparency through regular financial reporting and disclosure to the market is, on balance, always a positive. For financial services firms, the lack of transparency of capital and liquidity positions in banks was a direct contributor to the global financial crisis. To avoid a future crisis, the regulatory reporting requirements introduced via new initiatives such as Basel 3 are leading to more complex, expansive and, in many cases, more frequent reporting to regulators. Banks today submit reports to regulators as frequently as daily or even intra-day, and additionally conduct frequent internal reporting processes for management purposes. Recognising these reporting requirements, banks are investing in systems that support the collection of reporting data that can then be used as the basis for all reporting. Automated processes that are built on top of the new reporting infrastructure are helping banks to reduce their compliance costs and improve their controls.\n\nLessons from the financial services industry have thus shown that maintaining regular reporting to both internal and external stakeholders is crucial, and the associated ongoing costs of regular reporting can be mitigated through optimising systems within all corporations.\n\nTom Evrard\n\nManaging Director\n\nFTI Consulting Strategic Communications Singapore\n\nQUARTERLY financial reporting is an important disclosure milestone for all listed companies and their shareholders. While the financial statement is of course a crucial indication of the recent health of the company, this alone does not tell the full story. Indeed, (economist) John Kay may have found that investors often find quarterly information \"useless or misleading\" but this just highlights how companies must look beyond static figures and view financial calendars as regular opportunities for management to engage with investors, analysts and the media.\n\nThe quarterly reporting milestone should be used to provide meaningful figures, impart insight into market dynamics, outlook, challenges and strategy while using presentations, meetings, conference calls, webinars and various other channels to receive feedback and address concerns among stakeholders. The recent attacks by short-sellers here in Singapore highlight the importance of this continued engagement, showing that companies must work harder than ever before to be fully and consistently transparent, sustain investor confidence and maintain the capital flows into this thriving market.\n\nNick Foley\n\nPresident - South East Asia & Pacific\n\nLandor\n\nCHANGES in technology over the last decade have wide-reaching ramifications for everyone. Politicians live in a 24/7 world where everything that they say can be commented on almost instantaneously. Business is no different. The exponential influx of portable devices since the turn of the century means that most business executives are always contactable. With the transition to a more \"real-time\" world, it stands to reason that shareholders expect frequent updates on their investments. Quarterly financial reporting is here to stay whether we like it or not. In fact, even if technology had not moved at such a rapid pace, it is plausible that events such as Enron (2001), the sub-prime crisis (2007) and the global financial crisis (2008) would all have led to higher levels of reporting.\n\nThe caveat on quarterly reporting is simply this: See it as an update to investors, not as a reason to deviate from one's chosen strategy. At Landor Associates, we partner with our clients to build brands that deliver perpetual value to the companies that own them. The DNA of a brand should not change on an ad hoc basis. CEOs prone to being overly sensitive to market commentary would do well to apply the advice on brand building to their overall business strategy when navigating the whims of investors and industry pundits alike.\n\nPhilippe H J Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South East Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nREGULAR financial reporting is fundamental for companies to demonstrate transparency in order to build trust and confidence with key stakeholders. But others feel that quarterly reporting has placed a financial burden on companies and forces them to look short term.\n\nIn Singapore, a possible way to move forward may be to consider a system comprising a comprehensive half-yearly reporting for all companies together with interim quarterly reporting of key financial performance indicators. This will offer companies some degree of flexibility and cost savings while maintaining the financial industry's image - one that is highly transparent, well-regulated yet forward-looking and business-friendly.\n\nIn addition to reporting, I strongly believe that all companies, irrespective of its status and size, should have monthly, weekly or even daily numbers available. At International SOS, we report financial results, outlook and forecasts on a monthly basis. We believe that this is both pragmatic and informative, allowing us to make fast decisions and take corrective action if required.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nQUARTERLY reporting is beneficial to listed companies. This requirement compels management to review financial figures on a timely basis that could improve transparency. Companies may also be able to better manage investors' expectations by regularly providing information than surprising the market with less frequent reporting. Nevertheless, there is a significant drawback - cost. This can be quite onerous if the companies have cross-border operations. That said, listed companies can solicit funds from the public. Keeping shareholders reassured is a necessary cost for listed companies. Therefore, rather than giving up quarterly reporting, this can be left to companies with sufficient resources. In this respect, it would be more beneficial to raise the $75 million threshold (maybe to $100 million and/or include net profit as a criterion) so that the smaller firms are able to focus their resources on maximising growth.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nSingapore Head\n\nACCA\n\nTHE majority of investors still see a quarter as the optimal period for companies to release audited financial statements. In surveys conducted for the ACCA report Understanding investors: Directions for corporate reporting published in June 2013, three-quarters of investors said that, despite its flaws, the quarterly report remains a valuable input to their investment decision making. But almost half of those surveyed believed that mandatory quarterly reporting should be abandoned. Many expressed strong views that quarterly reporting drives short-termism in the market and consumes management time. This suggests that individual investors want to consume quarterly reports for their own self interests, despite recognising that this focus on short time horizons is damaging for the overall market's long-term interests. Although based on a survey of 300 investors in the UK and Ireland, the report also reflects the views of some Singapore-listed firms who would prefer a return to half-yearly reporting.\n\nPerhaps the answer lies not so much in how often we report but in how we report. More than 90 per cent of investors believe that it would be valuable for companies to combine financial and non-financial information into an integrated reporting model. The main benefit would be an enhanced understanding of a company's long-term outlook. Investors should still be positioned as the most important audience for the report, yet the value of reporting can and should be strengthened. This can be achieved by providing a greater focus on forward planning, risk management, and integrating these and other issues in a more coherent way.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nQUARTERLY financial reports encourage transparency and good corporate governance, and in the long term, better-governed companies mean a more vibrant, less volatile market. Being able to keep track of a listed company's financial performance on a regular basis is also beneficial for the investing community.\n\nBut, that said, the concerns of smaller companies on the cost-effectiveness of a quarterly reporting system need to be taken into consideration. The strains of having to devote resources and time every quarter to such an undertaking can impede the course of business for a small company. Moreover, smaller firms may not have as many corporate developments and activities over a three-month period that would impact their books in a significant way. It may therefore be more effective to raise the S$75 million market capitalisation threshold.\n\nRobin C Lee\n\nGroup COO\n\nBok Seng Group\n\nBE it quarterly or half-yearly reporting, the key is timeliness of the information disseminated to the investing public. Public listed companies must have the conviction to ensure that vital information with material impact on the company be highlighted in the timeliest manner and not deferred till the half-yearly or quarterly slots. If companies large and small are able to adhere to such discipline in disclosure, then perhaps half-yearly statements should suffice. For big companies equipped with all the resources, they may want to continue to stick to quarterly reporting as they probably have more happenings within the period. Such regular reporting will undoubtedly also create goodwill and garner greater trust from investors. But, for smaller firms, the threshold should be raised to S$150 million market capitalisation before one needs to report quarterly.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA)\n\nREVERTING to half-yearly statements is a step back and not in tandem with Singapore's transformation into a leading global and Asian financial and business hub. Neither would it be in sync with today's world of information technology and high-speed communication.\n\nFor the investor, receiving timely and reliable financial information is necessary for investment decisions, and quarterly reporting would provide more timely information compared with half-yearly reporting. For the entity, quarterly reporting encourages better financial management control and discipline, increases the level of transparency and is in line with good corporate governance.\n\nMost companies doing quarterly reporting are the larger listed companies, and it is fair for the market to expect them to have in place an established financial reporting infrastructure. This means that producing timely financial information should not be a time-consuming and costly exercise. Reducing the frequency of reporting to half-yearly may not necessarily result in substantial resource savings. In fact, any cost savings achieved would be at the expense of transparency and timely disclosure to investors.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nQUARTERLY reporting is not to directly benefit the companies; it is to help investors or potential investors spread their bets. Castlewood Group, like other professionally managed companies, works with live dashboards and scorecards of management information to enable us to launch, learn, adjust and pivot.\n\nCorporate reports - whether quarterly or annual - affect investment activity around them. There is a detectable lull in decision making prior to the release of such information, and a flurry of activity immediately thereafter. A reduction in frequency of updates might see fewer annual blips in activity; however, the knock-on effect could see more concentrated movements on the half-yearly reports.\n\nFrom the perspective of smaller firms, there is a strong case for change, as the resources required to compile and publish quarterly reports might far outweigh the newsworthy impact of the content.\n\nA biannual release of information should have considerably stronger content, and would serve as the half-time score card. The biggest companies and their key performance indicators (KPIs) can have a direct effect on the economy, and it would be foolhardy to have their reporting obligations reduced.\n\nA change in threshold makes the most sense. As to whether that threshold should be determined by capitalisation or by another metric is a subject for further discussion.\n\nKong Chee Min\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\nCenturion Corp Ltd\n\nTHERE are definitely merits to more frequent financial reporting to give investors a better understanding of a company's developments. However, massive efforts and resources are required to put together the numbers. It might be best for the company's management to decide on this, after consulting with their stakeholders. The S$75 million threshold is something arbitrary, so rather than raising it, I would suggest doing away with it and leaving it to the company to opt for quarterly or half-yearly statements. But should a threshold be necessary, I would recommend including the company's sales turnover as this will take into account the size of the company's operations, which may be of investors' interest.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nTHE purpose of financial reporting is to provide timely and real-time information to directors, shareholders and other key stakeholders within an organisation, regardless of whether this is done on a quarterly or half-yearly basis. In this highly competitive marketplace, key reporting is always beneficial and provides a clear track record of financial performance, giving confidence to investors and allowing the management to make adjustments where necessary. As a financial guide, regular and consistent reporting promotes transparency and advocates corporate governance, particularly in today's economic landscape. Large multinationals and government bodies are encouraged to provide financial figures that will clearly present long-term forecasts, giving insight and perspective for investors. Increasing the S$75 million market capitalisation threshold will not advocate transparency and could exclude smaller businesses. Indeed, to ensure that all companies are included, smaller firms can provide interim reporting.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive Singapore & CEO, Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nABN AMRO Bank NV\n\nIN today's volatile markets, quarterly reporting is useful for investors and analysts to have timely information on companies' financial performance and business prospects though it may lead to a short-term focus. It also presents the investment community with greater opportunities to have more frequent access to the companies' management, which is important in assessing the value of the stock.\n\nHowever, we are also aware that quarterly reporting raises compliance costs which can pose an issue for the smaller cap companies. To balance the need for quarterly reporting, and yet at the same time address the business concerns companies have, a middle ground solution could be to raise the S$75 million market capitalisation threshold. By doing so, only the larger companies who have the ability to manage the increased compliance cost are mandated to do quarterly reporting, which would be an invaluable tool to promote transparency and a more vibrant stock market.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman and Co-Founder\n\nHtwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nQUARTERLY reporting has its merits. Companies will be kept in check on its performance. It would make sense to have timely reports, especially given the volatile markets and political situations in some parts of the world that will have direct impact on business. Transparency to investors is part of best practices. Though quarterly reports may be of limited value for some firms, they do serve as a record of progress, or lack of, over a few quarters. Companies can chart timely action plans to address pressing issues. The benefits of quarterly reporting outweigh its shortcomings.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nANECDOTALLY, quarterly reporting entails higher compliance costs. Practically, it shorts long-term planning for immediate results to be window-dressed in quarterly reporting, which begets a short-term mentality in management. Long-term investors premise their decisions on fundamentals, pipelines of mid to long-term goals and other metrics to gauge how good a company and its management is. What is quarterly reporting good for? Transparency? Or is it a search for the devil in the details in the financial reports to spur stock subscriptions?\n\nThe question to ask is: What kind of behavior does quarterly reporting beget? It drives management to focus on delivering what investors want, ie quarterly profit. The idea of transparency, disclosure and accuracy of reporting is not time-sensitive. It is a given that management should be open, transparent and proactive in giving information to investors but can it be done half-yearly?\n\nBusinesses go through seasonal, cyclical and exceptional tranches, and it is best to give management a longer runway and head space to focus on the business and less on quarterly reporting.\n\nI strongly support the idea of half-yearly reporting. Compliance costs aside, it is the breathing space that is needed for management to focus on the larger issue of running the business than on explaining the numbers quarterly.\n\nZaheer K Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore and Europe)\n\nQi Group of Companies\n\nTHERE is perceived merit in quarterly reporting (QR) from a transparency and information perspective for stakeholders. Even then, some investors have only limited reliance on QR. This is not the first debate over QR. The key issue is financial disclosure and how it can be achieved without compromise, but distinguished from generic statements of little actual value. Enhanced voluntary disclosure requirements may well be the answer to reduce QR costs yet maintain and uphold good governance. This should be coupled with raising the market capitalisation (market cap) threshold to S$150million. Alternatively, a hybrid staggered reporting between half-yearly and QR depending on market cap, in keeping with changing global norms, is a pragmatic step since market cap is still the established reporting benchmark criterion in Singapore. Overall the consideration must be the balance not just of the surfeit of information, but quality and accuracy while maintaining investor confidence.\n\nChunlin Liu\n\nCEO\n\nK&C Protective Technologies Pte Ltd\n\nIN today's competitive markets, members of the firm's management are all extremely busy. Reducing the frequency of publishing financial statements from every three months to every six months would definitely aid in cutting down the amount of work for them and allow them to spend more time on running the firm. The size of the Singapore capital market is relatively small compared with other international finance centres. To encourage more firms to raise their capital in Singapore, a friendlier environment is desirable. Reducing the frequency of financial reporting not only reduces compliance costs, it would also allow the management to take a longer time horizon in project investments. The drawbacks of a reduced reporting frequency could probably be compensated by timely updates of significant events and management decisions. Such reporting should be done, anyway, according to reporting regulations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It comes after Mr Cameron led the largest-ever British mission to China last December that involved about 100 business people. \"When I met chairman Wang Jianlin during my recent trade visit to China, I encouraged him to make further investment into Britain. So I'm delighted that Wanda has decided to invest \u00a32-3 billion in regeneration projects so soon after my visit,\" Mr Cameron said. \"This will help to create jobs in Britain and it's a great example of how we can benefit from foreign investment.\"\n\nLast year, Mr Cameron launched a government-backed body to help foreign investors identify and fund UK regeneration projects after securing international funds for the Battersea Power Station project and Chinese investment for London's Nine Elms and Royal Albert Dock and Manchester City Airport.\n\nHe said that \u00a3100 billion worth of possible projects were on the table but on Friday he did not outline where Dalian Wanda's investment would go.\n\nMr Wang is China's richest man with a net worth of US$14 billion according to Forbes magazine. Dalian Wanda, a privately-held conglomerate that owns over US$60 billion in hotels, commercial properties and department stores, has expanded rapidly outside China in recent years.\n\nThe company cut its first British deals in June last year when it said it would spend US$1.6 billion to build a luxury London hotel and buy British yacht maker Sunseeker.\n\nDalian Wanda said that it wanted to invest in \"cultural tourism\" projects but did not specify how many it planned to invest in, or whether it was currently looking at any opportunities.\n\nIn September, Mr Wang unveiled a planned 50 billion yuan (S$10.5 billion) \"motion-picture\" city in China's coastal Qingdao city, comprising of an indoor amusement park, hotels and the world's first underwater studio. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

The candidacy is likely to be discussed at an Ericsson board meeting before the end of the month, another person said.\n\nMr Vestberg joins a growing list of executives whose staff were jolted by news that their boss is being wooed by another company - in this case, to succeed Microsoft's Steve Ballmer. Alan Mulally of Ford Motor Co and Ebay Inc's John Donahoe have also been tipped for the job in recent months.\n\nSuch exposure can cause frustration in the executive suite and confusion in employee ranks, diverting energy from the day- to-day execution of business. It might result in infighting among deputies seeking to fill a void left by the departing or distracted executive. To board members, it can also seem like their CEO has been double-dealing.\n\n\"The process of finding a new CEO at Microsoft is dragging out too long,\" said Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who's on the boards of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Exxon Mobil Corp. \"It's become unseemly to have these candidates exposed without any closure.\"\n\nPeter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, and Ola Rembe, a spokesman for Ericsson, declined to comment.\n\n\"When names start showing up in the press, it instantly creates trust issues,\" said Ron Lumbra, co-leader of the CEO and board-services practice for the recruiting firm Russell Reynolds Associates in New York.\n\nOther executives who have been the subject of reports they're in the crosshairs of another company include Hewlett-Packard Co's Meg Whitman, Oracle Corp's Mark Hurd and Foot Locker Inc CEO Ken Hicks.\n\n\"It's an awkward and inelegant moment for the CEO,\" said Jeff Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management in New Haven, Connecticut. \"The relationship is always going to be a little different after that. The board, if they are surprised, might have some trust issues.\"\n\nFord directors were frustrated last month when Mr Mulally's candidacy at Microsoft distracted from the global debut of the automaker's redesigned Mustang sports car, according to a person briefed on the matter. Mr Mulally, 68, had said last year that he would remain at Ford at least through 2014.\n\nLess than a week before Ford introduced a redesigned F-150 pickup at the Detroit auto show, Mr Mulally told the Associated Press that he wasn't going to Microsoft and had \"no other plans to do anything other than serve Ford\".\n\nDirectors urged him to clarify that he was staying at Ford once it became clear he was out of the running at Microsoft, the person said.\n\nQuestions over how soon Mr Mulally might leave had created the risk of a return to the executive infighting that characterised the pre-Mulally Ford. He cultivated a more collaborative culture at Ford, which had long been marred by backbiting and dysfunction.\n\n\"There was no change from our previously announced plans. Alan remains absolutely focused on continuing to make progress on our One Ford plan,\" Ford said.\n\nEven when an offer isn't forthcoming, the individual revealed as a contender could benefit from the attention.\n\n\"Being named as a candidate may actually help the executive more than hurt,\" said Ron Robertson, a partner in the Ottawa, Canada, office of recruiter Boyden Global Executive Search. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nSingapore ranks among top cities for tech talent as AI job listings surge globally: report\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:37 AM\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Confidence in the local economy also encourages Singaporean workers to explore their options in the job market,\" he pointed out.\n\nAs for the tightened policies on hiring foreign workers, Mr Smith noted that more companies have adapted their human resource strategies to open up a wider local talent pool as a result.\n\n\"As companies in Singapore struggle to find and retain talent, organisations need to adopt flexible working arrangements to attract a more diverse workforce, such as mature-age workers and return-to-work mothers, to drive business growth,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/utilities-not-necessarily-power-play", "site_title": "Utilities: not necessarily a power play", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nUtilities: not necessarily a power play\n\nThe electricity, water and gas sector is a hodgepodge of unsexy names and hot China stocks, reports CAI HAOXIANG\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 26, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR retirees who are looking to invest their money, or for a risk-averse person just starting out, a common question will be: What are the stable stocks in the market? Not everyone is interested in chasing the latest technology initial public offering (IPO) that might be up 10 per cent one day and down 15 per cent the next. Rather, it is the counter that gives steady returns of 5-8 per cent a year that might be more appealing.\n\nReturns like these are nothing to sniff at when compounded over the long term. Assets that deliver 7.2 per cent a year, for instance, will have doubled in value over 10 years.\n\nWhat businesses offer the lowest risk in the market? In theory, the providers of utilities such as electricity, water and gas fall under this category.\n\nAfter all, these businesses often enjoy a government-sanctioned monopoly, or might themselves be partially owned by the government. Their revenue-generating assets - electricity lines, water treatment plants, gas pipes, waste treatment plants - cost a lot to build, and there is no danger of rivals setting up alternative networks anytime soon.\n\nIncome could be guaranteed by regulation, with prices fixed in advance for many years. This makes future earnings easy to calculate. Moreover, the nature of the products provided makes the business less vulnerable to economic shocks. During a downturn, companies and people may cut back on investment or big-ticket consumer goods such as new cars, but they will continue to leave the lights on and pay for water and cooking gas.\n\nThe medium-term growth story is also looking good. Market research company Frost & Sullivan noted in a recent report that rising electricity demand, regional economic growth and falling coal prices mean that the power generation industry will see continued investments. The company noted in another report that the water industry is resilient as it supports socioeconomic activities.\n\nBut companies need to constantly reinvent themselves to stay ahead, while being prudent with their investments. \"It is not uncommon that water companies become too ambitious in taking up projects that do not match their core competencies, and this may lead to unnecessary financial damages and divestments,\" the report said.\n\nIn Singapore, the utilities sector contains a hodgepodge of the unsexy but high-performing Sembcorp Industries, electricity distributor SP AusNet, sizzling-hot China stocks such as SIIC Environment and HanKore, counters with trust structures such as K-Green Trust and Cityspring Infrastructure Trust, and home-grown multinational Hyflux.\n\nWhile the theory of investing in the utilities sector sounds good, the reality is quite different. An examination of the various utilities companies listed here can illuminate.\n\nFor one thing, prices may be guaranteed but demand is not. The recent unusually cool tropical weather in Singapore might mean less demand for electricity for air-conditioning and fans, for example.\n\nAlso, some utilities companies have a business model where they bid for projects and then develop them. Hiccups in the process can incur large expenses. The number of projects that they tender for may also fall in the event of global economic uncertainty.\n\nEventually, the certainty of income flows at prices fixed by governments fades away as concession agreements expire after 20 to 30 years. Investors should ask what happens next.\n\nAnother macroeconomic event to watch out for is rising interest rates as the US Federal Reserve slows down its bond-buying programme on an improving US economy. Utilities companies may pay a seemingly high yield now, but rising interest rates will make that yield less attractive, causing their valuations to fall. Moreover, many companies have to take out large borrowings to fund their expenditures in building power plants or water treatment plants. Rising rates mean a higher cost of debt, which might put the company's solvency in doubt in the event of a downturn.\n\nHigh yields, therefore, are not everything. A part of dividends paid may come from the return of the initial investment of a company, called the \"return of capital\". This is not real income but effectively a transfer of value from companies to shareholders, but non-savvy investors might mistakenly treat it as a flow that will continue forever.\n\nInvestors also need to examine the nature of the financial vehicle that they are buying, as utilities companies may be listed using opaque trust structures.\n\nFinally, investors can consider diversifying by buying a range of utilities companies in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Both the Vanguard Utilities ETF and the iShares US Utilities ETF, for example, have had annual average returns of more than 8 per cent for the last 10 years.\n\nTotal returns in this piece were all calculated by Bloomberg and are based on monthly returns, and assuming that dividends are reinvested into the stock.\n\nSembcorp Industries and SP AusNet\n\nOver a longer-term horizon, the star in Singapore's utilities sector has been the largest stock there, Straits Times Index (STI) component Sembcorp Industries. If dividends are reinvested, Sembcorp has generated yields of 20 per cent a year on average each year in the last 10 years, according to Bloomberg. This is due to both its marine and utilities businesses.\n\nThe utilities business of Sembcorp Industries is currently its largest and most profitable segment, apart from its also-sizeable marine segment. Sembcorp develops, owns and operates energy and water assets. Sembcorp serves industrial and municipal customers, generating power, supplying steam and natural gas, treating wastewater as well as providing desalinated and drinkable water.\n\nNet profit from its utilities segment has grown steadily in the last five years from $202 million in 2008 to $375 million in 2012. In its latest earnings report in Nov 11, 2013, Sembcorp said that the utilities business should perform better for the full year despite greater competition in the Singapore gas and power market. Meanwhile, the company has a pipeline of projects in Singapore, India, the United Arab Emirates, China and the United Kingdom.\n\nSembcorp distributes dividends annually with ex-dates at end-April. Ordinary dividends in the past four years have been 15 cents a share, with bonus dividends of two cents in 2010 and 2011. At 15 cents a share, this translates to a yield of 2.8 per cent on its last traded price of $5.30.\n\nAfter Sembcorp, the next largest utilities counter in Singapore is Australian utilities provider SP AusNet, which is 31-per cent owned by a unit of Temasek Holdings-held Singapore Power. It distributes electricity and gas in the south-eastern Australian state of Victoria, and has a secondary listing in Singapore.\n\nLast November, it declared an interim distribution of 4.18 Australian cents (4.65 Singapore cents) per security, out of which 0.391 cent, or almost a tenth, is a \"return of capital\". Distributions are expected to be 8.36 Australian cents per security for the full year, or a yield of 6.9 per cent on its last traded price of A$1.205.\n\nFor its half-year results ended Sept 30, 2013, revenues were almost A$1 billion, while net profit was close to A$100 million. Net profit would have been higher if not for A$87 million that the company would have to pay after Australian courts ruled against it in a dispute with the Australian Taxation Office. SP AusNet is appealing.\n\nA bit of historical trivia here - SP AusNet was the first stapled security to list in Singapore in 2005. This is a structure common to property and infrastructure companies in Australia where two separate legal entities are bound together. This allows the company to distribute cash as well as gives it more more flexibility when carrying out future acquisitions, SP AusNet has said. But while giving tax advantages to owners, these structures can be opaque and give investors limited control rights, and the real advantages to minority investors are unclear, according to an article by the non-partisan Australian Centre for Financial Studies.\n\nSP AusNet's eight-year average return was 8.7 per cent a year.\n\nHyflux\n\nAnother utilities company that Singaporeans might be familiar with is homegrown water treatment company Hyflux. Its executive chairman Olivia Lum won many awards for her entrepreneurship.\n\nThe company started out as a distributor for water treatment equipment, eventually branching out into designing, building and running custom-made water treatment systems. It went public in 2001 and went on to clinch various key projects here and around the region, including the construction of Singapore's first desalination plant, as well as its first Newater plant. The second, called Tuaspring, opened last September. It is also involved in a major desalination project in India.\n\nHyflux employs 2,400 people around the world, according to its 2012 annual report. Its annual revenues have grown from around $10 million at its IPO to $682 million in 2012. Its order book at end-2012 was almost $3 billion.\n\nHyflux's 10-year return was 6.9 per cent a year on average.\n\nIndonesian plays: Gallant and ISDN\n\nGallant Venture is a utilities and industrial park provider in the Indonesian islands of Batam and Bintan. It also owns a smaller resorts business, Bintan Resorts. It also has a property development component.\n\nIn end-2012, the company bought into vehicle distributor PT Indomobil Sukses Internasional Tbk (IMAS), which manages brands such as Audi, Nissan, Renault, Suzuki, Volkswagen and Volvo.\n\nWhile the vehicle distribution acquisition boosted revenues and profits, the outlook for Gallant's core business is not as bright. \"The industrial park and utilities business remain challenging, and electricity consumption remains depressed,\" Gallant wrote in its Nov 1, 2013 third-quarter results. \"With increasing labour cost, high fuel cost and potential surcharge on gas purchases, the industrial parks' and utilities' margin will be impacted.\"\n\nISDN Holdings, an engineering solutions provider, could also be an interesting utilities play to watch. It is diversifying into energy projects in the region. It is planning to develop a string of mini-hydropower plants in Indonesia. A plan to develop the largest coal power plant in Myanmar is also in the works.\n\nGallant Venture's 7.5-year return was negative 8.6 per cent a year, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMeanwhile, ISDN shares shot up more than three times last year, with its price up 10 times at one point. This boosted its eight-year return to 14 per cent a year.\n\nK-Green Trust, Cityspring\n\nThen there are a couple of companies with business trust structures.\n\nK-Green Trust was spun off by conglomerate Keppel Corp in 2010 as a vehicle comprising the Senoko Waste-to-Energy Incineration Plant, the Keppel Seghers Tuas Waste-to-Energy Plant and the Ulu Pandan Newater Plant assets. The term of agreements entered with authorities for the assets to operate is from 15 to 25 years. It has not made any new acquisitions yet.\n\nThe trust said on its website that it has potential for long-term capital growth, as it will invest in green infrastructure assets in Singapore and globally. These assets operate under long-term agreements, have a competitive advantage because they are difficult to replicate, and also enjoy inelastic demand.\n\nBut assets may have a finite life, and investors have to value them by their projected cash flows over that life, instead of assuming that flows will continue forever. K-Green Trust pays dividends partially out of declining \"service concession receivables\", which are rights to receive fixed or determinable payments from the National Environment Agency and national water agency PUB.\n\nThus some observers have been critical of the trust, pointing that investors should not just look at the trust's yield alone. AmFraser Research, which maintained a \"sell\" call on the trust last Tuesday, pointed out that its then-7.4 per cent yield masks a partial return of capital - essentially the trust drawing down on its assets to pay back investors, instead of earning an additional return on those assets.\n\nCityspring Infrastructure Trust, meanwhile, is involved in several utilities activities. Wholly owned subsidiary City Gas produces and supplies town gas in Singapore. Cityspring's gas operations are the trust's biggest revenue and profit contributor. Meanwhile, a 70 per cent owned unit, SingSpring, is the first desalination plant that Hyflux built in Singapore. Hyflux currently owns the remaining 30 per cent of SingSpring.\n\nWholly owned Cityspring subsidiary Basslink owns and operates a 370 km underwater power cable linking mainland Australia with the Tasmanian island. Basslink owns Basslink Telecoms, which provides telecommunication services between Hobart in Tasmania and Melbourne on the mainland.\n\nWholly owned Cityspring subsidiary CityNet owns, installs, operates and maintains the assets of NetLink Trust - a unit of telco giant SingTel that recently bought OpenNet, Singapore's ultra-fast fibre broadband network.\n\nCityspring currently pays a 6.9 per cent yield, according to Bloomberg. Despite the apparent strength of Cityspring's assets, its stock price performance has been uninspiring especially for those who have bought the shares since its IPO. Shares have been languishing below 50 cents for much of the past two-and-a-half years, a fair distance from its IPO price of 89 cents or its adjusted IPO price of 69 cents after rights issues.\n\nCityspring's five-year performance according to Bloomberg was 12 per cent a year, while its seven-year performance was about negative 5 per cent a year.\n\nK-Green Trust has five-year returns of about 5 per cent a year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The goal is to bring agriculture and nature back into the urban core so that by 2050 . . . we have green, sustainable cities where humans live in balance with their environment.\"\n\nEach building, he said, must ultimately be a \"self-sufficient, mini-power station.\"\n\nThe quest for sustainable urban living has never been more urgent as people continue flocking to cities which encroach ever more onto valuable rural land, gobbling up scarce natural resources and making a disproportionate contribution to pollution and Earth-warming carbon emissions.\n\nEnter Mr Callebaut with his project \"Dragonfly\" - a design for a massive, twin-towered, \"vertical farm\" on New York's Roosevelt Island.\n\nFrom each tower springs a large, glass-and-steel wing, so that the edifice resembles the insect after which it was named.\n\nThe draft structure includes areas for meat, dairy and egg production, orchards, meadows and rice fields along with offices and flats, gardens and public recreation spaces.\n\nEnergy is harvested from the sun and wind, and hot air is trapped between the building \"wings\" to provide heating in winter. In summer, cooling is achieved through natural ventilation and transpiration from the abundant plant growth.\n\nPlants grow on the exterior shell to filter rain water, which is captured and mixed with liquid waste from the towers, treated organically and used as fertiliser.\n\nAnd at the base of the colossus: A floating market on the East River for the inhabitants to sell their organic produce.\n\n\"They made fun of me. They said I created a piece of science fiction,\" Mr Callebaut says of his detractors.\n\nBut as awareness has grown of the plight of our planet, overpopulation and climate change, his ideas have gained traction, and the Dragonfly design has been exhibited at an international fair in China.\n\nMr Callebaut has also drafted a concept for a floating city resembling a lily pad that will house refugees forced from their homes by climate change.\n\nAnd he hopes to sell a design for a \"farmscraper\" in Shenzhen, China that will include housing, offices, leisure space and food gardens.\n\nAs yet, Mr Callebaut has found no buyers for these big projects.\n\n\"With the recent economic recession, politicians and government may . . . have been reluctant to venture into such new, large-scale endeavours that have not been tested before,\" Emilia Plotka, a sustainability specialist at the Royal Institute of Royal Architects, told AFP of Dragonfly and similar projects.\n\nBut she pointed out the concept has inspired other, smaller projects.\n\n\"Instead of majestically tall bionic towers plonked in riverbeds, vertical farms have been rather more modestly integrated into existing buildings, derelict industrial sites and floating barges,\" said Ms Plotka.\n\nOne example is the Pasona Urban Farm - a nine-storey office building in Tokyo that allows employees to grow their own food in specially reserved green spaces at work.\n\n\"Whilst the buy-in may not be as noticeable at the moment, it certainly is widespread and growing,\" said Ms Plotka of the \"vertical farm\" movement.\n\n\"I suspect most other new vertical farms will remain hidden in disused urban spaces or existing business and domestic blocks, which is not bad at all as they will use fewer resources to be set up and enhance their surrounding environments and communities.\"- AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

But it costs money to ferry empty aircraft overseas and doing heavy checks is very labour intensive work. Therefore, it makes more sense for this work to be done in Indonesia.\"\n\nLion also plans to make Batam an international transit hub for passengers flying in and out of Indonesia and its second major Indonesia hub after Jakarta. The airline plans to increase the number of domestic destinations it serves from Batam to 20 from the current 15 and increase the frequency of these services.\n\nIt then plans to launch services to points in southern China such as Guangzhou and Hong Kong, as well as Bangkok, Jeddah and the Indian cities of New Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nThis will help passengers bypass the congested airport in Jakarta, which is Indonesia's main international hub, said Rusdi Kirana, the president director of Lion Group.\n\nIndonesian airlines have been looking for alternatives to Jakarta's Soekaro-Hatta Airport for several years due to the congestion and delays that the airport faces.\n\n\"The distance is actually shorter if you transit in Batam rather than fly south to Jakarta to transit,\" said Mr Kirana.\"The shorter flying time makes flying more convenient for passengers and it means aircraft burn less fuel, leading to significant cost savings.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

But he denied that the government has any desire to \"contain\" China.\n\nHowever, in view of China's recent establishment of an air defence zone, the two leaders \"underscored the importance of freedom of overflight and civil aviation safety in accordance with the recognised principles of international law\" and practices.\n\nAn agreement signed by Mr Abe and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was aimed at \"intensifying the strategic and global partnership\" between the two countries and embraced regional security cooperation, including stepped-up maritime exercises near India and in the Pacific.\n\nForeign ministry officials in Tokyo made much of the fact that Mr Abe became the first Japanese political leader to attend India's Republic Day celebrations as chief guest. This marks the maturing of political as well as economic relations between the two countries, they said.\n\nEconomic cooperation figured prominently across a wide swathe of issues such as civil uses of nuclear technology, aerospace development, high-speed rail systems, infrastructure development in general, cooperation in IT, electronics and cybersecurity and stepped up yen loans to India.\n\nThe two leaders \"discussed the possibility of cooperation in building infrastructure that will enhance connectivity and regional integration between India and its neighbouring countries, sharing the view that they will support cross border business activities and supply chains\".\n\nDespite the fact that Mr Abe's visit marked his second as prime minister (and the fourth annual summit between Japan and India), the Japan-India relationship still pales alongside the Japan-China relationship in terms of trade, investment and Japan's corporate presence.\n\nThis, as Mr Abe and Japanese leaders told their Indian counterparts, is largely due to \"problems\" on the Indian side. Japanese officials cite as examples India's demand for joint ventures and majority shareholdings, insistence on local employment, and tax and financial issues.\n\nJapan is keen to promote sales of high-speed railway (shinkansen) systems in India against competition from France, the UK, Spain and others as well as assist development of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor.\n\nIndia is, meanwhile, eager to develop a domestic aerospace industry, a Tokyo official noted, and Japan is offering cooperation in this regard with the sale to India of US-2 amphibian military aircraft. Japan also assisted in the development of India's motor industry through the Maruti-Suzuki venture.\n\nNegotiations for a cooperation agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy figured high on the agenda of the Abe-Singh meeting, with Japan stressing the need for safeguards to prevent civil nuclear technology being applied to military use.\n\nIndia has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and is unlikely to do so but Japan is eager to sell commercial nuclear technology and equipment. For this to happen, ways must be found for Japan to be able to \"withdraw\" if India tests further nuclear weapons, an official said.\n\nJapan and India are to expand their bilateral currency swap arrangement from US$15 billion to US$50 billion from this month - a move which the two prime ministers said would \"contribute to the stability of global financial markets including emerging economies\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Insiders say only a handful of people on either side knew about his talks with AIG.\n\nAt a lunch in New York last May, Mr Kelly secured a promise from investment bank UBS that it could fund the deal alone to minimise the risk of leaks.\n\n\"We said we are going to need ... to do this absolutely off the books as it were. We didn't want to be out there with rumours of us being the buyer who never actually shows up.\"\n\nMr Kelly is hopeful that a steadier management hand would help the new AerCap pick up business that some in the industry say eluded ILFC when question marks remained over its future.\n\nIndustry executives are expecting a sharp change of style. \"I think you will see that company being run by Excel spreadsheet rather than Powerpoint presentation in future,\" said an aircraft industry executive, asking not to be named.\n\nMr Kelly will be a key partner for the two giants of the aviation world, Airbus and Boeing, with one of the largest fleets in the world of each company's planes.\n\nWhile ILFC was known for directly placing mega-plane orders, AerCap has historically built up its fleet by buying newly delivered planes from airlines and renting them back out.\n\nHowever, that gamble was running out of steam as it faced increased competition and industry executives say AerCap was running short of options to grow its portfolio, having held off buying directly from manufacturers for so long.\n\nBut Mr Kelly said that while he would always remain cautious in terms of financing, the new AerCap would not shy away from large deals. \"So long as you understand the risks of what you are doing and are able to mitigate those, you should not be afraid of the scale you are taking on,\" he added. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

In December, Mr Bernanke had signalled that the rate-setting committee would reduce bond purchases by another US$10 billion at this meeting. Could the emerging markets crisis give the Fed pause?\n\nOne voting member of the committee, Richard Fisher, president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, has made it clear that stock market shocks alone will not sway his opinion.\n\n\"One of the things people think is if we see a correction then we'll back off,\" he said in a question and answer session with reporters after a recent speech in Dallas. \"If it's a correction that does not have underlying it a significant slowdown, a reversal in the economy. If we're still reducing cyclical employment, and still seeing economic growth, then I would dissent.\"\n\nIf Mr Bernanke and Ms Yellen don't tweak the tapering plans or find some other way to calm investors down, the likelihood is that global markets will continue selling off this week.\n\nThe latest crisis descended fast. Unlike the US, emerging markets have not seen growth return to pre-recession levels. China's recovery has been particularly uneven.\n\nLast week, investors fled stocks, bonds and currencies in emerging markets after a survey showed another slowdown in Chinese industrial data. At the same time, The Wall Street Journal reported that rumours spread of a possible default in a bond-like instrument issued by a major bank and backed by the debt of a coal miner.\n\nIn the interconnected global economy, China's troubles soon became those of its major trading partners and creditors. It doesn't take long for a ripple in the Argentinian bond market to become a full-fledged crisis. The South American nation is already paying such high interest rates that the bond selloff last week raised questions over whether they would be able to service higher yields.\n\nTo prevent an outright panic and a possible run on local banks, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner lifted a long-standing limit to the number of dollars Argentinians can buy with their pesos. It amounted to a devaluation of the peso and failed to ease pressure on the bonds.\n\nLike Greece before it, Argentina may find it difficult to prevent the default fear from becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nFrom there, the selloff spread to other emerging markets such as Turkey and around the world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.5 per cent, one of the biggest setbacks for the bull market since the \"flash crash\".\n\nLate last year, US investors had finally returned en masse to stocks as the crises that had rolled from US banks to the eurozone to the US budget subsided. US economic growth appeared to be picking up and even the \"tapering\" of bond purchases by the Federal Reserve couldn't slow it down. Even the seemingly immovable unemployment rate had begun to drop.\n\nBefore earnings season went into full swing last week, bullish traders were betting on a \"blowout quarter\", when corporations outstrip expectations almost across the board. Instead, the sceptical strategists who had warned that corporate growth rates would not accelerate enough to justify the 2013 rally were proved right.\n\nStrategists at Barclays, in a note to clients, said: \"Stronger growth was so firmly embedded in risk assets that even (positive economic data) and improving corporate fundamentals are not sufficient to offset an inflection point in monetary policy.\"\n\nThis week, Silicon Valley could provide some of the positive surprises traders need to distract them from Argentina and the Fed. Apple, Facebook and Google are among the tech giants reporting results.\n\nMr Bernanke will have one last opportunity to use central banking power to nip a crisis in the bud. With one foot already out the door, the famously interventionist chairman may not come to the rescue this time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He was said to have done it \"wilfully and with intent to defraud\", by omitting to report the losses incurred on trading positions he held with various banks between 2005 and 2007.\n\nAccording to the charge sheets, these were hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of marked-to-market losses that Wee had incurred on foreign exchange and options trades positions he held with a host of banks, including OCBC Bank, DBS Bank, BNP Paribas (BNP), Societe Generale (SocGen) and Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nThe offences, under the Penal Code, carry a maximum penalty of an unspecified fine and a seven-year jail term, for each charge.\n\nIt is understood that the prosecution, led by deputy public prosecutor Kevin Yong, intends to proceed on nine of the 57 charges, taking the rest into consideration.\n\nThe next hearing, a pre-trial conference, is scheduled for March 6. Wee is represented by Julian Tay, a senior partner in the litigation and dispute resolution department of Lee & Lee.\n\nThe charges come some six years after Wee's alleged wrongdoing first came to light. SembMarine had announced in October 2007 that Wee, then its group finance director, had made large unauthorised currency bets in the euro and the US dollar with 11 banks using the account of Jurong Shipyard.\n\nThe news stunned the industry and the financial markets.\n\nSoon after its announcement, SembMarine was locked in a bruising battle with the banks to reduce its losses, with SembMarine arguing that the transactions were invalid and not binding.\n\nIt fired Wee from the group, while Jurong Shipyard said that it was lodging a complaint against Wee with the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD).\n\nIn February 2008, SembMarine announced that it had reached full and final settlements with nine of the 11 banks, for just US$9.1 million.\n\nThat left it fighting a US$50.7 million claim by BNP, while trying to recover another US$198.9 million that it had paid to SocGen.\n\nBNP had threatened to wind up Jurong Shipyard, but lost that court battle; it settled the claim for US$30 million in December 2008. During that hearing, Wee's unsigned affidavit was produced in court; in it, Wee claimed that BNP executives had pressured him to take up some \"very aggressive instruments\" to cover up his initial losses. He suggested that they had played on his fears and convinced him of the need to enter into \"more and more exotic and complex transactions\" as his losses deepened, despite his angry e-mails to them to stop.\n\nIn his affidavit, Wee claimed Jurong Shipyard's management had no idea he was involved in such risky trades until mid-October 2007. But his lawyers argued that their client's acts and foreign exchange transactions were at all material times authorised and mandated by the board of Jurong Shipyard.\n\nIn September 2010, SembMarine and SocGen agreed to settle the claim for US$40 million, without any admission of liability by either side.\n\nIn July 2011, Jurong Shipyard filed a notice of arbitration against its former auditor Ernst & Young (EY) for claims over these disputed unauthorised foreign exchange transactions. It did not give any details other than the statement that it believes \"it has a valid claim\" against EY. In January last year, SembMarine announced that it had reached an agreement with EY, for a \"full and final amicable settlement\" over the case.\n\nSembMarine is a global marine and offshore engineering group, specialising in integrated solutions in ship repair, shipbuilding, ship conversion, rig building and offshore engineering and construction.\n\nJurong Shipyard is a one-stop total shipyard offering ship repair, shipbuilding, ship conversion, rig building and offshore engineering.\n\nBoth companies have said in their annual reports that their foreign exchange trading was only for hedging purposes to protect their foreign currency denominated receivables and payables.\n\nSembMarine shares closed at $4.18, down two cents, on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At least 10 people have been killed and scores wounded.\n\nA senior government official said earlier yesterday that as many as 45 of the 50 polling stations in Bangkok had been shut as protesters swarmed the centres in what shaped as another blow for the embattled Ms Yingluck.\n\nEarly voting was also disrupted in 10 of Thailand's 76 provinces.\n\nBangkok police said clashes had broken out between anti-government protesters and Ms Yingluck's supporters, with the two sides trading punches before shots were fired. Hospital officials said 11 people were hurt in the clashes in Bangkok's Bang Na district.\n\nYesterday's violence, the worst in a month, came after a state of emergency came into effect on Wednesday and casts further doubt over the election.\n\nThe protests are the latest eruption in a political conflict that has gripped Thailand for eight years and which is starting to hurt growth and investor confidence in South-east Asia's second-largest economy.\n\nThe conflict broadly pits Bangkok's middle class and elite, and followers in the south, against mainly poor rural backers of Ms Ying-luck and her brother, ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, in the populous north and northeast.\n\nThe protesters, led by firebrand former premier Suthep Thaugsuban, accuse Ms Yingluck of being Thaksin's puppet and want an unelected \"people's council\" to oversee reform before any future election is held.\n\nOn Saturday, a government minister said Ms Yingluck was prepared to discuss cancelling the Feb 2 election if the activists ended their protests.\n\nForeign Minister Sura-pong Tovichakchaikul, also a deputy prime minister, said in a televised address the blocking of advance voting was \"a serious offence\" and said protesters had used force to stop people voting.\n\nMs Yingluck's government had already warned anyone who tried to stop voting would be jailed or fined.\n\nCity officials said they had begun negotiating with the protesters.\n\n\"We have to negotiate with them and let them know that blocking the election is illegal,\" said Luckana Rojjanawong, a Bangkok district official said.\n\nIt was already unclear whether the election would go ahead after a Constitutional Court ruling on Friday that opened the possibility of a delay. The Election Commission has also called for a delay, saying Thailand is too unsettled.\n\nMs Yingluck, who would probably win the election easily, is set to meet Election Commission officials tomorrow.

This shakeout of older, less sophisticated plants continues, with the latest being planned divestments Down Under by oil majors Shell and BP. China's PetroChina is also reportedly delaying the start-up of two new refineries, and the expansion of a third.\n\nA worldwide refining overcapacity, especially with newbuilding in China, plus the global economic slowdown is partly to blame. But the real game-changer has been the shale revolution in North America, which has resulted in bountiful and price-advantaged supplies of, first, easily tapped shale oil, followed by shale gas. The former has led to a revival of the US oil refining industry, with American petrochemicals set to get the next big leg-up from the latter.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, this has already hit oil refiners elsewhere, with the European refining industry under the greatest stress.

The analysis also reveals the complexities of some of the issues, such as foreign- worker policies, that have occupied the nation.\n\nINFOGRAPHIC: Click here for 10 years of Budget Speeches\n\nIn the years since the Global Financial Crisis, two dynamics have dominated Mr Tharman's annual Budget speeches: raising productivity on the one hand, and inclusiveness on the other.\n\nBeginning in 2010, a $2 billion National Productivity Fund was created as the country emerged from recession and turned towards the future. The efforts were emphasised in 2011, when the goal of raising real incomes by 30 per cent over 10 years was stated. In 2012, foreign-worker quotas were cut, and in 2013, those policies were tweaked but not substantially relaxed despite loud complaints from certain industries.\n\n\"We are no longer a developing economy, but we have not achieved the level of productivity and income of an advanced economy,\" Mr Tharman said in 2013.\n\nBut the government has also sought to balance the productivity drive with stronger social initiatives for the young, the old and the poor centred around the buzzword \"inclusiveness\". The elder segments of the population, in particular, have seen initiatives targeted specifically for them in the past three Budgets.\n\nAlthough past Budgets have mostly sought to be progressive, inclusiveness has not always been a big issue. The 2004 Budget, for example, was notably a business-friendly package aimed at rejuvenating the economy, which was just emerging from the 2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) crisis and the 2001 bursting of the tech bubble.\n\nIt was in that light that then-Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the creation of the S Pass for skilled foreign workers to address businesses' struggles with finding talent. Keeping the foreign-worker spigot too closed would crimp the economy's ability to expand, it was reasoned.\n\n\"For our economy to grow, companies must be able to recruit skilled workers,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nThe rhetoric is different these days. In 2012, with the heartland still smarting from major MRT train disruptions, Mr Tharman said: \"Our increasing dependence on foreign workers is not sustainable. It will test the limits of our space and infrastructure, despite our efforts to build more housing and expand our public transport system.\"\n\nThe analysis of past Budgets also unearths interesting nuggets about the Global Financial Crisis. The 2007 Budget was clearly optimistic, with the looming housing crisis in the United States seen mostly as a serious but distant risk. A year later, those concerns had grown to the extent that the 2008 Budget was relatively conservative and appeared to be storing surpluses for a rainy day.\n\nThat conservatism proved to be wise as the crisis hit in 2008. Even so, the 2009 Budget showed how accurate forecasting can be a challenge for even the best of us.\n\n\"Like other governments and the vast majority of private forecasters, we did not anticipate the speed and scale of the deterioration in the global economy in the last six months,\" Mr Tharman said in 2009.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Friday, the shares closed at 8 cents, up by 0.9 cent or 12.7 per cent. Genesis shares last traded at 9 cents.\n\nGenesis' core asset is the right to purchase a 62 per cent stake in a gold, silver and copper project in Plavica, Macedonia, upon the completion of a feasibility study. The study is expected to be completed before Feb 28, 2014. The company also has exploration licences covering 1.1 sq km in northern and central Australia.\n\nThe company lost A$1.8 million in the year ended June 2013, and the deal would have reduced Blumont's earnings per share to 1.322 cents from 1.933 cents on a pro forma basis.\n\nThe offer is conditional upon Blumont gaining majority control of Genesis. Directors of Genesis, who control about 18.6 per cent of the company, according to data from Bloomberg, have agreed to recommend and accept the offer.\n\nOther major shareholders of Genesis include Singapore-listed Annica Holdings chairman Edwin Sugiarto, who paid A$1.35 million, or 9 Australian cents per share, in November 2012 for his 9.7 per cent stake in Genesis, according to data from the Australian exchange and Bloomberg.\n\nThis will not be the first time that Mr Sugiarto finds himself in a Singapore-Australia mining deal involving one of the companies at the centre of October's penny collapse. A year ago, Innopac Holdings launched an all-share takeover bid for Australia's Merlin Diamonds. Mr Sugiarto was a substantial shareholder of Merlin at the time. His last reported interest in Merlin was 4.24 per cent as at September 2013, according to Bloomberg.\n\nShares of Blumont and Innopac, among others, dived on Oct 4, 2013, prompting queries from the Singapore Exchange directed at both companies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The good times are rolling in the aircraft finance industry as yield-hungry investors gamble on growing demand for air travel, banishing recent jitters over funding.\n\nDespite new concerns over emerging markets that mounted on Friday, an annual gathering in Dublin last week attracted record numbers of lawyers, bankers and lessors who keep the US$100 billion a year jetliner industry aloft with funding.\n\nJust a few years ago, tougher capital regulations triggered fears that airlines would be unable to find the funds needed to pay for record numbers of aircraft being ordered from Airbus and Boeing, as European banks scaled back.\n\nBut Asian banks helped fill the void and financiers in Ireland, the world's leading hub for aviation finance, said new money was pouring into the promising sector in their wake.\n\n\"I don't think there's a sector of the financing space that isn't open for business. Everything is very robust right now,\" Jude Bricker, treasurer of low-cost US airline Allegiant Travel, said at the Airline Economics conference.\n\nWith US airlines back on a more stable footing and oil prices relatively calm, aviation is luring interest from longer-term investors such as insurers and pension funds, who hope to boost weak returns dictated by low interest rates.\n\n\"We've seen the pensions, endowments looking to make up lost investment time, and more hedge fund investors looking for stable spread over time but not necessarily a super-sized return to make it work,\" said Daniel Hartnett, partner at law firm Kaye Scholer.\n\nCapital markets such as that in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETC), a secured corporate bond structure typically used by US airlines, are increasingly opening up to foreign airlines because of a recent treaty to protect lenders.\n\nIn a landmark transaction, Air Canada last year issued an EETC backed by five Boeing jets. More investors are also placing funds privately with airlines to avoid dilution when such public offerings are over-subscribed.\n\n\"The choice of where to go to refinance or finance used to be more guided by what was open, but now everything is open,\" said Eric Eugene, head of transportation finance at BNP Paribas. \"Our clients have a much wider variety of options than there used to be.\"\n\nLeasing firms, which own or manage 40 per cent of the fleet, remain active. And an ample supply of competitive financing means fewer airlines are resorting to guarantees from US and European export credit agencies, which have raised their fees.\n\n\"We are in a very healthy market but these are changing markets. We are using less export credit but replacing a lot of that capacity with capital from multiple markets,\" said Kostya Zolotusky, a managing director at Boeing Capital.\n\nThe resulting competition across the aviation industry means yields aren't as high as they were and that is pushing investors to look at new areas to fund, such as older aircraft. \"There's a lot of money chasing a few assets,\" said Tom Tuggle, executive managing director at CMC Capital Markets.\n\nBut despite concerns that rates could rise as central banks ease off printing money to stimulate the economy, delegates said it has rarely been a better time to be an airline treasurer - traditionally a nerve-racking job.\n\n\"Any CFO should be looking at refinancing everything they've got right now,\" said Ron Wainshal, chief executive of Aircastle, whose key shareholders include the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, a major Canadian pension fund.\n\nCheap money has in turn indirectly boosted the manufacturers who are now sitting on record order backlogs.\n\nThey are exposed to risks that airlines will not be able to pay for jets they have ordered, but say they are confident others will step in and funding will remain readily available.\n\nThe most worrying spot on the horizon is emerging markets, which have dominated aviation's growth in the past five years.\n\nThe Dublin gathering took place in the shadow of the World Economic Forum in Davos where bosses warned the \"gold rush\" of upstart economies was over. The rise of a new middle class has been driving much projected aviation growth.\n\nA flight from emerging market assets accelerated on Friday, sending the Turkish lira to a new low and setting global shares on course for their worst week this year.\n\nPolitical instability in Turkey and Thailand, both big markets for aircraft, were cited as risks by two aviation industry chiefs in Dublin.\n\nOne banker reeled off a list of \"red flags\" from currencies in Venezuela and Argentina, to growth in Brazil or India.\n\nFor now, China - whose domestic market is by far the fastest-growing air travel segment - is on everyone's watch list but is not dramatically slowing, delegates said. Jetmakers are said to have dozens of unannounced orders on their books.\n\nA less tangible concern is whether the airline industry that underpins an eight-year waiting list for new planes, and generates the need for finance, has changed for the better.\n\nShares in European airline stocks have risen 42 per cent over the last year, while US airlines stocks have almost doubled over the last year.\n\nYet despite talk of fundamental improvements in the way airlines are run, with capacity restraint improving the profits of US carriers, the industry operates on razor-thin margins.\n\n\"The margin for error is non-existent. A lot of things can go awry,\" CMC's Mr Tuggle told Reuters. \"Cheap money can sustain the industry, but things can get very different when it turns.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Gross domestic product rose 7.7 per cent in the October-December period from a year earlier compared with 7.8 per cent in the third quarter, according to the country's National Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\"Growth and demand in China will continue given ongoing urbanisation,\" Mr Bodouroglou said in an interview here late last week. \"While we will see some volatility in dry-bulk ship rates because of micro- events in China, the country's economy is three times bigger than eight or 10 years ago, so 8 per cent growth now is bigger than 15 per cent 10 years ago.\"\n\nChina's manufacturing may contract for the first time in six months, according to a gauge released last Thursday by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. The preliminary reading of 49.6 for January in a Purchasing Managers Index was below a final figure of 50.5 in December.\n\nThe urbanisation trend in India and in many African countries, with continued construction of homes, rail and road links, will also support dry-bulk rates, Mr Bodouroglou said. The value of China's new home sales in 2013 rose 27 per cent from 2012 to a record 6.8 trillion yuan (S$1.4 trillion), according to data from the country's statistics bureau.\n\nAthens-based Paragon has 14 dry-bulk vessels with a carrying capacity of over 850,000 deadweight tonnes, set to rise to over 1.1 million tonnes following delivery of four new ships by 2015.\n\nThe company's shares have risen more than 90 per cent in the past 12 months in New York trading, to US$7.23, compared with a 12.6 per cent rise for the 12-member Bloomberg Dry Ships Index.\n\nParagon is positioned to take advantage of improved rates on a monthly basis as \"we don't rent out our bulk ships for more than 30-60 days,\" Mr Bodouroglou said. \"At the end of 2012, we took the view that we will start to see a recovery in dry-bulk rates towards the end of 2013.\"\n\nThe Baltic Dry Index, a measure of the cost of moving commodities via 23 seaborne shipping routes by different sizes of ship, fell 3.4 per cent to 1,322 last Wednesday, according to the Baltic Exchange in London. The index is still down 89 per cent from the record high reached in May 2008, even after it more than tripled last year.\n\nWeaker rates have resulted from an oversupply of ships, with too many new vessels on order, rather than lack of demand, the executive said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The firm also had to scale back work programmes and implement cost-cutting measures as oil prices fell 35 per cent and reduced its revenue.\n\nFour and a half years on, the outlook for the first listed oil producer on the Singapore Exchange is markedly brighter.\n\nIt moved from the Catalist board to the mainboard in January last year.\n\nIn the past two quarters, Interra Resources has seen revenue hit record highs and net profit soar, on the back of a surge in production at its South Sumatra field.\n\nFor the quarter ended Sept 30, 2013, net profit rose nearly five times to US$4.99 million, compared with US$1.09 million a year ago.\n\nInterra's share price has also more than doubled from about 14 cents in mid-2009 to 39.5 cents on Friday.\n\nMr Tjia says of his work so far at the helm of the firm: \"I think we've done a decent job. We could have done a better job, but we've done a decent job with what we've gotten.\"\n\n\"It took basically three years before things started to move up. (Now that) we're on the uptrend, hopefully we can maintain that,\" he tells The Business Times in an interview.\n\nThe key, he adds, is balancing existing production, new production and potential acquisitions.\n\nInterra Resources has two producing onshore oilfields in Myanmar, in which it has 60 per cent working interest. In Indonesia, it holds full rights to two producing blocks in South Sumatra and West Papua, as well as a 49 per cent stake in an exploration block in Central Kalimantan.\n\nThe group's shareable production has been rising steadily, from 250,978 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in 2010 to 471,560 bopd for the first nine months of last year.\n\nIn particular, contribution from the Tanjung Miring Timur (TMT) concession in South Sumatra has almost tripled, thanks to an extremely prolific new oil well there.\n\nThe group added eight new wells in the TMT field last year, bringing the total number of producing wells there to 26. These development wells are often deeper and hence, more expensive and challenging, but has a greater production rate when successful.\n\nIn comparison, in the mature oilfields in Myanmar, increasing production is a matter of drilling as many shallow wells as possible.\n\nThe firm - the largest onshore oil producer in Myanmar with about 40 per cent of market share - drilled 24 wells last year. It now has about 258 producing wells there.\n\n\"We're the only onshore company in Myanmar that has actually increased production, which is quite interesting because an oilfield naturally declines,\" Mr Tjia says.\n\nThis year, Interra expects to drill a similar number of wells.\n\nEven as Interra picks up speed, however, a potential road bump lies ahead.\n\nIts lease for the TMT field expires in end 2016, while the contract for the oilfields in Myanmar lasts till April 2017.\n\nInterra is confident of the renewal of the TMT contract. \"Very rarely do (contracts) get cancelled (in Indonesia), only when people don't fulfil their commitments, breach their contracts, or voluntarily give them up,\" says Mr Tjia.\n\nThe prospects for the extension of its Myanmar oilfield contract are, however, more hazy.\n\n\"Honestly, I cannot tell you with any intelligent opinion whether it's going to be 10 per cent renewed, 50 per cent renewed, or 100 per cent renewed,\" he says when asked. But three factors place the firm in good stead, he adds.\n\nThe company has consistently maintained its presence in Myanmar since 1996, even when others pulled out when the going got tough. It was the first company to step up over there, and also the only one able to increase onshore oil production.\n\n\"We are probably the best positioned company in Myanmar to convince the government of this extension,\" he says.\n\nThe urgent need for crude oil in the fast-developing nation also means that the Myanmar government would not want a decline in oil production that would occur for a few years, if the oilfields were to change hands, Mr Tjia reckons.\n\nMeanwhile, exploration work continues apace in Interra's Kuala Pambuang block in Kalimantan. There, the firm expects to finish seismic work by the second quarter of this year.\n\n\"By the end of the year, we'll have a good understanding of the block,\" he says.\n\nThe group also announced in September last year that it was acquiring a firm with rights to explore and develop the Benakat Barat field in South Sumatra, in a deal which would increase its reserves by 80 per cent from its current proven and probable 24.5 million barrels.\n\nDue diligence work there has taken longer than expected, he says. Government regulatory processes are in limbo in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in April this year.\n\n\"Nobody's making a decision . . . so no matter whether you are well connected or not, it's going to be difficult, and it's going to be a general thing for Indonesia,\" Mr Tjia says, adding that the parties in the deal remain committed.\n\nWith a strong balance sheet and support from its largest shareholder Saratoga Capital, a private equity group founded by Interra's chairman Edwin Soeryadjaya, Interra continues to be on the lookout for more opportunities, and is in a better position than before.\n\n\"There are not many companies of our size and profile that are cashflow positive, and it's something that people are slowly starting to recognise,\" he says.\n\nBut ever the modest businessman, he adds: \"(Nevertheless), as always with oil and gas businesses, it is a high-risk business. There's no guarantee that our success will continue.\"\n\nsandrea@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By the time you read this missive, it will be of little news to you that I've been in a spot of trouble with the natives, what.\n\nAs you know, it does not become me to overstate the gravity of a situation, so believe me, old horse, when I say it's been a dashed nasty business from start to finish - not that it is finished of course, for the natives will not cease banging on about it.\n\nAll I did, old top, was offer my unvarnished opinion of this infernal contraption called \"public\" transportation. Would you believe it, Tuppy, that on these things, the proletariat have the temerity to sit next to you? And there is nowhere to rest your pipe! (I once tried to balance mine on a nearby chap's head, for he was of the right height, but was savagely rebuffed for my trouble.)\n\nAt no point, I must add, is there an opportunity on this \"train\" to tell the driver where you want to go, directly. Instead, I am forced to jerk back and forth, swallowing wave after wave of nausea as the doors clang open and shut at various abominable locations I most certainly did not commission.\n\nAt each of these unnecessary stoppages, a hoi polloi stampede transpires as the great unwashed surge in and out, no doubt headed towards their respective workhouses, rank with the crass odour of sweat and industry.\n\nI say, Tuppy, can you imagine a more vulgar thing - the exchange of lucre for producing something you can see and hold. Why did you and I throw our lot into finance, if not to extinguish this ludicrous practice?\n\nWhat is more, there is now some kerfuffle about my choice of word for the blighters on this train - \"poor\", as it were.\n\nTuppy, old thing, you have always been a man of Reason, and I implore you to turn your analytical eye on the matter at hand.\n\nSurely, the natives understand that this has nothing to do with Singapore - I mean to say, anyone in the world on public transport is poor and therefore equally odious to the nose. By Jove, perhaps if I had been clearer, I wouldn't be in this pickle.\n\nI plum forgot that to make yourself understood in English here, one simply needs to speak English louder. Perhaps, when I expressed myself on Facebook, I should have done so in all-capital letters, thereby \"shouting\" my English, what.\n\nWhile we are on the subject, would you mind terribly telling me if poverty is contagious? I took the utmost precaution with my post-train bath, but have been seized by a terrible and inexplicable urge to wear polyester.\n\nIt goes without saying (why does one say this, right before they say the very thing that needs no saying?) that the events of the last few days have been a shock to the nerves. Even the sight of my infinity pool no longer lifts the spirits like it used to.\n\nNow, upon my family, Porsche and me, the island's collective finger of scorn has been pointed - the unwashed finger of scorn! Between you and me, laddie, I have the most sinking of suspicions that it is not the index finger that has been activated for this purpose.\n\nUpon my Sam, it is a wearing life. A wearing life, old boy, for which no amount of happy hour at Clarke Quay can be a balm.\n\nThe very Dickens of it all, wouldn't you know, is that I have already been seen to apologise! By Gad, I told my PR man to say, \"Sorry, jolly bad show, better luck next time,\" and all that rot to the good people of Singapore.\n\nBut this seems to have riled them further, these savages who have traded in their bamboo spears for laptops.\n\nIt is here, Tuppy old chum, where I come to the reason for this bit of writing. I don't suppose it would be too much trouble if you had a bit of a poke around the City, see if there is a job that needs doing?\n\nI hear London is no longer the beacon of activity it was once but surely it can't be as bad as all that. I will be at Heathrow next Saturday. Have a car waiting for me, won't you, there's a good lad. I will not be taking the bally Tube.\n\njoyceh@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Their audit report was on the company's financial statements for the financial year ended Oct 31, 2013.\n\n\"These conditions, along with other matters as set forth in Note 2, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\"\n\nIn their audit opinion, the auditors nevertheless reported that they believed that the audit evidence they had obtained was sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion that China FlexPack's financials were in accordance with international standards.\n\nChina FlexiPack, a plastic packaging maker, reported net current assets of about RMB104.02 million (S$21.8 million) as at Oct 31, 2013.\n\nChina FlexPack, however, believes that it will have enough working capital for the current financial year.\n\nBesides noting its positive net current asset, the company said it was exploring the availability of external financing, and believed that a short-term bank loan secured by non-current assets is available.\n\nChina FlexPack is also working to improve its liquidity condition through measures, such as shortening receivable collection periods, lowering inventory levels and tightening cost controls. The company will also reduce production volumes from less effective production lines to address cash outflow.\n\nThe stock closed flat at 2.6 cents yesterday before the announcement.\n\nChina FlexPack has been plagued by production problems for the past two years which have led to significant impairments and losses.\n\nIn its full-year earnings report on Dec 30, the company said it expected performance in 2014 to remain affected by production issues, changing market demand as the industry goes through a cyclical downturn, continued intense competition, loss of customers due to unstable product quality, slowing growth in China and inflation.\n\nMainboard-listed China FlexPack has reported losses for two years in a row.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They chose different treatment options - one costing way more than the other - and emerged with vastly different outcomes.\n\nThe expensive option\n\nMr A arrived at the emergency centre with chest pain and signs of a major heart attack involving the main heart artery, which supplies the main pumping chamber of the heart.\n\nAfter discussion with the heart specialist, he opted for immediate opening of the heart artery with balloon catheters and insertion of stents, which are small metallic mesh tubes used to open up narrowed heart arteries. The procedure is known as Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or PCI.\n\nIn a major heart attack , every minute counts, as more and more heart-muscle cells die with each passing minute.\n\nMr A was brought immediately from the emergency department to the Invasive Cardiovascular Laboratory, where a PCI was performed successfully. He returned home a few days later and was able to return to his usual routine shortly after.\n\nThe 'cheap' option\n\nMr B also arrived in hospital with a major heart attack involving the main heart artery supplying to the heart.\n\nInstead of an emergency PCI, he opted for the cheaper treatment - the infusion of a clot-dissolving agent, which is supposed to dissolve the clot.\n\nAs most heart attacks occur as a result of the formation of a blood clot blocking an already-narrowed heart artery, an infusion of a clot-dissolving agent has been the standard treatment - at least, before PCI became the standard. The use of clot-dissolving agents continues to be the practice in many hospitals, particularly those unable to provide acute PCI services. The success rate of clot resolution generally varies from 40 to 60 per cent, although it has been reported that success rates of beyond 80 per cent has been reported with the use of newer agents.\n\nBut clot-dissolving agents do present a one per cent risk of bleeding in the brain and a few per cent risk of bleeding elsewhere in the body.\n\nUnfortunately for Mr B, the clot-dissolving medication failed to open up his blocked heart artery. As a result, a significant portion of his heart muscle progressively became damaged, compromising its pumping action.\n\nHe went into shock and his blood pressure plunged. Despite the attention he received in the intensive-care unit, his persistently-low blood pressure led to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, causing acute kidney failure.\n\nThe family then gave consent to open the heart arteries with stents. By then, the heart pump muscle was so extensively and severely damaged that, despite the surgery, his heart stayed weak and his blood pressure, persistently low.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to save his life, an artificial heart device was implanted in him. This stabilised his condition, but his problems were far from over: he needed dialysis for his failing kidneys.\n\nWhile attempting to save a few tens of thousands by going for the treatment option that cost some hundreds of dollars, the family's decision unfortunately led to a significantly poorer outcome for the patient, who now has life-long disabilities which will affect his quality of life; he will also be burdened with long-term healthcare costs which are not insignificant for the average family.\n\nAdded to this, his initial bill of some hundreds of dollars for the clot-dissolving medication had ballooned to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nMaking the best decision\n\nIn a major heart attack, both emergency PCI and infusion of clot-dissolving agents are acceptable options.\n\nEmergency PCI can only be performed in hospitals with experienced heart specialists, highly-trained staff, facilities to perform the procedure and 24-hour service. Infusing clot-dissolving agents requires no special facilities and can be ordered by any heart specialist.\n\nFrom a financial viewpoint, the cost of an emergency PCI could cost 10 times more, so clot-dissolving drugs may seem to be a more attractive option.\n\nUnfortunately, the cheaper option does come with some trade-offs - its lower success rate and higher risk of bleeding in the body, including bleeding into the brain. In the case of Mr B, the \"cheap\" option cost him dearly in terms of his quality of life and the final cost of medical care.\n\nIn a major heart attack, there is no doubt that emergency PCI is the best choice for patients. While the \"cheap\" option of infusing clot-dissolving agents is routinely provided in hospitals which are unable to provide emergency PCI, one should go for the PCI if it is available.\n\nThe truth of it is, in medicine, one can rarely have \"cheap and good\" treatment options.\n\nMaking the optimal choice\n\nLast but not least, when the decision has been made to proceed with an emergency PCI, wherever possible, one should opt for newer-generation stents which have polymers that are bioabsorbable.\n\nTwo commonly-available devices are the Bioabsorbable Vascular Scaffolds (BVS) by Abbot, and the Synergy stent by Boston Scientific. Both are American companies.\n\nThe BVS is almost completely made of a polymer material which has drugs and is designed to be completely absorbed by the body in three years; the Synergy stent is a cylindrical metallic mesh with a drug-polymer coating that is absorbed after a few months.\n\nThe greatest advantage with these newer-generation stents is that you can stop taking blood-thinning agents after a few months. The higher cost associated with the use of these stents is balanced by the significant advantage of not having to take blood-thinning drugs for the rest of one's life. It means that when you need to have your teeth extracted or need surgery, you will not need to worry about the stents clotting up when you stop the blood-thinning agents before surgery.\n\nIt also means savings on the cost of consuming blood thinners for decades and avoiding their side-effects.\n\nTherefore, choose wisely and opt for the optimal choice. Unlike cars, you cannot change to a newer version of the stents once they are implanted.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

The group is very selective as to who the first few tenants will be, as they are expected to be \"loss leaders\" vis-a-vis the $12-14 per square foot (psf) - on a stabilised basis - monthly rental target assumption for the project. \"If we have to drop rents to attract them, we might as well attract very good names so that they can help us in the leasing momentum,\" Ms Leong added.\n\nThe trust, which makes semi-annual payouts, will issue DPU for the July 1-Dec 31, 2013, period of 4.13 cents, a 1.2 per cent year-on-year rise.\n\nBooks closure date is Feb 3 and payment expected on Feb 28.\n\nThe group's full-year 2013 DPU of 8.14 cents is also up 1.2 per cent from FY2012 and translates to a distribution yield of 5.6 per cent based on the counter's $1.45 closing price yesterday. It ended four cents lower. CCT's results were released before the market opening.\n\nSetting a benchmark in valuation transparency for a major Singapore Reit, CCT revealed discount rates and terminal yields used by independent valuers for its properties.\n\nThe trust's investment properties excluding CapitaGreen are worth $6.5798 billion as at Dec 31, 2013, up 3.1 per cent year on year. The group's net asset value per unit stood at $1.67 at end-2013, taking into account distributable income payable to unitholders. This is five cents higher than the end-2012 figure.\n\nCCT's Q4 gross revenue rose 1.5 per cent year on year to $98.6 million due to higher revenue contribution from most properties except for One George Street due to cessation of yield protection income last July.\n\nHigher property tax and operating expenses eroded net property income, which dipped 1.3 per cent to $74.2 million. However, distributable income rose 3.3 per cent to $60.2 million due mainly to lower interest expense.\n\nCCT's Grade A office properties posted 98.4 per cent occupancy at end-\n\n2013, 2 percentage points higher than end-December 2012.\n\nThe group's monthly average office portfolio rent climbed 6.4 per cent year on year to $8.13 psf.\n\n\"We saw brisk leasing activity at CCT's properties aggregating about one million sq ft of total net lettable area signed in FY2013, of which 33 per cent were new leases,\" said Ms Leong.\n\nAmid limited new CBD office supply in 2014 and a vacuum in 2015, \"we expect rents to rise at a sharper rate in H2 2014\", Ms Leong said. \"CCT is well positioned to benefit from positive rent reversions for the remaining 10 per cent of office leases based on portfolio gross rental income that are due for rent review and renewal in 2014.\"\n\nCCT's 29.3 per cent gearing ratio at end-December 2013 - a slight improvement from 30.1 per cent at end-2012 - means it has $1.2 billion debt headroom for investment opportunities, assuming 40 per cent gearing ratio. Eighty per cent of CCT's borrowings are on fixed-rate basis giving certainty of interest expense.\n\nOne George Street's valuation rose - for the first time since 2011 - on the back of higher rent and occupancy. As at Jan 7 this year, the building's occupancy has reached 99.5 per cent. Following the cessation of yield protection last July, net property income from the asset for FY2014 is expected to decline by no more than $4.5 million from FY2013, CCTML said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/grappling-tweetstorms", "site_title": "Grappling with Tweetstorms", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGrappling with Tweetstorms\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jan 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN the world of hashtags and retweets, the Tweetstorm finally made its way to Singapore's shores on Wednesday. Of it, the poet TS Eliot might have been tempted to recycle a line: This is the way a storm breaks - not with a bang but a whimper.\n\nFor the benefit of the wider world where pronouncements of any weight tend to contain more than 140 characters, a Tweetstorm is essentially an online protest. Twitter users collectively adopt a cause, craft a message and send out Tweets at an appointed time, the barrage of messages creating a \"storm\", as it were.\n\nOn Wednesday, the cause that made its rounds here was for the release of five men charged with vandalism that made references to hacktivist collective Anonymous. The response can be charitably described as limp - fewer than 100 Tweets bearing the requisite hashtag were sent. It bears pointing out that a brief spike occurred on Wednesday night after a regulator's press briefing brought the campaign to mainstream attention.\n\nFor perspective, Tweetstorms have been used for other - some would say weightier - issues. Last June, as Texas State Senator Wendy Davis began her 13-hour filibuster speech against a Texas anti-abortion bill, the Tweetstorm hashtagged #standwithwendy was unleashed. This hashtag racked up 547,000 Tweets - one of them sent by President Barack Obama - during the course of Ms Davis' speech. What began as an obscure political stunt soon went viral. The bill did not pass, euphoria abounded and the Twitterverse rejoiced, for the people of the Internet had spoken, it appeared, and been heard.\n\nBut the following month, Texas Governor Rick Perry pushed the bill through in a special session, and it was eventually passed, before making several protracted rounds in the court of appeals. And so it ended, not with a bang but a whimper.\n\nEven so, 140 characters can do very much. In restive countries like Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen, protests have been organised over Twitter. Governments have come to fear the platform, and for good reason. And yet the outcomes have diverged tremendously. Today, Egypt is under military governance, but Tunisia has produced a new constitution lauded for its progressiveness.\n\nAs Singapore grapples with Tweetstorming, the evidence elsewhere is that Twitter is the perfect tool for igniting passions - but in the sustained fanning of the flames, it falls short. Real change continues to be unglamorous and bureaucratic, thick with policy and consultations. Singapore is well-acquainted with such things.\n\nIn the future, the challenge for the authorities will lie in distinguishing between real and perceived threats, and calibrating responses accordingly. Singapore's first Tweetstorm was no Arab Spring, but was it simply a passing online skirmish? In the mounting complexity of social media, there will be much value in being able to distinguish between a bang and a whimper.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I don't think you'll see a lot more consolidation, it's hard to do.\"\n\nAerCap's agreement to buy Los Angeles-based ILFC from insurer American International Group, which gets a 46 per cent stake in the merged business, will create a lessor with 1,329 planes, narrowing the gap to General Electric Co-owned market leader Gecas, which has 1,635 aircraft.\n\nBelow the big two are half dozen players whose owners are unlikely to want to exit the industry given record demand for new aircraft and the surge of market interest in lessors likely to be spurred by the ILFC deal, Mr Kelly said.\n\n\"As a result of this transaction the stock-market valuation of leasing companies has improved significantly,\" he said at the Global Airfinance conference in Dublin. \"There's more of a willingness to look at it.\"\n\nThe ILFC takeover should close in April following regulatory clearances, Mr Kelly added.\n\nAmong listed companies focused primarily on plane leasing, AerCap has surged 147 per cent in the past 12 months, while Air Lease Corp, set up by ILFC founder Steven Udvar-Hazy, has posted a 43 per cent gain. Both businesses trade in the US.\n\nLessors provide close to half the more than US$100 billion in financing required to fund annual jetliner purchases, with a spate of mergers paralleling consolidation among top airlines, Jeff Knittel, who runs the transportation-finance unit of New York-based CIT Group, said earlier this week at the Airline Economics Growth Frontiers conference, also held in Dublin.\n\nIn the past 18 months, Mitsubishi UJF Lease & Finance Co spent US$1.1 billion to buy Oaktree Capital Group's Jackson Square Aviation, and Babcock & Brown Aircraft Management sold a 50 per cent stake to Canada's Onex Corp Earlier deals included Schiphol, Netherlands-based Aercap's 2009 takeover of Genesis Lease and Aviation Capital Group's US$2.5 billion purchase of Boullioun Aviation Services from WestLB in 2005.\n\nMr Kelly also listed CIT, Mitsubishi and ACG as companies that might be considering the IPO option.\n\nThe AerCap-ILFC merger has broken a log-jam in the industry after New York-based AIG failed to sell its leasing arm to Chinese bidders who missed specified deadlines, John Higgins, chief commercial officer at Dublin-based lessor Avolon, said at the Airline Economics event.\n\n\"It certainly removes the uncertainty around ILFC that wasn't good for the market in general, either for aircraft values or manufacturers,\" he said. \"We now have clarity with a blue-chip buyer, which contrasts with a murkiness before.\"\n\nAvolon, controlled by private equity firms including Oak Hill Capital, Cinven and CVC Capital Partners, is looking at a timeframe of two years or so for going public or finding a buyer, Mr Higgins said. AWAS CEO Ray Sisson said in November that Terra Firma Capital Partners, owner of the Irish lessor since 2006, would seek an exit by March 2016, either via a sale or an IPO process starting this year.\n\nWhile lessors have increased the percentage of aircraft funded annually to more than 40 per cent from about 15 per cent two decades ago, new sources of funding including wider access to capital markets mean they may have plateaued.\n\nAirbus Group, where 44 per cent of 648 deliveries were funded via lessors last year, expects the proportion to start easing off from this year, Nigel Taylor, director of aircraft finance, said at the Airline Economics event. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The counter closed trading at 17.9 cents yesterday.\n\nMuch lies at stake for JES International on this question.\n\nIf Mineriver were to realise its potential, it would be a dream come true for struggling JES, which owns a shipyard in the Jiangsu province.\n\nOvercapacity in the Chinese shipbuilding industry and a global slowdown in demand for shipping vessels have caused the firm to sink into the red for the past four consecutive quarters. On its balance sheet, current liabilities have overwhelmed current assets in the same period, implying that JES could face problems meeting its short-term obligations.\n\nIn a sign that the weak macro environment is continuing to take its toll on the firm, JES increased its provision for liquidated and ascertained damages in the last quarter to 70.4 million yuan (S$14.9 million) - the highest since it started doing so in the 2011 financial year. The additional provision was made for potential penalties the firm might have to pay for the delayed delivery of vessels in the third quarter of 2013, as the refusal of customers to take delivery of completed vessels in the midst of the downturn affected the production of other vessels at the shipyard.\n\nThe amount of cash and cash equivalents that JES is holding has similarly fallen to 32.4 million yuan as at Sept 30 last year, from 227.31 million yuan a year earlier.\n\nAt the same time, as a result of a monetary tightening policy in China, banks there have been reducing their support to the shipping industry, including JES International, its chief financial officer Patrick Kan told reporters last week, though he added that there are signs of a turnaround.\n\nThe only bright spot for JES is in the offshore marine business, a new area for which the firm just started work end last year, where the firm is seeing strong demand.\n\nSuch dire straits is why JES is betting the farm (or shipyard, in this case) on Mineriver - the $127 million it is paying for a 30 per cent stake in Mineriver represents almost 90 per cent of its market capitalisation.\n\nMuch scepticism, however, remains on the size of Mineriver's resources.\n\nThe firm on Monday sought to dispel these by emphasising that SRK Consulting, which wrote the report, is an established international firm which has done similar work for other firms seeking listings on stock exchanges.\n\nJES also released the JORC (Joint Ore Resources Committee) report on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nThe credibility of the report aside, other questions such as future capital expenditure and operating costs also hang over Mineriver.\n\nMineriver's chief executive Ho Sing Ming said in response to queries from BT that the costs of extraction from the mine are likely to be low.\n\n\"Because ours is a surface mine, and the accessibility of the mine is so good, I don't have a concern that there will be a big difference between resources and reserves (which indicates the current economically mineable part of a resource),\" he said.\n\nMineriver is planning two approaches to developing the mine. Firstly, it will set up its own facilities to produce magnesium-rich serpentine fertiliser and flux, which is used in steel making. As this is done through crushing, it will be relatively low in capex, costing an estimated $30 million, Mr Ho said.\n\nFor the more capex-intensive work of extracting and processing the ore into magnesium, Mineriver will partner larger multinationals that have the resources to do so.\n\nA large cash infusion for Mineriver will come from the $127 million that JES is injecting into the firm, through a combination of cash and share issuance.\n\nSome $2 million out of $7 million in the first tranche payment for the deal has been completed.\n\nTo raise cash, JES could issue bonds, or conduct a rights issue, Mr Kan said.\n\nGiven the capital intensity of mining projects, the latter could be the first of many cash calls that the firm might have to make of its shareholders.\n\nFor JES then, there is no room for error - the deal has to come good. The alternative would, otherwise, be disastrous.\n\nWe wrongly stated that JES had parted with $7 million so far in the deal. JES has pointed out that only $2 million out of $7 million in the first tranche payment for the deal has been completed. We are sorry for the error.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is to \"seek to finalise the terms for the possible offer\".\n\nThe extension came amid a report that OCBC has reached an agreement to buy Wing Hang for about US$5 billion and that the deal was being reviewed by Hong Kong regulators.\n\nNews agencies quoted sources as saying that Hong Kong regulators also need more time to examine the deal because of the coming festive season.\n\nJan 31 falls on the first day of Chinese New Year, a public holiday. Workers usually take at least a half day off on the eve of Chinese New Year to have reunion dinners with their families. Feb 3, the fourth day of the new year, is also a holiday in Hong Kong.\n\nBut in its announcement yesterday, OCBC made it clear that discussions on the deal were ongoing and \"no definitive terms nor formal legal documentation for the possible offer have been agreed at this stage\". After Hong Kong regulators give the go-ahead for the launch of the offer, the two banks still need to announce the transaction and the offer price, before going back for regulatory approvals again.\n\nWing Hang is one of four remaining family-owned banks in Hong Kong. It is 45 per cent controlled by the Fung family and BNY International Financing Corporation.\n\nEarlier this month, OCBC said that it was in exclusive talks until the end of the month to buy Wing Hang Bank. Reports had estimated a price of $5.8 billion, or 1.7 times Wing Hang's estimated 2013 book value. This would be OCBC's biggest purchase to date.\n\nFears that OCBC might overpay have sent its stock down almost 7 per cent year-to-date. OCBC fell seven cents yesterday to close at $9.50.\n\nOn Thursday, Moody's Investor Service said that Wing Hang is a conservative bank that has not grown rapidly in recent years, and it was unclear why OCBC might want to pay that much of a premium over Wing Hang's book value.\n\nBut OCBC's second-largest shareholder, Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, has voiced support. The latter has a 7.7 per cent stake.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The number of potential data breaches - and their threats - is evolving rapidly, and many organisations are finding their defences increasingly on the back foot.\n\nThe reality is that IT departments find it difficult to be as nimble as the people attacking their systems. According to Lloyd's Risk Index 2013, cyber risk ranks third among 50 risks globally among 588 senior and board-level executives polled.\n\nWhat is also becoming obvious is that the cost of a data breach far exceeds that of implementing the right security measures in the first place.

This was mainly due to the opening of Suntec City Mall (Phase 1) and Suntec Singapore following the completion of its asset enhancement initiative (AEI) works.\n\nFor the full year ended December, the DPU dipped 1.7 per cent, from 9.49 cents to 9.328 cents.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/language-ever-evolving-book", "site_title": "Language by the (ever-evolving) book", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nLanguage by the (ever-evolving) book\n\nThe Oxford English Dictionary seeks to be of relevance to both traditionalists of the language and new users in an era of Googled searches and texting\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jan 23, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTO compile a dictionary of nearly every word in the English language was an endeavour typical of Victorian times, complete with white-bearded gentlemen, utter confidence and an endearingly plodding pace. After a quarter-century, the first instalment emerged in 1884. Its contents? \"A to Ant.\"\n\nIn our own impatient age, the Oxford English Dictionary is touch-typing towards a third edition, with 619,000 words defined so far, online updates every three months and a perma-gush of digital data to sort through. Greybeards are scarce today at its open-plan office, just earnest editors frowning at flat screens, occasionally whispering to their neighbours. For all the words here, few are spoken aloud.\n\nThis hush aside, change is afoot at the OED. For the first time in 20 years, the venerable dictionary has a new chief editor, Michael Proffitt, who assumes responsibility of retaining the vaunted traditions while ensuring relevance in an era of Googled definitions and text talk.\n\nIn his first interview since assuming the position in November, Mr Proffitt - a neat 48-year-old in suit and tie who has defined, researched and managed for the OED since 1989 - was respectful of the old ways but equally ready to reconsider the dictionary, characterising it less as the heavy volumes of yore than as a trove of invaluable data.\n\n\"My idea about dictionaries is that, in a way, their time has come,\" he said. \"People need filters much more than they did in the past.\" \"As much as I adhere to the OED's public reputation,\" he said, \"I want proof that it is of value to people in terms of practical use.\" Mr Proffitt advocates links in digitised literature to OED entries; he wants more use by students, whose distinction between \"dictionary\" and \"web search\" is increasingly blurred; he is also willing to license OED data to other companies.\n\nThe OED has stood apart, partly for authoritative definitions but chiefly for its unmatched historical quotations, which trace usage through time. The first edition, proposed in 1858 with completion expected in 10 years, was only finished 70 years later, in 1928. The second edition came out in 1989, at a length of 21,730 pages. Work on the third started in 1994, with hope of completion in 2005. That was off slightly - by about 32 years, according to the current guess of 2037.\n\nPotential online converts\n\nBut for all the admirable rigour of the OED, nowadays the dictionary is probably more revered than used. Part of the problem is price. A copy of the 20-volume second edition costs US$995, with a one-year digital subscription running US$295 - a hard-sell when so many research tools are free online. (Oxford University Press does offer a less extensive cousin of the OED for nothing online, under the confusingly similar title Oxford Dictionaries.) Although the OED survived the Internet upheavals that devastated other reference works, it has yet to capitalise fully on the potential online audience. Mr Proffitt is eager to do so, perhaps with lower prices, certainly with tweaks to the website and less stuffy definitions.\n\n\"A lot of the first principles of the OED stand firm, but how it manifests has to change, and how it reaches people has to change,\" said Mr Proffitt, who speaks with a faint Scottish accent and a lexicographer's habit of qualifying his speech with subheadings, historical references, alternate meanings. However, he is hardly the tweedy scholar of old, referring with satisfaction to having drafted the entry for \"phat\" (\"a. Of a person, esp. a woman: sexy, attractive. b. Esp. of music: excellent, admirable; fashionable, 'cool' \").\n\nRaised in Edinburgh, Mr Proffitt moved south to attend the University of Oxford, where he studied English language and literature. After graduation, he floated from job to job for a spell, then spotted a newspaper ad: The OED was hiring. The editors who grilled him in his job interview later confessed that they'd not expected him to stay long.\n\n\"But it drew me in,\" Mr Proffitt said 25 years later, now at the helm of an enterprise sharply different from the one he had joined.\n\nFor all the tech talk, certain analogue ways linger at the dictionary, notably in the Quotes Room, a repository of word citations on little slips of paper, many mailed in decades ago by volunteers around the world, the most prolific of whom are identified by their distinctive handwriting and referred to fondly by editors: \"That's a Laski,\" or \"This one's from Collier in Australia.\" In the 19th century, the primary obstacle to composing this envisaged dictionary of \"every word occurring in the literature of the language it professes to illustrate\" was tracking down suitable quotations, hidden as they were in myriad dusty tomes. Today, the editorial staff of about 70 people - with access to extensive digital archives - contends with the opposite problem: too much information.\n\n\"We can hear everything that's going on in the world of English for the last 500 years, and it's deafening,\" said the associate editor Peter Gilliver, who once spent nine months revising definitions for the word \"run,\" currently the longest single entry in the OED.\n\nLiterary texts accounted for most quotations in the early days of the dictionary. But the current text is far more inclusive, with blog and Twitter postings, quotations from gravestones, an inscription in a high school yearbook. The objective is to find the earliest and most illustrative uses of a word, not to grant benediction to anything as \"proper English\".\n\nThis prompts a question: If the dictionary merely describes what exists, then why not include every word? When the OED needed to fit into printed volumes, that notion was fantasy. Now, when there is doubt that the third edition will even appear in print, why not use digital space to accommodate everything?\n\nLinguist and writer David Crystal appealed to his peers in a 2012 speech, later published, at the University of Glasgow to create a \"superdictionary - the ultimate, unprecedented and, of course, unpublishable (on paper) collection of all the lexical items in a language.\" This would mean combining major existing dictionaries and adding specialised lexicons, as well as words from global English dialects and new online vocabulary, too. Mr Proffitt was reluctant to place the OED at the forefront of such a project. The dictionary, he said, lacks resources to transform itself this way.\n\nDigitising the dictionary\n\nSimon Winchester, author of two books on the OED, including the 1998 best-seller The Professor and the Madman, expressed mixed feelings about the rapidly digitising dictionary. He hoped, for example, that the third edition would someday come out in print, yet admitted to consulting only the online version now.\n\n\"To me, I didn't want the joy of the OED and the authority that it has to be somehow overwhelmed by the searching abilities, the search engines and so forth,\" he said.\n\nMr Proffitt, taking charge of the most esteemed record of the most global language, may face criticism however he acts. Some will complain if he brings change, others if he resists it. But years of working with words - meanings shifting, enlarging, vanishing altogether, joined by new coinages - offered a particular perspective.\n\n\"It makes you, broadly speaking, more tolerant or calmer or placid,\" he said, hastening to add: \"I don't know whether those words are appropriate. But seeing the historical context often persuades you that what seemed like a hard-and-fast rule is not. And, similarly to the way the language changes, its uses change. The more flexible that people are about language use, then probably the more they thrive.\"\n\nHere are some quirks of the English language that pundits still grapple with:\n\nOMG:\n\nThe first recorded appearance of this breathless acronym for \"Oh, my God!\" comes, surprisingly, in a letter to Winston Churchill.\n\n\"1917 J.A.F. Fisher Letter, Sept 9 in Memories (1919) v. 78. I hear that a new order of Knighthood is on the tapis - O.M.G. (Oh! My God!) - Shower it on the Admiralty!!\n\nLiterally:\n\nWord curmudgeons wince when \"literally\" is used figuratively. Examples of this inversion go back to 1769. Even Mark Twain did it. \"1876 'M Twain' Adventures Tom Sawyer ii. 20 And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth.\n\nLike:\n\nFew words annoy the purist like \"like.\" Plopped into sentences, \"like\" is a rest stop for the hesitant, and not just tweens. 1778 F Burney \"Evelina\" II. xxiii. 222 Father grew quite uneasy, like, for fear of his Lordship's taking offence.\n\nUnfriend:\n\nFacebook was born in 2004.

Gondry and producer Luc Bossi wrote the screenplay.\n\nVian, a significant presence on the French jazz scene, was both a trumpet player and an admirer of jazz greats such as Hoagy Carmichael and Duke Ellington, whose eponymous 1930 composition provides the film with its English language title. In some ways, Mood Indigo's improvisational feel and daring, free-flowing visual style is the movie equivalent of a jazz riff - unfortunately, there are a few too many false notes. The Paris of Gondry's imagination is a colourful pastiche, a magic-realist realm filled with whimsical creatures both human and otherwise, where fun times, cool jazz and sunny dispositions prevail - to begin with, anyway.\n\nColin (Romain Duris), a young man of independent means, lives in a stylish Paris apartment from where he sips cocktails mixed by playing tunes on his piano and plans daily excursions into bohemian society. His well-connected lawyer friend Nicolas (Omar Sy) is a home chef who whips up impressive meals and is also a well-practised exponent of a popular dance called the Biglemoi (it helps to have elongated legs).\n\nColin's best buddy Chick (Gad Elmaleh) is an obsessive collector of the works of the philosopher Jean-Sol Partre and reveals that he's met a soulmate (Aissa Maiga) who is equally devoted to the Partre cause. \"I demand to fall in love too,\" says Colin - whose wish will be granted, naturellement.\n\nAt a party, he meets Chloe (Audrey Tautou) - not coincidentally also the name of an Ellington jazz standard - and they get married after a whirlwind romance. Their happiness is tempered when Chloe develops a chronic illness, caused by a lily flower growing in her lungs.\n\nAs her condition deteriorates, so too does Colin's frivolity, and his once-jolly apartment is now overrun by depressing shades of grey.\n\nMusic is a vital component of Mood Indigo but while the Ellington-infused soundtrack helps to elevate the movie, it doesn't detract from the film's shortcomings - sort of like a nice wine paired with a so-so meal.\n\nDespite some witty moments, cool stop-motion animation and an appealing retro quality, the film feels like an over-indulgent labour of love by Gondry. This is a refreshing departure from the mainstream but ultimately, it fails to engage the viewer. And as the Duke himself might say - it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing.\"\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

An inspection by the authorities revealed that China Paper's subsidiaries in China were making payments in the country for liabilities incurred by the company outside of China.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

Deloitte cited Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways as \"the centrepiece of its commercial success\".\n\nParis Saint-Germain is the fastest climber in this year's Money League, claiming the highest-ever position for a French club. It is the country's sole representative in this year's top 20.\n\nTurkey's Galatasaray and Fenerbahce rose to 16th and 18th respectively, becoming the first teams from outside leagues in England, Germany, Spain, Italy and France to enter the top 20 since the 2005-06 season.\n\nOverall, the combined revenue of the top 20 clubs went up 8 per cent to 5.4 billion euros, which Deloitte noted was a rate \"far outpacing the wider global economy\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are some of the things you will encounter if you take a walk around the Marina Bay area in March, once the sun has gone down.\n\nBut no, it isn't the annual Singapore Night Festival that you're seeing. Instead, it would be the i Light Marina Bay Festival 2014 - the third edition of a biennial night-time light art festival organised by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\nThe three-week festival was initiated mainly to champion the cause of sustainability, so most of the art works were made using recycled products or biodegradable components, while lights are mostly LED lights powered by natural energy sources such as solar or kinetic energy.\n\n\"The various components of the individual installations are sustainable... This allows us to reduce the amount of energy consumed, and goes back to reinforcing the sustainable message that we want the public to be mindful of,\" says Jason Chen, director of place management at URA.\n\nThis year's festival also carries the theme Light+HeART, and has a strong focus on art installations having interactive elements that can involve the local community.\n\nSo it comes as no surprise, when one of the festival curators, Ms Ong Swee Hong, reveals that this interactivity was one of the main criteria they were looking out for in the art works this year.\n\n\"It's not just sculptural but more like people being part of the installation. And not just in terms of interactive technology but even people forming the pieces. For example, maybe artists working with students or schools to create the pieces together,\" explains Ms Ong, director at multidisciplinary design house ONG&ONG, which is curating the i Light Marina Bay festival.\n\nOut of over 80 submissions from all over the world, at least 25 outdoor installations have been selected from 11 different countries.\n\nAlso running in tandem with the festival is the energy-saving campaign called \"Switch Off, Turn Up\". This campaign targets companies especially around the Marina Bay area, and encourages them to switch off non-essential lights and turn up the temperatures of their air-conditioning.\n\nThe previous edition of the campaign chalked up over 200,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) in energy savings from 47 different properties over the three-week period, which was more than the amount of energy used to power that year's festival.\n\n\"This is the only sustainable light art festival in Asia, so we have a very strong positioning, and a very strong identity. The development and the design of these artworks also reinforces the sustainable positioning,\" says Chen.\n\ni Light Marina Bay 2014 runs from March 7 to March 30 around the Marina Bay waterfront, from 7.30pm to 11pm daily.

Only 5 per cent of processes are fully automated and only 25 per cent of processes are technology enabled at the banks examined.\n\nSpeaking to BT, McKinsey's Joydeep Sengupta said that banks in Singapore are very well positioned to take advantage of digital banking trends: \"The digital infrastructure is among the best in Asia, the regulatory environment is conducive to innovation and adoption rates among consumers is high.\"\n\nMr Sengupta, who is senior partner at McKinsey & Company and head of McKinsey financial institutions practice in Asia, however, added that most banks in Singapore have barely scratched the surface in terms of realising the potential. Most of the existing investments have been around creating digital propositions, largely with a branding benefit.\n\n\"In the core areas of fundamentally transforming the business model, either through digitally enabling the bank to improve productivity or digitising the processes to enable significant efficiency and superior customer experience, or offering a customer oriented digital proposition, Singapore banks have much distance to travel.\"\n\nThe report shows that the number of digital banking consumers in Asia could reach 1.7 billion by 2020, with China, India, and the Asean region showing the biggest gains. The Asean region and Australia are expected to have 150 million customers by 2020.\n\nMr Sengupta said that the use of digital banking services has been increasing on average by more than 35 per cent over the past three years. Interestingly, this increase coincides with a drop in (physical) bank branch usage of 27 per cent across Asia. With over 20 per cent of online sales in some products, banking in Asia is already ahead of online sale of groceries (10 per cent) but way behind music which has more than 50 per cent of online sales in the region.\n\nAt a few leading banks, nearly 20 per cent of key product purchases are now completed online. Across Asia, about 25 per cent of pre-purchase decision-making and 40 per cent of post-purchase servicing is conducted through mobile or Internet devices, the report added.\n\nMr Sengupta noted that cybersecurity is one of the biggest challenges that banks face. \"Asian banks are realising that cybersecurity must be treated as a core business function. Many of the current approaches and responses are passive - looking out for known threats, waiting for sensors to trigger alarms and in general often backward looking.\"\n\nAsian banks need a new approach, one that avoids large staff increases and is better able to use existing security assets, such as fraud detection units, compliance and risk resources in a cross functional manner, moving from the alert and reaction approach to one where they can anticipate and hunt for malicious activity affecting their most critical assets, the McKinsey official added.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

It also recorded $23.1 million in share of losses of associates.\n\nThird-quarter revenue for financial year 2014 slumped 30.5 per cent to $172.1 million, while total expenses declined 21.3 per cent to $180.9 million. Both were lower due to the exclusion of Tigerair Australia which ceased to be a subsidiary last year, following the divestment of a 60 per cent stake to Virgin Australia.\n\nAs a result, the group recorded an operating loss of $8.8 million, against an operating profit of $17.9 million previously.

QQE is short for quantitative and qualitative easing.\n\nBut \"Japanese banks have yet to reallocate their growing reserves at the Bank of Japan, and these could increasingly flow into regional growth markets as Japanese corporations begin to diversify their investments\", he said.\n\n\"Financial stability can be undermined during a prolonged period of capital inflows and cheap foreign financing. The policy challenges from strong capital inflows can include the possibility of overheating, sharp capital flow reversals, and excessive real exchange rate appreciation.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in a report yesterday, investment bank Schroders said that while the huge increase in money supply had not initially led to a rise in bank lending to Asia and other emerging regions, there is some evidence that it is now feeding through to Asean economies.\n\nExit from \"unconventional monetary policy\", Mr Shinohara told the Tokyo seminar, is probably some way off for both Japan and the euro area, but \"I believe that the moment to start planning is now\".\n\nBy saying this, the former finance ministry official appeared to be putting himself at odds with BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda who has insisted repeatedly that exit is not on the cards until a 2 per cent annual inflation target is reached.\n\nMr Shinohara said: \"For Japan, as long as steady progress is being made towards the 2 per cent target, we do not see a need for additional monetary accommodation.\"\n\nMr Kuroda, however, has insisted on keeping his options open over further easing.\n\nMr Shinohara said that it would probably take \"more than two years\" for the BOJ to exit its super-easy monetary stance once the process does begin.\n\n\"As the BOJ has shifted its asset purchases towards longer-dated securities as well as risk assets, it presents greater challenges for the exit compared to earlier episodes, especially in case debt issuance by the government does not start to decline markedly.\"\n\nA number of tools may need to be used to withdraw liquidity once the BOJ does start to exit, he said, \"starting with the automatic roll-off of short-term securities as they mature, slowing the pace of purchases of longer maturity securities, and eventually raising the interest paid on reserves to mop up excess liquidity\".\n\nOn balance, unconventional monetary policy has been beneficial in staving off financial and economic system collapse following the global financial crisis in 2008, and helping to prevent the break-up of the euro area, Mr Shinohara said.\n\nBut he warned that it \"carries a number of serious risks, largely due to monetary policy remaining very accommodative for an extended period\".\n\n\"Financial stability may be adversely affected if risk-taking behaviour driven by the accommodative monetary policies goes too far. Prolonged asset purchases . . . may also undermine the credibility of central banks, and by extension inflation expectations.\"\n\nHe warned that the policy may be relied upon to do too much, so that the breathing space it offers is not used to enact necessary, but difficult structural reforms to raise long-term growth.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Off-Broadway has yielded two incarnations of Hamlet; A Midsummer Night's Dream directed by Julie Taymor; and yet another Twelfth Night on the way.\n\n\"It's unprecedented in my lifetime, anyway,\" said Michael Sexton, the artistic director of the Shakespeare Society, a non-profit organisation that promotes the study of the playwright and his work. \"It's a happy time for us. There's plenty to enjoy and discuss and disagree about.\" When David Schmidt, a retired drama teacher in Burke, Virginia, was organising a trip to New York for high school students and choosing which tickets to buy for them, he was delightedly overwhelmed by his options.\n\n\"Oh, my God, it was so hard to pick,\" Mr Schmidt said, sounding not unlike the excitable teenagers he oversees. \"It was like being in London. It was like, 'Wow, this is real theatre this year.' \"\n\nBut the glut has also led to marketing challenges. While the productions say this confluence offers a chance to build on one another's success, they also acknowledge, in much more than a stage whisper, that they need to stand out from the pack.\n\nWhen Philadelphia's Pig Iron theatre Company decided to bring Twelfth Night to New York, it could not have known that its well-liked production, which opens on Feb 4, would be following on the heels of a critical and commercial juggernaut: The Shakespeare's Globe theatre's all-male version of that same play, imported from London and starring Tony Award winner Mark Rylance.\n\nSo Pig Iron is doing what it can to convey to audiences, through advertising, word-of-mouth and social media, that the rollicking ensemble nature of its Twelfth Night - with a five-piece Balkan-inspired jazz band onstage for much of the show - will feel \"more like coming to a party\" than to a traditional play, said John Frisbee, the managing director.\n\nMeanwhile, the Acting Company is hard at work selling its own repertory initiative: Hamlet and Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which has not been revived in New York in 27 years.\n\nWith a marketing budget of just $20,000, the company has had to rely on email blasts, print advertising and programme inserts at its off-Broadway theatre to push these two plays, selling them on their complementary nature (they tell different sides of a similar story) and the lower costs of their tickets, which run from $35 to $60.\n\nMargot Harley, co-founder of the Acting Company, said the plays had sold 30 per cent of their tickets before performances began this month. These strong advance numbers, she said, were \"unbelievable,\" and driven by this season's rapacious appetite for classical theatre.\n\n\"In another year, I might not have been so positive,\" Ms Harley said. \"We might have been at nothing.\" On Broadway, attention-grabbing musicals still dominate: They represent about two-thirds of the roughly 30 shows playing there and generate more than US$25 million of the US$30 million weekly gross at the Broadway box office.\n\nBut if, as most theatre producers agree, a straight play needs to sell 40 to 50 per cent of its tickets at regular price to be financially viable, then several star-studded Broadway productions have done that and more.\n\nOn the strength of relentless marketing and the magnetism of Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz that allowed huge swathes of tickets to be sold at premium prices, a revival of Pinter's Betrayal closed this month after grossing US$17.5 million. Producers of the repertory productions of No Man's Land and Godot, with Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, have extended the run another month, to March 30, thanks to audience demand.\n\nTwelfth Night and Richard III have recouped the producers' US$3.1 million investment; during one prime holiday season week, those shows were the only non-musicals in the top 10 of the Broadway box office.\n\nThe season has had its share of highbrow boldface casualties, too: Romeo and Juliet, with Lord of the Rings star Orlando Bloom, found its house plagued by poor reviews and was playing to less than 40 per cent capacity before its doomed lovers went to their final demise in early December.\n\nGroup-sales agencies such as Group Sales Box Office say that straight plays account for about 10 per cent of their overall business, so there is not as much incentive to push them, as they do the flashier Broadway musicals. Where classical theatre is concerned, \"It's like what they say about the bus - if you miss one, there's another one coming around the corner,\" said Scott Mallalieu, president of the group sales site GreatWhiteWay.com.\n\nThat latest one, for the moment, has Frank Langella driving: He plays the title role in a Chichester Festival theatre production of King Lear that opened last week at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\n\nWhile the academy's subscriber base puts it in a different category from commercial productions, the organisation has mounted a \"substantial campaign\" to promote its Lear, said Soo Pak, its vice-president for marketing and communications, including mailings, brochures and outdoor advertising built around Langella's recognisable face.\n\n\"He's definitely the selling point,\" Ms Pak said.\n\nMeredith Lucio, the lead producer of the Bedlam company's four-person off-Broadway repertory productions of Hamlet and Saint Joan, said the group considered its options when it realised that it would face competition from the bigger Broadway repertory plays.\n\nBut, Ms Lucio said, \"We decided that for our shows, it would actually help us rather than hurt us. We knew there was going to be a conversation about the classics and Shakespeare and repertory.\" In its advertising and messaging, Ms Lucio said Bedlam is trying to emphasise the accessibility of its performances - \"Our actors' treatment of the language is really understandable at a beginner's level,\" she said - and the chance that its ensemble might contain a future star or two.\n\n\"Mark Rylance started somewhere once,\" she said. \"We are just at the beginning of that trajectory.\" Mr Schmidt, the tour organiser in Virginia, said that he ultimately chose Waiting for Godot, Richard III and Twelfth Night for his groups, partly because of the esteem for these productions, and partly because they were plays that high-school students do not often get to see.\n\nHe opted against Lincoln Center theatre's production of Macbeth, now closed, which was not as well reviewed and whose lead actor, Ethan Hawke, whom he felt would be too distracting to impressionable young theatregoers.\n\n\"They probably would have fallen in love with Ethan Hawke,\" Mr Schmidt said. \"But then they might not actually be listening to Shakespeare.\" - NYT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Most are focused on the vehicle financing restrictions and hope they will be eased but at least one motor distributor would like to see a more serious effort in the comprehensive electrification of Singapore for a cleaner and more sustainable automotive future.\n\n\"This would go beyond the car industry per se and involve building and property owners, as well as parking operators to incentivise them for installing charging facilities for electric vehicles,\" says an executive.\n\nBut more than that, he would like to see some indication that electric or plug-in hybrid cars will attract certain incentives. \"It doesn't have to be a permanent subsidy, maybe for early adopters only. For helping people to breathe cleaner air.\"\n\nHowever, future mobility is hardly at the top of most wishlists. That has to be the loan curbs. On Feb 25 last year, a 40 per cent cash downpayment became mandatory if the OMV or open market value of the car being bought is below $20,000, and 50 per cent if the OMV is above $20,000.\n\nThe maximum repayment period was also halved to five years for all loans. Together with a tiered ARF or additional registration fee structure, car ownership became even more expensive overnight.\n\nKarsono Kwee, executive chairman of the Eurokars Group that represents Rolls-Royce, Porsche, Mini and Mazda here, hopes that the Budget would relax the vehicle financing restrictions. \"It is affecting all segments. I hope the government will reconsider the loan curbs, both in terms of the quantum and tenure.\"\n\nMr Kwee adds that buyers will eventually come to terms with the tiered ARF structure but the up to 50 per cent cash downpayment has affected the industry.\n\nRon Lim agrees. The general manager of Tan Chong Motor Sales, which distributes Nissan, hopes that the restrictions can be loosened in the face of an increasing COE supply later this year.\n\n\"We anticipate higher vehicle deregistrations from the second quarter of this year will be reflected in the COE quota from August onwards, so the government can consider easing the curbs. This will make it less painful for those who have been eyeing a new car purchase for a long time.\"\n\nThe loan curbs are on Andre Roy's wishlist too but the CEO of Wearnes Automotive is looking beyond new cars to used cars too. This is because when used car values are low - due to low demand - prospective buyers of new cars find it hard to upgrade.\n\n\"It would be nice to see the easing of the loan restrictions on cars imposed last year,\" says Mr Roy, whose company represents Bugatti, McLaren, Bentley, Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, Infiniti and Renault in Singapore. \"If not new cars, at least used cars to support their value in the market place.\"\n\nOne director of a mid-sized dealership also believes used car financing rules should be relaxed but for a different reason. \"It is too harsh for this segment of buyers. If someone can't afford a new car, at least give them a chance to buy a used car.\"\n\nBut otherwise, he is not optimistic about any Budget goodies. In fact, he is hoping no new punitive measures are introduced. \"I am very worried if the government does something else, like tweak car taxes further or relook car financing. But actually, I don't think it can get much worse because we are probably at rock bottom already. Just look at the COE situation now.\"\n\nThe last point is a reference to the current COE quota. The monthly allocation of Cat A and Cat B COEs for the upcoming February to April 2014 quota will be one of the smallest since 2010. Only the first half of 2013 was lower.\n\nIt is the size of the COE quota that is also the cause of a luxury car dealership boss's pessimism regarding any good news. \"Are you kidding? No way should you expect anything. There are barely enough COEs and you think they will lift the loan curbs?\"\n\nThen again, perhaps some could really be hoping for too much because the vehicle financing restrictions may not even be part of the Budget. The head of another luxury dealership says: \"Last year's loan curbs were not included in the Budget speech but announced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore - after the Budget was delivered.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The system's flaws were fixed by November - for which trade data released in December was accurate, IE said.\n\nOctober 2013's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) was said to have grown 2.8 per cent, when it had shrunk 2.7 per cent.

This represents about 97.2 per cent of its market capitalisation of approximately $405.6 million based on the closing price of $0.76 per share on Wednesday.\n\nSunVic expects to use the proceeds to reduce its bank borrowings as well as to continue to grow its intermediate chemical business in China through the setting up of new facilities and expansion of new sales channels.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Others speculated that the judges were simply nervous that Russia's Pussy Riot, had they won, would do something embarrassing on stage and, hence, set the inaugural art awards on the wrong (or is it right?) track so early in its history.\n\nThe speculations weren't entirely baseless, considering that finalist Fiona Lowry told the media she was advised by the organisers not to show her paintings of nudes - which form the bulk of her art - but instead put up her \"safer\" landscape works for the finalists' exhibition in Suntec City.\n\nOne thing's for sure - it is not likely that digital/video category winner Daniel Crooks, who beat Pussy Riot, will be remembered in history as well as the latter - even if Crooks's digitally manipulated videos that stretch and distort reality are really quite mesmerising to watch.\n\nIndeed, now that the dust has settled, it would be a good time to clear one's head of Pussy Riot's ravishing Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and focus instead on the art on display at the Crescent Room at Suntec City Mall.\n\nEach of the 20 finalists, whittled down from 500 submissions from around the greater Asian region, gets to show just one or two works at the free exhibition. And though they're hardly enough to understand the breadth and depth of each artists' practice, they're enough to pique one's interest and curiosity.\n\nAustralian photographer Trent Parke, for instance, clinched the top prize in the photography category. His two black-and-white snapshots of the Australian landscape - one showing an aboriginal woman carrying a white baby, the other showing wild rodeo horses - are sufficiently startling and enigmatic, reflecting his uncanny ability to capture life on the run.\n\nAnother standout is Indonesia's Jompet Kuswidananto, the winner of the installation category. His large Cortege of the Third Realm shows a row of invisible horses fitted with visible saddles and nosebands. The saddles are loaded with musical instruments and trunks of costumes, evoking a strong carnivalesque spirit even without having to depict actual people and animals.\n\nKorea's Seoung Wook Sim, winner of the sculpture category, also impresses with his harsh, all-black sculpture that offers a sneak peek of what the world might look like post-Apocalypse. In a similar vein, China's Yang Yongliang's dystopian images of overcrowded cities competing with nature for space are remarkably compelling.\n\nPerhaps somewhat predictably, Australian painter Ben Quilty took home the prize in the painting category and emerged as the overall winner for the Eye Awards for Contemporary Asian Art 2014. His figurative works executed in rapid, partial-impasto style should find ready buyers when he exhibits them at his first solo show at the Saatchi Gallery of London - the coveted prize on top of a cash prize of US$50,000.\n\nThe Prudential Eye Awards, founded by art patron David Ciclitira and his wife Serenella, selects works in five categories - painting, photography, sculpture, installation and digital/video art.\n\nWhile the awards aims to honour the best in \"greater Asia\" - a term taken broadly to comprise 28 countries including Australia, Russia and Saudi Arabia - the selected works are far from being a definitive representation of art in the region. Notably, half of the finalists are East Asian and South-east Asian, while the other half are Australians and Russians. No South Asian or Middle Eastern artist made the cut, a surprising omission considering the strength of the art scenes in those regions.\n\nPrudential Eye Awards exhibition is on from now till 5 February at the Crescent Room, Level 2, Suntec City Mall. Free admission to public, 10am to 10pm daily\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Construction is expected to take about 24 months.\n\nProvisional permission was previously obtained in July 2010 from the Urban Redevelopment Authority to increase the plot ratio on the hospital's existing land from 4.2 to 5.6, representing an additional increase in GFA of 9,534.98 square metres.\n\nThis means Raffles Medical will have a combined additional GFA of 20,612.34 square metres, expanding its healthcare facilities at North Bridge Road from its GFA of 28,604.94 square metres to 49,217.28 square metres.\n\nBoth the existing hospital site and the adjacent site are 99-year leasehold properties with a coterminous period with effect from March 1, 1979.\n\nThe group said that the acquisition is a strategic opportunity to expand its existing core business of providing health and healthcare services. The additional space will be used for expansion of inpatient and outpatient facilities as well as training of doctors, nurses, ancillary staff and research.\n\nThese include expanding its range of sub-speciality centres and developing a number of centres for excellence, such as for cancer, heart diseases, infertility, and spine and joints.\n\nLoo Choon Yong, Raffles Medical's executive chairman, said: \"The proposed extension will offer a runway for the hospital's expansion and growth for the next 10 years, and contribute to Singapore's vibrancy as a medical hub by offering integrated facilities and services for healthcare services, life sciences, research and teaching.\"\n\nRaffles Hospital started operations in 2001 and has since developed into a full-fledged tertiary facility providing medical services in more than 35 specialities.\n\nRaffles Medical shares closed trading yesterday at $3.09, up one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cat E - the open category that tracks Cat B - fell $190 to $78,810.\n\nMeanwhile, Cat C - for goods vehicles - rose $1,112 to $50,001, while Cat D - for motorcycles - increased $715 to $2,704.\n\nThe sales manager of a volume dealership said that business has been \"quiet\" over the past two weeks. \"Most people want to wait and see because they expect Cat A premiums to fall,\" he explained. \"The softening property market is also making some people more cautious.\"\n\nFrom next month, Cat A will be reclassified to include an engine output limit of 97 kW or 130 hp. The move is to keep luxury models, which have been blamed for soaring premiums, out of this traditional bread-and-butter segment.\n\nBut the sales manager also pointed out that prospective big car buyers have been staying away. \"You can see from yesterday's bids that Cat B is also weak, with bidding action hotting up only in the last few minutes before the close of the tender.\"\n\nHe attributed this to the vehicle financing restrictions implemented last February to cool the market. \"The mandatory 50 per cent cash downpayment is really biting. Usually, we get a bonus boost around now, but not this year.\"\n\nWith many models moving to Cat B next month, the market expects the Cat B premium to climb slightly and the Cat A premium to fall by at least $10,000.\n\n\"A lot of cars will be getting out of Cat A and going into Cat B. But I think it is anybody's guess how much Cat A will drop and how high Cat B can rise,\" said the boss of a European dealership.\n\nHe has two reasons for saying this. One is the continuing effect of the loan curbs. \"Even if the Cat A premium falls by $10,000, the 40 or 50 per cent cash downpayment will still be painful,\" he explained.\n\nThe other reason is the smaller quota size. For the February to April 2014 quarterly quota, there will be 1.5 per cent fewer Cat A COEs (717 per month), 6 per cent fewer Cat B COEs(701) and a hefty 26.8 per cent cut in Cat E COEs (382 monthly).\n\nThis makes the upcoming quota the second smallest since 2010. Only the monthly allocation in the first half of 2013 was lower.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A 5 per cent option deposit totalling some $29 million has already been paid.\n\nThe purchase price for Westgate Tower works out to about $1,900 per square foot based on its net saleable area of about 305,000 sq ft. Low Keng Huat has indicated that the deal was done for long-term investment purposes.\n\nLocated next to Jurong East MRT station, Westgate Tower is the office component of the Westgate integrated development (which also includes the Westgate shopping mall) and is currently under development. It is expected to be completed by the end of this year.\n\nCapitaLand expects to book a net gain of about $90 million upon the strata offices obtaining their temporary occupation permit. This will not have a material impact on the property giant's net tangible assets (NTA) per share, but would have boosted earnings per share (EPS) for the period ended Sept 30, 2013 from 16.6 cents to 18.7 cents assuming the deal was completed on Jan 1.\n\nLow Keng Huat said the purchase of Westgate Tower should not have a material impact on both its NTA per share and EPS for the current financial year ending this month.\n\nShares in CapitaLand fell one per cent to $2.87 yesterday, while the counter for Low Keng Huat dropped 0.7 per cent to 68.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even so, price increases slowed to less than the 10-year average last year because of rising long-term interest rates and tougher mortgage-lending standards, UBS said.\n\n\"Despite slower momentum, valuations in the Swiss owner-occupied housing market have reached a high,\" UBS economists Claudio Saputelli said. \"This has further increased the risk of a correction.\"\n\nThe Swiss National Bank (SNB) has sounded the alarm about the property market overheating in a bid to prevent a repeat of the real estate crisis of the 1990s.\n\nThe UBS Swiss Real Estate Bubble Index rose to 1.20 points in the third quarter from a revised 1.15 points in the second, according to the most recent report in November.\n\nA reading above two would indicate a bubble.\n\n\"We've been in a risk zone for more than a year,\" Mr Saputelli said. Still, prices are rising more slowly than they did in the 1990s, he said.\n\nThe average price growth for condos was 3.5 per cent last year, while single-family-home values climbed 4.5 per cent, UBS said in its report.\n\nThe SNB has warned about an increase in risks in the country's real estate market as record-low borrowing costs lifted demand and fuelled inflation. The central bank initiated a capital buffer for banks that was introduced by the government in February 2013.\n\nThe buffer, which banks have had to comply with since Sep 30, currently is set at one per cent of risk-weighted assets tied to residential mortgages to guard against losses on loans. At the behest of the SNB, the government can raise it to as much as 2.5 per cent.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's monthly economic survey published on Tuesday, 71 per cent of economists expect the buffer to be raised, and more than half of those predicting an increase see that happening before the end of March.\n\nThe median estimate is for the measure to be boosted to 2 per cent.\n\nUBS is due to publish the next bubble-index report on Feb 5. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Japanese banks are no longer lending against stock purchases as they did then, but are pumping money into property instead.\n\nThe former TSE president acknowledged the need to diversify the assets available to Japanese investors and disclosed that in this regard, plans are underway to enable such investors to direct money towards projects in Asia via the infrastructure bank.\n\nHe added that the Japan Exchange Group's introduction of new listings of overseas companies to supplement the existing menu of offerings in the exchange will include the TSE's first foreign listing since Citicorp in 2007; a Canadian company is also set to list.\n\nMr Saito voiced concerns about Chinese companies that have applied for listings on the TSE, on the back of one of the listings being abandoned when the chairman absconded with the firm's money; in another case, a company was found not to have facilities it had claimed to have.\n\nSimilar problems have been encountered by exchanges in the US and Singapore, he said.\n\nWhile major business corporations in Japan are sitting on large cash reserves and do not need to raise money from the market, smaller Japanese firms - essential to maintaining employment - are often starved of funds. The Japan Exchange Group has plans to address this issue through its listing policy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

To date, 99.9 per cent of the Series A CPPUs had either been converted or redeemed.\n\nDuring the quarter, gross revenue slipped 3 per cent year-on-year to $28.77 million, as the weaker Australian dollar and lower occupancy for Central Park offset a 7.5 per cent increase in gross revenue for its Singapore properties.\n\nNet property income fell 4 per cent to $22.12 million, because of the Aussie dollar, Central Park's occupancy and an absence of income from properties in Japan that were sold in October 2012.\n\nDistribution income rose 33 per cent to $13.7 million.\n\nFinance costs fell $1.6 million to $5 million due to lower interest expense and no capitalised borrowing costs expensed off.\n\nAs at end-2013, FCOT's portfolio comprised five quality commercial buildings in Singapore and Australia, representing a combined appraised value of about $1.8 billion.\n\nIts portfolio occupancy rate was 97.1 per cent as at Dec 31, - 97.1 per cent and 97 per cent for Singapore and Australia respectively - providing room for further income growth from higher occupancy.\n\nPortfolio weighted average lease term to expiry (Wale) is about 4.4 years, anchored by the long Wale of Caroline Chisholm Centre of 11.5 years.\n\nThe properties recorded rental reversions of up to 20.2 per cent for leases which commenced in Q1 FY2014. New leases include AEP Investment Management, TownHall Clinic, Pacorini Metals (Asia) and Aeroflex Asia.\n\n\"Our properties continue to record rental reversions and the new Telok Ayer Mass Rapid Transit on the Downtown Line which opened on Dec 22, 2013 will increase the connectivity to China Square Central and boost its attractiveness as an office accommodation,\" said Low Chee Wah, CEO of Frasers Centrepoint Asset Management (Commercial), which manages FCOT.\n\n\"We will ride on this momentum while continuing our efforts to drive further growth for the Trust.\"\n\nThe DPU will be paid out on Feb 28.\n\nThe counter closed 1.5 cents higher at $1.27 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

To ensure that the funds do not end up in the pockets of corrupt generals and officials, the government is implementing a strict regimen of accountability and transparency in the military's procurement operations.\n\nWhere, in previous administrations, a documentary lapse by a sole bidder could have been ignored, Mr Fernandez's committee is now following \"a rigid pass-or-fail system\" in which a single error could invalidate a bid, he said.\n\nDespite the rejection of its bid, all is not lost for KPM. Mr Fernandez said a rebidding will be held next week and KPM can submit a fresh bid - which, he expects, will contain the necessary corrections.\n\nKPM officials have said they will take part in the second bid. The Philippine Navy is one of its biggest clients; major repairs of the navy's largest warships are regularly carried out at its Batangas yard.\n\nThe BRP Artemio Ricarte, for one, is no stranger to KPM. Its first upgrade involving the installation of command-and-control systems, secondary guns, compass and radars was carried out in the Batangas yard in 2005.\n\nThe second upgrade, for which KPM is now bidding, will cover hull repairs, and improvements to the ship's electrical plant and its control and monitoring systems.\n\nThe BRP Artemio Ricarte is a 763-tonne Peacock-class corvette which saw service with the British Royal Navy as HMS Starling until it was sold to the Philippine Navy in 1997.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are largely located on the third level of the department store currently, said to be the only part of Parco that is doing well.\n\nPontiac Land Group, which owns and manages Millenia Walk, is in the midst of working out plans for the space that Parco will leave behind. It revealed that no other tenant was leaving apart from Parco.\n\nSaid Michael Su, CEO of Pontiac Land: \"We will be taking Parco's departure as an opportunity to reposition and focus on a renovation and enhancement exercise. In Q2, we will unveil exciting plans for the mall.\"\n\nTalk in the market is that Pontiac is considering converting the retail space for hotel use, as those it owns in the area, such as Conrad Centennial Singapore and the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore, have been performing well. The site Millenia Walk sits on is the same parcel of land that houses the Ritz Carlton and Conrad Centennial Singapore. It has been zoned for hotel use under the Master Plan 2008.\n\nBut Mr Su dismissed such talk, saying: \"We view retail as a viable business and with Parco's departure, we are taking this opportunity to reposition our mall.\"\n\nParco's departure from Millenia Walk comes after it chalked up millions of dollars in losses after tax from continuing operations each year since it moved to the mall in 2010. In 2011, it incurred as much as $8.7 million in losses, filings with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) showed. In 2012, it made a loss of $3.4 million.\n\nIts performance over the past few years contrasts sharply to the time when it first started here in 1995. At that time, it managed what was known as the Parco Bugis Junction shopping complex and a department store at the mall.\n\nSome market observers had predicted that it would not do well, but Parco Bugis Junction managed to register sales of $110 million in its first full year and more than $22 million in rental revenue.\n\nParco sold its stake in Bugis Junction in 2005, and was the appointed retail manager for The Central mall at Clarke Quay between 2006 and 2009.\n\nThe Singapore department store is fully owned by Parco Co Ltd, which has 19 stores in Japan, where it has built a strong reputation for creating successful, bustling shopping complexes out of the most unlikely locations.\n\nIts store at Millenia Walk covers three floors; it includes popular ramen joints such as Keisuke Tokyo and Nantsuttei and restaurants such as Saboten, Tomi Sushi and Ma Maison, which are located on the top floor.\n\nParco is also involved in a fashion design incubator project called Parco next NEXT, where local designers undergo a structured training and mentorship programme and set up shop on the second floor of the department store.\n\nThis is a joint initiative between Parco and the Textile & Fashion Federation (Singapore) (TaFf), with support from government agency Spring Singapore.\n\nBut designers who have set up shop there complain that sales have been poor.\n\nSaid one designer, who declined to be named: \"We are doing very badly. There are very few customers. It's practically a ghost town.\"\n\nIn response to BT's query on the Parco next NEXT programme, Spring Singapore said it was launched in 2010 and will \"run to its fruition\" till March this year.\n\nYeo Meow Ling, deputy director of lifestyle at Spring Singapore, said: \"This incubator programme has successfully groomed 55 designers to date and met its objectives.\"\n\nGoing forward, Spring Singapore will continue to help local designers by leveraging on alternative or existing avenues, added Ms Yeo.\n\n\"New-to-market designers who are interested to start their own business can tap the ACE start-up grant. Designers who are keen to gain working experience in the fashion industry can go through TaFf to be matched with suitable local fashion companies.\n\n\"Spring Singapore will work with existing designers who remain committed to grow in the fashion industry both locally and internationally. Furthermore, designers can seek Spring's support to upgrade their business capabilities using Spring's Capability Development Grant (CDG).\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The deadline for a new airport terminal in Fortaleza has been pushed back to 2017. \"The provisional structure is not what we wanted, but it's what we have to resolve the problem in Fortaleza,\" Wellington Moreira Franco, Brazil's Civil Aviation Secretary, told local media late on Monday.\n\nWork on Brazil's chronically overcrowded airports is much further behind schedule than the construction of new stadiums, many of which have missed deadlines and run over budgets, but should be ready for kickoff according to World Cup organisers.\n\nThe Sports Ministry reported in September that half of the airport renovations under way would be completed by May, but those time lines look unrealistic despite workers toiling around the clock in many cities.\n\nThe world will clearly be watching what happens. An estimated 600,000 foreigners are expected at the month-long World Cup, and three million Brazilians are expected to travel during the tournament.\n\nIn Fortaleza, where the six games being hosted will include Brazil's match against Mexico as well as a quarter final, the new terminal is one quarter finished and authorities have decided to break work into two phases, wrapping up in 2017.\n\nDelays at airports in Salvador and Cuiaba have also forced officials to consider backup plans, although Mr Moreira Franco has held back definitive judgment in those cases.\n\nThe worries don't end there.\n\nThe new terminal at the international airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city and a likely stopover for most foreign fans, is still looking skeletal. Airlines are concerned about shifting operations to new gates without enough time ahead of the tournament.\n\nAt the international airport near Belo Horizonte, site of six games including a semifinal, workers over the weekend carried steel bars alongside families pushing baggage carts. The entrance to the airport has been consumed by construction, and travellers stroll past exposed rebar and piles of rubble as workers tear apart an overhead structure.\n\nBrazil's cramped concrete airports are a dramatic example of the outdated infrastructure that has choked economic growth for the past three years. President Dilma Rousseff auctioned rights to upgrade and run five major airports, but the timing of concessions means few improvements will be ready this year.\n\n\"The process of the privatisations took too long, so the reforms have been compromised,\" said Adriano Pires, president of the Brazilian Infrastructure Institute, a consulting group in Rio de Janeiro. New operators of airports in Rio and Belo Horizonte took over after winning auctions in November, leaving little time for real reforms, he said. \"All we'll get is makeup to hide the awful state of the airports. It's the classic quick fix in Brazil,\" Mr Adriano said.\n\nSimilar issues face public transportation projects, many of which have been abandoned or cut back because they were started late or derailed by legal challenges. At least five of the 12 host cities won't complete the projects they promised in time for the World Cup.\n\nEven if planned airport renovations were finished by the World Cup, passenger traffic may exceed capacity by as much as 50 per cent according to a report prepared by the Sports Ministry with the help of outside consultants in 2011.\n\nSenior officials now dismiss those grim forecasts, but their pressure on airlines highlights the unprecedented challenge facing the local aviation industry.\n\nBrazil's government has repeatedly warned airlines to avoid price gouging, but backed off the threat of opening domestic routes to foreign carriers.\n\nTourism officials urged Brazil's two biggest airlines, Gol Linhas Aereas and TAM, the local unit of Chile-based Latam Airlines Group, to follow the lead of smaller rivals Avianca and Azul, which capped the price of flights during the World Cup at 999 reais (S$540).\n\nAuthorities have also authorised nearly 2,000 new domestic flights during the tournament, helping to ease price pressures, but increasing the load on host cities' airports.

That would make it Asia's sixth or seventh largest private bank in an industry dominated by UBS and Citigroup with assets of more than US$200 billion each.\n\nSources said that the discussions between DBS and SocGen were advanced, with one characterising the talks as being at a \"delicate stage\". They declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nA DBS spokeswoman reiterated the bank's stance that boosting wealth management is one of its key strategic priorities, but declined to comment on the possibility of talks. A Singapore-based SocGen spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nDBS and ABN Amro had emerged as front-runners after five suitors were short-listed in the final round of bids, the sources said. It was not immediately clear if ABN Amro was still in the picture.\n\nEconomic growth has led to a surge in Asian millionaires and billionaires. Their combined wealth, at US$6.6 trillion this year, is expected to overtake that of their European counterparts in 2017 and US peers in 2024, according to a Wealth-X and UBS World Ultra Wealth Report.\n\nBut profit margins are thin for the industry's smaller players, especially those managing less than US$20 billion, because the asset bases at those levels don't generate enough revenue to support expensive bankers and cope with rising regulatory costs and technology spending.\n\nSociete Generale's private bank sale follows two major transactions since the financial crisis - the sale of ING's private bank in late 2009 to Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and Bank of America's sale of its Asian and European private banking units to Julius Baer.\n\nThe industry has also seen smaller deals such as the sale of HSBC's private bank in Japan to Credit Suisse and Julius Baer's taking over of Macquarie Group's private banking unit in Asia. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/reduce-rental-costs-help-local-economy", "site_title": "Reduce rental costs to help local economy", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nReduce rental costs to help local economy\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jan 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE Hillford, a 281-unit retirement resort on Jalan Jurong Kechil, sold out within five hours at last Friday's launch. But make no mistake about it: if Sunday's sale of the Panorama condominium in Ang Mo Kio is anything to go by, the residential property market is weakening, in a welcome correction two years before interest rates are slated to go up. Just 60 of the 120 units released for sale at the 698-unit suburban condo project were booked. This translates to first-day sales of 8.6 per cent, which was hardly inspiring. Moreover, prices are said to be between $1,265 and $1,320 per square foot (psf) for various units. Yet when developer Wheelock Properties submitted the winning bid for the site last year, analysts calculated breakeven prices of between $1,180 and $1,300 psf. Again, when the developer does not seem to be enjoying a fat margin, the residential property market cannot be said to be red hot.\n\nA cooling property market is not something to be unduly worried about, because a crash - a sharp fall of 15 per cent or more - is unlikely. Many cash-rich buyers are still waiting on the sidelines. Most Singaporeans buy homes to live in. And even though household leverage has increased in recent years, the percentage of overleveraged buyers is not alarmingly high - estimated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to be 5-10 per cent. Even when mortgage rates spike by three percentage points, overleveraged buyers will increase to only 10-15 per cent. Economists as well as analysts have pointed out that household cash balances remain strong. UBS's Kelvin Tay noted that with a $33 billion rise in CPF Ordinary Accounts from before the global financial crisis to June 2013, the majority of households are not recklessly leveraging, and credit growth alone does not imply a bubble.\n\nBut an unstated assumption is that economic growth will continue as usual. With global liquidity flows shifting from slowing emerging markets to recovering US and Europe, Singapore - battling high costs and limited productivity growth - will not be spared when the quantitative easing (QE) music stops. To ensure Singapore's economy is as strong as possible when liquidity outflows accelerate, the government's attention should be on shoring up the local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) base. In the event of a downturn, SMEs will provide a much-needed buffer to ensure Singaporeans will still have jobs, even while larger multinational companies may have to shed workers to cut costs.\n\nWhile the government has made efforts to cool the residential property market, it should examine ways to cool commercial rentals as well. Anecdotal evidence suggests some egregious examples of businesses forced out when landlords summarily doubled their rents. High rental costs, together with high labour costs, are detrimental to Singapore's productivity drive and dampen entrepreneurship. Larger enterprises have the power to negotiate more favourable terms, but smaller ones are price-takers. The local SME base cannot be ignored as Singapore restructures its economy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He picked up a rock and hit his captain on the back of the head. Before the ship's cook could pull Mr Sabrah away, the captain's blood was everywhere.\n\nThe attack came on Aug 2, after the 67-metre JSM had been tethered in the Greek port of Kiato for more than five months. A Greek court had refused to let the ship leave after a deadly harbour accident. The freighter's owner couldn't be reached, according to the captain, and there was no money for salaries or supplies. The ship had no electricity. The toilets didn't work. Mr Sabrah and the other nine crew members didn't know if they'd ever make it home, they said.\n\nThe men were caught in a legal limbo that ensnares thousands like them around the world. More mariners have been abandoned by their employers than taken hostage by Somali pirates, according to the Mission to Seafarers, a London-based charity. The United Nations has documented cases of 2,379 stranded sailors on 199 ships in the past decade, with many more unreported. In April, international agencies are scheduled to meet in Geneva to consider requiring companies in the US$375 billion shipping industry, which handles about 90 per cent of world trade, to carry insurance or a bond to pay for repatriating sailors when they get stranded.\n\n\"When a ship goes to sea, it goes a long way from the vision of most of society,\" said Bud Darr, a former mariner who worked on abandonment cases as a lawyer for the US Coast Guard. \"But these seafarers are the backbone of our commerce, not just in a commercial sense, but in the things we take for granted - the niceties in life, the consumer goods that we use every day.\"\n\nThe JSM's saga shows the hazards mariners can face. On Feb 14, the ship, captained by Ramez Haddad, a 49-year-old Syrian living in Egypt, arrived in Kiato from Alexandria, Egypt, carrying more than 1,000 tonnes of potatoes. The weather was cool and sunny. While port workers unloaded the potatoes, Mr Haddad said that he went into town and bought chocolates to bring home to his children. The JSM was scheduled to sail on to Turkey and Romania, then return to Egypt with a cargo of soda ash and timber, according to Mr Haddad.\n\nOn Feb 20, the crew prepared to leave. Something went wrong after a tugboat tied up to help them manoeuvre out of the harbour, according to court records and interviews with Mr Haddad and Kiato officials. The tugboat made a wrong turn and started pulling the ship into shallow water, capsized and sank, Mr Haddad said. The tugboat captain died.\n\nMr Haddad appeared in court the next day and the judge absolved him of any wrongdoing, he said. The JSM, however, was ordered to stay in Kiato because the tugboat's owner and the captain's widow were suing to recover damages through a sale of the ship. At first, Mr Haddad said that he wasn't too concerned. He said that he notified the ship's manager, Mohamad Tartousi of Tartousi Shipping in Constanta, Romania, whose job was to oversee the freighter's operations from land. Mr Tartousi said that he would inform the vessel's owner. The JSM was well stocked, and the crew had enough cash for their needs, Mr Haddad said. At worst they would be on their way home in a week or so, he said.\n\nWeeks turned into months. Mr Haddad said that he spoke with Mr Tartousi every so often to update him on the ship's situation, and Mr Tartousi told Mr Haddad he was working to resolve the problem. The crew hadn't been paid and was owed about US$100,000, Mr Haddad said. Mr Tartousi didn't respond to questions concerning the crew's wages.\n\nWhile international conventions recognised sailors' right to repatriation as early as 1926, that means little to those who find themselves abandoned, said Deirdre Fitzpatrick, executive director of Seafarers' Rights International, an advocacy centre in London.\n\n\"The industry is structured in a way that allows seafarers to be abandoned,\" Ms Fitzpatrick said. \"That shouldn't be allowed in this day and age. There is this loophole where a ship owner can walk away and the seafarers are left relying on charity to survive.\" - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Delta was the first major US carrier to report fourth-quarter results.\n\n\"Delta is on the leading edge,\" Mr Neidl said. \"They're riding a wave now and the rest of the industry will benefit. Delta is probably one of the best run airlines in an industry that has a lot of well-run airlines.\"\n\nOther airlines have achieved operating margins since the 2001 terrorist attacks like what Delta forecasts for the current period, though none occurred in the first quarter, Mr Baker said.\n\nDelta, the third-largest US carrier, rose 3.3 per cent to US$32.08 at the close in New York on Tuesday. The company led advances by eight of nine carriers in the Bloomberg US Airlines Index, which climbed 1.9 per cent.\n\nThe six biggest airlines should report combined fourth-quarter net income of US$1.2 billion, according to Michael Linenberg, a Deutsche Bank analyst in New York. He estimated that revenue climbed 6 per cent to US$35.1 billion.\n\nUnited Continental Holdings, Southwest Airlines Co and Alaska Air Group are set to issue results today, with American Airlines Group on Jan 28 and JetBlue Airways on Jan 29.\n\nDelta's full forecast was a \"margin expansion\" this quarter in a range of 6 per cent to 8 per cent, president Ed Bastian told analysts on a conference call. \"We are also expecting to see a strong second and third quarters, which you should see expansion there as well.\"\n\nDelta expects revenue from each seat flown a mile this quarter to climb 3 per cent to 4 per cent from a year earlier, he said. The carrier had 72 days last year without a cancellation and 85 per cent of its flights were on time, chief executive officer Richard Anderson said on the call.\n\nAn expanding economy should lead to growing demand that will let carriers keep raising fares, said David Swierenga, president of aviation consultant Aeroecon.\n\n\"The economy I expect did very well in the fourth quarter and it looks like it's going to continue that way,\" he said. \"I'm pretty optimistic for 2014. Prices will be up, not a whole lot but enough to justify forecasts of margins in that 5 per cent to 6 per cent range.\"\n\nDelta's fourth-quarter profit excluding some items more than doubled to US$558 million, or 65 cents a share, on increased holiday travel, higher fares and lower fuel prices, according to a company statement on Tuesday. That beat the 63-cent average of 16 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSales rose 5.5 per cent to US$9.08 billion, beating the average estimate of US$9.04 billion. Net income was US$8.48 billion, including a US$8 billion non-cash gain from the reversal of a tax valuation allowance.\n\nPassenger traffic at Delta and its regional partners rose 6.9 per cent in December, which included Christmas and return Thanksgiving travel, the airline said on Jan 3. Average fare per mile on Delta's main jet fleet rose 4.5 per cent in the quarter, while total fuel spending on that basis fell 7 per cent.\n\nDelta forecast a first-quarter average jet fuel price of US$2.97 to US$3.02 a gallon. The airline's Trainer oil refinery had a US$46 million loss in the fourth quarter.\n\nDelta last year began a share buyback programme and reinstated a dividend after a decade-long break. The changes, along with a US$10 billion debt reduction plan, helped Delta regain a spot on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index after being dropped in August 2005 ahead of its bankruptcy filing.\n\nIn 2013, Delta paid US$100 million in dividends and spent US$250 million repurchasing stock. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

On top of that, the lease Xtron had at that point would be expiring in (two years' time), so in a sense you are paying for a rental commitment, which Xtron did not have the lease to back up. Commercially, it just didn't make sense.\n\n\"I have been an accountant for many years. This is the first time I've seen people paying rental in advance for eight years.\"\n\nHe also noted that \"there wasn't very much consideration being put in writing (by CHC) as to the reason and the rationale why the church considered this a good arrangement to enter into\".\n\nDPP Ong then showed Mr Sim an email - which had been tendered as evidence last year, in an earlier part of this trial - where Wee said the $7 million was \"just an arbitrary figure\".\n\nMr Sim said that if he had known of this email before, \"it would raise even more concerns on my part as to the real motive behind (CHC) entering such an agreement with Xtron\".\n\nHe also testified that while the audit team was aware of CHC's $11.4 million investment in the SOF, it took \"many rounds of discussion (with CHC, before) it was eventually determined by the church that (the SOF invests in) fixed-income instruments\".\n\nThe prosecution then showed Mr Sim an email from Chew to CHC finance manager Sharon Tan, which said that, in their upcoming discussion of audit issues with Mr Sim, they should \"steer away from the topic of what (the SOF) invests in . . . the $11.4 million outstanding was all to UA, and we don't want that to surface\".\n\nMr Sim said the email would have made him question \"why this information is so confidential that it cannot be surfaced\".\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And that has come at the expense of value-creation activities (which are) extremely important for businesses in Singapore.\n\n\"Because of the size of the domestic market, Singapore businesses need to go abroad and venture into new markets as well, as they look into new ways of doing things (through) innovation.\"\n\nSupported by the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC), KPMG's Pre-Budget 2014 Survey Report aims to highlight the thoughts of businesses here in the run-up to Feb 21.\n\nIt was sent out to both KPMG clients and SICC members between October and November last year, and attracted 159 responses.\n\nWhen asked for their most urgent business concern in the year ahead, 32.7 per cent of respondents cited rising costs and inflation as the issue of paramount importance; 30.2 per cent said manpower restrictions and improving productivity were their top concern.\n\nIn contrast, far fewer companies said they expect to explore new markets (10.1 per cent), invest in new capabilities (5.6 per cent), and drive innovation (1.9 per cent).\n\nAnd while almost all respondents (96.8 per cent) want the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme to be extended beyond its expiry in 2015, close to half (45.2 per cent) want the government to simplify its regulations, policies, and tax and other monetary incentives, to make them more relevant.\n\nThis, companies say, would keep Singapore competitive and attractive to businesses.\n\nIn addition, it would provide more support for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in high-growth phases, but without the resources to deal with complex incentives and regulations.\n\nMr Tay also stressed the need for schemes to be administered based on a company's size and industry: \"A lot of businesses feel that Singapore government agencies should be less broad-based in their administration of some of these policies (and) understand the unique requirements of each sector.\"\n\nEven though more simplified conditions could, in theory, lead to instances of abuse, Mr Tay thinks such cases are likely to be outnumbered by genuine applications by far. \"We tend to focus on fraudsters, but we may overdo things. (By) putting in many roadblocks, a lot of businesses who are genuinely entitled to tax incentives may be kept out altogether ... This needs a balanced (approach),\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/global-economy-poised-transition-growth", "site_title": "Global economy poised to transition to growth", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGlobal economy poised to transition to growth\n\nProspects for the world's economies look brighter in 2014 with positive signs of the US economy strengthening and powering growth of its beneficiaries\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jan 21, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBEFORE you know it, another year has passed, and here we are again wondering what is in store for us in 2014. As usual, 2013 produced its share of uncertainty, yet we ended the year with more questions than we answered. Is the New Year going to be a year of growth especially in the US and will interest rates start to \"normalise\", or are we in for more volatility?\n\nThis year, we expect that with signs that the US economy is picking up momentum, the prospects for the global economy looks brighter. Citi analysts expect a modest reacceleration in global real GDP growth from 2.4 per cent in 2013 to about 3.1 per cent in 2014, the best since 2010, with growth in advanced economies (AEs) up from 1.1 per cent in 2013 to about 2.0 per cent in 2014.\n\nGrowth is likely to be around 3 per cent in the US and UK in 2014-15. On the other hand, Japan's growth is likely to slow significantly during 2014 as the consumption tax hike bites.\n\nEmerging markets (EM) growth may continue to outpace AE growth in 2014, as in every year since 1999. However, the EM-AE growth gap in 2014 is likely to be the smallest since 2002.\n\nAs for monetary policy, although the US has started a modest reduction in its bond buying programme, it is still likely to remain loose across advanced economies, and indeed further loosening in 2014 is expected from Japan and Europe - with the ECB probably setting a slightly negative deposit rate alongside a lower refinancing rate, extra liquidity and enhanced forward guidance.\n\nTapering by the Fed is likely to be completed by some time late this year. However, this may have been already discounted.\n\nHaving said that, a group of advanced economies (probably including the UK, Canada and Australia) may begin to withdraw stimulus in 2015, but are unlikely to tighten enough to trigger significant slowdowns. The European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are unlikely to begin tightening policy until 2017-18 at the earliest.\n\nIn such a diverse situation, we should consider focusing on key themes and position our portfolios accordingly.\n\nIn the US, we would remain invested in selected cyclical growth sectors, although our preference would be relatively more focused on Europe and Japan where liquidity is likely to remain ample.\n\nIn Europe, we prefer core markets which benefit from the global recovery such as the UK, Germany and France. Within the emerging markets, we continue to favour the North Asian markets such as China/Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea as they remain cheap and are prime beneficiaries of the recovery in the US economy.\n\nMeanwhile, we would continue to remain underweight fixed income but within the bonds space, overweight high yields which tend to benefit from growth on lower default risk.

For the same reason, full year DPU fell 4 per cent to 8.4 cents.\n\nExcluding the effects of the rights issue, Q4 DPU would have been 1.96 cents and full-year DPU would have been a historical high of 9.03 cents, said Ascott Reit.\n\nFY2013's distribution of 8.4 cents represents a yield of 6.9 per cent based on Ascott Reit's unit closing price of $1.21 at end-2013.\n\nFor Q4, revenue rose 11 per cent to $83.9 million as a result of additional contributions from properties the group acquired in late 2012 and middle 2013, and a stronger performance from its serviced residences in Belgium and France.\n\nHowever, revenue per available unit (RevPAU) fell 7 per cent to $129 on weaker performances in the Philippines and Japan (arising from depreciation of the yen), and lower average daily rates from its newly acquired China properties.\n\nGross profit was 8 per cent higher than a year ago at $41.6 million compared with $38.5 million, although on a same store basis, it actually fell by $1 million.\n\nFor the full year, revenue was 4 per cent higher at $316.6 million. Gross profit inched up one per cent to $161.2 million.\n\nThe group's serviced residence properties portfolio (including asset held for sale) was revalued at about $3.26 billion, resulting in a surplus of $74.1 million for Q4, against a negative $27.9 million a year earlier.\n\nThe change in value of serviced residence properties will affect the net asset value, but has no impact on the unitholders' distribution, said Ascott Reit. Net asset value at end-2013 was $1.37, against end-2012's $1.35.\n\nOn Ascott Reit's prospects and future plans, Lim Jit Poh, chairman of Ascott Residence Trust Management Ltd (ARTML), said: \"We will actively seek acquisitions in gateway cities in China, Japan, Malaysia, Australia and Europe.\n\n\"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects the global economy to grow in 2014. In line with IMF's outlook, we expect the performance of Ascott Reit's properties to remain stable.\n\n\"Ascott Reit's extended stay business model and geographical diversification will continue to provide income stability.\"\n\nAscott Reit will also aim to further capture organic growth, said Ronald Tay, ARTML's CEO. This will be done through asset enhancement programmes.\n\nLast November, Ascott Reit launched a $253.7 million underwritten renounceable rights issue at a ratio of one unit for every five held by unitholders.\n\nIt said then that about 80.8 per cent of gross proceeds from the issue will be used to reduce debt and 17.7 per cent to fund capital expenditure and asset enhancement initiatives.\n\nAs at end December 2013, Ascott Reit had $204.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $125.2 million a year ago.\n\nYesterday, Ascott Reit's units closed 0.4 per cent lower at $1.235.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Airlines, which are flying bigger planes now, last year cut flights and concentrated the remaining ones at large airports, including Guarulhos, to save money. About 10 per cent more passengers passed through Guarulhos last year, compared with a 3 per cent drop at Rio de Janeiro's Galeao airport, he said.\n\n\"Guarulhos has proved to be a big defensive asset,\" Mr Rocha said in an interview at Bloomberg's Sao Paulo office. \"Growth in passengers in Sao Paulo over the past two years has been much higher than we anticipated.\"\n\nThe success of Guarulhos, the first of three Brazilian airports auctioned to private investors in 2012, will help predict whether future infrastructure contracts will be profitable, said Marcel Kussaba, head of equity research at Quantitas Asset Management. Invepar paid 16.2 billion reais (S$8.8 billion) - almost five times the minimum bid - to run Guarulhos for 20 years, prompting analysts at Raymond James Financial Inc. and UBS AG to say it overpaid.\n\n\"The money they make may boost prospects for infrastructure projects in the eyes of other companies and prompt them to be more aggressive or not when bidding for other licences,\" Mr Kussaba said in a telephone interview from Porto Alegre, Brazil. \"The initial good results in Guarulhos come from improvements in management, showing that room to profit from such projects just by making these kinds of adjustments in the beginning may be bigger than expected.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Corporate finance houses might pick up a tip or two from the way the issue was structured by CCM's sponsor, Prime Partners, while traders could possibly learn a trick or two from trading the associated instruments.\n\nIn December last year, CCM proposed a bonus issue of 10 warrants for each share held, with these Bonus Warrants (BW) bearing an exercise price of one cent each. A total of 1.7 billion warrants were issued by the company with an expiry three years hence in December 2016. At the time, CCM's shares traded at around six cents, so the proposed warrant was priced very deep in-the-money.\n\nSo far, the issue appears pretty much the same as dozens of others. However, it included a novel twist - for every BW that is exercised, the company will issue a \"piggyback warrant\" (PW) that carries an exercise price of 1.1 cents.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

There, the natural gas is reformed into town gas and then piped to customers for heating, cooking and use for other gas-fired appliances.\n\nHowever, other gas retailers are restricted under their licences to sell natural gas only in the JIT areas.\n\nFurthermore, they see City Gas, a subsidiary of listed CitySpring Infrastructure Trust, as threatening to encroach on the JIT area, following its latest joint venture (JV) with Osaka Gas, Japan's second largest city gas player, to market and sell natural gas to industrial customers here.\n\nUnder the JV unveiled last March, City Gas Trust will contribute its existing business of marketing and selling natural gas to industrial customers in Singapore to a new entity, Newco. The latter is 51 per cent owned by City Gas and 49 per cent by Osaka Gas.\n\n\"Overall however, it involves only a relatively small amount of natural gas,\" one source said of the current gas sales outside JIT, adding that the EMA move is aimed at levelling the playing field.\n\nIn the longer term, Singapore is looking at how to move its domestic gas market forward, especially since the start of liquefied natural gas supplies here last May.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Taking into account cash retained ($2.087 million), this translates into distributable income of $20.6 million, a 4.3 per cent year-on-year increase.\n\nFor the quarter under review, net property income (NPI) rose 4.4 per cent to $28.3 million from $27.1 million. Gross revenue rose 5 per cent to $40 million.\n\nThe improved results were largely a result of higher revenue from Causeway Point, whose contribution jumped 10.6 per cent to $19.18 million. Northpoint's revenue increased 1.3 per cent to $12.28 million, thanks to improved rental rates, higher turnover rent and car park income.\n\nOn the operational front, Causeway Point and Northpoint enjoyed stable occupancy, at 98.5 per cent and 99.1 per cent respectively. Positive rental reversions were achieved at the two malls, at a respective 15.4 per cent and 7.3 per cent.\n\nBut occupancy at Bedok Point slipped to 80.2 per cent from 96.7 per cent in the previous quarter, with negative rental reversions of 16 per cent registered.\n\nBedok Point has been facing sharp competition from the newly opened Bedok Mall, said Chew Tuan Chiong, CEO of Frasers Centrepoint Asset Management, the manager of FCT.\n\nThat said, the drop in occupancy was largely due to renovation of shop spaces of incoming tenants and vacancy from expired leases.\n\n\"We expect tenancy to go up to about 90 per cent by May when Harvey Norman opens. We should be able to keep occupancy at that level until the new batch of renewals,\" said Dr Chew.\n\nGoing forward, Bedok Point will be positioned as a destination mall, he said at FCT's annual general meeting earlier yesterday.\n\n\"The nice thing about being No 2 is that our rentals are more affordable to many people, including schools. When kids are having classes, parents will sometimes hang around, and this brings in a strong shopper base . . . one of the strategies is to ensure occupancy of malls remains high (and) we are quite willing to moderate rents as a result,\" he said.\n\nIn Q1, 90 leases accounting for 146,599 sq ft (16.7 per cent) of FCT's total net lettable area were renewed. Overall portfolio occupancy as at Dec 31 stood at 96.7 per cent, down a touch from 98.4 per cent in the preceding quarter. Average rental renewals registered a 2.5 per cent increase over the preceding leases contracted three years ago.\n\nThe next growth catalyst for FCT will likely come from acquisitions of pipeline assets. While Changi City Point has been identified as the next likely acquisition, Dr Chew said there is no definite timeframe as yet.\n\nFCT's counter ended one cent higher at $1.79 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In Singapore alone, EM has invested well over US$10 billion.\n\nEM Asia-Pacific chairman and managing director Matthew Aguiar said that the hydrotreater would help meet the growing demand for fuels in the Asia-Pacific region, and that when its product is used with today's engines, it will contribute to lower emissions and improved air quality.\n\n\"This new unit, along with the recently-completed petrochemical expansion project at our Singapore complex, positions EM competitively in the Asia-Pacific markets for fuels and chemicals,\" he said, referring to EM's largest investment here, its second petrochemical complex inaugurated just a fortnight ago.\n\nEM chairman and chief executive officer Rex Tillerson, who was in Singapore for the event, told The Business Times in an interview that its latest clean-diesel investment here to produce the Euro-4 specification fuel was the group's response \"not only to (areas) where there has been a regulatory change, but also where we see the market trending\".\n\n\"We know there is going to be demand, including for cleaner marine (diesel) fuels, which we produce a lot of here. And customers are already responding to the production of the higher-value fuel from the new (hydrotreater) plant,\" he added, in a reference to Singapore's status as one of the busiest bunkering ports worldwide.\n\nAs far as its investments here are concerned, he said that EM intends to \"continue to get more from the Singapore complex, in particular in the diesel area\".\n\n\"This is because, going forward, the most-demanded fuel will be diesel; demand for motor gasoline (mogas, or petrol) will plateau because more vehicles are either moving to diesel or to hybrid-type vehicles using less mogas.\"\n\nEM anticipates that demand for diesel will grow sharply by about 75 per cent between 2010 and 2040 to power the rise in activity in trucks and other commercial transportation; diesel will also become more important in the marine sector as a result of stricter marine-emissions standards.\n\nThe strongest growth for transportation demand will come from the Asia-Pacific region, which remains the largest consumer of heavy-duty vehicle energy. It is in this region that personal vehicle ownership will boom during the period - by about 500 million vehicles, EM said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the European probe has made banks reluctant to participate, they added. \"The banks' compliance (teams) and managements are not very keen at this stage to discuss about fixing and benchmark pricing,\" said one source. Another source said the topic of gold fixing has become too sensitive for banks to be associated with for now.\n\nSingapore is still in talks to introduce some form of pricing mechanism for gold, the sources said, as part of efforts to make it a trading hub for precious metals. The SBMA declined to comment.\n\nThe fixing of the gold price in London is done through a teleconference between five banks, but Deutsche Bank said last week it would withdraw from gold and silver benchmark price-setting, after exiting the bulk of its commodities business.\n\nIn mid-December, German banking regulator Bafin demanded documents from Deutsche Bank under an inquiry into suspected manipulation of benchmark gold and silver prices, the Financial Times reported, citing sources. The other banks involved in fixing the gold price are Bank of Nova Scotia-ScotiaMocatta, Barclays Bank plc, HSBC Bank USA and Societe Generale. All four have declined comment on the Deutsche move.\n\nAsia, led by China and India, is the biggest buyer of physical bullion. Encouraged by that, Singapore is still trying to figure out how best to introduce a pricing mechanism.

According to M1's CEO Karen Kooi, this means single-digit percentage growth.\n\nFor the three months ended Dec 31, 2013, operating revenue shrank 14.9 per cent to $278.6 million, owing to lower handset sales, which fell 46.3 per cent to $71.6 million.\n\nEven so, telecommunications service revenue increased 5.2 per cent to $163.3 million.\n\nBoth the post-paid and pre-paid sectors showed revenue growth, with the former growing 5 per cent to $142.8 million and the latter rising 6.6 per cent to $20.5 million for the quarter.\n\nFixed services revenue also made considerable headway, putting on 30.6 per cent in the quarter to weigh in at $16.4 million.\n\nAt the same time, the pressures of reeling in customers eased somewhat, with subscriber acquisition cost falling 5.3 per cent to $396 in Q4.\n\nThe group declared a final dividend of 7.1 cents per share and a special dividend of another 7.1 cents, which - including the previously declared interim dividend - come up to a total payout of 21 cents for the year.\n\nIn 2012, the total payout stood at 14.6 cents. This year, the group's payout ratio of 80 per cent will be maintained, M1 said.\n\nFor the full year, net profit grew 9.4 per cent to $160.2 million, while operating revenue fell 6.4 per cent to $1.01 billion, also on lower handset sales.\n\nThe fourth quarter was perhaps a turning point for average revenue per user (ARPU), with post-paid customers clocking a monthly ARPU of $62.20, up 0.2 per cent year-on-year.\n\nFittingly, at the end of the quarter, the proportion of post-paid customers on tiered data plans jumped from 32 per cent in Q3 to 49 per cent. Some 16 per cent of the tiered data plan customers exceeded their monthly data limits.\n\nThe prognosis for data usage here is an upbeat one.\n\n\"We think there's room for further growth especially with the trend of pre-paid customers increasingly adopting smartphones,\" Ms Kooi said.\n\nOn the pay-TV front, M1's cross-carriage ambitions are chugging along.\n\n\"We are on track to get the necessary approvals for cross-carriage . . . we will get the approval and then we will start negotiating with our content partners,\" she said.\n\nThe operator had previously said that it is trying to get at least 10,000 subscribers to its MiBox Internet TV service so that it can qualify as a receiver of cross-carriage content - such as English Premier League matches - by the middle of this year.\n\nEarnings per share were 4.4 cents and 17.4 cents for the quarter and full year, respectively, up from 4.1 and 16.1 cents during the corresponding year-ago periods.\n\nThe counter closed three cents lower at $3.24 yesterday, before its earnings were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These indices were in turn derived by subtracting the percentage of respondents expecting decreases from the percentage expecting increases.\n\nNet optimism levels in volume of sales, for example, moderated from 50.8 percentage points in Q4 2013 to 20.3 percentage points for the current quarter.\n\nLikewise, business expectations on net profits also moderated sharply, from 44.1 percentage points last quarter to 17.5 percentage points in this quarter.\n\nInventory levels and employment levels eased downwards to 11.9 percentage points and 10.6 percentage points respectively.\n\nBusinesses are least optimistic about selling prices; net optimism levels moderated to 6.3 percentage points, down from 16.7 percentage points last quarter.\n\nDespite the lowered business confidence, it is still a marked improvement from the corresponding period last year, when the overall BOI score sank into the contractionary region at net -0.82 percentage points; this was when firms were anticipating falls in volume of sales, net profits, selling prices and inventory levels.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan said that this quarter paints a much better picture than the first quarter last year, and that major industry players are a lot more optimistic now.\n\nHe pointed out that the survey results confirm the positive picture produced by indicators such as the latest purchasing managers' index (PMI) and industrial production numbers.\n\nAmong the various industries, the wholesale, transportation and services sectors are the most optimistic, with all five business indicators in the expansionary region.\n\nThe accommodation and food-services sectors are also anticipating higher business receipts from the Chinese New Year festivities in this quarter; the mining sector is the least optimistic.\n\nThe SCCB study also suggested that manufacturing activities are likely to ease in the next few months as a result of weaker production and slowed-down orders towards the end of last year. Business sentiment of manufacturers moderated from 26.7 percentage points in Q4 to 9.7 percentage points in the first quarter of this year.\n\nEconomists have mixed predictions on business expectations over the next few quarters.\n\nOCBC's head of Treasury Research & Strategy Unit Selena Ling said that business optimism is likely to remain range-bound in the coming quarters due to domestic policy constraints on foreign manpower and elevated business costs offsetting the growing optimism on the external-demand front.\n\nUOB's Mr Tan, however, said that he expects business optimism to pick up in the coming quarters, as he is seeing rising optimism and real economic growth coming from the US, Japan and the EU, which will boost consumption demand and in turn create higher business volume for exporters.\n\nAudrey Chia, SCCB's chief executive officer, said: \"The strategic focus for the majority of local firms in the new year ahead will be to ensure that their business models remain competitive and relevant in the long run. This marks a shift away from the traditional focus on increasing topline revenue. Where the triple bottom line is concerned, enhancing capabilities, raising productivity, adopting corporate social responsibility-related practices and cost-cutting measures are vital to business sustainability and profitability.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As part of our restructuring, we should do more with less,\" he said in a ministerial statement as he responded to 15 questions by various MPs on foreign worker management.\n\nIn his speech, he reiterated that foreign workers have always been part of Singapore's economic landscape as they contribute \"significantly\" to the progress and well-being of the people.\n\nTurning to how foreign workers are treated here, Mr Tan cited a survey that found that the vast majority are generally happy with their working experience and many want to continue working here.\n\nHe also said that foreign workers in Singapore are by and large treated decently by their employers.\n\n\"Are all foreign workers poorly treated here? While the situation is generally good, it is not perfect. There is always room for improvement,\" said the minister.\n\nHe warned against generalising that there was \"widespread and systemic abuse\" of the foreign workforce, or to conclude that these were the reasons for the Little India riot.\n\n\"In the same vein, some foreign media just echo these points but offer only scant evidence for their assertions. We don't think there is basis for these assertions, but look forward to the COI's (Committee of Inquiry) perspective on the matter,\" he said.\n\nThe four-member COI, chaired by a former Supreme Court judge, was convened to investigate the cause of the riot and will submit its report by June.\n\nMr Tan revealed that the government would open more dedicated recreation centres for foreign workers in future, although he did not specify how many would be built or where they would be located. But while these gathering spaces provide alternative options for foreign workers, he said the reality is that they can never completely replace popular spots such as Little India, a place that has evolved to cater to their physical and emotional needs.\n\n\"I believe Singaporeans understand and appreciate the need for these shared spaces. Unlike the picture painted by the critics, I also believe that Singaporeans are generally big-hearted and accommodating,\" said Mr Tan. \"On the part of the government, we will manage these areas well so that we can co-exist harmoniously.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its latest tenant, PPB Advisory, signed a 10-year lease.\n\nOverall, the weighted average lease expiry for the entire portfolio was 6.5 years. About 170,000 sq ft of space was renewed and 69,000 sq ft of space was newly committed in Q4. About 105,000 sq ft (3.4 per cent) of the portfolio's net lettable area (NLA) is due for renewal and 195,000 sq ft (6.3 per cent) is due for rent review in 2014.\n\nAs at Dec 31, Keppel Reit's portfolio was valued at $7.2 billion, a growth of 10.4 per cent. The average capitalisation rate for the Singapore properties was 4 per cent while the average capitalisation for the Australian properties was compressed slightly to 6.7 per cent.\n\nOn the capital management front, all loans due in 2014 and a further $60 million due in 2015 have been refinanced. Average all-in interest rate stood at 2.15 per cent with a weighted average term to expiry of 3.6 years.\n\nLooking ahead, the manager will selectively pursue and review opportunities for strategic acquisitions and divestments, although it is too early to comment on MBFC Tower 3, said Ms Ng.\n\nThe acquisition, if executed, will probably be partially funded by the divestment of an older existing portfolio asset.\n\n\"For Reits, any raising of capital is very dependent on the capital markets. Based on the current trading level, it may not be so easy to (raise the funds required to) acquire Tower 3 assuming Keppel Land is willing to divest. We could consider the possibility of divesting one of our older assets to partially fund the Tower Three acquisition so that we won't have to go to the market for huge equity raising,\" said Ms Ng.\n\nKeppel Reit's counter ended trading unchanged yesterday, at $1.155.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Assuming full conversion of the convertible bonds, Jardine's stake will be 20 per cent.\n\nThe acquisition will result in Jardine Strategic becoming one of the top three shareholders of Zhongsheng after its two co-founders: chairman Huang Yi, and Li Guoqiang, vice-chairman and chief executive officer. Shareholdings of companies jointly controlled by Mr Huang and Mr Li will be reduced to 52.77 per cent from 65.96 per cent after the completion of the placement and full conversion of the convertible bonds.\n\nZhongsheng is one of mainland China's leading motor dealership groups operating over 170 outlets in over 60 cities across 15 provinces and regions. The company carries over 15 major marques, including Lexus, Jaguar and Land Rover in the luxury segment, and Toyota, Nissan and Volkswagen in the mid-to-high-end segment.\n\nIts shares surged the most since its initial public offer in 2010 on news of the placement to raise HK$5.6 billion to develop its dealership network and for general working capital purposes. Zhongsheng was trading around HK$12.54 yesterday, up HK$1.02 from HK$11.52 last Friday.\n\nZhongsheng has benefited from China's burgeoning economy, but its growth has slowed somewhat recently.\n\nFor the first half of 2013, profit attributable to owners was RMB489.2 million (S$102.3 million), representing an increase of 32 per cent compared to RMB370.7 million a year ago. Group revenue was RMB24,608.5 million, up 1.5 per cent from RMB24,257.2 million a year ago. Revenue from sales of luxury brand automobiles amounted to RMB13,574 million, accounting for 62.4 per cent of revenue from new automobile sales. This was up from 56.4 per cent previously. Zhongsheng generated RMB1,512 million net cash from operating profit before working capital movement and tax payment.\n\nAccording to releases, the parties are \"very excited\" about the union's prospects.\n\nThis is not surprising given that Jardine Strategic, through its 73 per cent stake in Jardine Cycle & Carriage, has great experience in the automotive markets in many parts of South-east Asia including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam. Jardine Cycle & Carriage is the 50 per cent owner of Indonesia-listed conglomerate Astra, which is the largest automotive group in South-east Asia. The former also has motor subsidiaries that have operations in Singapore and Malaysia under the Cycle & Carriage banner.\n\nMr Huang said: \"The combination of Zhongsheng's strong presence in the China motor dealership market, coupled with Jardines' in-depth experience in the sector across Asia and its long-term vision, represents a powerful partnership.\"\n\nJardine Strategic director Adam Keswick added that the long-term strategic investment provides the group with \"a greater exposure to the mainland market in a sector we understand well and in which we feel Zhongsheng has the potential for substantial growth\".\n\nJPMorgan is Zhongsheng financial adviser for the proposed transaction.\n\nJardine Strategic has a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, with secondary listings in Bermuda and Singapore. Its interests are managed from Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson.\n\nJardine Strategic Holdings shares closed on the Singapore Exchange at US$34.10 yesterday, down 51 US cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Instead, Mr Li has left it up to individual cities to impose their own curbs, with at least 10, many of them provincial capitals, tightening local property policies since November.\n\nShenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou have all raised minimum down payments for second homes to 70 per cent since November.\n\n\"The effect of those measures was limited last year because in first-tier cities demand still outpaced supply,\" Ding Shuang, a Hong Kong-based senior China economist with Citigroup said.\n\nThe value of new housing sales was 5.4 trillion yuan in 2012, an 11 per cent gain from the previous year, according to the government data.\n\nChina's economy rose 7.7 per cent last year from 2012, the government said yesterday, the same as the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 31 analysts.\n\nInvestment in homes, office buildings, malls and other real estate gained 20 per cent to 8.6 trillion yuan last year from a year earlier, according to the statistics bureau data. New property construction rose 14 per cent to two billion square metres.\n\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange Property Index, which tracks 24 developers traded in the city, was little changed as at 11am, while the benchmark fell 0.4 per cent.\n\nNew-home sales volume rose 18 per cent to 1.2 billion square metres, the government data showed.\n\nNew and existing home sales in the US were about US$1.1 trillion last year, including US$149 billion of new homes sold, broker Cushman & Wakefield estimated, based on US Bureau of Census data.\n\nChina's existing-homes market is about one-third of new homes by sales, according to Centaline Property Agency, because the nation only allowed private home ownership in 1998. The government doesn't release data on existing-home sales.\n\nExisting-home prices rose 20 per cent in the capital Beijing last month from a year earlier and increased 14 per cent in Shanghai, according to Saturday's data.\n\nPrivate figures also showed no sign of cooling in the property market. Home prices last month had the biggest year-on-year gain last year, increasing 12 per cent, according to SouFun Holdings, China's biggest real estate website owner.\n\n\"There has been a misconception that China's property curbs are aimed at cracking down on the market or squeezing sales,\" said David Hong, a Hong Kong-based property analyst at China Real Estate Information Corp, or CRIC, a property data and consulting firm. \"The country's economy, especially that of less affluent cities, is relying on the real estate industry.\"\n\nFirst-tier cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, may impose further curbs if prices rise too fast, Standard & Poor's Hong Kong-based analyst Bei Fu said on Friday. Home prices will increase about 5 per cent this year from last year, while home sales volume will jump about 10 per cent, according to S&P.\n\nAlmost one-fifth of respondents in a Renmin University of China survey gave a zero score to the government's property policies, indicating \"near despair\" with housing prices, the official China News Service reported last month, citing survey results.\n\nNew-home prices in the eastern city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province fell 2.6 per cent from a year earlier, declining for a 27th month. It was the only city among the 70 to show a decrease, the government data showed.\n\n\"The government should increase land and home supply in major cities because only artificially tightening the market through government orders will not work,\" Citigroup's Mr Ding said.\n\nBeijing, the financial centre of Shanghai, and the southern business hubs of Guangzhou and Shenzhen are considered first-tier cities by the statistics bureau. The four have \"high levels of international business connectivity, deep corporate bases and well-developed international grade stock, and they are the country's most liquid and transparent markets,\" according to broker Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nHome sales will continue to rise this year because of economic growth, supportive credit environment and government reforms including the easing of the one-child policy, said Sigrid Zialcita, head of Asia research at Cushman.\n\nHome sales rose at a rate of about 30 per cent each year from 1998 to 2009, according to Centaline, China's biggest real estate brokerage. The annual rate has slowed to about 10 per cent since 2010, according to the brokerage.\n\nThey won't continue growing as fast given their already rapid increase and government curbs, said Liu Yuan, a Shanghai- based researcher at Centaline.\n\nGrowth in the early 2000s was driven by tax rebates and other incentives to encourage home buying as the nation's property market was opened to private ownership, he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Mining contributes no less than 12 per cent to its GDP. Indonesia is the world's top exporter of nickel ore, tin and coal. The country also produces substantial amounts of copper, iron ore and bauxite.\n\nAn ore export ban had been in the works since a mining law was passed in 2009. Subsidiary rules on unprocessed mineral ore exports were set out in July 2012, which included a new 20 per cent export tax on raw minerals. Foreign-owned miners are resisting the ore processing rule because, it is being claimed, the impetus for this policy are the legislative and presidential elections later this year. Politically motivated or not, Indonesia is not exceptional in pursuing such a policy: almost every primary producing country wants to move up the value chain. Thus, Jakarta's action should be seen against the backdrop of other initiatives aimed at extracting more value from its rich stores of natural resources as well as its forest and plantation output.\n\nNevertheless, international mining companies have stood by the letter of their original agreements and have threatened to go in for international arbitration if their operations are affected. Last week, Jakarta was forced to water down the export ban, hours before the law took effect, to allow them to continue ore exports until at least 2017. These companies are obligated to build smelters by then. Some midsized miners that have had difficulties complying with the rule because third party smelting works are yet to be completed were also given more time. To ensure compliance, a progressive tax, starting at 25 per cent, is being imposed. Foreign miners seem determined to hold out.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Values in Westminster slid 8.3 per cent, while those in Kensington dropped 6.9 per cent.\n\n\"The average asking price of property coming to market is having a pause after a pretty hectic year of heady rises,\" said Miles Shipside, a director at Rightmove in London. \"It's traditionally a quieter time of year. London needs more properties for sale to lessen upward price pressure.\"\n\nLondon is leading the housing market as supply fails to keep up with demand and the capital's economy powers UK expansion. Bank of England governor Mark Carney predicted last week that housing will continue to strengthen in 2014, and while policy makers have downplayed concern that prices could spiral, they scaled back a mortgage lending programme last year.\n\nCapital Economics said in a report this month that London's economy will expand 4 per cent in 2014 and 2015. It has projected a 3 per cent annual increase in UK gross domestic product in the same period.\n\n\"London almost certainly led the UK's growth rate in 2013,\" said Richard Holt, an economist at Capital Economics. \"We project that to continue this year and next, with several of the UK's more northern or peripheral regions and nations bringing up the rear.\"\n\nRightmove's isn't the only report to show London leading the property market. Data from the Office for National Statistics last week showed that UK annual house price growth was 5.4 per cent in November, compared with 11.6 per cent in the capital. Excluding London and the south-east, average prices in the UK rose 3.1 per cent.\n\nUnsurprisingly, London has Britain's most expensive properties, with the average value in Kensington \u00a32.05 million in January, according to Rightmove. That's more than eight times the national average of \u00a3243,861. In Westminster, homeowners are looking for around \u00a31.39 million for their properties.\n\nNationally, values climbed one per cent this month, with Yorkshire and Humber increasing 4.5 per cent, Rightmove said yesterday. Prices in the north declined one per cent.\n\nFrom a year earlier, UK asking prices for homes rose 6.3 per cent in January, the highest annual rate of increase since November 2007. London's values increased 7 per cent in the same period. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

The hotels will be part of new projects with a sales value of 6-8 billion dirhams (S$2.1- 2.8 billion) that Nakheel will unveil this year, including homes, retail and leisure destinations, he said.\n\n\"We are seriously thinking of expanding in hospitality, which goes along with the vision of the Dubai government of trying to build enough facilities,\" Mr Lootah said. \"By 2016, we will have nine hotels and more to be announced.\"\n\nDubai's economy expanded 4.9 per cent in the first half of 2013, led by the hotel and restaurant industry, as growth in the Middle East's tourism and financial hub rebounded. Traffic through Dubai's airport, the world's second-busiest by international passengers, surged 15 per cent to 60.4 million in the 11 months through last November, official statistics show.\n\nNakheel reported on Sunday a 27 per cent increase in 2013 profit to 2.57 billion dirhams, helped by a 20 per cent rise in revenue to 9.4 billion dirhams as Dubai's property sector rebounded from one of the world's worst crashes after the credit crisis. The company, which was rescued by a government bailout in 2009, said earlier this month it will pay 4 billion dirhams of bank debt due in September 2015 this year as it generated cash.\n\nNakheel expects to deliver about 1,600 homes this year after handing over 3,150 homes last year, according to a statement distributed at Sunday's news conference. At the end of December, it had a new development pipeline of almost 3,500 homes at an estimated value of 10 billion dirhams, about 3.6 million square feet of leasable retail space with an investment value of 6 billion dirhams and more than 1,200 hotel rooms at a value of 1.5 billion dirhams, according to the statement. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

These officers will be able to search and interview people who enter the area for alcohol or prohibited items, such as weapons and explosives.\n\nThe Commissioner of Police or any authorised officer will also be given the power to ban people from going into the area for up to 30 days if their presence is deemed likely to threaten public order.\n\nOfficers can also cancel or suspend the business licences of those who have flouted the law, or are even reasonably suspected of doing so. Those holding the rank of Sergeant or above can raid any establishment in Little India without a warrant.\n\nResponding to 21 questions from 14 MPs, Mr Teo said the new law was \"scoped more tightly\" compared to the wide-ranging powers that come into effect when the Public Order (Preservation) Act is invoked.\n\nThe one-year duration of the law, he added, would give enough time for the Home Affairs Ministry to enact longer-term legislation once the findings and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry (COI) are ready, and after the public consultation on the liquor licensing regime review is complete.\n\nMr Teo told the House that the four-member COI, appointed last month, will begin hearings from Feb 19 and is expected to submit its report by June this year.\n\nAs he gave a blow-by-blow account of the fateful Dec 8 night, Mr Teo told the House that it was important to consider the things that did not happen.\n\n\"The riot, though serious, did not spread to the surrounding neighbourhoods or other parts of Singapore,\" he noted.\n\n\"Foreign worker dormitories that night, and workplaces the next day, remained calm and peaceful. Not a single shot was fired that night, and there were no fatalities among the rioters, innocent bystanders or our Home Team officers.\"\n\nMr Teo praised Singaporeans for responding calmly. Business owners gave their support despite being affected by the restrictions imposed after the riot, and grassroots leaders in Little India helped the community to recover.\n\nHe also said that, even in a stable and peaceful society like Singapore's, it was not possible to anticipate every event that could happen.\n\n\"What's most important is that we are prepared and able to deal with a crisis decisively, quickly and appropriately when they do arise. We cannot be crisis-proof, but we can be resilient and crisis-ready,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For this exemption to stick, the firm must have an ongoing relationship with the person in question.\n\nThis exemption was issued the week before the DNC Registry was slated for its official launch on Jan 2.\n\n\"The PDPC recognised that while some consumers are very clear that they do not want any telemarketing messages from businesses at all, there are others who may like to receive in-service telemarketing text messages from organisations with which they have an ongoing relationship,\" Mr Wong said.\n\nWhile the PDPC is investigating several cases of non-compliance, none of these cases involve in-service telemarketing text messages, he added.\n\nIn response to a question about whether the authorities would consider changing the approach of the exemption to that of opt-in rather than opt-out one, Mr Wong replied that the PDPC had considered the possibility, but opting in would have required an additional step for consumers.\n\n\"Such a system would also have been very complicated for both consumers and organisations,\" he said.\n\nMr Wong also noted that in other jurisdictions with established DNC registries, none of them had used an opt-in facility.\n\nSince the full force of the registry kicked in on Jan 2, about 600 organisations have checked a total of about 37 million telephone numbers against the DNC registries for voice calls, fax message and text messages.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Sepang, Malaysia-based airline has lined up local partners and plans to commence service next year, the executive said.\n\nThe carrier, with units in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines, expects to begin service with a new Indian venture in March as it aims to expand its regional reach. ANA, which took over AirAsia Japan Co after almost a year of operating because of a disagreement over strategy, has rebranded the unit Vanilla Air, leaving Mr Fernandes to reformulate plans.\n\n\"We have had one year of free advice really,\" Mr Fernandes said. \"It's a fantastic market.\"\n\nThe Japan enterprise will avoid Tokyo's Narita airport to achieve lower costs, he said. The venture with ANA, Japan's biggest airline, operated from Narita, where Mr Fernandes said the carrier should never have been.\n\nOperations from Japan will not begin until next year in part to allow AirAsia to focus on establishing its India unit this year, Mr Fernandes said. Indian government approval to have a low-cost airline in a once closed market of 1.2 billion people is \"imminent\" with flights slated for as soon as March.\n\nThe airline will initially use 10 Airbus Group A320 single-aisle jets.

According to Pacnet's chief executive officer Carl Grivner, the company has achieved year-on-year revenue growth of over 20 per cent, and he expects this growth to continue to rise to over 30 per cent this year, driven by the demand for data centres and bandwidth.\n\nIts latest data centre - a 155,000 sq ft standalone facility launched last week in Singapore - has already achieved a utilisation rate of 20 per cent. This makes it one of the strongest data centre pre-opening sales that the company has recorded. Customers include local cloud service provider Acclivis Technologies and Solutions.\n\nAccording to a Frost & Sullivan report on the Asia-Pacific data centre services market, the Singapore market is expected to more than double from US$223 million in 2010 to US$550 million in 2017, at a compound annual growth rate of 13.8 per cent.\n\nPacnet has pumped some US$50 million into gutting the building, which was formerly a warehouse it leased for 25 years, and building up the first two floors of the data centre as well as its new office. It expects to build up the remaining three levels of the data centre at a cost of US$40 million.\n\nThe data centre, called Cloudspace II, is also the first in Singapore to be awarded a Tier III design certification from the Uptime Institute. A Tier III data centre allows for any planned maintenance activity of power and cooling systems to take place without disrupting the operation of computer hardware in the data centre. It requires site infrastructure uptime of 99.982 per cent or no more than 1.6 hours of downtime per year.\n\nCloudspace II can accommodate 1,500 IT racks and operates with a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of less than 1.6. PUE is a metric used to determine the energy efficiency of a data centre. This is the total energy used by a data centre divided by the energy used by IT equipment there.\n\nSo, for every watt of IT power used by Cloudspace II, another 0.6 watt is used for cooling, lighting and other ancillary functions. An ideal PUE is 1.0, which means all of the energy is used for computing. A Digital Realty survey conducted last year among 100 respondents found that the average PUE of data centres in Singapore is 2.61.\n\nThe new data centre was also designed in accordance with the BCA Green Mark scheme and has undergone a threat vulnerability risk assessment for meeting the security requirements of the financial services industry.\n\nPacnet also has new facilities in Tianjin and Korea which are expected to come online this year. \"There's still a lot of demand out there. We've won significant business from some of the content providers in mainland China who are expanding into Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney. Korea is another a big focal point - customers in Korea are buying 40 to 50 racks primarily for gaming applications. There is also a lot of pent-up demand in Japan,\" adds Mr Grivner.\n\nThe company currently has 18 data centres in 14 cities in the region, all interconnected by its high-speed network. Asked if there are plans to re-list the company, Mr Grivner said: \"As we continue to make progress, this is something we will look at, probably in the middle of this year, in terms of whether it makes sense.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Depends on where and how you look", "publish_date": null, "content": "Bubble? Depends on where and how you look\n\nThere's no housing bubble in Singapore, but only if people buy within their means, says CAI HAOXIANG\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Mon, Jan 20, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nA BUBBLE can provoke fear or outrage.\n\nFear, because if a speculative bubble rising on nothing but hot air bursts, the resulting sudden plunge in asset values can bode ill for the economy and cause unemployment and personal hardship. Outrage, because the continued existence of such a bubble implies the failure of regulators to protect the man on the street from rushing headlong towards disaster.\n\nTo say a bubble exists in Singapore means that there is a lack of control by the powers that be, which is anathema to the government's perception of itself as a forward-looking architect of a well-planned and orderly economy.\n\nSo one can very well imagine the reaction of Singapore's central bank when Jesse Colombo, a French-born, American independent economic analyst who just turned 28, wrote a widely circulated column last Monday warning that there is not just a low interest rate-fuelled credit bubble here, but also a residential property bubble, construction bubble, financial-sector bubble, wealth bubble and population bubble.\n\nMr Colombo did not only see bubbles all around Singapore and surrounding emerging markets, he went on to argue that the foundations of the Republic's wealth - sovereign wealth funds Temasek Holdings and GIC - were at stake, and that Singapore's current prosperity was illusory.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) response was swift.\n\n\"Singapore is not facing a credit bubble that puts the country or its banking system at any risk of crisis,\" the central bank said last Tuesday evening.\n\nWhile MAS said that unusually low interest rates have caused credit growth and a rise in property prices in Singapore and other countries, the government has \"taken decisive steps to cool property demand and prevent excessive leverage\".\n\nMAS added that the property market is stabilising, new housing loans have been declining, household balance sheets are strong, and the financial system here is strong, as reflected by Singapore's AAA rating from major credit rating agencies.\n\nMr Colombo replied that the MAS was in denial, just like other governments in the region. Household balance sheets might be strong now when interest rates are low, but not so when they rise, he said.\n\nLow interest rates might stay for a few more years and delay the burst of Singapore and the region's wealth bubble, he said. But \"it also means that the city-state's asset and credit bubbles are likely to grow even larger and more threatening than they currently are\".\n\nWhat is a bubble?\n\nBubbles are a nebulous concept. There is a difference between the temporary insanity of a bubble and the normal ups and downs of a market, when assets are just overpriced. Hence, to decide whether Singapore is indeed caught up in a bubble, it is important first of all to define what a bubble is.\n\nBubbles have a psychological element that make them dangerous. The building of a bubble requires a kind of spontaneous optimism characterised by British economist John Maynard Keynes as \"animal spirits\", and later by former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan as \"irrational exuberance\". While property showrooms may still be packed here, an element of caution has crept in, with the property market by all accounts slowing down. The animal spirits are subsiding, in no small part due to a debt servicing framework introduced in mid-2013.\n\nIn a bubble situation, prices of assets deviate significantly from their fundamental values. What constitutes \"significant\" is arguable. Given sufficient historical data, a possible starting point for a bubble call is when financial ratios deviate from their long-term averages by, say, more than two standard deviations.\n\nA recent instance of a bubble was the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. Then, the long-term cyclically adjusted price to earnings (PE) ratios of America's S&P 500 index went up to more than 40 times, more than three standard deviations from the 130-year average of 16.5 times and even the post-war average of 18.4 times. In Singapore, the Straits Times Index (STI) is trading at roughly or just under its long-term average of about 15 times earnings. Using our definition, we can safely say there is no bubble in our equity markets.\n\nMoving on to property, a common indicator of value is the ratio of median house prices to median household yearly incomes. By various accounts, this ratio peaked in America in 2006, almost hitting five times and deviating more than two standard deviations from its long-term average of about 3.5 times. Median household incomes were around US$50,000 then, so median house prices were about US$250,000.\n\nIn Singapore, one might very well ask if there is a residential property market bubble. In the HDB resale market and the private property market, average prices have doubled from a decade ago. Incomes have increased by only about 60 to 70 per cent.\n\nMr Colombo cited a statistic from cost-of-living comparison website Numbeo that showed Singapore's price-to-income ratio at 25 times, which is the third-highest in the world. On the surface, the number makes sense: The typical price of a suburban condominium is $1.2 million, with the implied median household income at $48,000.\n\nThese statistics are flawed, however. The latest household income data show that households earning $48,000 a year belong to the bottom third of income earners, who live in much cheaper, subsidised HDB flats anyway.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of Singaporeans live in HDB flats. This puts those who live in condos in the top fifth of wage earners. One cannot benchmark a typical Singaporean to a condo unit.\n\nThere should thus be at least two separate price-to-income ratios for Singapore when measuring whether the market is in a bubble: one for the private property market, and others for various segments of the HDB market.\n\nAssuming the top fifth of households buy condos, the next fifth buy five-room HDB flats, and so on, back of the envelope calculations using latest data show the price-to-income ratio for HDB five-room flats at about 4.2 times, and 4.3 times for condos - both very far from the statistic of 25 times used in Mr Colombo's piece.\n\nBy comparison, at the property market trough 10 years ago, the equivalent ratios would be about 3.3 times for five-room flats and 3.6 times for condos.\n\nMore data could be crunched to find out whether Singapore's price-to-income ratio differs significantly, or outrageously, from historical averages. But that does not seem to be the case from an initial reading of the data - with a caveat that people must buy within their means.\n\nBasically, between 2003 and now, homes cost about 0.6 to one year's worth of household income more at the most, from trough to peak. This means people have to take two to three more years to repay their loans, assuming they use a third of their incomes every year to do so. If they only use a fifth of their incomes, then they will take three to five years more.\n\nIf Singaporeans buy property within their means, three or four extra years of paying the mortgage, given later retirement ages and longer lives, seem to be reasonable.\n\nInteresting tidbits can be gleaned from the analysis. If people aim beyond their wage bracket, house prices become pricey. A typical median-income household buying a five-room resale flat, or even an 81st to 90th percentile household buying a suburban condo, will see their price-to-income ratio shoot up from three-plus to six times - which is arguably unsustainable. If a family can only use 20 to 30 per cent of its income to pay the mortgage, this easily means an extra 10 years of work.\n\nIt is therefore not surprising that with increased expectations, even the middle and upper middle-income groups would complain that houses have become unaffordable. Going by the data, the average Singaporean household can aim for a $500,000, four-room resale flat to keep the affordability ratio within four times annual income.\n\nMr Colombo is not wrong in warning Singapore of the dangers of rising asset prices, if they are not backed by productivity gains or economic growth.\n\nHowever, the situation confronting Singapore's residential property market now is more inflated expectations and less runaway prices.\n\nCommentators pointing out numerical increases in any statistic should define what makes something a bubble and what does not. Overusing the word can obfuscate rather than illuminate.\n\nhaoxiang@sph.com.sg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}

Prices of the units sold ranged from $650,000 for the one bedroom units to nearly $2.4 million for the five bedroom units. Majority of the units sold were two and three bedroom types, with sizes ranging from 678 square feet (sq ft) to 1,130 sq ft.\n\nThe developer said that most buyers were owner-occupiers with young families, with the ages of buyers spanning from thirties to fifties. While buyers came from across Singapore, most are residing in District 20 comprising Ang Mo Kio, Thomson and Bishan.\n\nWhile Wheelock did not release the average price per square foot (psf), prices quoted by a Knight Frank agent ahead of the launch ranged from $1,265-$1,320 psf for the two bedroom units and $1,293-$1,307 for the three bedroom units.\n\nWheelock submitted the winning bid of about $550 million for the site at a state tender in January last year. At the time, analysts calculated breakeven prices of between $1,180 and $1,300 psf.\n\n\"We are encouraged by the market response,\" said Tan Bee Kim, senior executive director of Wheelock Properties. Its wholly-owned subsidiary Pinehill Investments is the developer.\n\n\"Although the dampening effects on the Singapore property market brought about by the government's cooling measures are still being felt, the recent World Bank economic forecasts augur well for Singapore. Hopefully we may be looking at a more upbeat market sentiment and sustainable recovery,\" she added.\n\nThe World Bank raised its forecast for global growth to 3.2 per cent for this year and 3.4 per cent next year, up from 2.4 per cent last year.\n\nNoting that The Panorama comes hot on the heels of the release of the 281-unit retirement resort The Hillford in Bukit Timah, Chesterton International's managing director Donald Han said: \"It's a good start for the property market entering into 2014...with two major projects (starting) the ball rolling.\"\n\nThe take-up indicates that the market is still fairly active with genuine buyers looking to upgrade, he added.\n\nHighlighting that the condominium is adjacent to St Nicholas Girls' School, executive director of SLP International Nicholas Mak pointed out that it would definitely attract young families.\n\nThe absolute price of the family-sized units would likely determine how quickly The Panorama sells, he added.\n\n\"Buyers are very price sensitive,\" he said, pointing to The Hillford which sold out on its first day. Units at The Hillford were sold at an average of $1,100 psf.\n\nOther 99-year projects comparable to The Panorama include Thomson Three on Bright Hill Drive, at an average price of about $1,350 psf, as well as Sky Vue at Bishan Central - both launched in September last year. In its launch month, 433 units of Sky Vue were sold at a median price of $1,401 psf.\n\nSlated for completion in 2019, The Panorama is near the upcoming Mayflower station of the Thomson Line which is expected to be operational in 2020.\n\nThe Panorama has a total of 698 units across six blocks, with two 20-storey blocks and four 17-storey blocks. There are 95 one bedroom units, 196 two bedroom units, 314 three bedroom units, 68 four bedroom units, 19 five bedroom units and six penthouses.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some say what is crucial is careful selection of stocks.\n\nThe latest to weigh in on the richness of the sector is Credit Suisse, which wrote in a report last week that Asian consumer staples stocks could be next in line for a bubble deflation.\n\nIt said: \"While Macau gaming, Chinese Internet and Indian health care all look overvalued on our price-to-book versus return-on-equity (ROE) valuation metric, we believe the bubble that could potentially deflate in 2014 is consumer staples.\"\n\nThe Swiss firm added that while Macau gaming, Chinese Internet and Indian health care have all had their earnings expectations upgraded for this year, consumer staples have been the target of forecast downgrades.\n\nRecommending an \"underweight\" on staples, Credit Suisse wrote: \"Consumer staples continue to be associated with rather large downgrades to 2014-estimated consensus earnings per share, which has been downgraded by almost 20 per cent since Dec 31, 2012, versus 7 per cent for the broader region.\"\n\nDefensives such as consumer staples have actually outperformed cyclicals in the first half of each of the past four years, but the tides have now changed, Credit Suisse noted.\n\n\"We believe 2014 could be different and continue to favour cyclicals and materials.\"\n\nThe fact that consumer staples are sitting on demanding valuations is no secret. The total market capitalisation of consumer staples counters on the Singapore Exchange has grown by 33 per cent over the past year, compared to a one per cent decline in the Straits Times Index (STI) over the same period.\n\nOn average, Singapore-listed consumer staples are trading at about 15.6 times their 12-month historical earnings, compared with 13.5 times for the STI, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nBut other analysts, while acknowledging the high valuations, were not quite so ready to call a bubble with imminent deflation.\n\nTo begin with, optimism about the growth of the Asian consumer remains over the long term.\n\nMaybank Kim Eng analyst James Koh said: \"It's trading above historical levels, but I won't consider it very rich, considering the structural growth story over the next five years.\n\n\"It's important though, to be stock selective rather than to look at the whole sector.\"\n\nDBS analyst Andy Sim, who had raised concerns about sector de-ratings if 2014 earnings disappointed as early as December, shared similar thoughts, noting that the domestic consumer story may have some challenges in the near term.\n\n\"Valuations are probably about 23-24 times price-earnings on 2014 earnings,\" he said. \"Look at Thailand - consumption is coming down. Malaysia, Indonesia, higher inflation ... but long term, it's still green fields.\"\n\nCareful stock selection is the key. Del Monte Pacific, Courts Asia and Sheng Siong Group are Mr Sim's top picks in the sector.\n\nHe did, however, sound a slight note of caution in terms of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The takeover of the Fraser & Neave family of companies in 2012 and 2013 put consumer stocks on investors' radar as possible M&A plays.\n\nLast week, Bloomberg wrote that Super Group could be one of the best takeover options for beverage companies in Asia; Japan's Suntory Holdings is acquiring US bourbon maker Beam Inc.\n\nBut Mr Sim noted that M&A in the sector can be unpredictable, and one or two large deals do not necessarily suggest that others will follow.\n\n\"It's up and down,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The total cost to develop and build the ships is currently projected at US$32 billion.\n\nThe directive to scrap 20 of the planned ships came in one sentence of a memo to the Navy from Acting Deputy Defense Secretary Christine Fox, according to defence officials who asked not to be identified before a public announcement. Ms Fox also raised the possibility of building a replacement vessel, one of the officials said.\n\nThe preliminary order by Ms Fox could be overturned or modified before the Pentagon completes its next five-year plan in conjunction with its budget proposal for fiscal 2015, the officials said.\n\nRepresentative Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican who heads the House Armed Services Committee's seapower panel, last Thursday issued a statement of support for the vessel.\n\n\"Although this platform has had its share of development difficulties, I believe it has a necessary role to play in the future fleet, and I look forward to reviewing the Navy's 30-Year Shipbuilding Plan over the coming year to ensure the plan adequately supports the entirety of shipbuilding requirements,\" he said.\n\nMr Gilmore's report, which is due to be made public this month, cites failures of the USS Freedom during testing and a nine-month deployment to Singapore. The ship, built by Bethesda, Maryland- based Lockheed, had troubles with its diesel-powered generators, air compressors and propulsion system.\n\nSimilarly, the \"operational reliability\" of the USS Independence, made by Henderson, Australia-based Austal, \"has been degraded by equipment failures, including problems with operator consoles, power generation equipment, components of the Total Ship Computing\" system, \"internal networks, propulsion drive-train components, communications systems and mission package support systems\", Mr Gilmore wrote.\n\nLt Caroline Hutcheson, a Navy spokeswoman, said the service is \"confident\" that Mr Gilmore's report, \"when released, will outline areas the LCS program needs to continue to develop, as well as account for the progress being made as the program and mission modules continue on course from research and development\".\n\n\"We routinely work with the operational test community to ensure the LCS program is fully evaluated and validated in an operationally realistic environment,\" she said in a interview. \"And because of the close coordination and information sharing between Navy and DoD, we don't expect any issues to be raised that we haven't been collaborating on.\"\n\nLockheed is building a version of the ship with a traditional steel hull, while Austal is producing an aluminium trimaran, or three-hulled vessel.\n\nThe ship is designed to use \"mission modules\", equipment that can be swapped out for missions from waging surface warfare to finding and destroying mines. Northrop Grumman Corp, based in Falls Church, Virginia, is the prime contractor for the modules.\n\nMr Gilmore's report raises questions about the anti-mine module, which includes sonar, unmanned underwater drones and helicopter-borne laser-based detection sensors.\n\nIts performance \"has been degraded by immature mission systems, low sensor detection performance in some operational conditions, high false- alarm rates, unproven tactics and low operator proficiency\", he wrote in the report.\n\nLt Hutcheson, the Navy spokeswoman, said \"the mine countermeasure mission package modules have seen significant improvements and are on track for\" their initial realistic combat tests in fiscal 2015.\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2015, the Navy had planned to purchase the first 24 of the ships. Funding for the next instalment of 28 was to commence in the fiscal 2016 budget, according to Navy budget documents.\n\nThe budget documents indicate that the Navy planned to buy four vessels in 2015, and then two each year in 2016, 2017, and 2018. The remaining vessels that would be cut if Ms Fox's guidance prevails wouldn't be built until after 2019.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, advised the Navy last year to slow construction of the LCS to allow for further testing. As recently as July, the Navy rejected that recommendation, saying it could resolve any testing issues while construction proceeded on schedule. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Passengers from China saw their spend grow by some 24 per cent year-on-year.\n\nThe top five markets for sales contribution were China, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia and India.\n\nProducts which typically fly off the shelves include liquor and tobacco as well as perfumes and cosmetics. Other popular categories include luxury goods, electronics and equipment, and chocolates and candies.\n\n\"We are heartened to have delivered a stellar year for Changi Airport on the retail front,\" said Lee Seow Hiang, chief executive of CAG. \"A strong retail business underpins our continual efforts to keep Changi Airport competitive, augmenting its status as an air hub.\n\n\"For 2013, we achieved record high concession sales, with a healthy growth rate that outperformed passenger traffic growth for the period. This is the result of an effective retail strategy comprising a compelling retail mix, as well as dynamic campaigns to drive sales and create buzz throughout the year.\"\n\nIn addition, Changi is striving to maintain its edge over competitors by expanding capacity with the upcoming Terminals 4 and 5 - slated for completion in 2017 and the mid 2020s - as well as the $1.47 billion mixed-use development dubbed Project Jewel. When it is ready in 2018, Project Jewel will facilitate airport operations as well as offer hotel and retail space.\n\nMeanwhile, 47-year-old Indonesian businessman Irvung Tio walked away a million dollars richer yesterday after winning CAG's Be a Changi Millionaire 2013 Grand Draw.\n\nSix finalists - two from Singapore, two from China, and one each from Russia and Indonesia - were in the running for a million dollar pay-day in a game-show which took place in front of a live audience at Terminal 3.\n\nMr Tio won the opportunity to become one of the finalists in a draw after he bought $667 worth of Shiseido skincare products for his wife at Changi in September last year.\n\nThe other finalists won $5,000 cash and a three-night stay at Crowne Plaza hotel.\n\nThe Be a Changi Millionaire draw, which has been gaining traction since its launch in 2010, will return for a fifth edition.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Local company Shevron makes fabric embroidered ones, making them last longer than paper ones. These here come with auspicious greetings and even one in the shape of a horse.\n\nHorse Wine Stopper\n\n$105 each, at Shanghai Tang,\n\nNgee Ann City, #03-006/07\n\nThese wine stoppers not only make great gifts, but those born in the year of the Horse may want to keep them for themselves. Made of stainless steel and brass, the wine stoppers come in two colours, a red for the merlot, and a silver grey to keep uncorked bottles of prosecco fresh.\n\nGold Lustre Mustang Vase\n\n$1,500, at Lalique Crystal,\n\nMandarin Gallery, #01-16\n\nThe horse is a symbol of strength, speed and grace, and gold has always been an auspicious colour for the Chinese. The Gold Lustre Mustang crystal vase from Lalique is a combination of both, with a horde of horses galloping on it. The gold is in a soft shade, reminiscent of sandy dust kicked up by the horses' hooves.\n\nThree-tier basket\n\n$159.95, at Crate and Barrel,\n\nIon Orchard, #04-21\n\nThis basket will come in handy when you are entertaining guests. The lowest tier is right for oranges, the second and top for cookies and other goodies. After Chinese New Year, the basket can be used to serve other snacks. The baskets are handcrafted of iron wire in a distinctive rustic weave and finished in a multistep process of zinc plating, dipping and rubbing to create a dark antiqued patina.\n\nThe Boat\n\n$338, at Atomi,\n\nMandarin Gallery, #04-27\n\nHere is an elegant way to display mandarin oranges. British-Japanese designer Reiko Kaneko's Boat, made of fine bone china, can do extra duty as a floral basket after Chinese New Year. The boat symbolises the bearer of good tidings and wishes.

Get some red cushion covers. These ones from Francfranc still come in an auspicious colour but with a modern look.\n\nSteeds Sweeping Far & Wide\n\n$290, at Franz, 137 Telok Ayer Street, #01-01A\n\nNo Chinese New Year is complete without the family getting together for a feast. These salt and pepper shakers, from Franz, are just right for the table. The shakers showcase traditional paper-cut designs on porcelain, with colours typically used in puppetry. The lively postures of the horses signify zest and passion.\n\nMahjong cushions\n\n$23 each, at Goods of Desire, Central, #02-08\n\nHands up if you play mahjong during Chinese New Year. Keep back aches away, with these cushions inspired by mahjong tiles.

These are from Ikea's new Trendig range, a fusion of Chinese culture and Scandinavian design. These tea towels are made of 100 per cent linen, do not generate lint and are thus suitable for drying glasses.\n\nTopiary\n\nFrom $108, at Blossom\n\nFloral Design, Mandarin\n\nGallery, #02-26A\n\nPlacing a bunch of pussy willows in a tall vase is the conventional way of displaying them.

Like its name implies, the Disposable China Collection, is 'china' that you can use and throw away - they are actually paper cups and plates. A set of paper napkins completes the collection. The collection is designed by local creative agency, The Local.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There are two stories about its origin: one told of the escape of the last Emperor to the southern part of China; and the other in which the scholar-general Wen Tianxiang retreated with his army to Dong Guan, now known as Shenzhen.\n\nThe residents, being mostly Hakka, fed the soldiers with whatever they had from their humble kitchens. Food was collected in huge wooden basins and passed to the starving soldiers. Since then, this practice has been preserved and handed down to commemorate the patriotism of General Wen, who was executed in 1283 by Kublai Khan.\n\nPen cai may look simple but it actually embodies the spirit of Hakka cooking, in which complex cooking techniques are used to alleviate the taste of \"poor man's\" ingredients. The soul of the dish lies in the number \"8\" - there are eight main seasonings and key cooking techniques, with eight layers of dishes stacked to form pen cai.\n\nThe eight seasonings consist of soya bean paste, superior light sauce, preserved bean curd, fennel powder, cinnamon, cloves, oyster sauce and dried lohan. The eight cooking techniques comprise pan-frying, deep-frying, braising, stewing, roasting, boiling and reduction. The dishes are stacked according to this order, beginning from the bottom: boiled radish; stewed mushroom and bean curd skin; boiled fried pig's skin and yam; deep-fried fish paste; braised roast pork belly and dried cod; pan-fried prawns; boiled chicken; and lastly caramelised pig's trotter.\n\nThe etiquette of eating pen cai states that you start from the top most layer; finishing it before starting on the next lower layer. The bottom layers are generally much prized as they comprise radishes, mushrooms and bean curd skins that have soaked up the juices from the upper layers for a long period of time.\n\nToday, the Hakkas who live in the New Territories in Hong Kong still celebrate Chinese New Year with a massive pen cai feast at their village.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The exchange is said to be considering a reform of its listing rules, while Alibaba is said to be willing to renegotiate a listing in Hong Kong.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}

BT had earlier reported that GIC will be forking out US$400 million to acquire the iconic development.\n\nGIC Real Estate's regional head of the Americas, Tia Miyamoto, said: \"Time Warner Center is one of the premier mixed-use projects in the country. We see significant upside in leasing the high quality office space following Time Warner Inc's planned relocation to 30 Hudson Yards.\n\n\"We believe strong demand for this first-rate office property will translate into a stable income stream which suits GIC as a long-term investor.\"\n\nTime Warner Center, completed in 2004, has a pair of towers bridged by a multi-storey atrium that is home to upscale retail shops such as Armani, Hugo Boss and Thomas Pink; it also houses the three-Michelin starred restaurant Per Se and Japanese restaurant Masa, which is considered one of the world's most expensive.\n\nThe towers have a total floor area of 2.8 million sq ft, housing offices, the Mandarin Oriental New York hotel and residential condominium units.\n\nGIC's investment into Time Warner Center is the latest of a string of real estate deals it has inked. Last month, it purchased a 50 per cent stake in Broadgate, a mega office complex in London's main financial district, in a deal said to be worth over \u00a31.7 billion (S$3.56 billion).

Japanese theatre group Gotanndadan performed physical theatre in Suteru Tabi, where the death of a young man's father spurs his personal spiritual journey through family relationships, grief and remembrance. Singapore performance artist Noor Effendy Ibrahim and his ensemble presented text-less performance art, in Joget, Abang, Joget, which is his continued development of \"excavating\" inherent memories within the body through the abuse of the flesh.\n\nOne brought us on a whimsical journey, using the \"vocabulary of dreams\", while the other was more obfuscated, although it appealed to a small, dedicated audience.\n\nSo Suteru Tabi first, which features a bare plot revolving around a man who learns of his father's death and goes on a train journey with his family members. None of it is physical but mimed, and the tale unfolds in dream-like fashion and in fragmented sequences that require you to leave conventional means of comprehension at the door.

Cohabitation-related sound and privacy issues notwithstanding, many one or two- person households now prefer to keep their interior spaces open plan with an integrated sleeping area instead.\n\nFor years, one of the best ways to achieve the open-plan bedroom has been to install a Murphy bed - a hinged bed that folds vertically into a wall closet when not in use. Various legends have it that in the early 20th century, William Lawrence Murphy applied for a patent on the device, which he devised to turn his bedroom into a parlour to make it socially acceptable for him to entertain ladies. (Or, less salaciously, maybe the idea was for him and his wife to entertain in their modest home.) Either way, the Murphy bed surged in popularity in the 20s and 30s when buildings like those in Tudor City on the far east side of Manhattan were developed; special Murphy bed closets made these diminutive studio apartments more livable during waking hours. But these clever beds, which were often uncomfortable and shabbily made, lost their allure after World War II as people flocked to houses in the suburbs.\n\nNevertheless, the fold-up wall bed has quietly been making a resurgence in recent years, as the world's population becomes increasingly urban, family sizes are shrinking, more people are choosing to live alone, and the price of real estate in crowded cities becomes more and more unaffordable. Companies around the world are designing beds that disappear into walls, can be stowed via remote control, or are even stored on the ceiling.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/a7703c33b65416434e931752c0e10622652f73fd86a93b5331072342b009b4e3?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Space-saving: Many micro-condos in North America are installing upscale beds that turn back into sofas (or other furniture) by day, giving the small-space dweller the equivalent of a secret room. - FILE PHOTO"}]}

In the face of three rounds of quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve and persistent, record-low interest rates, six further rounds of cooling measures followed, till January 2013. The measures included reductions in loan-to-value limits; the introduction of seller stamp duties (SSD), the rates of which were subsequently increased and the tenures extended; the imposition of additional buyers' stamp duties (ABSD), with differential rates for Singaporeans and foreigners, which rates were also later increased; and limits on maximum loan tenures.\n\nIn June 2013, the Monetary Authority of Singapore introduced a Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework which capped total borrowings at 60 per cent of qualifying income, based on stringent imputed interest rates.\n\nThese successive measures, which were introduced in a calibrated fashion, were timely and served their purpose. After increasing at 12 per cent per year during 2010 and 2011, private residential property prices slowed to 3 per cent in 2012 and then to one per cent last year. In the final quarter of 2013, they started to fall.

When he was younger, he started off by watching the local artisans making clay idols, and eventually learnt to make his own clay images of gods and goddesses.Since then, Maity has come a long way, and now has held over 60 exhibitions all over the world, and even won the Royal Watercolour Society Award in London.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

At the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Samsung on Monday launched a 105-inch behemoth that displays ultra-high definition. Its fellow South Korean rival, LG, announced both a curved TV and a curved smartphone, the G Flex. Both companies are showing off HDTVs whose screen you can bend on demand.\n\nWhether there's actually a market for these devices, or if they're just outlandish proofs of concept, is anyone's guess. For how much they're likely to cost (they won't say, but Samsung's 55-inch curved screen retails for US$9,000), the bendy screens don't seem very worth it. But gimmickry aside, the technology behind these devices is the real achievement, because they point to a future where flexible materials have become a common fixture everywhere - and not just in the living room.\n\n\"It's a big leap forward,\" said John Richard, the global business manager of DuPont's displays division.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Technology\n\nSingapore ranks among top cities for tech talent as AI job listings surge globally: report\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:37 AM\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

SMU also suggested it will offer a full degree course in applied mathematics and may consider a liberal arts programme and residential college in the future.\n\nThese constitute a progressive step for SMU that will take the university beyond the US-styled private business school it originally set out to be. To be sure, it would be unfair to compare SMU with any of these American business schools as a significant part of their reputation and credibility has been built through their post-graduate MBA and executive-level programmes. It is through such programmes too that these business schools have been able to build substantial and affluent alumni networks that have contributed generously to the endowment of the schools. Singapore currently has at least four well established business schools - French institution Insead, the Essec Business School, as well as business schools from the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). There are other smaller schools as well. For a relatively small potential student base in Singapore and the region, SMU may find itself in an increasingly crowded and perhaps saturated pool. Its move to expand its scope of offerings may thus also make good strategic sense.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member in 2 minutes to keep reading.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\nS$9.90\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nsave 50%\n\nYearly recurring\n\nS$4.95\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nBilled yearly\n\n118.8\n\nS$59.40\n\nContinue reading\n\nCancel anytime\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal\n\nRECOMMENDED", "images": []}

It was later expanded to cover people's needs in housing, health care and investment.\n\nYoung workers now contribute 20 per cent of their wages to the scheme, while their employers contribute 16 per cent.

I often get asked this question during my regular meetings with business leaders and CIOs (chief information officers). Customers want to know how they can leverage these trends, as well as how they can address any challenges.\n\nThese trends, including the explosion of data, cloud computing and the multitude of personal devices on the corporate network, are fast changing the way organisations traditionally manage their business. The challenges and opportunities are more apparent than ever, and look set to drive IT and business decisions in the coming year.\n\nWe believe there are four key themes through which we can help customers improve their IT agility: Transform, Connect, Inform and Protect.

Our political and corporate structures are based on a closed loop system of governance.\n\nIn the basic democratic model, political leaders are elected to set policies while civil servants are appointed to implement them. Every few years, the report cards of political leaders are examined by the electorate and, if they are found wanting, new officials are elected.\n\nSimilarly, in a corporate setting, shareholders elect the board of directors who, in turn, appoint management to run the company in the interests of the shareholders. At the annual general meeting, the board must answer to the shareholders who may elect new directors.\n\nYou could say this system of governance - which distributes the rights and responsibilities among different participants - has generally worked well.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War in 1991 and the adoption of capitalism and democratic reforms in China, the former Soviet Union and other countries, the world economy and global wealth have grown rapidly.\n\nWhen practised, good corporate governance enhances the performance of not just individual companies, but also the performance of the entire economic system.\n\nYet, on several occasions the system of governance has clearly broken down. When these failures in governance are scrutinised, the causes can often be traced to the people in power acting primarily out of their own narrow self-interests instead of the greater interests of the constituents, whom they should be serving.\n\nTherein lies the second axiom, and the core difficulty of governance: power does tend to corrupt. It is not easy, and some would even say unnatural, for those in power to serve and to always act in the interests of, as well as be fully accountable to, the citizens or shareholders.\n\nHarking back to the words of the CEO I noted earlier, he was essentially communicating the point that many leaders, enlightened as they may be, will say: \"I agree with having controls, accountability and reporting, but I would rather not be subject to them myself.\"\n\nWhen these leaders go too far off-course, their companies, and sometimes part of the economic system, can crash. In turn, corporate failures lead to hindsight analysis that often recommends increasing the number of rules and regulations to ensure that corporate boards and management behave in the future.\n\nThe 2001 collapse of Enron in the US resulted in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the drastic tightening of rules for company financial reporting. The 2008 global financial crisis resulted in US regulatory proposals to address consumer protection, executive pay and weaknesses in the banking system. At the same time, European regulators introduced Basel III regulations for banks with tighter capital, liquidity and risk-taking requirements.\n\nIn Singapore, the Pan-El debacle of 1985 led to amendments to the Companies Act alongside more statutory controls for audit committees of listed companies. After the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and the reviews that followed, Singapore introduced a Code of Corporate Governance in 2001, which became operational in 2003. The Code has since been updated twice - in 2005 and 2012 - while the Singapore Companies Act is set to have the largest number of amendments made to it since its enactment.\n\nOne setback of these \"safeguards\" is that new rules are often just layered upon existing ones. The process of compliance thus becomes an increasingly complex and costly one for companies.\n\nUnfortunately, the increasing number of rules also creates the erroneous impression that corporate governance is just about ensuring compliance with the maze of rules. Instead, what boards and companies should really be doing is to focus on performance rather than on conformance.\n\nAfter all, companies exist primarily to create value. The role of boards must, therefore, be to ensure that the companies they govern can, and do, create value, albeit within the context of the regulatory environment in which they operate.\n\nAt the same time, it is not commonly agreed as to what kind of value companies should be creating. Traditional capitalists would argue that it is exclusively about shareholder value. An emerging view is that it should be tempered by the broader notion of stakeholder values that include the needs of employees, the community and the environment.\n\nCorporate governance - the mainstay of the board of directors - is therefore a crucial but not straightforward matter. In future articles in this series, my SID colleagues and I will explore these various facets of boardroom matters.\n\nThe writer is chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors.

OCBC's biggest shareholder is Selat Pte Ltd, an investment unit of the Lee family.\n\nOCBC is in exclusive talks with the Hong Kong bank's majority shareholders until the end of the month to buy over Wing Hang Bank for an estimated $5.8 billion, or 1.7 times its estimated 2013 book value.\n\nResponding to a question during a panel discussion at The Business Times-Maybank Kim Eng Invest Asia 2014 forum, Mr Wong pointed to OCBC's acquisitions of Indonesia's Bank NISP in 2005 and ING Asia Private Bank in 2009, which, he said, turned out to be important pieces for OCBC with potential for long-term growth.\n\n\"So the rationale for Wing Hang bank is the same . . . China is the engine in terms of its economy, and they need to fit that into the jigsaw,\" said Mr Wong.\n\n\"We cannot pretend to know what the full synergies are, and they probably have a game plan. If they are not able to execute the game plan, they will be punished (by shareholders).\"\n\nMaybank Kim Eng research head Ng Wee Siang, however, cautioned investors against buying the stock.\n\n\"You're entering a market that is extremely competitive. You're just buying a connection to a high- growth region and you're paying 6 billion,\" he said, adding that it will take a long time before the bank sees any payout from the investment.\n\nThe investment might make sense for investors with a horizon of six years, said Mr Ng. But for those with a one-year investment horizon, the brokerage's pick is DBS, which he said will especially benefit from the anticipated upturn in interest rates with its strong deposit franchise.\n\nOCBC's shares have fallen 4.41 per cent so far this year to $9.75 on Friday. DBS has risen 1.58 per cent over the same period to $17.37.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With easy access to the Internet, clinical practice guidelines will become more and more apparent in the medical landscape, both from the doctor's and patient's perspectives. Clinical practice guidelines for different medical specialities have been proliferating so rapidly that it is an impossible task for primary physicians to keep up with.\n\nGiven the trend towards sub-specialisation in many developed countries, it is extremely difficult for most specialists to keep up with guidelines within their speciality let alone other specialities. Guidelines are precisely what they are meant to be, that is, guidelines. They are not meant to be laws and regulations to govern the practice of medicine, but rather, beacons to guide physicians as they meander through this rapidly changing medical landscape and sometimes confusing maze of data that endlessly emanates from medical trials.\n\nLest you search the Internet and start reading treatment guidelines for a condition that you may have, you will need to be aware of the limitations of the guidelines even if you can navigate through the subtleties of the medical jargon and technical terms.\n\nGuidelines are produced for specific population groups in specific regions with specific medical resources. Many of the guidelines produced in the US and Europe may not be practical or applicable in many countries in Asia and Africa as the training of medical professionals, the population characteristics, the economic situations, the healthcare infrastructure, the disease patterns and culture make the application of these guidelines impractical and impossible.\n\nEven for developed countries with access to the same healthcare resources, the guidelines are not identical even though they have access to the same body of data as is the case for guidelines issued by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC). At the recent ACC Annual New York Cardiovascular Symposium in December last year, Professor Valentin Fuster, one of the most respected mentors in cardiology in the US and the current editor-in-chief of the Journal of the ACC, was was asked about clinical practice guidelines. He replied: \"Fortunately, physicians have brains to think and not just follow guidelines.\"\n\nAre guidelines the biblical truth?\n\nFormulation of guidelines need a significant amount of time and often requires input from many expert parties. Hence, they are only revised and updated once in a few or several years. The unending march of advances in medicine may not be represented in the guidelines.\n\nWhile guidelines help doctors make decisions on patient management, they may not always be supported by strong trial data. Cardiologists all over the world routinely place stents in patients with 50 per cent or more stenosis of the left main stenosis and 70 per cent or more in the main coronary arteries, based on the recommendations of the guidelines from the AHA and ESC. However, for stable patients with significant blockage of the heart arteries, compared to medication, there is as yet no well designed trial data which demonstrates that intervention with stents improves survival and lowers the risk of a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, guidelines are based on the consensus of experts as evidence from studies are unavailable. In addition, guidelines may be based on limited data. For example, while scoring systems for heart disease risk profiling are widely recommended for use, these scoring systems are based on data collected by observing specific populations in specific communities and there is now no well designed study to validate whether this can be applied in other communities with different racial, cultural and socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nDespite this limitation, many physicians still use the Framingham risk-scoring system although the data on which it has been based was derived from a white population in a specific community in the US.\n\nThis limitation has recently been recognised by the AHA and ACC, and hence in their latest guidelines they have discarded the previous Framingham scoring system for a new scoring system to better reflect the diversities in the population in US.\n\nGuidelines and real world experience\n\nThe nature of guidelines means that data obtained as a result of averaging data from different individuals and combining data from studies from different countries are then applied to individuals. Another limitation of data obtained from studies is that trials are often designed to get the best outcome for any treatment procedure and hence, there are specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients who are selected for the study. Hence, the outcomes from these studies may not translate to the same outcomes when applied to real world situations as many of these real world patients would not have been included in the study as they do not meet the selection criteria.\n\nGuidelines are based on trial data from high volume centres with considerable experience and resources to produce consistent results. However, the same outcomes may not be replicated in the real world situation where the average medical facility does not have such expertise, experience or volume of patients to be able to reproduce the results.\n\nFor example, non-invasive investigations used for the detection of blocked heart arteries such as treadmill stress testing, stress echocardiography, stress radionuclide myocardial perfusion scans and radionuclide PET CT scans are used routinely to assess patients who are suspected of having significantly blocked heart arteries. Data from published studies show that if the non-invasive test is abnormal, as high as more than 90 per cent of these patients were found to have significant blockage of the heart arteries for some of these test modalities. Data from the US coronary angiography (invasive X-ray test to image the heart arteries) registry from real world patients by Patel published in the NEJM showed that for patients who had an abnormal non-invasive test, only about 40 per cent were found to have significant blockage of the heart arteries.\n\nConsidering that the data was from a developed country such as the US, the startling difference in accuracy of the tests results between trial data and real world registry data only serves to remind us that while guidelines are based on data from high volume centres with significant experience, this level of accuracy cannot be replicated in most real world medical facilities. Since real world data can sometimes be substantially different from trial data, these guidelines may not always apply. Physicians must use their clinical judgment to recognise the areas in which they have strong expertise and are best able to produce the best outcomes for patients.\n\nUtility of guidelines\n\nThe main usefulness of clinical practice guidelines is to help physicians identify those patients who are most likely to derive benefit from the prescribed treatment and to provide the prescribed treatment in a manner which is most likely to result in a benefit for the patient and least likely to result in adverse outcomes. In applying the guidelines, one must understand the implications of the trial results that form the basis for the formulation of guidelines. One must not forget that in many treatment trials, only a small percentage of patients have adverse events and even with therapy, the benefit is only seen in a small percentage of those who had potential adverse events prevented.\n\nIf for example, 10,000 patients were treated compared to another 10,000 patients with a similar clinical profile who were given a placebo, and the treated group had 25 heart attacks compared to 50 for the placebo group over the same period of time, it would mean that the treatment reduced the heart attacks by 50 per cent. However, it would also mean that 10,000 patients had to be treated to prevent 25 heart attacks. This does not take into account the side effects of treatment and socio-economic cost of treating these 10,000 patients.\n\nHowever, if the result is statistically significant, then this will be used as evidence to formulate guidelines. Hence, while guidelines do help to point the way in the decision pathway for physicians, the physicians must ultimately use his experience and clinical judgment to produce the best outcomes for the patients with the lowest possible risks. Guidelines cannot replace thinking physicians.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre. It is produced on alternate Saturdays.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Five young F&B entrepreneurs who have recently done so offer tips on how to spread your wings smartly. By Debbie Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSeek unconventional spaces\n\nNong by Edible Gardens\n\nPeople's Park Complex rooftop carpark\n\nPop-up store opens Jan 20 till end March,\n\nwhile the permanent farm space will be ready by mid-year\n\nAS the gentrification of historic Chinatown advances with gusto, and shophouse rentals on popular F&B streets quickly creep upwards of $12,000 a month, one must build where Singaporeans know best: skywards.\n\nNever mind if one is a new-age farmer looking to start Asia's largest urban farm. Or if the only space available is a barren, concrete rooftop carpark smack in the middle of towering skyscrapers.\n\nFor Bjorn Low, that will do.\n\nThe co-founder of urban farming consultancy, Edible Gardens, and his team of 10 are currently sowing the seeds - literally - for their largest project to date: Nong, a 60,000 sq ft farm to be laid across the open-air, top floor of the People's Park Complex carpark.\n\nNong (which means \"agriculture\" in Mandarin) takes inspiration from urban farms such as the Brooklyn Grange, a 2.5 acre farm set on two rooftops in New York, and it is targeted to be ready by the middle of the year.\n\n\"It is no longer about just building a garden, we will be running a full-fledged farm,\" says Mr Low, whose consultancy works with local restaurants and hotels to erect and maintain edible gardens in their backyards. He was approached to collaborate by the carpark's \"forward-thinking\" landlord a few months ago, he says. \"More than just a romantic idea, we want to build a model for sustainable city living to show what can be achieved.\"\n\nThis includes sprouting \"highly productive\" edible crops such as herbs and spices, flowers and micro-greens, which will be sold via \"box schemes\", or regular orders, to restaurants and individual consumers.\n\nA small enclosure will be later introduced on the carpark floor below for organic mushroom farming, which will be done in collaboration with coffee joints in the city, Mr Low shares. Varieties such as oyster mushrooms will be grown on recycled coffee grounds collected from partner cafes such as Common Man Coffee Roasters, and the waste generated by these eateries will then be composted for use as fertiliser on the farm.\n\n\"We want to close all the loops,\" adds Mr Low. When functional, the farm will offer employment to graduates of the Pathlight School, which Edible Gardens currently works with to run a curriculum module on farming.\n\nTo generate public interest meanwhile, the team will be launching a two month-long pop-up retail and lifestyle space in the sheltered 3,000 sq ft space on the rooftop.\n\nOne-third of the indoor space will retail urban farming equipment such as seeds and organic fertilisers and pesticides, all packaged in smaller quantities and starter kits for greenhorns living in small spaces.\n\nAnother third will retail locally designed, ethically produced furniture and other lifestyle accessories supplied by homewares e-tailers, Naiise and Haystakt; and the final third will be used for cooking classes and workshops on vegetable-growing and terrarium and soap-making, which will kick off after Chinese New Year.\n\nThe rooftop will also host a one-day farmer's market on Feb 28, which will see local food producers and restaurants such as Morsels and the Cajun Kings serving food made with the first fruits of Nong's early harvests.\n\nNo further plans have yet been inked for the indoor space when the pop-up retail store ends in March, but Mr Low hopes that visionary chefs will move in to run permanent farm-to-table restaurants supplied by Nong. The irony of the project is exactly what drew The Cajun Kings' Melvin Chen to it:\n\n\"The farm is set right in the middle of the city, yet you don't feel claustrophobic. And under an aged block of flats occupied mainly by senior citizens and foreign workers, you get a group of young people building on a dream like this. It's completely unexpected.\"\n\nGrow slow, and minimise\n\nmanpower costs\n\nCarpenter and Cook Jr\n\n17 Jasmine Road\n\nTel: 6457 1510\n\nwww.carpenterandcook.com\n\nHours: 8am-8pm (Tue to Sun)\n\nLOVE the baked goods at Carpenter and Cook but loathe standing in line with the post-90s hipsters who regularly throng the Bukit Timah cafe?\n\nWe bring good tidings: the vintage furniture store-cum-cafe will be launching its first branch just off Upper Thomson Road today.\n\nHoused in a former cakeshop amid a row of shophouses behind Thomson Plaza, the 600 sq ft \"grab and go\" bakery will only offer retail items and takeaways.\n\nWhile their original outlet on Lorong Kilat largely sold cakes by the slice (whole cakes had to be ordered two days in advance), Carpenter and Cook Junior will additionally churn out ready-made whole tarts, quiches and cakes daily for people who \"just want to drop by to pick up cakes while on their way home or to a friend's party\", says cafe co-owner and head baker, Sim Li-Shenn.\n\nThe whole cakes and tarts will come in three quirkily-named sizes: It's All Mine for individual serves, Having Company for groups of six to eight, and Feeding the Village, for up to 12 people. Around five types of whole cakes will be available each day and they come in flavours such as lemon meringue, orange polenta and sea salt caramel walnut cheesecake. A range of pastries such as croissants and danishes will also be added, along with an expanded confectionery retail shelf of homemade jams, marshmallows, granola and brand-new ready cake mixes.\n\nMost of the larger furniture items for retail will be concentrated at the Bukit Timah outlet, while vintage knick-knacks at Carpenter and Cook Jr will be largely ornamental - and strategically arrayed for avid Instagrammers.\n\nAs with their first outlet, the trio chose the off-the-radar residential location as \"we wanted to be in a housing estate where we can serve the neighbourhood\", explains co-owner, Eunice Yeo. Jr is an abbreviation of the term \"junior\" as well as a subtle homage to the cafe's address.\n\nThey took their time with the expansion, which comes 11/2 years after they launched Carpenter and Cook, preferring to grow the business in small steps, says Ms Yeo.\n\nIn June last year, they moved the cafe's kitchen to the basement to expand the seating area of the Lorong Kilat outlet. They subsequently spun off their events business - which grew from creating the occasional dessert table to now styling weddings, birthdays and anniversary parties on a weekly basis - into a separate business entity, Heaven in a Wildflower.\n\n\"We've learnt a lot from the first outlet, and wanted to be cautious with the second,\" says Ms Yeo. This meant deflecting enquiries about expansion and franchising opportunities, which were broached as early as in their third month of operations, and expanding \"only when everyone is comfortable and clear with their roles\".\n\nA takeaway outlet helps them to minimise their manpower costs, while offering economies of scale in food production, explains Ms Sim. The entire space can be booked for private events such as art exhibitions after the bakery has shut for the day.\n\nTo fete their launch, close friend and London-based Singaporean food stylist Lee Shu Han will be holding a one day-only pop-up bake sale in the space this afternoon.\n\nMs Lee will be selling gourmet open-faced toasts made with loaves from traditional bakery Ghee Leong in Whampoa estate, topped with locally sourced ingredients from Green Circle Eco-farm and Edible Gardens.\n\nCollaborate with others\n\nSmith Street Taps\n\n02-62 Chinatown Complex,\n\n335 Smith Street Tel: 9430 2750\n\nHours: 6pm-11pm (Tue-Sat)\n\nIF you can, do. If you can't, collaborate.\n\n\"You may have a good idea that won't take off if you do it alone, but it may work when you put your strengths together with someone else's,\" offers The Good Beer Company's Daniel Goh.\n\nHis week-old latest venture, Smith Street Taps, is a case in point. The kopitiam stall in Chinatown Complex - one of Singapore's first watering holes to offer a range of craft beers on tap - is run jointly with Meng Chao of Clementi craft beer bottleshop, Brewer's Craft.\n\nThe idea struck the two men a balmy evening some months ago over a few mugs of beer. \"Meng Chao and I started out in the craft beer scene at the same time, and we both surprised people in different ways: he, by opening in an HDB location, and I, in a hawker centre,\" says Mr Goh. Even though the former is technically a competitor, \"we both share the same frame of mind, that is, we want to take the craft beer scene here forward - by doing craft beer for craft beer's sake.\"\n\nBoth men will personally maintain the 9 sq m stall's eight taps, which will dispense an ever-changing selection of five to seven different labels of craft brews such as Moa Brewery's Pale Ale, Rogue Ales' Hazelnut Brown Nectar and the made-in-Singapore Kiasu stout from local outfit, Jungle Brewery. Beers go for $8 to $13 a pint, relatively cheaper than their bottled counterparts.\n\nPrice aside, their taste can be as different as night and day, says Mr Goh. \"Kegged craft beers are better for easy drinking. Their quality should be high, that is, they should taste as they were when first kegged,\" he explains. Craft beers that are bottled-fermented, meanwhile, will see their flavour profiles continually evolve as the beer ages within the bottle. His goal is to one day also include cask ale - often considered too fragile to be kegged - among his taps.\n\nThe decision to locate the new stall just three units from his existing The Good Beer Company stall, he says, serves a practical and a symbolic purpose.\n\nThe proximity makes it easier for him to physically watch over both businesses and reduce his reliance on manpower (\"it's hard enough finding people who know about beer, let alone ones who don't mind working in a hot and sweaty hawker centre,\" says Mr Goh). Secondly, he hopes that his visibly growing fiefdom in the hawker centre - which most evenings draws in a sizeable crowd of expatriates and trendy creative types to the ageing food centre - can be a model to inspire more young entrepreneurs to launch hipster food stalls in a kopi-tiam environment.\n\n\"Rather than rent a shophouse, why not open a taco stand in a hawker centre? Or a cool retail store in one of the sundry shop units in the wet market?\" he suggests. \"It costs less to start and hence there's a lower risk of failure. And unlike private landlords, the National Environment Agency won't slap a 300 per cent rent increase on you overnight,\" he laughs.\n\nScour for second-hand bargains\n\nDapper Coffee\n\n#03-28 Market Street Food Centre,\n\n50 Market Street Tel: 8233 9810\n\nHours: 10am-5pm (Mon-Fri), closed weekends\n\nWHILE La Cuisson and Saveur are oft-lauded success stories of hawkerpreneurs who did well enough to expand out of their coffee-+shop beginnings and into air-conditioned shophouse surrounds, Dapper Coffee took quite the opposite trajectory.\n\nThe speciality coffee joint first started in July as a concept-within-a-concept at The Spiffy Dapper, a no-frills cocktail bar in a Boat Quay shophouse, and two months ago went on to launch its first offshoot in Market Street Food Centre.\n\nBut don't sniff at their humble hawker surrounds, for the bite-sized stall pulls out decent espresso-based coffees priced from $3 for a shot to $8 for a cold brew steeped for eight hours and served in a recycled beer glass bottle - the same rates as you'll get at their Boat Quay flagship. The signature Dapper blend used at both outlets is a mix of woody Brazil, Peru and Papua New Guinea beans and, in keeping with its cocktail bar lineage, lattes come in experimental flavours such as gula melaka, raspberry and milo.\n\nThe coffee expansion is a partnership between The Spiffy Dapper founder Abhishek Cherian George and former Chye Seng Huat Hardware coffee barista, Ahmadi bin Mohamed, and cost just $2,000 to start.\n\n\"Most cafes these days invest about $15,000 to $20,000 on equipment alone. We spent $1,000 on ours,\" says Mr George. Instead of parading the latest and shiniest machinery from top-of-the-line brands, the duo paid $350 for a 14-year-old espresso machine worth $4,000 from a cafe that was closing down, and acquired an eight-year-old coffee grinder for another $500. They later traded in the used machine for a smaller but brand new Expobar Levia espresso machine worth $3,800.\n\n\"Gumtree and Facebook are your best friends,\" quips Mr George on his second-hand scores. \"Just because you're using the best equipment doesn't mean the coffee will turn out right if you don't have the skill. On the contrary, even by using old machines, you can produce good quality coffee with consistency - you just need to know what you are doing,\" adds Mr Ahmadi .\n\nThe Spiffy Dapper itself was started in March last year on a shoestring budget of $7,000. Mr George was offered the previously unused second floor space by the owner of the Indian restaurant below. \"With rents as they are in Singapore, maximising the use of space is key. Businesses may be sitting on unused, empty spaces that can be used to help aspiring entrepreneurs to get started without the high overheads,\" he says.\n\nBesides adding a bookshelf \"to create a mini-cafe within a coffeeshop stall\", Mr George and Mr Ahmadi will also bring in a microwave-sized tabletop roaster to begin roasting their own coffee beans in two months.\n\n\"We want to bring speciality coffee to more public spaces, so people don't have to feel intimidated about going into a chic cafe to try them,\" says Mr Ahmadi, whose dream is to start a coffee village by 2016 that will physically gather the various independent speciality coffee players in Singapore in one destination.\n\nMr George, meanwhile, hopes to launch 10 to 15 more Dapper Coffee outlets in the Central Business District over the next few years; they will be linked up via a mobile ordering app so customers can have their daily cuppa delivered to their offices on demand.\n\nMaximise space\n\nSlake\n\n15 Swan Lake Avenue\n\nOpens April\n\nWHEN Jeremy Cheok, private chef-turned-chef-owner of Kampung Bahru bistro OKB, needed more elbow room for cooking in his conservation shophouse kitchen, expansion inevitably came on the cards.\n\nBut when Mr Cheok was scouting around for a central kitchen to store larger equipment used for his private dinners, he came across the perfect-sized space.\n\nThe only drawback was that while the kitchen space was perfect, there was a dine-in space in front which he had no manpower to run.\n\nSo he worked out a clever alternative: he tied up with a partner to run the space - previously occupied by the now-closed Big Sheila - as a gastropub, which will serve food prepared by his central kitchen in the back.\n\n\"A small gastropub on its own would be really expensive to run in relation to the number of seats available. You'd need a full complement of staff in the kitchen and trained bartenders out front in a bar that is expensive to stock,\" Mr Cheok elaborates. A central kitchen on the shared premises would thus help to ease manpower and recipe development costs.\n\nSet to open in three months, the 30-seater Slake will dish out individual servings of modern pub grub in contrast to the family-style meals and South-east Asian flavours at OKB. Dinners will start at $30 per head and brunch will cost less than $20, while lunch will be introduced at a later stage. Drinks prices will also be kept \"neighbourhood-friendly\", starting at $12 for a pint of beer or a classic cocktail, and around $10 for bar bites.\n\n\"We really want to get to know everyone around us - we don't want to be that expensive, empty neighbourhood establishment,\" says Mr Cheok, who lives in the East and will be splitting his time between both outlets. Slake is a shortened version of \"Swan Lake\" and is, aptly, a synonym for quenching one's thirst.\n\n\"My philosophy towards dining out is that you have to be satiated at the end of any meal so you won't find minuscule, overpriced portions at Slake,\" says Mr Cheok. Cheers to that.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/moodys-assigns-ba1-rating-oue-c-reit", "site_title": "Moody's assigns Ba1 rating to OUE C-Reit", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMoody's assigns Ba1 rating to OUE C-Reit\n\nProvisional corporate family rating takes into account the Reit's weak financial profile and limited financial flexibility\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nMOODY'S Investor Service has assigned a provisional Ba1 corporate family rating to OUE Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust (OUE C-Reit), noting that while it has a portfolio of high-quality and strategically located assets in Singapore and China, the Reit's weak financial profile and limited financial flexibility constrain its rating.\n\nOUE C-Reit comprises an initial portfolio of OUE Bayfront in Singapore and Lippo Plaza in Shanghai. The OUE Bayfront property has total net lettable area (NLA) of about 37,381.8 square metres (sqm), and committed occupancy rate of 95.9 per cent for its office component and 100 per cent for its retail component. Lippo Plaza on the other hand has total NLA of 39,232.0 sqm. Committed occupancy for the office component as at Sept 30 was 86.5 per cent and 97.8 per cent for the retail component.\n\nOn the one hand, the rating takes into account the favourable industry dynamics which support stable recurring cash flows, said Jacintha Poh, a Moody's analyst. Supply of new office space in these locations is expected to remain tight, thereby supporting occupancy rates and the potential for higher rental rates.\n\nOn the other hand, the Reit's rating is constrained by the portfolio given its small asset size, limited operating track record, and concentration risk in regard to OUE Bayfront.\n\n\"OUE Bayfront, which contributes to over 60 per cent of the trust's gross rental income, commenced operations only in 2011 and has not been through a re-leasing cycle. Nonetheless, its high-quality and diversified tenant base will somewhat mitigate the risk,\" said Ms Poh.\n\nThere are also concerns on the acquisitions front, despite the sponsor and parent company's commitment to support the trust by injecting assets at a discount to valuation.\n\nThe trust's sponsor, OUE Limited, is a 55 per cent owned subsidiary of Lippo Group. OUE Limited is expected to retain a 45 per cent to 50 per cent stake in the trust after the IPO. At its listing date, the trust will be granted right of first refusal (ROFR) over three of its sponsor's properties.\n\n\"Due to the small scale, any future acquisitions will have to be considered carefully. The Singapore assets available on ROFR will almost double the size of OUE C-Reit, and will require substantial funding - through equity issuances - to remain within its rating parameters,\" she said.\n\nAt listing, OUE C-Reit will have debt of approximately $698.2 million, and a committed revolving credit facility of $100 million, of which $49 million will remain undrawn upon listing.\n\nAlthough OUE C-Reit has no near-term refinancing risk, with its first debt obligation maturing 36 months after the initial drawdown, its debt maturity profile is lumpy and concentrated in 2017, noted Ms Poh.\n\nMoody's would expect the trust to take steps to spread out and lengthen its debt maturity profile over the next 12 months, she said.\n\nOUE C-Reit's currently expected issue price of each unit under the offering is 80 cents per unit.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMOVE over coffee joints. The latest hipster venture to be in is retail - selling specially curated lifestyle products, from notebooks to fashion accessories, home accessories and even bicycles.\n\nTake a new kid on the block - the Redundant Shop at Everton Park, which opened last month. Tucked under a block of flats in this emerging hipster neighbourhood no less, founder Watson Lee says the idea came about after readers of his Redundant Magazine started asking where they could find the cool stuff they read about. \"We started off as an online shop before moving into a physical one.\"\n\nThe shop carries products from all around the world, including KiBiSi from Denmark, Diamantina & La Perla from Colombia, and local labels such as Ang Ku Kueh Girl, Desinere and Woon Hung.\n\nLifestyle shops carrying independent brands have been popping up in recent years. Other shops that are popular with the hipster crowd include Strangelets, Supermama and Tyrwhitt General Company.\n\nMr Lee does not think he is late in jumping on the bandwagon. \"What we are offering may look similar to many, but we are different from the rest,\" he says. \"Unlike other indie shops, which stock mostly fashion products and accessories, The Redundant Shop curates products based on our magazines' six categories - Architectural, Design, Gadgets, Rides, Culture and Style.\"\n\nHe cites an example under the magazine's Ride category, which features cars, bikes and bicycles. \"You will probably not find helmets or bikers' accessories in other indie shops except ours. For bicycles, most of the other indie shops may have a bicycle on display, but we don't just display them, we sell more than four different brands.\"\n\nThose who have already been running their shops for a period of time, say they are unfazed by the competition.\n\nEdwin Low says that when he first started Supermama in 2011, \"I had this impression that competition would be stiff, and other independent shops were against me. However, when I was finally in it, it's actually a close-knit community with everyone egging one another on.\"\n\nColin Chen, one of the three founders of Tyrwhitt General Company says, \"Our approach is a little different, we try not to compete in terms of retail but we focus on creating unique experiences for our audiences.\" TGC often holds workshops to showcase the work of designers so that customers know what they can do.\n\nIf anything, Mr Chen welcomes more such shops. \"We always say that stores in Singapore are boring, but I think we are starting to see the boom in design-focused stores which is great for the local community in general.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And this \"eww\" factor is not just limited to the olfactory. Exposure to such chemicals may have effects that go beyond skin deep: In fact, a number of studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in the US have examined possible links between nail technicians' work and health outcomes, such as respiratory, neurological, and musculoskeletal effects, as well as other health conditions.\n\nBut how much harm is there really in a lunchtime mani or root colour touch-up? While current scientific studies can be inconclusive, a growing number of consumers are not taking any risks when it comes to getting their beauty fix.\n\n\"The unmistakable chemical odour from nail polish comes from a cocktail of alcohol, solvents and other toxins which enable the polish to stick to the nail, give it a shine, and prevent it from chipping,\" explains Zi Sha, the owner of Auum, a nail salon in PasarBella at Turf City dedicated to more natural, less toxic treatments. \"In addition, nail polish can be almost impossible to get off and is commonly presented in a bottle with a flammable symbol on the side.

The assessment takes into account Singapore's economic and geographical environment; its legal, judicial and institutional framework as well as crime trends. Emerging risks have also been identified for further study.\n\n\"The more vulnerable sectors include those that are internationally-oriented and cash-intensive,\" it said.\n\nThese sectors are where preventive measures against money laundering and terrorist financing are most needed. For many of them, such as banks and casinos, the relevant controls are in place.\n\nThese controls include customer due diligence, record keeping, ongoing transaction monitoring and rigorous supervision. In addition, Singapore has established an extensive international cooperation network for supervision and law enforcement to better combat transnational crime.\n\nSingapore is ranked by the International Monetary Fund as one of 25 systematically important financial centres in the world.\n\nThe large size of the financial sector, high volume of transactions and wide international reach inevitably expose Singapore to its share of the MLTF risks, the report said.\n\n\"Full banks face higher inherent risks, owing to their larger customer volumes and the international nature of their transactions,\" it said.\n\nThe private banking industry in Singapore has also grown significantly over the past decade, boosted by the rising wealth in Asia.\n\n\"This industry is traditionally associated with higher money laundering risk due to the more high value and bespoke services that can be offered, which has warranted additional due diligence on customers,\" it said.\n\n\"Overall, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) controls in banks are most developed, but there is scope for improvement in the areas of trade finance and correspondent banking.\"\n\nThe report also highlighted a number of sectors where controls are relatively less robust. These include remittance agents, money-changers, Internet-based stored value facility holders, CSPs and pawnbrokers.\n\nIn particular, it said CSPs have been identified as a sector with a higher level of risk owing to the companies that they help to incorporate for international customers.\n\n\"While CSPs generally do not handle large amounts of cash, there is a risk that the companies that they help to incorporate may be abused by criminals to set up complex and opaque structures for illicit purposes.\"\n\nThe Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority has proposed new legislation to regulate CSPs, which is expected to come into effect this year, to ensure that concerns relating to customer due diligence and beneficial ownership are adequately addressed.\n\n\"Relevant government agencies will be strengthening the legislative and supervisory framework through the year to address the risks in these sectors more effectively,\" the report said.\n\nAs technology evolves and criminals become more sophisticated, several areas have also been identified for further study. These include virtual currencies, precious stones and metals dealers, and the Singapore Freeport.\n\n\"(The) authorities will seek to better understand how money laundering and terrorist financing can be carried out through these channels, as well as review international best practices, to determine whether any safeguards and mitigating measures are needed.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another 10 paintings are displayed at the Asia Art Collective on Tanglin Road. The paintings are priced from $8,800 to $38,000, with 15 per cent of the proceeds going to the Singapore General Hospital's Needy Patients Fund.\n\nLiu's most famous work is a 60-metre scroll painting that he made in 1991 titled The Majesty of Mt Changbaishan, which broke the world record for the longest ink and colour scroll painting.\n\nHis fascination with the mountains has to do with the power of nature within them, he says. \"Nature is very important. Go and visit one of these mountains - you will realise how we humans are as small as ants in comparison. It gives you a sense of perspective about yourself, against the untainted beauty of nature. And that's what I try to capture in my work.\"\n\nSo far, Liu's paintings have been exhibited in locations around the world including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia and America.\n\nBut even before he found his calling in painting landscapes, Liu was already an artist in the making from the age of five. As a boy, he would make sculptures of zodiac animals out of candle wax, and later progressed to drawing portraits of the Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong to sell to the people in his village for a few cents.\n\n\"In those days, a few cents was equivalent to a month's salary in China. So I made even more money than my father sometimes,\" he says, laughing.\n\n\"But that was a long time ago. Now I am dedicated to painting these ink landscapes.\"\n\nLiu still makes it a point to go to China every year and spend some time wandering in the mountains to gain fresh inspiration to make new paintings. \"And every time I go into those mountains, I learn a lot about myself and my surroundings. That's a kind of accomplishment you cannot get by living an everyday life.\"\n\nThe Pulse Of Nature runs until Feb 7 at The Fullerton Hotel East Garden Foyer from 10 am to 8pm daily, and at Asia Art Collective at 19 Tanglin Road from 10.30 am to 7pm daily.

By Daven Wu\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHINK of Italy, and most people will immediately call up a mental slideshow of Rome, Florence and Milan with their crowded cityscapes, jostling mobs of camera-toting tourists all peering up at the statue of David, or hustling from one set of grand 2000-year-old ruins to the next, or, worse, scrambling for pole position in the Bottega Veneta atelier. And yet, curiously, just an hour or so south, the island of Sicily floats calmly in glorious sunshine and the balmy breeze of the Mediterranean, still every bit as Italian as the mainland and with just as much history.\n\nPerhaps the lingering whiff of its Cosa Nostra past has had something to do with why Sicily remains a little off the beaten tourist path, but even that is quickly subsumed by a general mood of bonhomie.\n\nAnd why not? The island's appeal is many splendoured and relatively timeless. Even during the low season - such as around Christmas - the days remain considerably warmer than the north and tourism is noticeably less feverish.\n\nSince time immemorial, Sicily has been a safe harbour and at the crossroads for merchant ships, roving marauders, fortune hunters and waves of immigrants led by successive Greek, Roman and Middle-Eastern overlords. This explains the almost pan-Moorish quality of the local Sicilians, their distinct patois and their unique take on architecture, design and fashion (say \"Ciao!\" to local boy made good, Dominico Dolce, one half of Dolce & Gabbana).\n\nWhat's more, the natural landscape is stunning. At every turn, the restless eye settles on a random palette of secluded beaches, wild volcanic mountains, ancient towns, the world's best granitas, imaginative cuisine and affordable hotels . . . all linked by a superb infrastructure of modern roads and conveniently located airports. Seriously, what's not to love about the place?\n\nGiven how easy it is to move around, consider renting a car and wending your way leisurely from one end of the coast to the other. However, if driving is not an attractive proposition, then there are any number of coaches that service the different towns as well as an efficient train network.\n\nIf you're arriving in Palermo, check into the Quintocanto (www.quintocantohotel.com) right in the centre of town and ask for a corner balcony room facing the church. From here, it's a quick walk to the local sights including the outre interiors of the 12th-century, gold mosaicked Palatine Chapel (www.federicosecondo.org), and the daily markets at Ballaro and Capo where the ancient alleys are taken over by stalls stacked high with cheeses, herbs and the freshest seasonal fish and fruit.\n\nOr else, hop into the car and half an hour later, you will be in the mountain top village of Monreale where the cathedral, built by the same generation of artisans who designed the Palatine, unleashed the full grandeur of their imagination to cover the entire interior with incredibly detailed gold mosaics depicting scenes from the Bible.\n\nShopaholics should hunt down Vallone (www.giovannivallone.it), a hole-in-the-wall atelier near the Piazza Borsa that makes amazing (and cheap) leather accessories that, if you squint, could pass for a Celine tote or a Commes des Garcons pouch. What a retail thrill to learn that some of the leather swatches are the very same ones used by Prada.\n\nAfter retail comes the extra fun bit - eating, which is practically a national pastime when one is in Italy, and more so in Sicily where the eternal sunshine is such a boon for vegetables and fruit. Adjourn to the Antica Focacceria S Francesco (www.afsf.it), a slow-food temple devoted to delicious homemade rice balls, and pasta tossed with anchovies, raisins and toasted breadcrumbs. The almond granita - smooth as silk - is, hands down, the best in Sicily, which is saying something.\n\nFrom Palermo, turn towards the south-east coast for an unrivalled collection of sun-kissed beaches and pretty little towns where life seems to go on pretty much the way it has for hundreds of years.\n\nDepending on the time of year, Taormina can be a hyperactive tourist trap, so if you're after a bit of peace and quiet, a little away from the madding crowd, drive on south along the coast for Avola Antica (www.avolaantica.it).\n\nPerched high on a limestone mountain overlooking the coast, this bijou agriturismo - a uniquely Italian bread and breakfast set on a farm - is a secluded gem where the very spartan rooms (starting from about 35 euros (S$60.4) per person including breakfast and dinner) are more than made up for by the scenery of coastal plains, ancient towns and the Mediterranean Sea; a garden of rosemary, lavender and figs; an outdoor pool shaded by olive trees; and a to-die-for dinner whipped up by the swarthy and dashing resident chef, Molino Santo.\n\nIf you're after a holiday that involves more than indolent pool-side reading, siestas and fabulous meals, then you must check into the nearby Baroque town of Noto. At the Seven Rooms (www.7roomsvilladorata.it), hotelier Cristina Summa has turned an ageing wing of the ancient Palazzo Nicolaci into a luxurious, gracious pavilion of high-ceilinged rooms, soothing colours and a breakfast terrace with panoramic views of Noto.\n\nDestroyed by an earthquake in 1693 (along with almost all the city's noble families), Noto was completely rebuilt which explains the uniformity and pristine quality of its burnished architecture, the perfectly preserved churches and generously proportioned urban grid. In the evenings, locals and visitors alike flock to the high street for the passeggiata (leisurely stroll) before adjourning for dinner.\n\nIn Noto, the idea of a bad meal is perverse, so gourmets are spoilt for choice. Our top hits include Ristorante Dammuso (via Rocco Pirri 10/12, tel: 0931 835786), Trattoria del Crocifisso (via Principe Umberto 46) and Marpessa (Vico Carrozzieri 10, tel: 0931 835225)\n\nFrom Noto, it's an easy day trip to any number of beaches. If culture calls, descend onto Siracusa for its Greek and Roman ruins and, in particular, the 3,500-year-old island of Ortigia. Here the catacombs - accessed from the Duomo Square and used during World War II as bomb shelters - are a must, as is the nearby cathedral with its trippy amalgam of Baroque shell encasing the original interiors of a 3,000-year-old Greek temple.\n\nBy this time, it will occur to you that after a week that seemed incredibly packed with activities, you've barely scratched this corner of Sicily, never mind the rest of the West Coast. Ragusa, another gorgeous Baroque town at the foot of the Iblei Mountains, remains uncharted, as are Modica and the Unesco Heritage listed Scicli, with its wonderful crop of palaces and churches.\n\nWhich is why, just before you head for the airport - your luggage filled with cheeses, spices and leather bags from Vallone secured in the rental car - you find yourself still at your favourite neighbourhood gelateria desperately scarfing down the last cup of granita while composing half-joking e-mails to your boss and family, explaining why you can't come home just yet.\n\nSicily can do that to you. And that is probably the island's greatest surprise.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are often used by companies with a low credit rating, but high growth potential.\n\nMr Marchionne is chief executive of both Fiat and Chrysler and engineered the merger between the Italian and US carmakers in a process started in 2009 when Chrysler exited bankruptcy after the global economic crisis.\n\nFiat already owns 58.5 per cent of Chrysler and said that it would buy up the remainder in a US$4.35 billion deal.\n\nThe combined entity, which Mr Marchionne said would have a new name, will be the seventh largest carmaker in the world once the merger is complete.\n\nMr Marchionne, who has been accused by Italian trade unions of planning to move Fiat out of Italy, said that the choice of listing would also influence where the headquarters of the new company would be, adding that this was \"a purely symbolic, emotional\" issue.\n\nIn terms of strategy, he said that Fiat-Chrysler would aim for the premium car market because in the mass market \"there are few clients, a lot of competitors, low margins and a complicated future\".\n\n\"We have fantastic brands that are premium by definition like Alfa Romeo and Maserati. Why not re-invent them?\"\n\nHe said that Alfa Romeo would unveil a new line-up of models in April that will \"change the image of the brand, returning it to absolute excellence\".\n\nMr Marchionne also said that the merger would be a boost for Italy, and all Fiat workers in Italy on reduced working hours or temporary redundancies would be able to return to work \"unless the market collapses again\".

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/bipolar-fortunes-bitcoin", "site_title": "The bipolar fortunes of Bitcoin", "publish_date": null, "content": "The bipolar fortunes of Bitcoin\n\nWhat regulators around the world do now about this virtual oddity that refuses to die will decide its future\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSingapore\n\nDEPENDING on the day of the week, Bitcoin is either on the brink of euphoric success, or complete and utter ruin. Either a big firm such as Zynga is adopting it (long live Bitcoin!), or a big country such as China is crushing it (rest in peace, Bitcoin).\n\nFor years, Bitcoin's proponents have wanted the currency to be taken seriously, and unfortunately for them, this is happening. Governments and central banks have turned their stony gaze on the heaving underworld of Bitcoin and begun or threatened to intervene. Now, what regulators do about this virtual oddity that refuses to die will decide its future.\n\nIn order to predict how anxious authorities are about Bitcoin on any given day, one just needs to consult the currency's price chart.\n\nFor example, in August last year when the Bitcoin hovered around a paltry US$100, Germany appeared mainly preoccupied with the potentially lost revenue. Then, it ruled that Bitcoin was \"private money\", and that any resulting profit would attract a capital gains tax.\n\nBut this week, with Bitcoin busting the US$1,000-mark again, what was considered \"private money\" started being treated like a public issue. On Tuesday, an official from Germany's central bank warned against the \"highly speculative nature\" of Bitcoins.\n\nAcross markets, officials trod a similar path of sombre concern last year. The European Banking Authority, India, Malaysia, France, Singapore and New Zealand have variously cautioned against Bitcoin's volatility or lack of a central authority.\n\nThe central authority-argument is precisely the reason Bitcoin is a superior alternative, some argue. \"Unlike a voucher, or points issued by a single entity like an airline or food court, there is no single counterparty to fail,\" says David Moskowitz of Coin Republic, a Bitcoin exchange platform.\n\nBe that as it may, in December, China tightened the screws on the Bitcoin industry in two steps - first banning financial institutions from carrying out Bitcoin transactions and later forbidding payment processors from working with Bitcoin exchanges by the end of January.\n\nIn the absence of a legal way to convert Bitcoin into and from yuan, the virtual currency will become Monopoly money within the mainland if workarounds on a large scale cannot be found. On the news, Bitcoin's price promptly plunged, falling 30 per cent to US$535. Even so, the currency displayed a frightful degree of resiliency, rebounding to US$800 even before Zynga sent the price soaring further last week by saying that it would accept Bitcoin as payment for in-game items.\n\n\"Overall, I think China's current restrictions have already been discounted into the price . . . Adoption of Bitcoin as a unit of exchange will continue despite China,\" says Coin Republic's Mr Moskowitz.\n\nAs governments stay wary, private firms and individuals have piled in. Gyft.com, a key online gift card service, now accepts Bitcoin for store credits from Whole Foods, Target and Victoria's Secret. On Thursday, Overstock.com sold its first item for Bitcoin - a patio set for US$2,700.\n\nIn Singapore, interest has also grown. Volumes on Bitcoin exchange FYB-SG crossed $850,000 in November - up from $100,000 in March 2013.\n\nWith the currency displaying staying power, Bitcoin proponents have rejoiced, but governments are bound to grow even more suspicious.\n\nWhile some worries are country-specific - in China, Bitcoin had been a way to circumvent yuan currency controls - others are general headaches. For most countries, Bitcoin represents yet another money-laundering hole to plug, another means of anonymously trading contraband and one more way to hoodwink the taxman.\n\nJust yesterday, a national risk assessment report involving the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said that the authority is closely watching the use of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin for illegal doings, and will \"consider the need for regulation if necessary\".\n\nEven among the countries that have not banned it outright, those ambivalent towards Bitcoin far outnumber the ones that are not. So far, only the United States, Canada and Hong Kong have approached anything remotely resembling tacit approval.\n\nIn the US, the Department of Justice told the Senate that Bitcoins can be a \"legal means of exchange\" in November. A month before that, Canada allowed the installation of the world's first Bitcoin ATM, and Hong Kong will soon have the second.\n\nAs lucrative businesses spring up around Bitcoin, the craving for legitimacy has increased. This, many believe, can be achieved through regulation. If countries have rules for Bitcoin usage, then there is at least a game to be played and won, goes the reasoning.\n\nShortly before new Chinese rules decimated volumes on its largest Bitcoin exchange, BTC China, its CEO said that regulations would be \"for the good of the consumer\".\n\nEven so, others are against the idea. \"In my opinion, any government intervention is negative and they should stay out of it,\" says FYB-SG's founder, Luv Khemani.\n\nRegulation has unpredictable outcomes. You could regulate something towards legitimacy, or you could regulate it to death. China's position on Bitcoin, for example, started out as regulation, but evolved - or mutated - into what is practically a ban.\n\nWhen Hong Kong said this week that it would not regulate the use of Bitcoin, many cheered. \"The best thing that any government can do is not to regulate anything, so ultimately, this is good news,\" says Tomas Forgac of BTCPOS, a Bitcoin point-of-sale system for merchants.\n\nToo much celebration, though, could be premature. Sometimes, governments do nothing simply because they have not made up their minds.\n\nThe making-up of minds can be messy. Take Hong Kong's reason for allowing Bitcoin ATMs: \"Bitcoin is not a currency.\"\n\nAnd then take Taiwan's reason for rejecting the same ATM: \"Bitcoin is not a currency.\"\n\nAlready, the same understanding of the issue has led to entirely different outcomes.\n\nThe difference in comprehension from country to country can be staggering. South Korea has dismissed Bitcoin as having no intrinsic value, but Germany sees the same thing as a unit of account that is solid enough to be taxed.\n\nAt the same time, the Bitcoin community continues to be at odds with its own.\n\nIn the US, the Bitcoin Foundation spent months last year charming Capitol Hill like a seasoned Washingtonian, meeting government officials to allay their fears.\n\nBut in the same year, the CEO of Overstock.com was quoted saying: \"Money is too important to leave in the hands of government officials . . . the long-run value of all fiat currencies goes to zero.\"\n\nThis disjoint in approach highlights a deeper schism over what Bitcoin should eventually become - an unregulated protocol free of establishment trappings or a respectable component of the global economy that toes the line of fiat currencies.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin has a foot in both realms of possibility. The French would say that its ass is between two chairs. (Actually, the French central bank says that Bitcoin represents a \"financial risk\". Its view on posteriors is not known.)\n\nNow, Bitcoin businesses are forced to operate on the shifting sands of policy and perception - an unsustainable kind of limbo.\n\nWhile Bitcoin refuses to die, it risks being neither dead nor alive - the ultimate undead of virtual currencies. But before it can be anything more than that, it will have to avoid being felled with a blow to the head by the blunt force of public policy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 10, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSO you already have a bottle opener, a salad bowl or two, and more than enough lamps for your home. Do you need more? Giovanni Alessi Anghini says yes, and this is not because he is a product designer.\n\n\"Products don't just solve needs. They are the main channel by which we communicate our personalities,\" says Mr Anghini, who hails from the famed Alessi family, best known for producing quirky designer kitchen and desktop accessories.\n\nUnlike most designers who would go to design school from the start, Mr Anghini chose to study cultural sociology and anthropology, because \"I had a strong interest in human behaviour\".\n\nBut coming from a family which made its name on good design, it soon became clear that Mr Anghini would eventually become a designer. \"I got bored after two years of studying sociology and anthropology in Florence. It was all theory and I was doing nothing concrete,\" he says.\n\nHe switched courses, choosing to study industrial design in Milan, but where he could \"explore the concept that I studied in sociology and use it in product design\".\n\nHe believes that products are linked to sociology and anthropology, and to people's behaviours. \"We no longer need products for their function, but more for the ability to explore imagination,\" he says. \"As a designer, I don't explore people's needs but rather their dreams.\"\n\nAs child, he liked taking things apart and putting them back together, and had always wanted to be an inventor. Asked if it was natural for him to become a designer, the Italian says no. In fact, among his 14 cousins, he is the only one interested in design. \"My grandfather, Carlo, was the last designer in the family before me,\" says Mr Anghini. The company, founded in 1921 by Mr Anghini's great grandfather, Giovanni, is now headed by his father, Alessio, and his uncle Alberto.\n\nHaving a famous last name can be a bane at times. Mr Anghini recalls that in school \"teachers were always saying everything I did was alright, even when I purposely submitted really bad work.\"\n\nRealising that this was not the kind of education he wanted, he worked for free with well-known designer Stefano Giovannoni, who designs for Magis, Moooi and Lazazza, among other brands. \"I wanted to learn about how things work in real life, how to be a proper designer,\" says Mr Anghini. Two years later, he left to start his own studio GAA Design Farm.\n\nAlessi does not have in-house designers, instead it chooses to work with independent designers. They include Giovannoni, Philippe Starck and Micheal Graves.\n\nMr Anghini designs for Alessi as well. Among the products, include the Moom salad bowl, and Pop-Up bottle opener. The latter, which resembles a stainless steel egg, won the Good Design Award in 2008, and is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Architecture and Design in Chicago.\n\nHe is especially proud of the range of LED lights done for Alessilux in collaboration with Foreverlamp. \"I wanted to bring LED technology to the masses, but there was a problem,\" he says. \"LED bulbs tend to be costlier than incandescent bulbs, but they can last longer. The question was how to convince people to pay more for something that is more energy saving in the long run.\"\n\nThe result is a series of lamps where the LED bulbs don't look like bulbs, but look like lamps. \"There is no longer a need to cover up the bulbs now,\" he says.\n\nMr Anghini says that for him, it is not about designing the best looking product, but rather about enhancing the user's experience. He cites the example of his bottle design for Adiacqua's Bognanco mineral water which resembles a top heavy vase. \"The design is an attempt to represent the intimate relationship with water,\" says Mr Anghini.\n\nIt took him four years to design Pop-Up, two years for the LED bulbs and six months for Bognanco. \"I'm getting faster,\" he quips. His focus now is on creating technological products, because \"technology has been and will still continue to change the way we live\".\n\nAt 32, he says he is too young to decide what he wants to be best known for. \"But probably the experience people have using my products matters most to me,\" he says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I'd much rather say, 'Hey, we have an online shop too'.\"\n\nShe started TDGS last year inside her Maxwell Road office. The store used to open every first Friday of the month, but since the start of the year, Ms Law has decided to move the retail business entirely online. \"This is to stay true to our core business in digital. We may pop-up from time to time at various places, but the doors will be shut for now,\" she says.\n\nTDGS sells anything from vintage drinking glasses and telephones to phone covers and pouches that have printed book covers on them, as well as knick-knacks from local stores, such as bookshop Books Actually and design label SBTG. \"We sell memories, mostly specific to the 1980s kid, local brands we love, and the unassuming piece of modern happiness,\" sums up Ms Law.\n\nSome of the things she sells can also be found in other indie shops. She dismisses any competition. \"The truth is, the local community is a very tightly knit one and we support one another. I don't think we even see it as competition to be honest. There are commercial benefits in growing an industry together as one,\" she says. Goodstuph also produces its own range of products, such as the Good Amulets, specially carved wooden pendants, engraved with a moral reminder, \"What good have you done today?\" on the back; as well as a pair of Goodstuph Stone Lions, similar to the ones seen outside towkays' homes.\n\nThese toy stone lions however have a more unconventional look. The female lion comes adorned with a Chanel necklace across her chest, while the male lion sports a tongue stud. The bestselling items however are the Adverjardon notebooks. The notebooks poke fun at buzzwords often said at meetings, such as \"paradigm shift\", \"value-add\" and \"synergy\". Concealed beneath each ordinary notebook is a well-hidden agenda - a scoring sheet that allows one to keep track of the 'douchebraggery' produced by the guilty party at the meeting.\n\nMs Law says the notebooks were made to poke fun at both the advertising industry as well as ourselves. \"Buzzwords are used rather frivolously in this industry, to the point where they hardly make any sense in a sentence let alone a meeting on the whole,\" says Ms Law. The idea came from Goodstuph's director of strategy, Eugenia Tan, who was inspired to keep herself entertained after barely surviving a meeting darting buzzwords.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Besides performing together, all of them are also heavily involved in their own film and TV projects.\n\n\"It definitely gets lonely when we're working on our own solo projects because over the years, we've gotten really comfortable with each other as a band,\" he says. \"But I also think that helps us build character and makes us stronger individuals.\"\n\nThe band was put together in 2006 from six winners of a Taiwanese reality TV show. Two members left in 2009 at the height of the band's popularity, causing the group to break up momentarily before the remaining members reunited a year later.\n\nAs the old saying goes, absence makes the heart grow fonder and A-Wei believes that that temporary split and downtime they spent from each other working on TV and films is what keeps Lollipop going stronger than ever. \"Being together in a group is a bit like a relationship between lovers - you want to be together all the time and no matter what happens, you try your best to keep things going,\" he says.\n\n\"But the reality is it might not always work out the way you think it would so it's something we have to face up to.\n\n\"Going from a six-piece to a quartet now also means each of us has to work harder to make up for the missing members.\"\n\nSince its re-formation, Lollipop F has also been looking to break into K-pop and has slowly made inroads. In 2011, it became the first Taiwanese band to appear on South Korean national TV.\n\nTheir pretty-boy looks and nifty dance moves have drawn comparisons to K-pop boybands like Super Junior, Big Bang and SHINee but A-Wei says the members of Lollipop F, who are all pushing 30, don't mind this at all.\n\n\"When we first started, we really hated it when people referred to us as a boyband,\" he explains. \"But now at our age, we'e actually quite flattered when people call us that!\"\n\nThe Four 2 is showing in cinemas islandwide now\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The government has now taken the efforts a big step further in legislating the scheme, at least in two sectors. Businesses in the cleaning and security services will soon have to adopt a tiered wage system, with cleaners' entry salary set at $1,000.\n\nIt's a laudable if bold move on the part of the government to, in effect, enforce a minimum wage level for the cleaning sector, which has among the lowest-paid workers in Singapore. But Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, announcing the plans on Wednesday, took pains to emphasise that the \"targeted approach\" for the two sectors does not amount to any \"national minimum wage\", which Singapore is not in favour of. Nor is the government \"setting wages by political decree\", he said, pointing out that the wages are negotiated between the government, unions and employers.\n\nIndeed, more than merely stipulating a minimum salary, the tiered wage model sets out clear rungs for workers to progressively climb the wage ladder as they become more skilled and productive. Linking pay to skills and productivity is essential, particularly as adopting a progressive wage model will become a licensing prerequisite for cleaning firms (and later, security agencies). To be sure, the National Trades Union Congress believes every sector should adopt a progressive wage model - and, indeed, the principle of being paid according to one's level of skill and productivity is sound. But while employers have always been urged to adopt the national wage recommendations, they haven't been mandatory - until now. It is a bold gamble but there is good reason to wield the legislative stick on the cleaning and security sectors, where wages have been persistently low, in the bottom decile. Most of the 70,000 cleaners - including some 55,000 locals - are older workers with little or no education and limited job options. The new licensing rules will hopefully force cleaning and security firms to focus on worker training and operations upgrading, and lead the sectors away from rampant cheap-sourcing. Service buyers may face higher contract costs, but they can also expect better and more reliable service. They should, and should take the cue from the government, which has started awarding cleaning and security services contracts to firms based on quality and performance standards, rather than pricing.\n\nNot least, the higher wages, as well as opportunity to upgrade, will go some way in raising the morale and welfare of cleaners and security guards, who perform essential work but still rank among the lowest-paid. Cleaning firms may even find it easier to hire Singaporeans. Overall, a compulsory tiered wage model for the cleaning sector is the firmest commitment yet to raising standards in low-paid jobs, while at the same time narrowing the income gap.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One dealer summed up the situation as \"you either play with Keppel Corp, DBS or the pennies since there's nothing else really worth playing\", an observation that paints a fairly accurate picture.\n\nAmong the corporate developments of note was OCBC's bid for Hong Kong's Wing Hang bank while property stocks remained weak because the latest housing statistics show prices in most segments are correcting after the slew of curbs over the past few years. Elsewhere, the offshore marine segment came under some pressure because of concerns over rising risks this year though Keppel emerged as the favoured play.\n\nOverseas developments included the release of the minutes of the December Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at which the US central bank announced that it was starting to taper its monetary stimulus; the minutes were greeted with dismay by Wall Street because almost all the governors voted for tapering, suggesting that tapering is likely to accelerate rather than progress slowly.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}

The comedy is forced, although there is some traction to be derived from the fact that it features two well-wrinkled actors whose careers have been defined in part by classic boxing-themed movies. Unfortunately, the mojo is mostly missing this time.\n\nA lifetime ago, Robert De Niro (70) and Sylvester Stallone (67) starred in vastly superior films about boxers: Raging Bull (1980), director Martin Scorsese's seminal biopic about Jake LaMotta, and the original Rocky (1976), the Cinderella-story (for both Stallone and Rocky Balboa, the character he played) that led to a money-churning movie franchise.\n\nRocky versus the Raging Bull played for laughs must have been an appealing one-line movie pitch and a mouth-watering prospect and on the face of it, Grudge Match, directed by Peter Segal and written by Tim Kelleher and Rodney Rothman, is a no-brainer. The latter stages of De Niro's career are littered with comedic roles while Stallone's one-dimensional screen persona is also tailor-made for the part he plays here.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

The aircraft will be on lease,\" spokesman Sanjay Singh said in a statement.\n\nThe demise of Kingfisher Airlines in 2012 marked an end to the bitter competition that led to low ticket prices for Indian consumers and high levels of losses for its airlines.\n\nThe subsequent drop in aircraft capacity gave the airlines some breathing space, allowing them to raise fares and return to profitability. Two years later, despite a slowing economy, international and passenger demand has continued to grow.\n\nThat, and a liberalisation of Indian regulations that now allow foreign airlines to invest in local ventures, mean that two new carriers will begin operations in 2014.\n\nTata SIA Airlines will start flying in the full service segment in the second half of 2014, as will an AirAsia-Tata joint venture in the low-cost market.\n\nIndian tea-to-steel conglomerate Tata holds a 51 per cent stake and Singapore Airlines Ltd 49 per cent in the new venture, announced in September, as they seek to exploit one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets.\n\nThe airline, which will have an initial combined investment of US$100 million from the two stakeholders, marks the third foreign direct investment in the Indian sector since the government declared last year that international airlines could buy as much as 49 per cent of local carriers.\n\n\"The fundamentals of the Indian market should eventually improve, but patience and initial losses may have to be withstood,\" the Centre for Aviation, a consultancy, said in a report in September.\n\nSources said the SIA-Tata joint venture will get up to 20 A320s worth US$1.83 billion at list prices.\n\nThe new airline has begun recruiting pilots and is close to confirming its top executives, including an SIA executive as its chief executive officer.\n\nIt will initially operate out of New Delhi on domestic services and compete with full-service carriers Air India and Jet Airways, which are the only players left in the full-service market after the collapse of Kingfisher.\n\nJet, in which Abu Dhabi-based Etihad has a 24 per cent stake, and Air India are also expected to open tenders to replace some of their older narrowbody and widebody aircraft in the coming year. - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

It also featured some of his least-memorable work, along with a seemingly unending march of the almost-great (the 9-11 elegy The Rising, parts of 2007's Magic), niche releases (We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions) and the inexplicably mediocre (Working on a Dream).\n\nHigh Hopes, Springsteen's 18th studio album, is billed as a collection of newly finished versions of cover songs, live favourites that had not been recorded, redone versions of released tracks and songs that simply didn't fit anywhere else. Many of them were intended for, then left off, the spottiest '00s releases. This was worrisome: How bad did a song have to be to have been rejected for Working on a Dream when Queen of the Supermarket made it on?\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

The capital gains tax honestly doesn't seem to have impacted sentiment or demand for London property,\" said Ms Davies.\n\n\"The capital gains tax is a bit of a disadvantage . . . but (not having to pay tax) was not the main reason investors bought property in London. It was just an added bonus that previously, they didn't have to pay CGT.\"\n\nThe survey, which was conducted over October and November last year, also found that about 33 per cent of the 250 potential buyers surveyed intends to fund their purchase with cash.\n\nThe majority - about 48 per cent - said that they were looking for a unit in the range of \u00a3500,000 (S$1.04 million) to\u00a31 million; about 9 per cent of respondents said that their price point was over \u00a31 million, while 30 per cent said that they were looking for a unit for between \u00a3300,000 and \u00a3500,000.\n\nInterestingly, there has been a surge in younger investors aged 25 to 30, said Ms Davies, with most of them interested in regeneration projects.\n\nOne such regeneration project poised to hit the market is Lend Lease's two-building residential development, Glasshouse Gardens.\n\nLocated at the gateway to the 500-acre Olympic park now renamed the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, the project boasts a range of studios, one-bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom apartments. The units all feature open plan living and kitchen spaces, with the homes ready for the first residents in 2016.\n\nA one-bedroom apartment of about 560 square feet in the West Building costs about \u00a3396,000 while a three-bedroom apartment measuring 1,023 sq ft costs about \u00a3710,000.\n\nThe apartments will showcase the latest in sustainable building practices and innovation, with each apartment constructed with the aim of maximising natural light and fresh air.\n\nThe development forms part of The International Quarter, a joint venture between Lend Lease and London Continental Railways to deliver a \u00a31.3 billion commercial and residential development in Stratford.\n\nGlasshouse Gardens will be launched in Singapore and London this weekend, and launched in Hong Kong the following weekend.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is the occasion when a wine leaves you silent and still, once you've tasted the first mouthful. The wondrous impact of its taste in your sensory cortex and the lingering remnants on your palate leave you desperately finding the right words to quantify and describe its content and nature. At moments such as this I am reminded of that immortal sentence \"Silent, upon a peak in Darien\" from John Keat's On First Looking Into Chapman's Homer.\n\nKeats' poem describes the feelings of the Spanish explorer Cortez, who was looking for the Pacific Ocean while he was exploring in the province of Darien in Panama. He had advanced alone to the summit of the mountain from which he had been assured he would see it. He did, and the sheer sight of the ocean left him speechless in awe.\n\nThere are such wines, not necessarily the same for each of us, which do not need words. Two months ago, at a Chinese dinner, it was a 1988 Faiveley Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru, a 25-year old at its peak. Beautifully balanced, very intense and long from the very first mouthful, its beauty completely unexpected. I sat for a moment speechless and disbelieving. My previous experiences with the wine had left me unprepared for this beautiful maturity. In its youth, this wine had been good but certainly did not show such promise.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

Ms Chan Pui Yee has also resigned from the board of CCM Industrial, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCM Group, and as an employee of the group. Mr Chan Tien Chih will remain an executive director of CCM Industrial.\n\nJoseph Liew, chief executive officer of CCM Group, will be the company's sole executive director. Other board members comprise non-executive and independent directors. \"We will recompose and revamp the board and senior management,\" said Mr Liew.\n\nThe company said it is also in the midst of identifying candidates for its management team, which will be tasked to review the group's existing construction projects with a view to improving cost controls and operational efficiencies, and accelerating project schedules.\n\nThe company also projected higher net losses for FY2013 as compared to the $1.9 million net loss in FY2012. It attributed this to cost overruns due to increases in material prices, sub-contractor engagement fees, foreign worker levies and related overheads.\n\nCCM also announced plans to diversify into property development. It will acquire a wholly-owned subsidiary in Singapore to optimise construction activity, and incorporate a new subsidiary in Australia to develop property in Western Australia.\n\nConcurrently, it plans to acquire a wholly-owned subsidiary, Singapore Construction, from owner Chan Heng Fai, to optimise and enhance its current construction projects.\n\nIt will be led by a new management team and a separate board of directors comprising Mr Liew, Teh Wing Kwan and Mr Chan Heng Fai. The latter, formerly the controlling shareholder of Catalist-quoted SingHaiyi, is a non-executive director and the second-largest shareholder of CCM Group after Mr Liew.\n\nIn addition, CCM Group will incorporate a new unit in Australia via its wholly- owned subsidiary CCM Property by March 31, to explore property development opportunities there.\n\nLast November, it raised up to $41 million from the issue of some 3.42 billion warrants and $5 million worth of exchangeable notes to support diversification efforts in real estate development.\n\nThe warrants, which have attracted huge interest since they started trading on Monday, closed unchanged at 2.3 cents yesterday. The stock closed at 3.9 cents.\n\nBut with an exercise price of 1 cent, these long- dated warrants are in the money. Also, each converted warrant comes with a free \"piggyback\" warrant at an exercise price of 1.1 cents.\n\nBased on yesterday's closing, the warrant has an intrinsic value of 2.9 cents without the piggyback. But with the piggyback warrant, the warrants gain an additional intrinsic value of 2.8 cents, giving it a total imputed intrinsic value of 5.7 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The two associated companies of Tong Eng Group built the development, in the Lavender Street/Jalan Besar locale, in the 1980s.\n\nThe new development, ARC 380, will have 167 strata units comprising 23 retail units on ground level and 144 office units on levels five to 16. Tong Eng will release 71 units for sale - comprising 52 offices and 19 retail units (six shops and 13 food & beverage units).\n\nIt will be retaining the balance units in the development for long-term investment for rental income.\n\nThe development will come up on 49,063 sq ft of land near the upcoming Bendemeer MRT Station on the Downtown Line. The project is being undertaken by Prominent Site Pte Ltd and Prominent Plaza Pte Ltd.\n\nIndicative prices of the retail units will range from $5,500 per square foot to $6,500 psf. Absolute prices will start from around $1.4 million for a 21-sq m (about 226 sq ft) shop unit facing an inner corridor; the priciest, at $4.8 million, is for a 71-sq m (764 sq ft) street-fronting F&B unit.\n\nOffices are likely to be priced at between $2,500 psf and $2,700 psf. In absolute price terms, the office units will cost anywhere from $1.75 million for 65 sq m (700 sq ft) of space on the fifth floor to $2.6 million for a 93-sq m (1,001 sq ft) unit on the eighth floor.\n\nThe office units that will be released for sale are on Levels 5-8 and part of Level 9. The rest of the offices on Levels 9-16 are being retained by Tong Eng.\n\nEminent Plaza currently has tenants operating karaoke lounges on the ground floor, but ARC 380's developers are taking steps to ensure such operators will not have a place in the new development.\n\nThe developers will not allow a range of uses in the premises under a restrictive covenant on titles for the strata retail units: amusement centre, betting outlet, nightclub/karaoke/lounges, hostess bar/hostess pub, massage establishment, money lending, funeral parlour/coffin shop/undertaker, cybercafe and billiards saloon.\n\nThe restrictive covenant is for an initial 20-year period from the project's completion and can be extended by the developers for further terms of 20-year each so long as they own units in the project.\n\nARC 380's sales gallery will open on site for preview this weekend. Sales booking are slated to begin on Jan 17.\n\nARC 380 will have 82 car-park lots on levels 2-3 and part of Level 4, which will also feature a lansdcaped deck with a garden and barbecue pit.

For the financial year ended June 30, 2013, the group posted a 5 per cent rise in net profit to US$46 million, excluding one-off items.\n\nAmong the handful of analysts who cover the stock, CIMB remains upbeat on the group, stating that it had started the 2014 financial year \"in the same fine fashion that it ended Q413, sustaining its fleet utilisation at 91 per cent\".\n\nIn its Oct 31, 2013 report, CIMB said that it expects the stock to be re-rated as efforts at changing Jaya's earnings profile from a lumpy to a recurring one have started to bear fruit.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But so far, less than a fifth of such firms have agreed to raise basic wages during the upcoming annual spring wage offensive or shunto.\n\nAll this is likely to put further pressure on the BOJ to make further monetary accommodations to maintain growth in Japan, given that the room for further fiscal manoeuvres is constrained by the country's highly strained fiscal situation, analysts say.\n\nBOJ policy board member Sayuri Shirai suggested yesterday that the central bank should move quickly to step up its monetary easing if Japan's economy or price trends deviate from their forecast paths.\n\nShe said in a speech, the text of which was released yesterday by the BOJ: \"I believe we should take additional easing measures without hesitation to avoid jeopardising the Bank of Japan's credibility, if it becomes clear that economic and price conditions have sharply diverged downward from our baseline scenario.\"\n\nMs Shirai also noted that the BOJ may delay its deadline for achieving its inflation target if the burden of inflation on consumers and companies becomes \"excessively heavy\".\n\n\"There could be cases where we would judge it appropriate to seek to achieve 2 per cent inflation at a slower pace than the time frame of about two years,\" she added.\n\nThe BOJ had aimed to achieve the desired rate of price increases within about two years, starting from early last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The idea is to simulate the exercise you get from surfing without actually having to go anywhere near the sea.\n\nMelissa Goh, a Pilates instructor who discovered Surfset while researching fitness trends in the United States, says exercising on the RipSurfer X mimics the physical motions associated with surfing. It was invented about two years ago by a professional ice hockey player and off-season surfing nut who realised that surfing was a good way to develop his physique.\n\n\"Once I saw it, I ordered a board and was convinced that it works,\" says Ms Goh, who ran her own fitness studio in Jakarta (www.benefit-pilates.com) before returning here to start Surfset Singapore.\n\nWhile a typical Pilates class is made up of about six people working on a Reformer machine, a Surfset class can accommodate up to 10 people.\n\nMs Goh says she charges between $25 and $35 per person for a session but during the initial stages it's really more about building a brand than profit margins. She's confident that commercial success will come in time - especially since she's a pioneer in indoor surfing, so to speak.\n\n\"It's an exciting new trend, and Singaporeans love trends - plus they are very health conscious,\" she says. \"You get the same kind of workout that you can get in the ocean - it forces your core muscles to work evenly, otherwise you'll fall off.\"\n\nThe first of several planned studios is located in the East Coast \"near the sea\", she says.\n\nA typical session lasts 45 minutes and mimics the actions associated with surfing, such as paddling. Other exercises include Carving (standing on the board and shifting your weight), Pop-Up (pushing up to a standing position from a flat position on the board) and the Duck Dive Push-Up (going under an imaginary wave and pushing to the surface). \"It's like a fun exercise for people with a sense of adventure,\" says Ms Goh.\n\nSurfset classes take place in a group setting and are not recommended for people who are injured, elderly or pregnant, she adds. \"It's quite different from Pilates, which is accessible to almost everyone. The classes are more intense than Pilates and the exercise is more like Spinning (high-energy indoor cycling).\"\n\nYou may end up with a well-toned surfer bod but it won't mean you'll know how to surf for real, of course.\n\n\"You don't learn how to catch a wave - you just use the same muscles and movements,\" says Ms. Goh. \"People won't feel like they're working out - they just have to want to get fit.\"\n\nSurfset Singapore is located at 454B Joo Chiat Road.

Last year, construction demand hit a record $35.8 billion, preliminary estimates showed.\n\nFor the full year, total construction output, or payment for work done, is estimated at about $33 billion. The outlook for on-site construction activities is expected to brighten, to between $34 billion and $36 billion for 2014, and $29 billion to $37 billion annually for 2015 and 2016, owing to the high level of contracts awarded since 2011.\n\n\"On the back of an increased workload, the construction sector's GDP continued one of its longest run of expansion, although at a moderated pace of about 5.5 per cent in 2013. Correspondingly, the construction sector's share of economic GDP sustained at about 4 per cent in 2013 amid improved performance in other major economic sectors,\" said Lo Yen Lee, director (economics research department), business development group, at BCA.\n\nSpeaking at the annual BCA-Redas Built Environment and Property Prospects seminar yesterday, Ms Lo noted that year on year construction GDP growth this year is likely to continue to moderate, as it is coming off a high base.\n\nAccording to advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry earlier this month, the construction industry grew 4.7 per cent year on year in Q4 last year, easing from 5.8 per cent the previous quarter.\n\nThe slowdown was primarily due to the moderation in the growth of private-sector construction activities. The industry contracted at an annualised rate of 6.9 per cent, compared with the 1.7 per cent expansion in the previous quarter.\n\n\"Construction will very likely contribute positively to growth in 2014, although to a lesser extent than 2013,\" said Barclays economist Joey Chew.\n\nWhile the land sales programme has been cut back, there is a large pipeline of infrastructure projects in the wings, on top of existing building activity that will continue into 2014, she noted.\n\nPublic infrastructure works can be expected to support construction demand in view of Singapore's capacity constraints and the Population White Paper 2013, said UOB economist Francis Tan.\n\nAccording to BCA's estimates, the public sector is expected to contribute close to 60 per cent (equivalent to $19 billion to $22 billion) of the industry's total demand in the coming year, compared with $14.8 billion last year.\n\nConstruction demand for institutional projects is expected to see the biggest jump, from $3.6 billion to $7.6 billion. Civil engineering projects will also receive a boost, with construction demand expected to increase to $10.3 billion from $6.8 billion, followed by industrial projects, to $6.3 billion from $5 billion.\n\nThe private sector on the other hand is expected to take a back seat in driving construction demand because of current market volatility, said the BCA.\n\nDemand from the private sector is expected to moderate to between $12 billion and $16 billion from $21 billion last year, as the sector grapples with the government's attempts to stabilise the property market, the substantial supply of completed housing units coming on stream over the next few years, as well as the scaling back of new government land sales for the first half of 2014.\n\nConstruction demand for the private residential segment will likely halve in the coming year, to $5.2 billion from $10 billion. Construction demand on the public residential front is however forecast to dip to $5.5 billion from $6.6 billion last year.\n\nFor 2015 and 2016, average construction demand is projected to be sustained at between $25 billion and $34 billion per annum.\n\nLee Yi Shyan, Senior Minister of State for National Development and Trade & Industry, who was the Guest of Honour at yesterday's event, launched BCA's \"Quality Mark Homes\" mobile application. It helps homeowners search for residential developments that are certified under the BCA Quality Mark Scheme as well as access information on acceptable construction workmanship.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But closer inspection reveals hundreds - if not thousands - of thin strips, running parallel or perpendicular to each other, each individually painted in a shade of black to collectively achieve something akin to computer static.\n\nTaniguchi describes the process of creating them as \"close to literally putting one 'brick' on top of another\". She says: \"I always feel like they are built and not painted; they are construction and not surface. I think of them as forming the walls of a mental house, something that serves as architecture to contain or to hold, and in that sense, to articulate.\"\n\nTaniguchi is a rising star in the increasingly hot Filipino art scene.\n\nWhen Silverlens Gallery was invited to participate in the prestigious Art Basel art fair last year - the first Filipino gallery to make the cut - it chose to devote its booth to Taniguchi's works.\n\nHer geometric abstracts were an instant hit among collectors, partly because they seem a fresh departure from the works of blue-chip contemporary Filipino artists most collectors are familiar with, such as Ronald Ventura, Annie Cabigting, Geraldine Javier and Rodel Tapaya.\n\nTaniguchi says that her country's art scene has alway had a wide mix of \"contrasting, dissimilar and seemingly unrelated but often overlapping formal, ideological, conceptual solutions to the problematics of artmaking\".\n\n\"On a surface level, formally, I wouldn't say my practice is a departure - the Philippines has always had an aesthetic relationship with geometry, and not just in painting. For example, there are sophisticated traditions of textile weaving and basketry that use the geometric language.\"\n\nTaniguchi will show three paintings concurrently at Art Stage and the Silverlens' Singapore branch in Gillman Barracks. They are priced at US$25,800\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ask Lee in person what she thinks about that, and she looks genuinely surprised.\n\nShe says: \"Most of my collectors are Americans and Europeans. I know very few Singaporeans who do.\"\n\nIn fact, for her first solo exhibition here in four years, she's asked her gallerist Sundaram Tagore to keep the works' prices on the more affordable side - despite strong demand from Western collectors - so as to encourage Singapore-based collectors to purchase them.\n\nHer new works, showing concurrently at Art Stage and Sundaram Tagore Gallery in Gillman Barracks, are priced from US$21,760 for a wall painting to US$126,920 for a large installation. Yet even as this writer was interviewing her at the latter space, the gallery phones were ringing frequently as buyers from the West were enquiring about her works' availability.\n\nFor much of her artistic career, Lee, 50, has been trying to do one thing: \"I'm always trying to challenge how people perceive painting.\"\n\nIn the past, she broke all rules by creating paintings without canvases. The paint is piled on thickly enough that it can hang - as if by magic - without a canvas.\n\nIn 2008, she made a splash at the Singapore Biennale with a massive work - again a painting created without canvas - that covered the entire wall of a hall. Its sheer audacity caught the eye of New York gallerist Sundaram Tagore who invited her to exhibit in New York in 2012. The show sold every piece it exhibited and created a following for Lee in the West.\n\nFor her new show at Sundaram Tagore Gallery at Gillman tonight, she's once again taken painting in a unique direction. She's created thick blocks of paint that resemble desserts with their rich colours, texture and consistency. Works hung on the walls look like delectable blocks of creamy yoghurt, while stacks of brown blocks placed on the floor resemble chocolate bars.\n\nReferring to the latter, she says: \"People tend to look at paintings on walls. So in this case, I've stacked the pieces up so you only see the sides of the paintings. Of course, the owner of the painting gets to lift each one and see the details of the pieces, but the idea is that those details can only be viewed by the owner. Everyone else only see the sides of the painting. But the sides, I feel, tell their own story too.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nJane Lee's works are shown at Sundaram Tagore Gallery starting today. Admission is free. They will also be shown at Art Stage's SEA platform at Marina Bay Sands from Jan 16-19. Tickets from Sistic or at the door\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a cloud-based application that can process enormous amounts of information, the so-called big data.\n\nThe Watson system, described by many as artificial intelligence, became famous by defeating two world champions in the popular quiz show Jeopardy. It has the ability to answer questions asked in human language and can self-learn from past mistakes.\n\nDBS CEO Piyush Gupta noted that the bank has set aside $15 million over the next three years for developing the system within the bank. However, DBS has no plans to immediately start using Watson to assist its relationship managers.\n\nOver the next several months, the bank will work with IBM to \"teach\" Watson what to look for when analysing the data that would be fed to it. Noting that the initial results are encouraging, Mr Gupta said: \"By the end of the year, we would be able to roll out (the service) to our relationship managers.\"\n\nWealth management is one of the three key thrust areas for the bank. The others are SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) and payments. The bank is focused on \"relentlessly\" digitising its systems, understanding the changing methods of customer interaction with the bank and in using vast amounts of data to understand its customers in order to provide better service.\n\nWith Asia creating wealth faster than anywhere else in the world, coupled with increasingly sophisticated and digital savvy customers, banking relationship managers need to be empowered with sophisticated and intuitive tools that enable them to respond more speedily with insightful and tailored solutions, Mr Gupta said.\n\n\"IBM Watson will help DBS's relationship managers analyse large volumes of complex unstructured and structured data, including research reports, product information and customer profiles; identify connections between customers' needs and its growing corpus of investment knowledge, and help advisers weigh various financial options available to customers.\"\n\nHe added that even though Watson is a cloud-based application, adequate safeguards exist to ensure that all confidential client data remained behind DBS's firewalls.\n\n\"It (Watson) will put us ahead of the curve as it represents a significant shift in the ability for organisations to quickly analyse, understand and respond to vast amounts of big data,\" Mr Gupta said.\n\nThe bank has already been using big data analytics. For example, it has been able to streamline the filling up of its islandwide network of ATMs by analysing the traffic at each machine, thus saving considerable amount of time and money.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice-president of IBM global business services, noted that the business agenda of every industry is being transformed by data and the technologies to exploit it.\n\n\"The partnership with DBS is allowing them to anticipate and respond to market shifts, and transform the relationship between the bank and its customers using the cognitive computing power of IBM's Watson and deep analytics combined with business consulting.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The official added that apartments in big cities with area of less than 70 square metres and sold at less than 15 million Vietnamese dong per square metre are strongly consumed and there is hardly inventory for these products.\n\nThis presents that correct measures implemented have brought about positive signals to Vietnamese real estate market in 2013, said Mr Dung.\n\nVietnam's real estate market was frozen in the past. This was due to higher housing prices than average income of the majority of local people and high interest rates.\n\nStatistics from the ministry showed that as of late December 2013, total nationwide inventory in real estate sector stood at 94. 45 trillion Vietnamese dong, down 26.5 per cent over the first quarter of 2013. - Xinhua\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

At first, he had no interest in Japanese culture and half-ignored what he saw. \"But after several visits over the years,\" he says, \"something of the place took root in the very kernel of my being, and I've since developed an incredible attraction to it.\"\n\nThis is particularly true of its graphic traditions - indeed, the whole visual experience of Japan. Quinteros lapped up its broad spectrum of cultures and subcultures, from manga and cosplay to visual-kei (a metal music sub-genre), cyberpunk and kabuki theatre - all of which appear in varying degrees in his paintings.\n\nHe says: \"The Japanese don't have a suspicion towards the surface of things. They live comfortably within the reality of appearances, and have a very advanced engagement with fiction.\n\n\"These widely sustained interactions with surface realities made a wonderful impression on me, and each engagement with Japanese culture became a store of lessons for my own understanding of art.\"\n\nOne of his best works, Prelude To Mercurius (oil on canvas, 2013, 120cm by 80cm), exists in a strange intersection between kabuki, glam rock and surrealism.\n\nKabuki theatre has a tradition of onnagata, where certain male actors dress up as women and play heroines. Similarly, in glam rock, singers - think David Bowie in the past - take on flamboyant, androgynous looks in defiance of strict gender roles.\n\nQuinteros fuses these two theatrical genres with a dose of surrealist wit, resulting in a painting that fascinates and repels.\n\nHe says: \"I've had potential buyers shy away from imagery that may have been somewhat scary or grotesque, but I consider it all part of the lot of making work that is not only decorative, or comes out of some specific sensibilities.\n\n\"Still, it doesn't trouble me that some shy away from them because I believe there is always a certain enthused audience for this kind of work, and I plot my antecedents consistently along in history.\"\n\nAlthough only 21 years old, the recent graduate of Sydney College of the Arts displays assured technique and a limitless capacity for association. The heavy make-up and costumes that the characters in his paintings wear also reflect his love of the stage. He says: \"There are so many things I like to watch that take their place on various stages - from musical performance to kabuki theatre, and my favourite of all musical dramatic works, Richard Wagner's Der Ring Des Nibelungen cycle of operas.\n\n\"I believe in the stage as the place to play out our life's meaning. It is the site of our spiritual catharsis. It's embedded in my thinking to visualise art in terms of a kind of stage, elevated from and drawing out the essences from life.\"\n\nQuinteros' works will be shown at the Australian platform of Art Stage\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Chng is executive director of property services at the group.\n\nSet up in 1960 by the late Ng Teng Fong, Far East has completed some 730 developments in Singapore, spanning the residential, office, retail, industrial, serviced apartment and hotel space. Singapore's biggest privately-held property developer, the group has been stepping up overseas investments in the face of property cooling measures at home.\n\nAmong various things, Mr Boey will manage the development of the property giant's foreign projects. It owns a 1.5 million square foot land parcel in Melbourne's St Helena-Greensborough district, which is planned for development into an integrated residential community.\n\nLast year, it bought The Clocktower Square complex in Sydney - a mixed- use asset with retail, office and hotel components - for A$72 million (S$82 million). It also clinched the Harbour Town Centre in Perth, an outlet shopping mall, for A$205 million. The group will continue operating the two assets. However, if they are redeveloped in the future, Mr Boey is expected to oversee these projects.\n\nIn Kuala Lumpur, the group's Singapore-listed vehicle Far East Orchard is redeveloping the former Plaza Atrium into a serviced residence.\n\nIn addition, Mr Boey will evaluate further overseas investment opportunities for the group.\n\nMr Boey, who is in his 40s, has close to two decades' experience in planning and policy work at URA and its parent, the Ministry of National Development (MND). He was group director of land sales and administration at URA, where he was responsible for strategising and implementing MND's Government Land Sales Programme. He also oversaw the property research and Controller of Housing functions at URA, collaborating with other government agencies in formulating key policies affecting Singapore's property market. He holds a master's degree in regional planning from Cornell University and an MA in geography from the National University of Singapore.\n\nMr Boey's arrival at Far East marks the latest senior management appointment in the group. Last October, it promoted Shaw Lay See to chief operating officer of property sales. She reports to Augustine Tan, executive director of property sales. Mr Tan joined the property giant last March.\n\nChia Boon Kuah, currently COO and executive director of property sales, will be leaving Far East on Feb 2. He will be moving to GuocoLand as group president and CEO on Feb 3, replacing Quek Chee Hoon, who is retiring.\n\nLast November, Mavis Seow was promoted to COO of retail business group at Far East.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The average price in December was \u00a3173,467 (S$362,029).\n\n\"Mounting signs that the economic recovery is becoming firmly established, together with a predicted decline in unemployment, should further boost consumer confidence,\" said Martin Ellis, a housing economist at Halifax. \"This will increase the likelihood that more people will consider buying a property in 2014, therefore supporting housing demand.\"\n\nMortgage approvals are at an almost six-year high amid a property-market revival in part fuelled by government incentives. The surge in housing activity has prompted the Bank of England to end incentives for home loans under its credit-boosting programme and officials have said that they are monitoring risks.\n\nNationwide Building Society said on Friday that values increased 1.4 per cent in December, taking their gain last year to 8.4 per cent, the biggest annual increase since 2006. As well as the economy and the government's Help-to-Buy programme, Nationwide said that \"ultra-low\" borrowing costs were fuelling demand for property.\n\nThe BOE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has pledged to keep its key interest rate at a record-low 0.5 per cent until unemployment, now at 7.4 per cent, falls to 7 per cent. The MPC will leave the rate unchanged when it announces its next policy decision today at noon in London, according to a Bloomberg News survey. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Lower secondary students at their last talk, for instance, learnt about the Hollywood system through its star-making and franchise models.\n\n\"The Ministry of Education has been trying to place more emphasis on the arts and a more well-rounded education for students in recent years; we hope (to) give schools the opportunity to explore Film Education as an accessible and exciting way to get students to engage with the Arts and learn something different from what they might normally do,\" says Mr Tan.\n\n\"The Filmic Eye also champions the use of film in the classroom by exploring innovative ways to integrate Film Education into subjects such as English, Chinese, the Humanities and even Civics & Character education.\"\n\nThe courses can last anything from a day to eight weeks and the curriculum is developed in-house. While the core target market is made up of teenagers at secondary and junior college level, Mr Tan says that they are not limiting themselves to that demographic.\n\nThey are also eyeing \"the public and working professionals who see cinema as a potentially liberating, informative and insightful medium to explore either leisurely or relevant to their personal, cultural or organisational growth\".\n\nResponse so far has been \"excellent\" even though the initiative is only a couple of months old.\n\n\"The Filmic Eye aims to provide (participants) with the tools and knowledge to see movies as more than just entertainment,\" Mr Tan says. \"Films can be an art form and are cultural artifacts; they offer excellent opportunities for critical thinking . . . even the ubiquitous Hollywood blockbuster can be seen through different 'eyes' (so) we hope to sow the seeds for a new generation of cinema-lovers who are not only sensitive and critical consumers of visual media, but also contribute to the Singapore cinema landscape in various ways.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On the other hand, the Singapore facility is 100 per cent owned and operated, which gives it maximum flexibility and makes it an ideal site to develop and commercialise breakthrough technologies, Mr Pryor told ICIS Chemical Business.\n\nAs such, EM's plan to invest in more plants here to produce halobutyl rubber and tackifying resins \"can provide a support for earnings even where there is a downturn in the commodity business\", he said in the ICIS handout.\n\nApart from being its largest manufacturing project, its new Singapore petrochemical complex is also its most technologically advanced, and incorporates over 40 new proprietary technologies, added Mr Pryor. Its cracker is the first in the world to be able to use crude oil as a feedstock, thus lowering feedstock costs. This also saves energy and reduces emissions by eliminating the refining steps needed to produce naphtha feedstock.\n\nAnd, just as it had relocated a part of the original Jurong Island Highway to make way for the new EM expansion, PM Lee assured yesterday continued government support for Singapore's energy and chemicals industry, which he said is \"one with a bright future\". This is despite looming challenges like global competition from rival hubs in the US, China and Europe, increasing global concern over carbon emissions, and domestic constraints of foreign labour and land here.\n\nSingapore, he said, will continue to upgrade Jurong Island, like for example, building an LPG terminal to import another alternative feedstock for the petrochemical crackers here. Vopak just last month announced it will spearhead this project, with EM signed on as its first anchor tenant.\n\nSupport will also come from the Republic upgrading the \"software\" here, like growing a skilled workforce, and also working closely with the industry to be more environment-friendly, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China investors were particularly active, nearly tripling their investment year-on-year to $2.9 billion.\n\nAmong the notable deals involving China players last year were Bright Ruby Resources' purchase of Grand Park Orchard for $1.2 billion, Kingsford Development winning two adjacent private residential sites at Upper Serangoon View, and Qingjian Realty (South Pacific) Group winning two executive condominium sites at Woodlands Avenue 5/Avenue 6 and Anchorvale Crescent.\n\nDTZ noted that Japanese developers had also contributed to the increase in foreign investments in 2013, with prominent deals such as when Japan-based Daisho Group bought The Westin Singapore hotel for $468 million.\n\nThat said, the bulk of investments continued to be driven by domestic investors, with total investment activity for the whole of 2013 at $28.5 billion, 0.7 per cent lower than the $28.7 billion in the previous year, DTZ said.\n\nA separate CBRE report released yesterday put total investment sales for 2013 at $29.72 billion, 3.7 per cent down year-on-year.\n\nFor the first year since 2009, DTZ said residential properties did not make up the largest share of investment sales last year, having been overtaken by mixed- use developments.\n\nIntegrated projects saw more than twice the investment from the previous year at $6.9 billion, or 24.3 per cent of market share. Major integrated properties transacted include The Paragon and PoMo.\n\nComparatively, residential developments declined 37 per cent from 2012 to $6.4 billion, or 22.5 per cent of total market share.\n\nAs for office investments, they slid for the third straight year, accounting for 17.5 per cent, or $5 billion, of investment activity in 2013.\n\nJeremy Lake, executive director for investment properties at CBRE, said the investment market has been energised by three big deals done at the end of last year and the start of 2014 - the sale of 111 Somerset, The Westin Singapore and Westgate. Also helping is a positive outlook for office rents.\n\n\"Investors are back to work after the holidays and are keen to look at deals again and we expect to see more activity in Q1 2014 particularly office deals,\" he said.\n\nLee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ, expects more office investments this year with rentals set to rise in 2014 and an improving economic sentiment.\n\nHowever, Swee Shou Fern, director of investment services advisory at DTZ, cautioned that transactions would be \"limited by the amount of stock available for sale and a gap in pricing expectations between sellers and buyers\".\n\nOverall activity is likely to be weaker on the year, DTZ said.\n\nMs Lee said deals could take longer to close as investors seek higher returns in light of the tapering of bond purchases by the US Federal Reserve, or investors could divert funds to other countries where they can get a higher return.\n\n\"Residential developments are also likely to fall further given that collective sales continue to be difficult and there are fewer residential sites on the H1 2014 GLS (Government Land Sales) programme.\"\n\nThere were no collective sales in the last quarter of 2013, CBRE's report noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At US$750 a square foot, it's San Francisco's most expensive deal for a stabilised office property in the past year, the person said. The tower at Second and Mission streets, completed in 2000, is 90 per cent leased.\n\n\"It was a very competitive process but an asset we think makes a lot of sense to own long-term as this location and quality is rarely found in San Francisco,\" Greg Kraus, a managing director at Atlanta-based Invesco, said in an e-mail. He declined to comment on the price.\n\nThe transaction with seller Hines, based in Houston, is scheduled for completion tomorrow, Mr Kraus said. The deal's capitalisation rate is 3 per cent, the lowest of 2013 in San Francisco, said the person familiar with the deal. A cap rate is derived by dividing a property's net operating income by its purchase price, so it moves down as values rise.\n\nJames Buie, chief executive officer for the western US region at Hines, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nSan Francisco ranked third, behind London and New York, among the most-favoured global office markets for overseas buyers, according to a survey by the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate.

It rebuilt the main Jurong Island Highway to enable US energy giant ExxonMobil to site its second multibillion-dollar petrochemicals complex - codenamed Singapore Parallel Train - alongside its first complex to boost operational efficiency. It also facilitated passage to and special housing on the petrochemicals island for the thousands of workers - there were more than 22,000 construction workers at the peak - needed to build the project.\n\nThat expansion has increased ExxonMobil's chemical plant workforce by 50 per cent, bringing total employment at its integrated manufacturing site here to 2,000.\n\nThis solid backing - which Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday said Singapore will provide to energy and petrochemical investors here - will help the industry ride out coming storms. With energy and chemicals contributing one-third of manufacturing output, Mr Lee stressed that it was not a sunset industry, but rather \"one with a bright future\", especially with fast-growing Asian economies fuelling demand.\n\nPartnerships, such as that provided to Singapore by ExxonMobil (including that by its rivals such as Shell, BASF, Sumitomo Chemicals and others), have helped. As an Economic Development Board official earlier noted: \"We have consciously grown the industry by anchoring the market leaders here.\"\n\nOptimal base\n\nIt is reassuring that ExxonMobil's top brass have made statements outlining how the group has grown its Singapore refining/\n\npetrochemicals site into its largest manufacturing site worldwide. The Singapore complex now accounts for one-quarter of its global chemicals capacity. This puts its Singapore facility in a good position - or optimal base, as ExxonMobil chemicals president Steve Pryor puts it - to supply demand in Asia and Asia Pacific. Singapore, rather than its main China market (where ExxonMobil also has a stake in a joint-venture plant), will be the focus of its future plant investments, the officials said.\n\nThere will certainly be coming competition from new cost-advantaged, shale gas-fuelled petrochemical plants being built (including by players already here, such as Shell and ExxonMobil) in the United States and Canada. But Mr Pryor noted that while shale gas was a game changer that provided a source of advantaged feedstock such as ethane, naphtha and LPG, \"access to shale will not be enough on its own to sustain long-term success for chemical producers\". This, especially when today's advantaged feedstock, such as shale, becomes commonplace or more costly in future.\n\nThat is why ExxonMobil is injecting \"competitiveness\" or new technologies into its non-shale gas sites such as Singapore. It has notched a world-first in a petrochemicals cracker that can run on crude oil without first needing to refine the crude into naphtha - which is largely what fuels most Asian crackers today. While no details are available as to how much crude oil accounts for the new Singapore cracker's total feedstock, this has helped it to lower feedstock costs and enables it to save energy and reduce carbon emissions by cutting out the refining steps to produce naphtha.\n\nOther challenges\n\nIn the same vein, Royal Vopak is building an LPG terminal - which Singapore has been promoting under its JI version 2.0 plan to upgrade Jurong Island - to bring in alternative feedstocks for the industry here.\n\nMr Lee cited other challenges for the industry here, such as the slowdown in the inflow of foreign workers as well as more expensive and scarce land. While he did not offer immediate solutions, the fact that he made mention of them suggests that Singapore will work towards some solutions.\n\nThe bottom line was his assurance that Singapore will make it worthwhile for industry players to operate here despite such natural constraints, whether scarce land or access to feedstock, and to maintain a predictable environment for their investments to succeed over the long term.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Service buyers procuring from non-licensed cleaning firms will also face punishments.\n\nBut Mr Tharman stressed that the move to legislate the PWM was a targeted approach to raise the pay of cleaners and security guards and not a national minimum wage.\n\nThe pay will be fixed through tripartite negotiations, with entry-level wages of cleaners likely to be $1,000 or 20 per cent higher than their current basic pay. There are about 55,000 cleaners in the resident workforce earning a median gross wage of around $850 monthly.\n\n\"We are not setting wages by political decree,\" Mr Tharman said. \"What legislation will do is ensure that the PWM that the tripartite partners work out is actually implemented in these industries.\"\n\nHe noted that high minimum wages in many European countries \"have been accompanied by high unemployment, with the most severe impact falling on people with the lowest skills\".\n\nIn the United States, a high minimum wage has done little to improve opportunities for the poor, or to reduce social inequalities.\n\nMilton Ng, a director and head of Ramky Cleantech Services, said that legislation of the PWM would force the industry to look for new ways to improve productivity and overcome the shortage of workers. The higher pay that comes with PWM will also draw workers from other industries into cleaning, which is seen as \"not sexy\".\n\nAlvin Lee, managing director of Reachfield Security, said that legislation will help to encourage training and attract better quality people into the industry. \"There will be adjustments from all of us, but in the long term everything will fall in place,\" he said.\n\nWhile costs are likely to rise at first, Mr Lee is hopeful that his industry will end up saving money from higher productivity.\n\nMr Tharman said in his speech that the PWM offers a pathway to higher pay based on experience, skills upgrading, responsibilities and productivity improvements. \"This pathway, or 'wage-skill ladder', is a defining feature of the PWM,\" he said. \"To the cleaner, the PWM wage-skill ladder provides assurance of better wages and career progression.\"\n\nCleaning companies can also better retain workers and build up a more skilled labour force, according to him. Services buyers and consumers will enjoy better service.\n\nMr Tharman blamed cheap sourcing for the stagnant pay of cleaners and the \"too-low\" basic pay of the 70,000 security officers - even though their gross pay has gone up.\n\nLabour movement chief Lim Swee Say, who also spoke at yesterday's symposium, said that \"head count\" and \"fixed price\" contracts were also culprits.\n\nIn his speech, he said that workers and bosses are not \"charging at 100 per cent\" to push for higher productivity. Workers wonder if higher productivity will lead to higher wages, and bosses are unsure that higher wages will result in higher productivity. Mr Lim said that adopting the PWM should help to remove these doubts and encourage an all-out push to raise productivity, because wages, skills, productivity and jobs - PWM's four pillars - will then move in tandem.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But some of the issues raised in the Oct 4 selloff are also part of the current review.\n\nRichard Teng, the newly appointed chief regulatory officer at SGX, told The Business Times: \"As announced by MAS (the Monetary Authority of Singapore), MAS and SGX are conducting a thorough review of market structure and practices. The review is ongoing and we will consult the market on any proposed changes in due course. We seek your understanding that we are unable to share further details at this stage.\"\n\nAn MAS spokesman reiterated this message.\n\nOne of the proposals expected to be put up for consultation is the creation of an independent listing committee whose approval will be required for certain listings.\n\nSGX currently has an internal listing committee. Its regional rival, the Hong Kong bourse, is already using an external committee to approve initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nThe idea of a listing committee drew generally positive responses from independent observers.\n\n\"Excellent idea, and the structure in Hong Kong would be a good model to start from,\" said corporate governance advocate Mak Yuen Teen, associate professor at the National University of Singapore. \"To ensure balanced views and independence, it is important for different stakeholders to be reflected in the composition and that the appointment of members and reporting of the committee can ensure independence.\"\n\nWong Partnership joint managing partner Rachel Eng thought that the inclusion of industry viewpoints would allow more robust assessments of listing aspirants.\n\n\"I think it's an interesting proposition,\" she said. \"Having representation from various quarters gives a balanced perspective to the listing process.\"\n\nMs Eng thought that potential conflicts of interest were manageable, borrowing from existing mechanisms in panels like the Securities Industry Council and through strong selection processes.\n\n\"There are ways to handle conflicts,\" she said.\n\nStamford Law director Ng Joo Khin said practicality will have to be considered.\n\n\"Another concern would be timing,\" he said. \"Is this going to make the review process shorter or longer? It can be a challenge to find mutually agreeable time slots among busy executives to meet together and to get up to speed on matters at short notice.\"\n\nThe consultation is also expected to seek feedback on a number of changes to the listing and continuing listing framework, exploring issues such as minimum share price requirements.\n\nAn over-the-counter outlet, similar to the Pink Sheets in the United States, for companies that fail to meet the higher standards has been explored, sources said.\n\n\"I think it's worth considering but the devil is in the details,\" Mr Ng said.\n\n\"Pink sheets trading provides an alternative platform to companies which are unable to meet the continued requirements for continued listing on a stock exchange. On the other hand, let's hope that the bar for continued listing will not be raised too high just because there is such an alternative.\"\n\nSGX has also been exploring the issue of allowing dual-class shares. Ms Eng said close attention will have to be paid to whether the existing regulatory structure and controls provide adequate protection to minority investors.\n\n\"We will need some governance mechanisms in place and perhaps strengthen shareholder protection rules if we are going with this structure,\" she said.\n\nMr Ng felt that allowing dual-class shares was consistent with a caveat emptor philosophy, but stressed the importance of educating investors before lifting the gates.\n\n\"We should not be overprotective of minority shareholders,\" he said. \"Ensuring that the general public is sufficiently educated is important. The exchange can perhaps look at more public talks and discussions on the concept of dual-class shares and the implications of investing in companies with such capital structures.\"\n\nThe proposals are also expected to look into the possibility of strengthening the sanctioning powers of SGX, including the way companies are queried on unusual trading activity in their shares.\n\nThat query system needs a relook, Prof Mak said.\n\n\"The current system of querying and the rather meaningless response by companies does not achieve much in terms of improving market transparency,\" he said.\n\n\"This can be linked to giving more investigatory powers to SGX. At the moment, SGX queries a company, a company often says they know of nothing, and shortly after, some important transaction emerges. But currently, SGX is powerless to determine if the original response by the company was truthful.\"\n\nOverall, Ms Eng said it was always good to review existing regulations.\n\n\"I think rules should continually be reviewed,\" she said. \"The times are changing.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Findings of the survey conducted by the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC) - tasked with transforming the accountancy arena - will be used to design policies and programmes to benefit the sector's various stakeholders.\n\nThe survey was carried out between July 1 and Aug 16 last year, and received more than 3,500 individual responses from professional accountants in public practice (21 per cent), those in business (34 per cent) and from students in accountancy or related courses (45 per cent).\n\nThe mean monthly income among the professional accountants who responded was $7,587, or 2.5 times the national mean of $3,000 in 2012. About 5 per cent earned less than $24,000 annually and around one per cent earned $500,000 and above.\n\nThe respondents believed that pay in the accountancy sector was, in general, not commensurate with their job responsibilities. They also felt there was a lack of work-life balance and career progression. To improve the lot of accountants, they saw a need to give more recognition in the form of incentives or salary increments, a better work-life balance including having flexible working hours, and more on-the-job training.\n\nAnother area of concern was how productivity in the sector could be improved.\n\nAccountants working in companies said there should be provision of external structured training courses, continuity of staff and adoption of better technology. Those in public practice suggested having the availability of technical support from within and outside the organisation, and the provision of external structured training courses.\n\nAs for the students, many said they were intending to pursue a career in traditional areas, such as financial accounting (71 per cent) and external audit (46 per cent). Some want to pursue careers in new growth areas, such as internal audit (34 per cent), risk management (16 per cent) and valuation (9 per cent).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is a free-for-all,\" the local environmental activist said as chainsaws growled.\n\nPerched more than 1,000 metres high on Malaysia's central spine, the Cameron Highlands emerged as the country's first tourist destination during early 20th century British rule.\n\nKnown by some as a \"Little England\", it was beloved by homesick colonials who presided over afternoon tea or a few gin and tonics amid its cool air, lush gardens, and arresting tea-plantation vistas.\n\nColonial architecture still graces a region that is Malaysia's main domestic source of temperate-zone crops such as strawberries and apples and a habitat for flora and fauna including the severely endangered Malayan Tiger.\n\nBut rampant farm, condo and hotel development is shattering the area's legendary repose, raising growing concern for its ecological balance, tourist appeal, and even safety as landslide and flood fears grow.\n\n\"The pain inflicted on Mother Nature is terrible. We are losing the highlands,\" said Mr Ramakrishnan, popping peanuts into his mouth as he drove past felled trees and garbage-strewn streams that run brown with silt from erosion.\n\nVoicing a common local refrain, he blames \"greedy and corrupt\" officials and farm interests for flouting land laws in the mountainous region of Pahang state, which is governed by Malaysia's graft-plagued ruling coalition.\n\nIn the 1920s, British growers began establishing the picturesque tea plantations that hug the undulating terrain like a green quilt.\n\nThe area gained a measure of mystique with the unsolved 1967 disappearance of American businessman Jim Thompson.\n\nCredited with reviving Thailand's silk industry - his eponymous apparel brand still bears his name - Mr Thompson vanished during a Cameron stroll, sparking rumours of intrigue due to his documented US intelligence links.\n\nToday's problems are a microcosm of a greater national failure to balance development with Malaysia's rich natural environment.\n\nData published in the US journal Science in November showed Malaysia lost 14.4 per cent of its forests from 2000-2012, the world's highest rate.\n\nCritics largely blame the politically-connected timber and oil-palm industries.\n\nThe data indicated the Cameron Highlands was a deforestation hotspot.\n\n\"There is total disregard for laws,\" said Gurmit Singh of the sustainability advocate Centre for Environment, Technology and Development, Malaysia. \"We are killing our land and our forests.\"\n\nTop Malaysian officials joined a chorus of concern over the Cameron Highlands in October after three people were killed and dozens of homes and vehicles damaged or destroyed when authorities released water from a dam straining amid a severe flashflood.\n\nIllegal land-clearing is widely blamed for exacerbating the flood and the heavy silting behind the dam that has raised questions over its integrity.\n\nAhmad Daud, the state government's district land officer, acknowledged the rampant illegal land-clearing, but denied the allegations of official corruption.\n\n\"We have to be realistic.

Whether in the future, we want to raise renminbi fund for investment in China itself. That means I will start to take third-party money, external money, rather than using the bank's capital.\"\n\nThe fund will invest in later-stage private companies with a view to exit in three to five years. The fund focuses on the agriculture, oil and gas, resources, consumer, manufacturing and real estate sectors.\n\nChinese private equity can be potentially lucrative. Mr Than said that a 2008 onshore investment in Shindoo Chemical Industry Co, which listed in Shenzhen in 2011, returned about three times OCBC's initial investment of about $10 million.\n\nBut the restrictions and red tape surrounding the investments can be daunting. Onshore investments like the Shindoo deal can take months, a waiting period that some target businesses are unwilling to suffer. But the more popular offshore investment structure prevents the target from listing in China.\n\nThe QFLP programme offers some respite, allowing the fund to obtain block-approval for converting a specified amount of foreign currency into renminbi for onshore investments. That speeds up the investment process, removes the target's need for remittance approvals and keeps the option of a China listing open.\n\nThe fund has a licence to operate for 10 years, and Mr Than expects to invest about two deals of between US$5 million and US$10 million each per year.\n\nMr Than reckons the fund gives a competitive headstart to OCBC, which says it is the first South-east Asian bank to have such a fund in Shanghai. It took OCBC about one-and-a-half years to get from applying for approval for the QFLP programme in mid-2012 to finally launching a fund.\n\n\"When the QFLP programme was launched, we actually looked at it very carefully and decided that since we are long-term investors in China, we have done onshore investments and it has given us good returns, and the universe is attractive enough to allow us to invest into an infrastructure that allows us to do that effectively,\" Mr Than said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The pricing structure is identical to its WhatsApp prepaid plan - 50 cents for a day, $3 for seven days and $6 for 30 days. The plans cover Facebook data usage of up to one gigabyte (GB) a day.\n\n\"Many of our customers are avid Facebook users who frequently access the site via their smartphones and tablets. The plan we launched today enables our prepaid customers to get their Facebook fix without worrying about incurring additional data charges,\" said Johan Buse, SingTel's vice-president of consumer marketing.\n\nNow, there is a chance that rival StarHub might follow suit. Its head of personal solutions, Chan Kin Hung, said yesterday that Facebook is among the major social messaging players that it is in talks with, in a bid to expand its own prepaid offerings.\n\nM1, responding to BT's query, noted that its own prepaid plans, priced from $7 for 1 GB of data, give its customers access to instant messaging apps, social media networks and web surfing, among other things.\n\nBoth StarHub and M1 also went down the app partnership path last year, with the former teaming up with WeChat and the latter doing a deal with music streaming service Deezer.\n\n\"(The) take-up rate of StarHub's WeChat plan is healthy and tracks well with our expectations,\" said StarHub's Mr Chan.\n\nThe Facebook deal, designed to help SingTel increase data monetisation, comes on the back of a series of other tie-ups for the telco. Its WhatsApp partnership, for example, was launched last August and continues to be exclusive, a SingTel spokesman told BT. He declined to reveal when this exclusivity would expire.\n\nAs at the quarter ended Sept 30 last year, SingTel had about 1.77 million prepaid mobile subscribers, which accounted for about 45 per cent of its local mobile customer base.\n\nFrom April to September last year, its prepaid segment's average monthly revenue per user (ARPU) held up at $16, an increase from $15 in the corresponding period a year ago. Over the same period, postpaid ARPU dipped to $78 from $80 the previous year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The property reaches almost 753 feet (230m), making it the tallest hotel without accompanying offices or residential space in the US, said Kathleen Duffy, a spokeswoman for Marriott's hotels in New York City. The two-tower Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, a mixed-use development with a Mandarin Oriental hotel, is 750 feet.\n\n\"I'm certain either one of them would have done fine on their own,\" Marriott chief executive officer Arne Sorenson said on Tuesday at the opening of the two hotels. \"But here, you've got a great location, an A-plus location, with two distinct products that will appeal to two distinct kinds of stays.\"\n\nMarriott is opening the property as hotel demand in the city soars. New York had a record 54.3 million tourists last year, former mayor Michael Bloomberg said on Dec 10. The city is likely to have 55 million visitors in 2014, said Mr Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP.\n\nMarriott has about 100 hotels across the US that offer as many as three Marriott brands within one property, and the company is looking for more opportunities to pursue such projects, Mr Sorenson said.\n\nThe New York hotel property, which began serving travellers on Dec 29 and had its official opening on Tuesday, cost US$320 million to build. It is operated under a franchise agreement between Marriott and builder Granite Broadway Development LLC, the property's owner, and is managed by Arlington, Virginia-based Interstate Hotels & Resorts Inc.\n\nGranite bought the land in 2001 for US$32 million, when it had three \"non-distinct buildings\" with a restaurant, a pornography shop and a clothing store, CEO Harry Gross said at Tuesday's event. New York-based Granite took several years to decide to build a hotel, after also considering a mixed-use project with a hotel at the bottom and residential condominiums in upper floors.\n\n\"But at the time, the condominium market went to pieces,\" Mr Gross said. \"So therefore, seeing that, two hotels would make sense, especially if they catered to two different segments.\"\n\nHotel occupancies of 85 per cent and average room rates of US$254.32 last year till November in New York were the highest among the top 25 US markets, according to data from Hendersonville, Tennessee-based STR. Occupancies were at a 13-year high in the city, according to the research company.\n\nOccupancies at New York City hotels probably will decline slightly in the next two years as more hotels open, increasing competition, STR said. About 12,000 rooms will be added in 2014, bringing the city's total to about 120,000 and causing occupancies to drop to 83 per cent this year, the firm said.\n\nDemand from events such as the National Football League's Super Bowl on Feb 2 and an influx of business and leisure travellers throughout the year will help fill rooms, Ms Duffy said.\n\n\"There is plenty of demand in this city for all of us,\" she added.\n\nMarriott's other properties in New York include an Edition hotel, part of a luxury boutique brand that it has been developing with hotelier Ian Schrager. The company in August announced the planned sale of the Manhattan development at Madison Square Park, expected to open in the first half of 2015, as well as an agreement to sell an Edition project in Miami Beach and a London location that opened in September. The company said on Tuesday that it sold the London Edition, and the total purchase price for all three properties is expected to be about US$815 million.\n\nThe Marriott property that opened on Tuesday will have a shared entrance and lobby on 54th Street for both its hotels. Courtyard rooms are on floors six to 33, and Residence Inn rooms are the 37th to 65th stories, with public areas on the levels in between the two hotels. The Courtyard hotel will target leisure and business travellers, while the Residence Inn rooms are geared towards longer-term customers, Ms Duffy said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Wong Partnership was in second place, with 18 deals, followed by Stamford Law with 15.\n\nA&G was however overtaken by Davis Polk and Wardwell in terms of deal size. The latter advised three deals with a combined value of US$8.4 billion. A&G came in second with US$8 billion of deals advised, followed by Linklaters with US$7.8 billion.\n\nIn terms of financial advisers, Goldman Sachs led the pack with US$7.5 billion of deals in 2013.

Macquarie's eight deals took the second spot, followed by KPMG's seven deals.\n\nOverall, Singapore's completed M&A volume more than halved to US$14.2 billion in 2013 from US$31.5 billion in 2012, largely due to the absence of 2012's mega deals related to the takeover of Fraser and Neave. Total deal count fell 8.1 per cent to 114.\n\nAndrew Lim, co-head of corporate M&A at A&G, attributed his firm's record to \"a high level of technical expertise and depth of bench\", not just in terms of the lawyers in the M&A field, but also in terms of A&G's expertise across different practice areas.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Lim expects the M&A market in Singapore to grow slowly in 2014 and cross-border transactions to continue to dominate.\n\n\"Many deals of significance in Singapore are never solely Singapore deals,\" Mr Lim said. \"They always involve a cross-border element.

It was the only category to fall in the first bidding exercise of 2014, with the other four all ending higher.\n\nCat B - for cars above 1,600cc - climbed $3,000 to $78,700, while Cat E - the open category which currently tracks Cat B - rose $1,499 to $79,000.\n\nCat C - for commercial vehicles - was $888 higher at $48,889, while Cat D - for motorcycles - inched up $177 to $1,989.\n\nMost distributors had expected all premiums to rise because the previous COE tender was three weeks ago, or one week more than the usual interval between bidding exercises. A longer break allows distributors to collect more orders, hence driving prices up.\n\n\"Maybe the Cat A premium fell because most players who had been trying to sell off their existing Cat A stock have already done so,\" said the sales manager of a mid-sized European dealership.\n\nCat A, which was intended for bread-and-butter models, will be re-categorised next month to include an engine output cap of 97 kW or 130 hp. This is to ensure that luxury models do not encroach on this small car category, as they have in the past three years.\n\nAs a result, most in the industry had assumed that premiums would start easing only from February onwards, so yesterday's result was a surprise.\n\nStill, some cautioned that it may be too early to predict Cat A's eventual softening.\n\n\"It wasn't a big drop and there is one more tender before the re-categorisation takes effect, so I would say that we will have to wait until then for a clearer picture,\" said the sales manager.\n\nAnother point he made is that vehicle deregistration numbers for December are still unavailable, and that means the Land Transport Authority will not be announcing details of the new COE quota for February to July 2014 yet.\n\nWith the next half-year quota likely to see a contraction in Cat A and Cat B COE numbers, the sales manager said that this could change things.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition to Tiger's stake, Cebu Pacific will acquire the remaining 60 per cent in Southeast Asian Airlines (SEAir) - as the carrier was known before it was rebranded Tigerair Philippines - for US$8 million. The 60 per cent stake is held by Filipino Tomas B Lopez and other shareholders.\n\nTiger's wholly owned subsidiary, Roar Aviation II, has signed a binding offer letter with Cebu Air where the latter will acquire 55,000 Common A shares and 145,000 Common B shares in SEAir. The deal is subject to the necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals.\n\nAs part of the deal, the two carriers have struck a strategic alliance, which will include an interline agreement as well as jointly operating common routes between Singapore and the Philippines.\n\nTigerair Philippines will \"initially\" continue to operate under the Tigerair banner after the divestment, while both Tiger and Cebu Pacific will use their websites to sell routes operated by both airlines.\n\nThe group, which highlighted last July at an AGM that it was in it for the long haul with Tigerair Philippines, appears to have reconsidered its position. A spokesman for the budget carrier said yesterday that in the course of negotiations for an alliance, Cebu Pacific had expressed an interest in acquiring Tigerair Philippines in its entirety.\n\nGroup chief executive of Tigerair Koay Peng Yen said: \"This partnership with Cebu Pacific is consistent with our asset-light strategy, and builds upon our other alliances. We also look forward to achieving greater cost savings from the coordinated operations while providing more travel options and greater convenience for our customers.\"\n\nWith a fleet of five planes and a market share of some 5 per cent, Tigerair Philippines has failed to make significant headway against domestic rivals such as Cebu Pacific and PAL Express. The carrier has continued to bleed since Tiger invested US$2.5 million to acquire its stake in 2012.\n\nThis move could allow Cebu Pacific, which already holds a dominant share of the market in the Philippines, to cement its position on the domestic front, spelling bad news for state carrier Philippine Airlines. This is the second airline merger in the Philippines of late, after AirAsia acquired Zest Air.\n\n\"This strategic alliance will allow both Cebu Pacific and Tigerair to leverage our extensive networks spanning from North Asia, Asean, Australia, India, all the way to the Middle East,\" highlighted chief executive of Cebu Pacific, Lance Gokongwei.\n\nTigerair Philippines operates some 118 flights weekly to 11 domestic and international destinations from its bases in Manila and Clark. Meanwhile, Cebu Pacific operates about 2,200 flights weekly with its 48 aircraft to 24 international and 33 Philippine cities.\n\nThe carriers said that the merger would allow Cebu Pacific to provide services to high-growth markets such as Australia and India, while Tigerair would be able to fly more passengers to other cities in the Philippines and North Asia through its partner's network.\n\n\"Tigerair could be reluctant to continue covering losses in the Philippines as its other current and planned affiliates are more strategically important to the group,\" Capa-Centre for Aviation, highlighted in a research note. \"Indonesian affiliate Tigerair Mandala also has struggled and faces challenges but Indonesia is a much bigger market than the Philippines.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the three Airbus A320 planes in Tigerair Philippines' fleet will continue to be operated by the carrier while two A319s will be returned to Tigerair Singapore.\n\nThis divestment comes after Tiger sold 60 per cent of its stake in Tigerair Australia, which has also suffered losses, to Virgin Australia. The group still has a near 36 per cent stake in Tigerair Mandala, which has yet to swing into the black.\n\nLast month, Tiger announced a joint venture with China Airlines to set up Tigerair Taiwan, where Tiger will hold a 10 per cent stake.\n\nShares in Tiger closed at 51 cents yesterday, down half a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The gauge will be tied to 25 deals issued last year, according to an e-mail sent to traders.\n\nThe benchmark will open a window on the perceived difference between the quality of offerings sold last year, when sales doubled to US$80 billion, and those issued in 2012. All three major rating companies noted a decline in underwriting standards as 2013 progressed, including rising leverage and weaker properties, with Standard & Poor's forecasting in December that losses for deals arranged in 2013 would be larger than those from previous years.\n\n\"There is a debate regarding the credit quality of deals issued in the second half of 2013,\" Richard Hill, a New York- based debt analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in an e-mail. \"While some investors argue that credit quality has meaningfully declined, others believe it's a natural evolution. This new index should provide some transparency.\"\n\nThe new measure is the seventh in a series that started in March 2006. There were no updates from May 2008 through January of last year as issuance came to a standstill when credit markets froze. The most recent version is tied to 25 transactions sold in 2012, when US$41 billion was arranged, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe 2012 index linked to bonds rated BBB-, S&P's lowest investment grade ranking, rose to 98.6 US cents on the dollar on Jan 3 after falling as low as 86.7 US cents in June, according to Markit. The benchmark rises when investor sentiment improves and falls when it deteriorates.\n\nPrices on the fourth series of the index, tied to securities rated AAA when issuance peaked in 2007 that have since been cut to junk, increased to 77.5 US cents on Jan 3 from 66 US cents in June. That index, which tracks deals such as the US$3 billion loan that financed the doomed acquisition of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, fell to as low as 22.7 US cents in April 2009.\n\nCommercial-mortgage bond issuance, which ceased for 16 months following the financial crisis, is forecast to reach at least US$100 billion this year, according to analysts across Wall Street from Bank of America Corp to Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nThe introduction of the latest iteration of the CMBX is a testament to the strength of the revival of the commercial- mortgage bond market, according to Ellington Management Group LLC's Leo Huang.\n\n\"Over US$100 billion is pretty impressive for a business that was left for dead after the financial crisis,\" said Mr Huang, an investment manager overseeing commercial real-estate debt.\n\nThe rapid surge in issuance has sparked concern that lenders are sliding back towards the lax standards that characterised loans made during the boom leading up to the property market crash in 2007.\n\n\"The sheer volume we have seen in CMBS issuance over the past two years has forced an expansion of the credit window, which in turn has lowered underwriting standards,\" according to Scott Buchta, head of fixed-income strategy at brokerage Brean Capital LLC.\n\nMoody's Investors Service said in October it was requiring dealers to increase the buffer that protects investment-grade ranked securities from losses on new commercial-mortgage bond deals as loans get riskier. Lending standards may be compromised by the \"rapid increase\" of originations as banks struggle to keep up, losing track of or overlooking key information about the properties, Fitch said in a Dec 3 report.\n\nGoldman Sachs Group pulled a US$47.5 million loan from a deal sold in November when investors balked over a dispute between the borrower and one of its lenders.\n\nThe new index will probably trade wider than the 2012 index, meaning it will cost more to insure the underlying bonds, according to Brean's Buchta.\n\nNot everybody agrees. The difference will be minimal, according to Harris Trifon, a debt analyst at Deutsche Bank. There could be a surge in the cost of insuring debt at the outset as lenders switch to the new index to protect themselves from losses on loans they are stockpiling to package into securities, though that should subside, he said.\n\nWall Street is already pumping out the first transactions of 2014, with Deutsche Bank and Cantor Fitzgerald LP marketing a US$1.24 billion offering this week. Investors have been snapping up the deals, wagering that the US economic recovery will be strong enough to boost revenue for landlords.\n\nReal estate values have recovered 70 per cent of their losses since bottoming in December 2009, according to the Moody's/RCA Commercial Property Price index. The climb has come to a \"virtual stop\" over the past several months as rising interest rates weigh on values, Green Street Advisors said in a report on Tuesday.\n\nLate payments on commercial mortgages packaged into bonds have been declining after peaking last year, falling 41 basis points to 7.47 per cent in December, according to Wells Fargo. Delinquencies on deals sold after sales revived are still rare, with 0.12 per cent of borrowers behind on payments for 2012 offerings compared with 0.05 per cent for 2013, according to Wells Fargo.\n\n\"There is a range of opinions on series 7 versus series 6 credit quality,\" said Ellington's Huang. \"There has been an evolution of credit, but I don't think credit quality has fallen off a cliff.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Based on the advertisements, the average asking price of those units is $655 per sq ft (psf).\n\nPatrick Wee, senior marketing director at ERA Realty Network, said his listing had attracted a fair bit of interest.\n\n\"The HDB market is rather quiet at the moment, but even then, I'm getting quite a fair number of calls,\" he said, adding that he was still waiting for the valuation report and so has not yet shown the flat to interested buyers.\n\nBut consultants say that while The Premiere will certainly command a premium over regular HDB flats, sellers may have to lower their price expectations given the current climate; HDB's lending restrictions, for example, have limited the pool of potential buyers.\n\nThe Premiere was the first DBSS site rolled out by HDB. Back in 2005, it was lauded as a major shift in Singapore's housing programme, offering buyers a middle ground between the Build-To-Order (BTO) flats and executive condominium units.\n\nDeveloped by the private-sector Sim Lian Group, the 616-unit Premiere opened to much fanfare, pulling in 5,900 applications in late 2006.\n\nIt received its Temporary Occupation Permit in December 2008. Its residents have since lived there for five years and have become eligible to sell their units, but to date, no resale transactions have been recorded.\n\nEugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Singapore, said the units there will naturally command a premium over the neighbouring BTO flats.\n\n\"As these (DBSS) flats were designed and built by private developers, they have a certain 'private' feel in the interior and layout, and will appeal to buyers looking for that condo look and feel but do not mind the fact that it is a public flat,\" he said.\n\nHe added that at five years old, the units are new, relative to other Tampines flats put up for resale, which would generally be more than 15 years old.\n\nThe price-sensitive house-hunter may not bite. With the current mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) capped at 30 per cent and the loan term capped at 25 years, such buyers may not favour higher-priced flats, given that they need to fork out more equity, he said.\n\nR'ST Research's Mr Ong said he expects reaction to these flats to be \"lukewarm\", and that demand for resale flats will likely be directed at older three-room and four-room flats, which are more competitively priced.\n\nHe said: \"DBSS flats have breached the affordability limit of many resale flat buyers ... Also, DBSS flats are non-gated developments, so it is unlikely that there will be many buyers who are willing to pay a hefty premium for a resale unit. Executive condominiums (ECs) and private condominiums are usually gated with a range of facilities, so residents can enjoy that sense of exclusivity.\"\n\nThat being said, The Premiere, by virtue of its location, may find traction among private-home downgraders, said DTZ's Mr Wong.\n\nMr Ong said he reckoned it would be hard to brand DBSS resale flats as having enough of an edge over other flats to command a \"super premium\".\n\nHe added, however, that DBSS units have a uniqueness about them, since no more DBSS sites have been launched since 2011.\n\nThis was a reference to the DBSS programme having been suspended that year, following a public outcry over a new Centrale 8 DBSS unit - also in Tampines - costing $880,000.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The plaintiffs, who seek class- action status for their complaint, accuse the managers, Peter Malkin and his son Anthony, of rejecting higher offers for the building, including one for about US$500 million more than investors received for their interests.\n\nEmpire State Realty Trust Inc, whose properties include the building, sold 71.5 million shares for US$13 each on Oct 1.

From a loss of $78,000 the previous year, its Q2 profits were driven mainly by a halving of its sales costs.\n\nRevenue for its second quarter saw a 23.3 per cent drop to $2.4 million, from $3.2 million last year. TEE Land's development at The Peak @ Cairnhill 1, along with rental income from its \"Workotel\" development in New Zealand, contributed to its Q2 revenue.\n\nA year ago, the company recognised revenue from developments at The Peak @ Cairnhill 1 and 448@East Coast, which obtained its Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) in May last year.\n\nBesides a reduction in costs of sales, construction progresses by TEE Land's Singapore associates, together with the completion and handing over of units to owners of its Thailand associates' projects, helped drive profits.\n\nAs at Nov 30, 2013, TEE Land had a cash surplus of $34.6 million, from $29.1 million half a year ago, after its initial public offering (IPO) in early June last year where it was able to raise net proceeds of $57.8 million.\n\nFor the year ending May 31, 2013, the group has had eight completed developments, 10 current and 10 future projects to be launched. It currently has contracted $64 million and $16.7 million in sales for ongoing residential property development projects in Singapore and Thailand, respectively. It has also completed acquisition of two plots of land in Bangkok. Future project launches in Singapore include Rezi3Two (Lorong 32 Geylang), Twelve Residences (Hillside Drive) and TRIO (Sam Leong Road).\n\nOverseas, besides the official opening of its \"Workotel\" in New Zealand, TEE Land will launch its maiden project, Third Avenue at Cyberjaya, Malaysia.\n\nTEE Land said in a statement that it will \"remain cautious in view of increased challenges in Singapore\". It is also monitoring Thailand's political developments. \"While the regional real estate sector is currently facing inherent challenges, we remain convinced of the long-term potential in the Asean region,\" said Jonathan Phua, executive director and CEO of TEE Land.\n\nThe company announced an interim dividend of 0.5 cents per share, and its earnings per share as at Nov 30, 2013 is 37 cents, compared to negative two cents a year ago.\n\nTEE Land shares closed up 0.5 cent at 32 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They took immediate effect.\n\nThe central bank put in place a long-awaited framework for Singapore banks, which doubled a previous cap of 2 per cent on covered bond issuance to 4 per cent, relative to an issuer's asset.\n\nCovered bonds are debt obligations issued by a bank and secured by a pool of assets or cover pool, such as residential mortgage loans.\n\nFitch noted that the updated rules make liquid assets - cash, Singapore government securities and MAS bills - eligible cover pool assets, up to a 15 per cent cap. Liquid assets can help to bridge maturity mismatches between the cover pool and covered bonds.\n\nFitch said: \"However, this provision does not in itself lead to a more favourable assessment of liquidity gaps in covered bonds' programmes, as it does not ensure a minimum level of liquid assets in relation to liquidity needs over a given period.\n\n\"MAS' rules do not prescribe any mitigants for bridging liquidity gaps in covered bonds, which we expect to be addressed by contractual agreements in the covered bond programmes.\"\n\nThe updated rules also specify that asset coverage tests (ACTs) should be added as an additional risk-management test and conducted at least every 12 months.\n\nFitch said that in practice, it expects banks to conduct ACTs more frequently, to be comparable with the monthly or quarterly ACTs commonly seen in covered bond programmes in other jurisdictions.\n\nIt said that MAS will require banks to disclose ACT results and cover pool characteristics at least quarterly, which Fitch viewed as positive for investors. Public disclosure requirements had not been addressed in the 2012 consultation.\n\nHowever, Fitch noted that the updated rules still excluded standardised data sets for reporting, which it believed would make disclosure consistent and allow investors to compare Singaporean covered bond programmes.\n\nIt said that while the updated rules doubled the encumbrance limit to 4 per cent of total bank assets from 2 per cent, this is still low compared with Asia-Pacific covered bond jurisdictions such as Australia, which has 8 per cent and New Zealand, 10 per cent.\n\nFitch also noted that the MAS was maintaining its original rule that, other than liquid assets, only residential mortgage loans and derivatives held for the purpose of hedging risks that arise from issuing covered bonds qualify as cover pool assets, although it would \"review the inclusion of other types of loans at a later stage\".\n\nIn the absence of dedicated covered bond laws in Singapore, Fitch expects Singaporean covered bonds to be issued based on individual contractual arrangements, and that Singaporean issuers will use the current laws.\n\nThe rating agency said that its assessment of covered bonds issued under the rules will incorporate a review of the legal and contractual provisions for asset segregation and for the appointment and role of an administrator in servicing and liquidating cover assets.\n\nIt noted that the legal regime governing issuance by special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) in Singaporean securitisation transactions has been strong and supportive in ringfencing collateral from originator insolvency risk.\n\nLike most of Asia, Singapore's covered bond market is at a nascent stage of development.\n\nThe MAS proposals could potentially make Singapore the next market of covered bonds in the region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But no one would have paid attention. Stocks were in a free fall and wouldn't hit bottom for two more months.\n\nToday, after a year in which the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose almost 30 per cent, there are plenty of views on what the next five years might look like, but they're not in agreement. Plenty of people question whether the next five years can be as good as the last five. They base their concern on stock indexes setting records, while other parts of the economy, like jobs, continue to lag. Last Friday, the S&P 500 closed at 1,831.36.\n\nOther people see the fundamentals of US companies as so solid that stocks will continue to do well despite their large run-up.\n\n\"I think we're in for a long bull market and economic expansion that will be a little longer than average,\" said Marty Sass, chairman and chief executive of M D Sass, which manages US$6 billion. \"That's my best guess.\" When you're looking out three to five years, guessing would seem to be part of it. While the one-year predictions I wrote about last week can be thrown off by an unexpected event or two, the medium-term view should be based on economic and corporate fundamentals, whether the prevailing mood is as dire as it was in 2009 or as cautiously optimistic as it is today.\n\nThis is where my interest in the three- to five-year investment outlook comes in. Back in 2009, the economy could have continued getting worse for longer than it did, but it would have turned around at some point. Today, some investors have the opposite concern, that the good times have run too long and there is a correction coming.\n\nRegardless of whether a correction comes or not, this is where the medium-term projection should have value. Instead of reading tea leaves, it should be able to assess tectonic shifts. So now that we're in 2014, I wanted to consider what investment strategists think the near future could bring.\n\nThe trends\n\nSome of their views are very broad - like stocks continuing to do well because of solid corporate earnings, low inflation and little pressure to raise wages given how high unemployment remains. But other views are based on stories that could play out for far longer than five years.\n\nUS production of oil and gas, for one, is expected to be stronger in five years. This is based on proven reserves and new drilling techniques. Saying what will happen in six to 12 months in this industry, though, is always difficult: A pipeline could explode, turmoil in the Middle East could affect prices, or regulation in Washington could cost companies more money. Longer term, the issue is supply and demand.\n\n\"We've discovered through this shale drilling how to exploit much more natural gas than we ever thought we could,\" said Kent Croft, chief investment officer of Croft Leominster. \"Have all the stocks been the greatest this year? No. Do I expect them to outperform over time? I certainly do. I think this is one of those watershed moments in the US economic outlook.\" The mobile technology sector is another longer-term play. Mr Sass said payment processors such as PayPal were set to increase their processing of payments online but also to reach more into retail stores. And, of course, more of everything is moving to mobile devices, and companies are going to look to profit from that.\n\nIn other industries, such as airlines and television broadcasting, consolidation is going to make stronger companies over the medium term.\n\n\"These are industries that have gone from horror shows to very compelling plays,\" Mr Sass said.\n\nThe risks\n\nThere are plenty of risks to the medium-term view. Kate Moore, US chief investment strategist for JPMorgan Private Bank, said her clients generally had concerns about three big themes.\n\nThey worry first, she said, about how much higher equity prices can go. After 4\u00bd years of prices going higher, they ask her when the rally is going to end. \"This is where we'll walk them through corporate fundamentals and show them balance sheets and how margins can be sustainable,\" she said. \"We find that most valuations are below 10- to 15-year historical norms.\"\n\nThe two other worries are what will happen to China and Europe. With China, she said, the concern is that the country's economic growth is going to slow and drag down the global economy.\n\n\"There are some areas of the market, particularly in the resource space, that have overcapacity,\" she said.\n\nMichael Tiedemann, chief investment officer of Tiedemann Wealth Management, said he saw China as one of the two big questions over the next three to five years (the other was how tighter rules on bank lending and the Federal Reserve's gradual end to buying bonds will play out). He is not confident that China will be able to handle its transition from an export-based economy to a more balanced one smoothly.\n\n\"We're not predicting it's going to go badly, but along the way perhaps there will be conflicting signals,\" he said. And that calls for investors to be prepared for some volatility.\n\nThe questions about Europe revolved around whether the continent had gotten over its problems.\n\n\"They're either convinced that Europe is going to grow strongly next year because they've seen an appreciation of assets,\" Ms Moore said. \"Or they're very sceptical about institutional change and the capability to bring together so many different countries for cohesive change (her view is some place in the middle, she said).\" But Dean Tenerelli, European stock fund manager at T Rowe Price, said Europe's continued recovery was linked to what happened in China, which for years was bolstering companies around the world with its demands for goods.\n\n\"I come across a lot of businesses where they're disappointing because that froth isn't there anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"The mining companies are cutting capital expenditures by 25 per cent and that trickles through to all the companies that make that stuff and to the banks that were financing all of that. I even picked it up at beverage companies that have missed their numbers because the Chinese demand for cognac is declining.\"\n\nThe value\n\nIs looking out even five years still too short for long-term investors? Surely, oil drilling is going to be happening in North Dakota for a decade or more.\n\nKeith Banks, president of US Trust, said looking out 10 years was too long for most clients to think about, but five years was a great time frame to spot what he called the mega-trends where people made substantial wealth. These trends run over many years and offer a sustained opportunity for people to participate, even if they miss the very start of the trend.\n\n\"The world isn't an on/off switch,\" Mr Banks said. \"It is a dimmer switch.\" He said his firm talked to clients more and more about the three- to five-year outlook, but often they needed the view over the next year to get to the longer one.\n\n\"It's an iterative process,\" he said.\n\nOne of the main benefits of the longer view is it smooths out the noise that can crop up in just one year.\n\n\"I have more confidence in looking ahead five years than I do one year,\" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management. \"And I think most strategists feel the same. The short term is so uncertain and can be impacted by a lot of noise, while in the long term, markets are very fundamental.\" How those projections are done, though, naturally relies on assumptions, and that means they can be flawed.\n\n\"Any three- to five-year forecast typically relies pretty heavily on some mean reversion assumptions - I believe this company is relatively undervalued versus the market or its peers,\" Mr Tiedemann said.\n\n\"We have five-year forward views on asset classes and projections. At the core of those is our five-year expectation of GDP growth, inflation and where we believe the 10-year Treasury yield will be at the end of five years.\"\n\nIn other words, the medium term may be more accurate, but projecting it is still difficult. Yet it is such a stabilising view that can help people through the anxious moments of any year.\n\n\"Our advice is, 'Don't time, don't chase and don't react,'\" said Karl Wellner, president and chief executive of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management. \"We want our clients to think and plan ahead. It's very simple. But people kick themselves for making the same mistakes over and over.\" There are worse New Year's resolutions. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

SIA sent another plane to Baku for the affected passengers after getting the necessary overflight approvals.\n\nAccording to airline spokesman Nicholas Ionides, a door on the main deck of the Airbus A380 appeared to have suffered a leak, which caused the cabin depressurisation.\n\n\"The root cause of the incident is being investigated and a team of specialists from Airbus will be travelling to Baku to assist. The door will be removed and examined thoroughly by SIA and the specialists from Airbus,\" said Mr Ionides.\n\nMeanwhile, a new door will be fitted on the aircraft in Baku before it is sent back to Singapore, said Airbus communications director (Asia) Sean Lee.\n\nSIA's ground services teams met the passengers on the returning flight when they landed yesterday, and both flight as well as accommodation arrangements were made for those who had onward connections from Singapore. The airline is also offering all passengers a refund for the flight from London to Singapore.\n\nNone of the passengers or the 27 crew members on the double-decker plane were injured. The airline said previously that oxygen marks were deployed after the loss of cabin pressure.\n\nHowever, passengers were made to wait some 16 hours in Baku airport as approvals were sought from the local authorities before the passengers were able to obtain visas and move to a hotel.\n\nSome of the affected passengers shared their frustrations at having to sleep on the airport floor on the airline's Facebook page. However, others also commended the SIA staff onboard the flight for keeping passengers calm.\n\nSIA, which has been posting updates on its Facebook and Twitter pages, also deployed staff from Moscow and Istanbul to Baku to help, as it doesn't operate regular flights to Azerbaijan's capital city.\n\nSIA shares closed at $10.10 yesterday, down 11 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is much higher than the prior vote in November, when about 4,500 did not vote, said a union member who works on the 777 wing production line. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Earlier in the day, it had gone down as much as $9.73. Some 18.6 million shares changed hands.\n\nSince rumours of the takeover broke on Friday, OCBC's stock has fallen a total of 43 cents or 4.2 per cent.\n\nIts target fared slightly better; shares of Wing Hang, listed in Hong Kong, managed yesterday to claw back some of the heavy losses suffered previously.\n\nWing Hang closed 1.5 per cent up at HK$117.30 yesterday. Its shares had slumped as much as 6.1 per cent on Monday before being halted from trade.\n\nBoth OCBC and Wing Hang shares resumed trading yesterday, after being halted from trade midway through the morning session on Monday.\n\nOCBC had announced on Monday evening that it has entered into exclusive talks with Wing Hang's substantial shareholders to take over their stake in the bank. Wing Hang is one of four remaining family- owned banks in Hong Kong; it is 45 per cent controlled by the Fung family and BNY International Financing Corporation.\n\nUnder the terms of the \"exclusivity agreement\", Wing Hang's substantial shareholders \"will engage exclusively with OCBC to seek to finalise the terms for a possible transaction, which would, should it proceed, involve OCBC making a general offer for all the shares of Wing Hang Bank\".\n\nOCBC added that no binding offer had been made at this stage, and did not disclose other details of the talks, including its possible offer price.\n\nBut a Bloomberg news report last week estimated the deal to be worth around $5.8 billion. It cited two unnamed people with knowledge of the deal as saying that OCBC had made Wing Hang an offer that was less than the two times book value the Hong Kong bank was seeking.\n\nWing Hang has a market value of US$4.6 billion, which is 1.7 times its estimated 2013 book value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAnalysts said that OCBC investors are concerned that OCBC might be paying too much for Wing Hang, while investors in Wing Hang were worried that OCBC might not be paying enough.\n\nUBS analysts said that the deal would require \"sizeable capital raising\" by OCBC and is likely to be dilutive for shareholders. \"We struggle to see how an acquisition of Wing Hang will generate a double-digit return on investment on a three-to-five-year timeframe.\"\n\nUBS cut its 12-month target price for the bank to $10.90 from $11.30, saying that \"historically, acquirers of banks in Hong Kong have struggled to make a decent return on capital deployed\".\n\nKevin Kwek, an analyst at Bernstein Research in Singapore, was cited by Financial Times as questioning whether OCBC was overpaying for a business in a market where rivals have struggled to grow their acquisitions.\n\nDMG & Partners Research felt that the rumoured offer price, \"while not cheap, appears palatable relative to a recent M&A transaction there\".\n\nDMG was referring to Yue Xiu Group's offer last November to pay US$1.5 billion, or 2.1 times price-to-book value, for Chong Hing Bank, despite Chong Hing having a smaller asset base and lower returns on equity and assets than Wing Hang.\n\nOn the flip side, Wing Hang investors are unhappy with OCBC's rumoured intentions to offer less than the two times book value the Hong Kong bank is asking for. This, especially so when other Hong Kong banks before Chong Hing, have gone for much higher multiples.\n\nWing Lung Bank, for example, was bought by China Merchants Bank in 2008 for more than three times book value, while Dao Heng Bank went for about the same to DBS Bank in 2001.\n\nHong Kong's family-run banks, pressured by big players such as HSBC Holdings and Bank of China, are now attracting interest from buyers. Singapore banks, in particular, are keen to expand their Greater China footprint.\n\nWing Hang's presence across southern China's Pearl River Delta makes it a more attractive target than other smaller family-owned banks in the city, Grace Wu, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong, told Bloomberg.\n\nWing Hang is a mainstream retail bank, with a network of more than 70 branches spanning Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was trading at US$1,234 at 10pm last night.\n\n\"There's a lot of news about China, and people queueing up for gold jewellery,\" said Standard Bank's head of precious metals, Ng Cheng Thye. \"That's why it has created a strong demand in the physical market.\"\n\nThe closure of refineries for the holiday season meant that supply has been reduced, pushing up premiums over gold's spot price in China to about US$30 an ounce, compared with between US$8 and US$10 an ounce at the end of last year, Mr Ng noted.\n\nBesides seasonal buying for Chinese New Year, the pick-up in demand in China is due in part to recent weak gold prices.\n\n\"It looks like another price opportunistic period where the recent price weakness at the end of the year has triggered an increase in Asian physical demand,\" said Mark Keenan, head of commodities research at Societe Generale.\n\nAt the same time, Reuters reported on Monday that the Indian government could be cutting its import duty on gold later this month.\n\nTo reduce a record trade deficit, India had increased the import duty on gold three times last year to a record 10 per cent and tied imports for domestic consumption to exports, which resulted in a rise in smuggling that the government is now trying to curb.\n\nMany, however, remain sceptical about the relaxation of the import restrictions.\n\n\"The return of India as a greater importer would be gold-friendly but it is still not clear when, or even if, the authorities will cut the tariffs on gold,\" said HSBC chief commodities analyst James Steel. \"It may also take months for greater physical demand to work thoroughly through the market and support prices.\"\n\nIn the short term, gold prices could go up further to between US$1,275 and US$1,305 an ounce, said head of commodity research Dominic Schnider at UBS's wealth management unit.\n\nA rebalancing of commodity indices at the start of the year could help to support gold prices in this period.\n\n\"In the Dow Jones UBS Commodity Index, the second-largest passive commodity index, gold accounts for 10.8 per cent. If you think about the 28 per cent gold drop last year, in order to rebalance, it has to buy gold,\" he said. Both the Dow Jones index and the S&P GSCI are also giving gold more weight this year.\n\nAnother support for gold prices comes from a closing of short positions in gold, or bets that gold prices will go down.\n\nSaid Mr Keenan: \"As we saw for the whole of last year, (an increase in Chinese demand) does not have the ability to catalyse any meaningful sustained rises. But it certainly catalyses short-covering and the establishment of a short-term price floor, and that's what we're seeing at the moment.\"\n\nShort futures positions on gold held by hedge funds more than doubled from early November to 82,765 contracts for the week ended Dec 24, according to data from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The week after, it dropped 5 per cent to 78,334 contracts.\n\nThe longer-term outlook for gold, however, remains bearish, said analysts.\n\n\"The backdrop of a global economic recovery, the winding down of the monetary stimulus that we see coming to an end in the middle of this year - and the side effect of a higher dollar - will weigh significantly on gold prices,\" said Mr Keenan.\n\nAt the same time, nearing the end of this year, \"we're going to be talking about rate hikes\", said Mr Schnider at UBS.\n\n\"I know a lot of people will say this is premature, but it's not premature if we talk about a 12-month forecast.\"\n\nGold tumbled 28 per cent last year, the first time since 2000 that it has failed to end the year higher than where it started.\n\nA surge in speculative selling in bullion-backed exchange traded funds (ETF) in April caused gold to fall to a low of US$1,180 a troy ounce, and eventually led to the amount of gold held by ETFs to drop by more than 870 tonnes.\n\nThe price plunge stirred up a greater appetite among Asian investors, especially in China, where demand is forecast to have reached 1,000 tonnes last year, helping it overtake India as the world's top gold buyer.\n\nMany analysts foresee the outflow of gold from exchange-traded funds to maintain this year. China will continue to take up the slack - at bargain prices, said Mr Schnider.\n\n\"We expect 400-500 tonnes of outflow from ETFs which need to be absorbed. I don't think the central banks will step in in a big way,\" he said.\n\n\"With India being absent still, everything will be shouldered by China. Which it will do, but at a discount.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Boeing said jetliner gross orders totalled 1,531 in 2013, a record, and net orders reached 1,355.\n\nAirbus sales exceeded both of those numbers, the sources said on condition of anonymity, without giving further details.\n\nBased on announcements of 98 orders since the end of November, Airbus has booked at least 1,471 gross orders and 1,412 net orders. The European planemaker typically unveils new orders with its final figures for the year, due Jan 13.\n\nInvestors keep close tabs on deliveries, since planemakers book the bulk of the revenue from airplane sales when the aircraft are handed over to customers.\n\nBut orders have had a growing impact on share prices in the past two years, as the world's dominant planemakers fought for sales of new fuel-efficient models. Plane orders also can produce large swings in company cash balances, because airlines make downpayments when orders are placed.\n\nBoeing's delivery tally topped its forecast of up to 645 jets for the year and was up from 601 last year. The tally also exceeded deliveries by rival Airbus, one of the sources said.\n\nAirbus delivered more than 625 aircraft in 2013, beating its target of up to 620 but lagging Boeing's total of 648 deliveries, the source said.\n\nBoeing said it delivered 440 of its 737 single-aisle planes, 98 of its 777 widebody planes and 65 of its carbon composite 787 Dreamliners, which are now in use with 16 customers.\n\nThe Chicago-based aerospace and defence company also delivered 24 of its 747 jumbo jets, and 21 of its 767 jets.\n\nBoeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner praised \"solid execution\" as factories increased production rates last year.\n\n\"We delivered more advanced, fuel-efficient airplanes to our customers than ever before, and it's a great example of what our team can accomplish,\" he said in a statement.\n\nBoeing's production lead is likely to grow this year. The company plans to increase output of its top-selling 737 model to 42 a month in 2014 and to 47 a month by 2017. It makes 38 a month currently. Airbus, by contrast, has not announced plans to increase output of its rival A320 jet.\n\nBoeing also said it would lift production of its 787 Dreamliner wide-body jet to 12 a month by 2016 and 14 a month by 2020, up from a target of 10 a month by the end of 2013.\n\nHowever, orders are likely to slow, even as deliveries rise, said Peter Arment, an analyst at brokerage Sterne Agee. \"With delivery slots filling up, even at these elevated production rates, by nature we're going to see some tapering of the order book activity,\" Mr Arment said.\n\nBoeing and Airbus will focus on \"leveraging and execution off these large backlogs\" of orders, converting them to planes - and cash.\n\nWhile some investors fear rising production will create an oversupply of aircraft, Mr Arment said that's not a big worry. \"We still have some ageing aircraft fleets in Asia and Europe that need to be replaced,\" he said, and that should prevent a glut.\n\nBoeing also delivered 171 military aircraft and satellites, up 11 per cent from 154 in 2012. Boeing in October said it will close its C-17 military transport plane production, which is producing a steady 10 planes a year, due to lack of orders.\n\nThe order book for fighters also is tapering, and analysts say this could force closure of those production lines later this decade unless Boeing lands new orders. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

That flight was right on schedule. After a week like the last one, things seemed to have gone downhill since.\n\nIt wasn't really that much of a flight on Jan 1, 1914, when Tony Jannus flew one passenger, AC Pheil, on a 30 km journey across Florida's Tampa Bay from St Petersburg to Tampa in a wood-and-canvas biplane. The flight was operated by the St Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line, and it arrived, on schedule, about 25 minutes after it took off.\n\nOn Thursday through Sunday, airlines cancelled more than 13,600 flights, according to FlightView.com, a site that provides flight information. An additional 4,400 had been cancelled by mid-afternoon on Monday. Among them were 300 JetBlue flights cancelled at the Boston and New York airports. JetBlue said that icy conditions and a recent rule by the Federal Aviation Administration that limits pilots' on-duty hours \"caused delayed flights to quickly turn into cancelled ones\".\n\nThere are about 36,000 commercial flights daily in the US. Some flights were cancelled in places where there was no bad weather. That's because airlines have reduced schedules and there is little slack to handle disruptions.\n\nAs airlines cancel flights and shift equipment and crews, sometimes well in advance of anticipated bad weather, the effects radiate throughout the entire domestic system - including in places where the weather is good - and into the vast international networks. Traveller misery is often compounded at airports, as stranded passengers, some unable to rebook flights until days later, confront the reality that airlines are not required to provide a hotel room or meal vouchers for cancellations caused by weather or other \"acts of God\".\n\nOne benefit of cancelling flights even before the extent of a storm becomes clear \"is that airlines have time to rebook travellers who have connections before they get stuck at connecting hubs\", said Mike Benjamin, the chief executive of FlightView.com. \"This enables airlines to reduce the number of next-day bookings, overnight hotel vouchers and future flight vouchers that they have to issue - which mitigates the significant loss that airlines typically experience during major weather events.\"\n\nUnited Airlines, like other carriers, has added call centre staff, but systems are sometimes overwhelmed.\n\nPaul Hudson, president of FlyersRights.org, a consumer group, says that the industry profits by mishandling weather-related cancellations and rebookings. He suggests that the Transportation Department address the issue, just as it did in 2010 after it began imposing stiff fines against airlines for excessive tarmac delays that kept passengers on idled planes for hours.\n\nDuring bad weather, he said, \"many airlines prefer to dump costs on passengers and have the entire country suffer from an air transportation slowdown, rather than having the reserves to do proper contingency planning\". - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Legend has it that Mr Shaw first cut his teeth in the business by distributing film reels on a bicycle to rural cinemas in Singapore and Malaysia, giving poignancy to his name \"Run Run\".\n\nHe started out helping his elder brothers Runje, Runde and Runme set up a film studio in Shanghai in 1925. The brothers later moved into Hong Kong, making and distributing films to a chain of around 100 cinemas spread across other Asian markets such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nMr Shaw eventually split from his brothers to set up his own studio in the 1950s dubbed \"the dream factory\", which ushered in a golden era of Hong Kong film-making.\n\nThe Shaw studio produced about a thousand titles, including melodramas, historical epics and kung fu classics like The One-armed Swordsman - helping to redefine genres and lure new cinema-goers not only in Hong Kong and Asia, but in the West.\n\nMr Shaw also invested in a number of co-productions, most notably the Ridley Scott classic, Blade Runner, starring Harrison Ford, in 1982.\n\nThe studio also pioneered so-called wu xia or sword-play genre films - which had frenetic fight scenes with mixed weapons.\n\nAng Lee's Oscar-winning Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a striking modern example of the genre. The Shaw influence is also evident in the films of kung fu legend Bruce Lee as well as actors Jackie Chan and Jet Li.\n\nWhile Mr Shaw was famed for his business acumen and nose for spotting and grooming new talent, he famously turned away a brash, young actor who came to see him in the 1960s.\n\nThis spurned man, martial arts legend Bruce Lee, later teamed up with Raymond Chow, a former Shaw deputy-turned- rival, to make The Big Boss in 1971, propelling him to stardom.\n\nIn 1980, Mr Shaw focused on television, becoming the chairman of TVB, which grew into a successful television and entertainment empire that remains a deep influence on popular culture in Hong Kong and overseas Chinese communities.\n\nIn 2011, Mr Shaw sold his entire 26 per cent stake in TVB to a consortium for HK$6.26 billion (S$1.02 billion). He retired as chairman at the end of that year after holding the post for 30 years and was appointed chairman emeritus.\n\nMr Shaw was also a noted philanthropist, having donated millions to charity through his Shaw Foundation, mostly to causes in China. Hong Kong media reported that he donated more than 4.5 billion yuan (S$934 million) to the mainland over the years, mostly in the field of education. Many hospital and school buildings in Hong Kong are named after him.\n\nThe tycoon also ran the so-called Shaw Prize, sometimes referred to as Asia's answer to the Nobel Prize, which rewards excellence in math, astronomy and science, with a monetary prize of US$1 million for each laureate.\n\nHe was knighted by Britain's Queen Elizabeth in 1977 and received the Grand Bauhinia Medal from the Hong Kong government in 1998.\n\nPopularly known as \"Luk Suk\" or \"Sixth Uncle\", Mr Shaw was born in 1907, the sixth child of a well-to-do family in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo.\n\nHe married twice. His first wife died in 1987. He is survived by his current wife, Mona Fong, two sons and two daughters. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

And the top bid was just 0.45 per cent from the next highest offer of $380.08 psf ppr by a joint venture between City Developments and TID.\n\nMost market watchers declared the outcome as a reflection of developers' confidence that demand for ECs would remain strong. However, some pointed to a wider gap between the top and lowest bids at yesterday's tender compared with the previous EC land tender last July. This could mean a bigger divergence in developers' take on this public-private housing hybrid.\n\n\"While the top few bids were more optimistic, the bottom half of the bids were generally cautious and below expectations,\" said Jones Lang LaSalle national director Ong Teck Hui.\n\nPerhaps some developers were just taking the opportunity to try some bottom-fishing at yesterday's tender for the site in Westwood Avenue.\n\nSituated next to the Pan Island Expressway, the 520,945 square foot land parcel is opposite the Cleantech Park.\n\nEffective Dec 10, a 30 per cent mortgage servicing ratio cap was introduced on housing loans for those buying EC units directly from developers.\n\nAlso, the future project on the Westwood Avenue plot will be the first in recent times where second-timer applicants (that is, HDB upgraders) will have to pay the Housing Board a resale levy of up to $50,000, notes SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak.\n\nThe 12 bids at yesterday's tender were lower than the 16 that a more choice plot in Yuan Ching Road near Jurong Country Club fetched last July. The $419 psf ppr winning bid for that site also set a fresh high for EC land.\n\nR'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng told BT he had clipped his prediction on the top bid for the Westwood Avenue site to $340-380 psf ppr following last month's rule changes, from $360-390 psf ppr initially.\n\nWhen contacted, Francis Koh, managing director and group CEO of Koh Brothers Group, said: \"We lowered our land bid slightly. If awarded the site, we plan to build a project with about 480 units.\"\n\nWhen launched next year, the project will be \"priced to sell\".\n\n\"ECs will remain a very popular option for HDB upgraders - despite the recent measures. In line with a healthy living theme, we plan to promote a cycling community by having bicycle parking facilities and a cycling track within the development,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nAnalysts estimate that the top bid reflects a breakeven cost of about $750 psf, and assuming a 10 per cent profit margin, the target selling price could be around $820-830 psf.\n\nJLL's Mr Ong noted that at the last EC tender in July 2013, the lowest bid for the three sites (Yuan Ching Road, Punggol Central and Punggol Drive) was $295 psf ppr, while the range of bottom to top bids was quite narrow, at 16 to 29 per cent.\n\n\"In this tender, five of the 12 bids were below $300 psf ppr and the gap between bottom and top bid is 111 per cent.\"\n\nAt yesterday's tender, Fantasia Investment (Singapore), believed to be a unit of Hong Kong-listed Fantasia Holdings Group, bid $347.06 psf ppr.\n\nA partnership involving Singhaiyi unit Phoenix 88, Maxdin Pte Ltd and LMG Realty (part of Lee Metal Group) offered $335.71 psf ppr. SL (Serangoon), controlled by Douglas Ong Pang Chye, bid $333.62 psf ppr. UOL offered $316.73 psf ppr and MCL Land, $312.89 psf ppr. Amara Holdings unit TTH Development joined forces with EL Development for a $270.85 psf ppr bid.\n\nEvia Real Estate, Ho Lee Group and CNH Investment teamed up for a $261.81 psf ppr bid.\n\nAlso participating at the tender were Wee Hur Development ($254.59 psf ppr) and a joint-venture involving Hoi Hup Realty, Sunway Developments and Oriental Worldwide Investments ($243.79 psf ppr). Sim Lian Land placed the lowest bid - $180.06 psf ppr.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Shanghai Port achieved a throughput of 33.6 million TEUs last year, up 3.4 per cent from the 32.5 million in 2012, Xinhua News Agency reported, citing official statistics.\n\nSpeaking at the Singapore Maritime Foundation's (SMF) reception yesterday, Minister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew said he was heartened by the growth figures of the maritime sector in the face of high energy costs, overcapacity and weak global economic conditions.\n\nAnthonie Versluis, managing partner of Roland Berger Strategy Consultants in Malaysia, said the slump in container shipping stemmed mainly from oversupply, which shows no sign of abating, as well as a drop in demand from the European and North American markets.\n\nThat said, Singapore's growth in container volume for 2013 was in line with global container volume growth of 3.3 per cent, he noted.\n\nHe said growth in container throughput last year was driven by an increase in European demand for Asian goods in the second and third quarters of the year, and expects Singapore to benefit from this trend as an important transhipment hub for the Europe-East Asia shipping route.\n\nAlong with tankers, containerships boosted Singapore's annual vessel arrival tonnage by 3.2 per cent last year to 2.33 billion gross tonnage (GT). This helped Singapore maintain its position as one of the world's busiest port in terms of vessel arrival tonnage.\n\nMr Versluis said the increases in vessel arrival tonnage were in line with the deployment of bigger vessels, and he expects further increases in vessel arrival tonnage once the P3 alliance is launched.\n\nThe latter is an alliance on the major East-West trades between three shipping liners - Maersk Line, Mediterranean Shipping and CMA CGM - which is expected to be launched in the second half of this year.\n\nThe Business Times earlier reported that shipping companies were turning to larger vessels and forming alliances to achieve economies of scale and cost efficiency.\n\nSounding a note of optimism, Mr Versluis expects global container volume to grow around 4 per cent this year, based on global economic growth projections of 3.5 per cent by Morgan Stanley.\n\nMr Lui was cautiously optimistic. He said: \"On the back of rising economic optimism, many of us in the shipping world are adopting a cautious outlook for 2014.\n\n\"Shipping companies, however, will need to continue repositioning themselves to stay competitive, and closely manage costs, excess tonnage, manpower constraints and higher environmental standards.\"\n\nSingapore remained the world's top bunkering port in 2013, with more than 42.5 million tonnes in total bunker sales, down a touch from the 42.7 million tonnes in 2012.\n\nMPA's advance estimates also showed that total cargo tonnage handled last year rose 3.6 per cent to 557.5 million tonnes.\n\nTotal tonnage of ships under the Singapore Registry of Ships grew 13.2 per cent to 8.6 million GT, placing Singapore among the world's top 10 ship registries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue increased 48.5 per cent from 203 million yuan a year ago to 301 million yuan.\n\nAnalysts said that by bagging lucrative high-margin contracts for high-speed train cars, Midas can be expected to recover this year from the deadly 2011 Wenzhou high-speed train crash that sent the industry into a slump.\n\nLast month, DBS Group Research analyst Paul Yong, in a \"buy\" call, cited the firm's robust metro and overseas orders, together with potentially large high-speed rail orders.\n\nHe had assumed order wins of 400 million yuan in metro projects, 300 to 400 million yuan in overseas contracts a year over the next two years, as well as a billion yuan worth of high-speed contracts to be delivered until 2015.\n\nBased on a price-to-book multiple of 1.2 times this year's forecasted book value, he derived a target price of 64 cents, up from 60 cents previously.\n\n\"We believe current valuations are attractive for a stock whose earnings are poised for a strong rebound in 2014 and 2015,\" he said.\n\nMidas closed at 50.5 cents yesterday, up half a cent or one per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Effective rents, the amount after any landlord concessions, increased from US$22.98 a year earlier, the New York-based research firm said.\n\nSluggish employment growth has translated into a modest rebound in the office market during the past four years. Technology, energy and media companies have led leasing, helping to lift property values in select cities including New York, San Francisco and Houston.\n\n\"Until the growth rate in high-wage, high-skill jobs that require office space accelerates, expect slack demand for existing inventory to be the norm,\" Ryan Severino, senior economist at Reis, said in the report.\n\nOccupied space rose by a net 8.52 million square feet (791,600 square meters) in the fourth quarter, about even with the amount of new offices built during the period, Reis said. That helped keep the national vacancy rate at a four-year low of 16.9 per cent, unchanged from the third quarter and down from 17.1 per cent a year earlier.\n\nNew York and Washington had the country's lowest vacancy rates, at about 10 per cent, while Boston, Dallas and San Jose, California, had the largest rent increases from the third quarter, according to Reis.\n\nThe firm estimates effective rents will rise 3.4 per cent next year, following a 2.2 per cent increase last year.\n\nBlackstone Group, one of the biggest US office landlords since its 2007 purchase of Equity Office Properties Trust, has sold about US$5 billion of office assets during the past year to take advantage of the recovery, a person with knowledge of the transactions said. The firm plans to list 225 Franklin St in Boston for sale this quarter, said the person, who asked not to be named because the matter is private.\n\nPeter Rose, a spokesman for New York-based Blackstone, declined to comment on the company's plans.\n\nThe fourth quarter's net leasing gain of 8.52 million square feet was up from 3.11 million square feet a year earlier and 7.64 million in the third quarter, according to Reis.\n\nCompletions of new office space totalled 9.13 million square feet, up from 3.6 million square feet a year earlier and 6.3 million square feet in the third quarter, the firm said.\n\nOffice construction is rising from a low in 2012, when developers delivered 12.3 million square feet of space, the smallest in Reis records going back 15 years. For 2013 as a whole, developers completed 25.9 million square feet. In 2008, before the industry slump, completions averaged 16.4 million square feet a quarter. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7248e2fcdac3900446f7d882cfe2859f22c2b8b929f6d1a9b77b2358b0c202a9?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "In demand: New York and Washington had the lowest vacancy rates, at about 10 per cent, while Boston, Dallas and San Jose, California, had the largest rent increases from the third quarter. - PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/yellens-job-unlikely-be-easy", "site_title": "Yellen's job unlikely to be easy", "publish_date": null, "content": "Yellen's job unlikely to be easy\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jan 7, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSTEPPING into the shoes of an outgoing leader who commanded significant respect and who achieved unparalleled success is a hugely daunting and difficult task - just ask new Manchester United manager David Moyes whose first few months as Sir Alex Ferguson's replacement have been unspectacular, to say the least. So it will be for Janet Yellen who was confirmed as the new chair of the United States Federal Reserve on Monday, replacing the outgoing Ben Bernanke.\n\nLike Mr Ferguson, who is English football's most successful manager with 38 major trophies for Man United, Mr Bernanke's accomplishments are unprecedented in history. He expanded the Fed's balance sheet by almost US$4 trillion, staved off a Great Depression and brought the economy to the point where it looks like it will soon be able to fend for itself without the financial crutch of the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) money printing programme.\n\nMoreover, like Mr Ferguson and his replacement Mr Moyes, Ms Yellen comes from a similar background and shares the same economic convictions as Mr Bernanke. That this is important to markets which have grown used to large financial handouts under Mr Bernanke was clearly demonstrated in November last year when the hawkish Lawrence Summers, who was President Obama's first choice to head the Fed, withdrew and left the way clear for the dovish Ms Yellen. In response, markets around the globe surged in celebration because it meant the money printing would continue.\n\nBut as Mr Moyes has discovered to his dismay - as well as that of millions of fans of Manchester United worldwide - having appropriate credentials, backgrounds and beliefs is one thing, but keeping the ball rolling smoothly is another. Results have been poor, the team is floundering and there is now tremendous pressure on Mr Moyes to turn things around quickly. You'd have to wonder - will Ms Yellen encounter similar difficulties? If so, what might they be?\n\nMany experts believe Ms Yellen will seamlessly assume control of the Fed on Feb 1 and pick up where Mr Bernanke left off. If so, then her biggest challenge will be deciding when to taper QE and how to communicate the Fed's tapering schedule to markets. In other words, continuing Mr Bernanke's work and ensuring markets are kept up to date on the Fed's thinking.\n\nFew, however, have spoken of the bubble that is Wall Street as being a threat, partly because Ms Yellen herself in November said there is no bubble in stock prices and that valuations are reasonable. As a result, the vast majority of investment houses have recommended a \"buy\" on US stocks.\n\nIn our view, this is dangerous complacency, the belief that a stock market that rose to 51 all-time highs last year as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average (44 if the S&P 500 is used) and one that is almost 200 per cent off its 2008 lows is still a \"buy\", and will continue to rise because interest rates will remain low, because the money printing will still continue although at US$75 billion per month instead of US$85 billion, and because there is a flickering recovery on the horizon.\n\nAs most investors would know, valuations and what is reasonable, reside in the realm of the sentiment-driven investor, and this can change overnight. Price-earnings (PE) ratios, price/book values and more sophisticated metrics like the Schiller PE are all based on forecasts of a largely unknowable future, so what is cheap today could suddenly become expensive tomorrow - especially since the S&P 500 has not had a 10 per cent correction since Oct 2011.\n\nFurthermore, critics of the Fed's QE still believe that it hasn't really worked as advertised, and that it has merely created hot money that has pumped up markets and not the real economy, and that what awaits Ms Yellen is not recovery but severe inflation.\n\nIf this view proves correct and if Wall Street today is rising really because of an improving economic outlook and not because of relief that QE will only be tapered minimally, then it would be disastrous if the US economy backslides since this would force the Fed to backtrack and ratchet up QE instead of tapering it.\n\nLike Mr Moyes over in England, Ms Yellen will have her work cut out for her.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economists now say the effects are waning and expect the slowdown to continue in the first quarter of this year as Beijing has to deal with slower demand overseas and tighter credit conditions at home imposed by the central bank keen to end lax lending over the past decade which has led to overcapacity in all sectors of the economy.\n\nFurthermore, the new administration led by Xi Jinping has made reform of the economy to a more sustainable model a priority which will in the short term lead to slower growth rates.\n\nOverall, the PMI surveys show that conditions are worsening for small and medium-sized businesses which are bigger contributors to growth than their state-owned counterparts, but which benefit from looser credit conditions.\n\n\"The PMI should dispel any lingering doubts that the economic rebound since late summer has run its course,\" Capital Economics senior economist Mark Williams said in a note.\n\nA breakdown of the figures published yesterday show that the HSBC services PMI's sub-index measuring new business orders dropped to a six-month low of 51.8 in December on subdued client demand.\n\nHowever, labour market conditions improved for the fourth consecutive month, with the employment sub-index growing at the strongest pace since June, mainly due to company expansions.\n\n\"We expect the steady expansion of manufacturing sectors to lend support to service sector growth,\" said HSBC's China chief economist, Qu Hongbin, in a statement.\n\n\"Moreover, the implementation of reforms such as lowering the entry barriers for private business in service sectors and expanded VAT reforms should help to revitalise service sectors in the year ahead,\" he added.\n\nThe HSBC/Markit PMI covers smaller private firms than the official one, which is more weighted towards bigger state-owned enterprises that can weather slowdowns better.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Spring Airlines already operates international routes linking Shanghai to Ibaraki, Takamatsu and Saga airports, and its expansion is intended to attract more Chinese customers by facilitating easier flight connections for them in Japan.\n\nAs at December, there were 12 overseas LCCs operating international flights to Japan, and most were based in Asian countries, with each airline aggressively increasing their routes. Cebu Pacific Air in the Philippines increased flights linking Kansai Airport with Manila in December, and AirAsia X in Malaysia will start flights connecting Chubu Airport with Kuala Lumpur in March.\n\nAs it has been only a year and a half since domestic LCCs began operations, the LCC market in Japan is expected to grow.\n\nIn terms of transportation capacity, in which the number of seats is multiplied by flight distances, the LCC share of the Japanese market is only 3 per cent. This is compared to a 52 per cent share in South-east Asia and a 39 per cent share in western Europe.\n\nDomestic LCCs plan to open new routes in response to overseas LCCs' expansion. Peach Aviation will begin flights linking Kansai Airport with Kaohsiung, Taiwan, this month. Vanilla Air, formerly called AirAsia Japan and which started operation on Dec 20, will open a route linking Narita Airport with Seoul in March.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by the Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry targeting about 1,300 LCC users in September, more than 60 per cent said their use of LCCs increased due to the launch of LCC services. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/sharing-economy-versus-regulators", "site_title": "The 'sharing economy' versus the regulators", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe 'sharing economy' versus the regulators\n\nUS startups seen thriving in grey areas of tax, rules\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSELFISH behaviour will propel America's sharing economy. New match-making business models are thriving in large part by forging into grey areas of tax and regulation. As a result, fast-growing start-ups, such as Uber, Airbnb and Lending Club, face growing scrutiny from authorities. Like Amazon before them, though, self-interest should inspire some canny manoeuvring from these socialism-peddling capitalists.\n\nFinancially hard times and mobile technology enabled peer-to-peer options to proliferate. Citywide bicycle-sharing schemes in New York, London and beyond, along with operations such as communal Zipcar auto rentals, helped shift attitudes about ownership. Consumers are turning their homes into hotels, swapping clothes and meals with strangers, kennelling dogs, and making their cars available for hire. Often, there's even extra cash to earn.\n\nSuch businesses generally can't operate without breaking rules, however, even if some of the regulations are antiquated or simply designed to entrench incumbent operators. For example, Hailo, an app for hailing London's black cabs, charges a minimum rate in defiance of transport guidelines. Food sharers such as Mealku may run afoul of health standards. Many state regulators in the US have yet to sign off fully on institutions that directly match borrowers and lenders. Insurance-related questions remain open for ride-sharing options such as RelayRides.\n\nAs devout believers in the power of the network effect, founders and their financial backers know they can't sit around and wait for elected officials to respond. While many new sharing ventures are trying to negotiate new rules, lawmakers aren't sitting still. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman targeted Airbnb, a home-rental service privately valued at around US$2.5 billion, to see if users were skirting hotel taxes. Some cities worry such lodging arrangements fall foul of public safety and fire prevention rules.\n\nIn many ways, though, the backers of the sharing economy's emerging players can take comfort from Amazon's experience. The online retailer established a price advantage early on by carefully avoiding, and fighting, the collection of sales taxes. Only now, two decades after its founding, is it relenting on the issue. And the business it created over that period is now worth some US$175 billion of market value.\n\nYounger entrepreneurs are trying new crafty tactics, too. Airbnb touted a study that purported to show the firm generated more than US$600 million in economic activity in the Big Apple. Meanwhile, a budding trade group called Peers bills itself as a \"grassroots\" organisation that supports the sharing \"movement\" by advocating for \"smart regulation\". As it happens, Peers was founded by an Airbnb executive and its board includes a founding partner of the Collaborative Fund, an early-stage investment firm devoted to this burgeoning segment of the economy.\n\nWhat's clear is that the technology whizzes behind many of these operations can probably outrun most politicians and watchdogs for a while. And despite the feel-good connotation of their sharing sobriquet, they are also sufficiently cutthroat.\n\nTake Uber, a US$3.5 billion mobile-based taxi service, which suavely propagates a cuddly image with marketing events that allow customers to summon ice-cream trucks and kitten deliveries. The firm, however, also has been sued by multiple taxi and livery companies, encountered resistance by some city officials and even faced a strike in Boston. Yet earlier this year it was Uber founder Travis Kalanick who accused rival Lyft of \"regulatory arbitrage\". In the end, these sharers will look out mainly for themselves.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/buyback-activity-2013-hits-3-year-low", "site_title": "Buyback activity in 2013 hits 3-year low", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBuyback activity in 2013 hits 3-year low\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 5, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSINGAPORE Exchange buyback activity fell to its lowest level in three years with 69 companies recording 1,068 filings worth $451 million in 2013 - sharply down from 2012 (98 firms, 1,521 filings, $719 million) and 2011 (96 companies, 1,730 filings, $1.06 billion). Buyback totals were also lower than the yearly averages of 82 firms, 1,252 filings and $685 million from 2007 to 2012. Firms got off to a very slow start in 2013 with 176 filings worth $99 million in Q1. The activity picked up with 324 filings worth $162 million in Q2 and 332 filings worth $101 million in Q3 - but dipped sharply in Q4 (only 236 filings worth $89 million).\n\nShare buyback totals 1999-2013\n\nPerformance-wise, 41 companies or 59 per cent of the total number of firms buying back shares in 2013 recorded an average gain of 17 per cent from their mean buyback prices - 26 firms or 38 per cent of the total saw their share prices drop by an average of 10 per cent in 2013. Overall, firms repurchasing shares last year saw their share prices rise by an average of 6.2 per cent from their average buyback prices. Viking Offshore & Marine's share price more than doubled from its buyback price in 2013.\n\nBuybacks are not used by listed firms to drive share prices up but as a means of price support in a fast falling market. Firms buying back shares last year accounted for an average of 6 per cent of their stocks' trading volume in 2013. A total of 20 companies provided strong price support with their repurchases accounting for 5 per cent to 55 per cent of their stocks' trading volume last year. The price support paid off as their share prices held steady and also rose by an average of 1.6 per cent from their mean buyback prices in 2013. Although small, the average price increase by firms with heavy trading volume easily beat the STI's paltry gain of 0.01 per cent in 2013.\n\nWhile heavy trading by volume resulted in respectable price gains for several firms last year, companies that bought back consistently over a period of several months saw their share prices close even higher in 2013. A total of 23 companies recorded buybacks from 4 to 11 months in 2013. They recorded 824 filings or 77 per cent of the total number of buyback notices last year and their trades accounted for an average of 9.2 per cent of their stocks' trading volume. The consistent and heavy repurchase activity paid off - their shares ended 2013 up by an average of 4.2 per cent from their mean purchase prices.\n\nTop 10 buybacks by value in 2013\n\nEight out of the top 10 firms that bought back the most shares in terms of value in 2013 saw their share prices closing higher from their average buyback prices at the end of the year with an average gain of 6.3 per cent. The top gainer among this group was edible oil and fats producer Indofood Agri Resources with the stock closing 12.4 per cent up from the average buyback price in 2013. It timed the repurchases well, embarking on a three-month buying spree after the stock fell from $1.40 in January to a low of 73 cents in August, picking up 17 million shares worth $13.4 million from August to October 2013 at an average of 78.7 cents each. The stock closed higher from their buyback prices to 88 cents on Friday.\n\nThe top buyer in terms of number of filings and value in 2013 is Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp with 120 notices worth $150.4 million. It bought back 14.46 million shares in nine separate months (Feb-Oct 2013) at $9.84 to $11.19 each or an average of $10.40 each. The buybacks accounted for 1.5 per cent of the stock's trading volume. Despite the consistent repurchases, the counter closed 1.9 per cent down from the group's average buyback price in 2013. The stock closed at $10.02 on Friday.\n\nThe second top buyer was Ho Bee Land with 50 filings worth $42.8 million. It bought back 22.3 million shares worth $42.8 million in seven separate months (Jan-Dec 2013) at $1.78 to $2.12 each. The buybacks also accounted for more than 16 per cent of the stock's trading volume. The heavy and persistent repurchases by the group paid off as the stock closed 10 per cent up from their average buyback price in 2013. Interestingly, Ho Bee Land intensified its buyback activity after the stock shot past $2.00 with 4.4 million shares purchased (Nov 22 to Dec 31, 2013) at an average of $2.05 each. It bought back shares in 20 out of the 26 trading days in that period. The buybacks in the past two months bode well for shareholders as the stock rose by an average of 6.4 per cent six months after the firm bought back shares based on 310 filings from 2001 to June 2013. The counter recorded a price gain six months later on 57 per cent of those repurchases. Ho Bee Land shares closed at $2.09 on Friday.\n\nTop ten price gains\n\nThe top ten performers in terms of price gains in 2013 posted increases of 27 per cent to 103 per cent from their average buyback prices with an average gain of 45 per cent. Among the top performers is restaurant, cafe and kiosk operator Sakae Holdings with 2.5 million shares purchased from May to June 2013 at an average of 36 cents each. Those were the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in 2003 on SGX Sesdaq and in 2008 on SGX Mainboard. The group recorded 13 separate filings during that two-month period at prices ranging from 31 cents to 41 cents each. The trades also accounted for more than 10 per cent of the stock's trading volume. The buybacks paid off as the stock closed 44 per cent up from the group's buyback price in 2013 and has remained steady, closing at 50 cents when last traded.\n\nTop 10 price falls\n\nWhile firms that posted gains from their average buyback prices will draw investors' attention, stocks that fell sharply from listed firms' purchase prices last year should not be overlooked as they may pose significant upside heading into 2014.\n\nThe worse performers in 2013 recorded price falls from their average purchase prices of 10 per cent to 34 per cent with an average drop of 20 per cent.\n\nStocks trading below companies' buyback prices may indicate some upside as listed firms normally buy back when their shares are trading below their putative net asset value. Stocks that underperformed from a buybacks standpoint may also pose less risk for investors as companies that buy back are normally cash rich and debt free.\n\nAmong the stocks worth noting is Del Monte Pacific, whose shares closed20 per cent lower from their average buyback prices in 2013. It acquired 3.55 million shares from February to May 2013 at an average of 76 cents each. Aside from the buybacks, two directors bought heavily in the latter part of 2013 with non-executive chairman Rolando Gapud and executive director Egardo Cruz picking up nearly two million shares from Dec 11 to 23, 2013, at an average of 62 cents each.\n\nThe directors' purchase price was sharply lower than the group's average buyback price of 76 cents. The buybacks and director purchases in Del Monte Pacific indicate strongly that the stock is undervalued at the closing price on Friday of 60 cents.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Ltd\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This makes up about 40 per cent of an expected pipeline of some 49.1 million sq ft by 2017.\n\nThat said, DTZ estimates that 60 per cent of the supply this year will be owner-occupied or already have committed tenants.\n\n\"Taking into consideration the expected growth in the manufacturing and externally orientated industries and the moderate supply of available space, rents across all industrial space are projected to move upwards in 2014,\" the report said.\n\nThe rise in rentals in Q4 last year contrasted with the lacklustre sales volume and price performance by industrial property in the second half of last year.\n\nTransaction volumes for strata-titled factories for the whole of last year stood at 2,181 units, just over half the number from a year ago.\n\nCapital values for first- and upper-storey conventional industrial space stayed flat at $627 psf and $470 psf in H2 2013.\n\nDTZ attributed this to the combined impact from a seller's stamp duty introduced last January and a total debt servicing ratio put in place in late June.\n\nThe slowdown in industrial activity last year was also contributed to by a restraint in supply, said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ.\n\n\"The release of smaller sites of (shorter) tenure on the Government Land Sales programme, as well as mandating the minimum size of units, have not only limited the amount of new strata-titled industrial units on the market but also helped confer affordability on industrial land in Singapore, and brought about stability in industrial prices.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the fact that the yen has plummeted to a five-year low against the dollar and slumped also against other leading currencies has not gone unnoticed elsewhere.\n\nJapan's economic policies (Abenomics) are \"essentially based on aggressive quantitative monetary easing, sustained high levels of government spending and a beggar-thy neighbour devaluation strategy\", former Goldman Sachs (Asia) vice-president Kenneth Courtis told BT.\n\nAnother criticism levelled by some BOJ officials in private against Mr Kuroda, a former senior Japanese finance ministry official, is that he has allowed the Japanese central bank to be drawn much more closely into the orbit of the ministry, to a point where central bank independence is threatened.\n\nBut the former president of the Asian Development Bank stepped into the role of governor at a time when Mr Abe, who had newly assumed office a year ago, was threatening to revise the Bank of Japan Law in ways that would diminish its power unless it cooperated more closely with the government.\n\nMr Kuroda is nevertheless a fervent disciple of monetary easing. \"Not only from an exchange rate point of view but also because of deflation. Japan has been the only country in the world to have deflation over the past 15 years,\" he told BT shortly before his appointment.\n\n\"I think this is really unusual and this situation must be stopped,\" he said, adding that Japan was caught in \"a vicious circle of deflation and yen appreciation\".\n\nJapan was, in fact, one of the first countries in the world to engage in so-called \"quantitative and qualitative easing\" (QQE) ahead of the US Federal Reserve, after Japan suffered a banking crisis a decade or so ago and when conventional money easing was impossible as interest rates had fallen to zero.\n\nBut Mr Kuroda has pushed that policy much more aggressively since he assumed office, pledging to achieve 2 per cent annual consumer price inflation within two years from last April, by doubling the size of Japan's monetary base and by means of buying up financial assets on a massive scale.\n\nHe has pledged in effect to do \"whatever it takes\" by having the BOJ print unlimited quantities of money - a target demanded by Mr Abe at the time he came to office. The BOJ has been too slow and too miserly in expanding its balance sheet as a means to counter deflation, Mr Kuroda told BT then.\n\n\"We are halfway on the road to overcoming the longstanding deflation, and the remaining path may be a bumpy one,\" The Banker quoted him as saying last week. \"We will continue to make our utmost efforts in 2014 and after to achieve the BOJ's price stability target of 2 per cent.\"\n\nMr Kuroda has insisted that it is \"too soon\" yet for the BOJ to consider an exit policy from aggressive monetary easing, even though the US Fed has begun its unwinding amid fears that this could cause disruption in international financial markets.\n\nThe BOJ's actions have drawn support from economists such as Adam Posen, president of the Petersen Institute of International Economics in Washington and formerly a member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee.\n\n\"Deflation is 'sticky',\" Mr Posen told BT at the time of Mr Kuroda's appointment. \"The idea that you get into a trap and it is difficult to get out has some legitimacy.\"\n\n\"You really do alter people's mindset and behaviour once deflation sets in and is allowed to persist. It affects forms of bargaining, pricing, ways of thinking about wages and so on.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So when you look at our retail business, it looks small as a percentage of our total,\" he tells The Business Times in an exclusive interview at his office.\n\n\"But any retail operator in the world would like to have those kinds of numbers, and this is a secondary business for us,\" he adds.\n\nStill, Mr Tracy, who remains very optimistic about the growth prospects of Macau's economy and of China as a whole, knows that what goes up must eventually come down one day.\n\n\"I'm not a guy who believes that anything can go on forever. I start to get vertigo at some point. I believe that there will always be plateaus,\" he says.\n\nWhich is why the 60-year-old American has been busy hedging his bets ever since he took over the top job at Sands China more than three years ago.\n\nThe Venetian, Macau's largest integrated resort, has hosted concerts featuring the likes of Alicia Keys, boxing matches involving world champion Manny Pacquiao and numerous international TV awards shows.\n\nThis March, the Rolling Stones band will perform a one-night-only show at what will likely be a full house at Venetian's Cotai Arena.\n\nMr Tracy says that it is crucial to have enough entertainment options - both gaming and non-gaming - to cater to each market segment, be it the VIP customers, the premium mass market, families or business travellers.\n\n\"You have to have product offerings in all your businesses - gaming, entertainment, restaurants, retail - that are attractive to them,\" he says. \"It's things that they want, at prices that they find attractive, and it must be convenient for them too.\"\n\nHe remains well aware that it is because of the staggering gaming revenue in Macau that makes most, if not all of these, possible.\n\n\"At the end of the day, everyone knows that the casinos are the tail that wags the dog. But that shouldn't stop us from trying to do what we are doing, which is to diversify the tourist product,\" he says.\n\nHis main target audience? The Chinese market of 1.3 billion people with a rising wealth class, a market that Sands China has managed just a one per cent penetration rate so far.\n\n\"What if this went to 2 per cent, or 3? And it will, over a period of time,\" says Mr Tracy. \"Most other markets are either in stagnation or seeing a slight dip, but it doesn't happen here in Macau.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Pittsburgh could see temperatures about minus 24 degree Celsius by early tomorrow.\n\nTemperatures were forecast to fall to 30 below in parts of the north central United States early yesterday morning, and in Grand Forks, North Dakota, wind chills were expected to exceed 50 below. \"You grin and bear it and bundle up,\" said Rachel Osowski, a clerk at Hugo's Supermarket in Grand Forks. \"You have to survive and function, you can't let the weather stop you.\"\n\nIn such conditions, frostbite can set in on exposed skin within five minutes, forecasters warned.\n\nPreparing for the dangerous weather, officials in several states have asked residents to take extra precautions when outdoors.\n\nOfficials in Kentucky, which could see up to 20 centimetres of snow and freezing temperatures, were warning people to avoid road travel and stay indoors. \"If you don't need to be out, stay in, stay home,\" said Buddy Rogers, spokesman for Kentucky Emergency Management.\n\nThe storm comes on the heels of a massive weather system that slammed the US Midwest and Northeast just after New Year's Day, causing several deaths, grounding thousands of flights and forcing schools and government offices to close.\n\nA total of 1,266 flights were cancelled across the US and 6,036 flights delayed on Saturday, with Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey among the worst affected, according to tracking firm\n\nFlightAware.com\n\n.\n\nWith the new frigid air moving in, a National Football League wild card playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco 49ers yesterday at Green Bay's Lambeau Field was expected to rank among the coldest matches on record, local officials said.\n\nHigh-tech equipment, vigilant medical care and perhaps even chicken soup will be on tap to combat the Arctic conditions, Matthew Matava, head team doctor for the St Louis Rams and president of the National Football League Physicians Society, told Reuters.\n\n\"A lot of sidelines will have warm chicken broth available. It tastes good, it's going to be warm and help warm them internally. It contains electrolytes and the sodium chloride helps replenish electrolytes you lose in sweat,\" Dr Matava said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

In line with latest trends, we have decided to outsource our stock-picking abilities - to chance.\n\nIntroducing the BT Random Fund - the latest long-only, passive-aggressive, unknown-volatility, maximum-risk fund in the market with a starting net asset value of $1 million and a lock-up period of one year. Zero management and performance fees. Promise.\n\nThe 10 stocks we hold are in the table, hypothetically bought on the last traded price of the last trading day of 2013, using $100,000 for each stock.\n\nWe chose them for their high returns on invested capital, recession-proof cashflow generating ability, low debt, prudent and forward-looking management, brand-name endurance, strong corporate governance, sustainable business practices and a distinguished history of delivering maximum shareholder returns.\n\nJust kidding.\n\nWhat we actually did was to get a list from the Bloomberg machine of the 781 Singapore-traded stocks in its database, and used Excel to randomly select 10 stocks from that list. We got two exchange-traded funds on the first cut and replaced those with two more random picks.\n\nThe picks\n\nThe resulting 10 surprised us in some ways.\n\nInstead of 10 illiquid, loss-making S-chips, we got a decent number of profitable names spanning the financial services, oil and gas, shipping, electronics and industrial sectors - a good sampling of the Singapore market. Nine in 10 paid dividends last year.\n\nOCBC Bank needs no introduction, heading the list as the only large-cap, Straits Times Index (STI) component. Another financial services firm in our list is Malacca Trust, an Indonesia-based consumer finance, asset management, brokerage and insurance group.\n\nThree companies deal with ships. Nam Cheong makes offshore support vessels for oil and gas exploration purposes. It is the second-largest stock in our list. Interestingly, it is rated a \"buy\" by all nine analysts covering it, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRickmers Maritime is a business trust that owns and operates container ships, with a 10 per cent historical dividend yield. Also in the shipping business is Singapore Shipping Corporation. Its profits have increased in the past few years amid a downturn in the industry.\n\nTwo companies are in the electronics sector. PCI Limited is an electronics manufacturer that has been listed in Singapore since 1992. Earnings plunged for its 2013 financial year amid weak global demand. Meanwhile, AEI Corp makes aluminium parts mainly for the electronics and precision engineering industry.\n\nChina-based Southern Packaging Group makes plastic packaging for customers in the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and personal care industries. It is trading at two-fifths of its net asset value.\n\nTwo illiquid, loss-making micro-caps round up our portfolio. Health supplement distributor Jacks International owns the Nature's Farm chain here.\n\nCraft Print International, a Catalist-listed printing firm, has reported losses for seven years in a row. Blame the computer for that one.\n\nRationale\n\nWhy are we doing this? And why randomly pick 10 stocks? This is, firstly, an experiment, though not a very rigorous one.\n\nSome people think the stock market is nothing more than a lottery. Others theorise that in an alternate universe where a group of monkeys has an infinite amount of time to hit keys on a typewriter, one particularly literary monkey will accidentally type out the complete works of William Shakespeare.\n\nPerhaps a collection of 10 random stocks will similarly have a chance of making money. Perhaps our fund will fall flat on its face.\n\nBut given that a significant number of funds out in the market actually don't beat benchmark returns and just live off management fees, we thought it interesting to pit our imaginary horde of monkeys against the bevy of bespoke fund managers out there.\n\nWe selected 10 stocks because we wanted to avoid large fluctuations when we report our returns. The risk of a portfolio, defined by its standard deviation or how dramatically its returns vary day to day, drops very quickly as you add more stocks to it.\n\nAt a number closer to 30, the unsystemic risk of a portfolio is diversified away to effectively zero. That is, market-moving news specific to a company, like a CEO resigning or workers going on strike, will not affect the returns of the entire portfolio. What is left is systemic risk, such as the risk of a global financial crisis.\n\nThe upshot is, the more stocks in your portfolio, the more robustly protected you'll be against an individual screw-up. There's debate over whether 30 is too much or too little, and also how diversification can't be achieved by concentrating all picks in one market.\n\nIn any case, we'll stick with 10 stocks for now - about what an ordinary retail investor with a busy schedule can keep track of.\n\nThe 10 randomly picked stocks will stay in our portfolio for at least a year, before we do another run of randomly picked stocks.\n\nWe will run a piece once a month summarising the major changes in this fund, compare price returns against other funds and indices, highlight unusual happenings, and so on. We will take into account dividends paid when evaluating returns at the end of the year, as well as go with the majority on corporate actions.\n\nHopefully, this process might throw up interesting gems in the market which investors rarely hear of, companies which might be too small to have an impact on the Singapore market to be covered by the media or by broking house research.\n\nAt the very least, the BT Random Fund will be an alternative benchmark to measure your own performance against. And if you're an active fund manager and can't beat us, well, maybe you should be joining us.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

First, the Straits Times Index enjoyed a fair amount of year-end window-dressing in the final days of 2013, then it fell back once that support was withdrawn.\n\nWith no significant and genuine interest in blue chips, it's logical to assume speculative energies will turn to penny stocks and this is exactly what occurred - punters shed their concerns about the sector when top performers like HanKore, Vallianz and EMS Energy started to move in high volume, and jumped in.\n\nOver in the US, there was a relief rally following the December Federal Open Market Committee meeting when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke announced a US$10 billion cut to the monthly US$85 billion bond-buying programme known as QE3. Finally, after seven months of uncertainty over when exactly the cut (or taper if you prefer to use Mr Bernanke's preferred word) would occur, a rally suggested that Wall St might actually be reducing its reliance on free Fed money and focusing on fundamentals instead.\n\nHowever, this notion was nipped in the bud on Thursday, when a strong manufacturing report and jobless claims figures brought the sellers out, reminding investors that maybe the US market is still operating in the \"good economic news is bad for stocks\" mode that was in force for most of 2013.\n\nAs a result, the STI, which rose 113 points in eight consecutive sessions until the start of trading yesterday, plunged 43.18 points or 1.36 per cent to 3,131.47 in relatively light volume of 3.3 billion units worth $905 million yesterday. This compares with Tuesday's half-day haul of $1.2 billion, the last trading session of 2013 when window-dressing was most apparent.\n\nBrokers said that in addition to withdrawal of window-dressing support and an overnight slide on Wall Street, sentiment was also hurt by news that private property prices here have started to dip.\n\nAnother explanation for the loss suffered here and the 2.2 per cent loss in the Hang Seng Index yesterday was that China's manufacturing numbers on Thursday point to slower growth.\n\nMeanwhile, at various times last year, the penny segment was led by names such as SingHaiyi, MDR, Albedo and Innopac. For the past few weeks, the segment has been headed by Charisma Energy, HanKore and Otto Marine.\n\nOnce again, this should come as no surprise as traders say few positions in most penny stocks are ever held overnight, which suggests rapid rotational punting is the order of the day, punting which calls for positions to be closed out by the end of the day.\n\nRabobank in its daily notes yesterday looked at the US manufacturing numbers and said that together with US initial jobless claims at 339,000 versus 344,000 consensus, the picture at the start of 2014 seems to be of a strong manufacturing-led recovery across most major economies.\n\n\"That is extremely welcome, of course, but as the year ahead progresses, it will be important to try to ascertain where the fresh demand for this manufacturing output is stemming from: retail spending data in most OECD economies is still moderate at best while emerging markets (ex China) are seeing a decline in consumption on the whole, not an acceleration,\" said the bank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We continue to favour equities over bonds. In equities, we favour developed markets over emerging markets.\n\n\"In bonds, we favour corporate bonds over government bonds, and within corporate bonds, we favour high-yield over investment-grade.\"\n\nDBS' stance is in line with most other banks'.\n\nMr Lim believes that tapering, the major theme shaping financial markets since May 2013, is not to be feared. This is because the Fed's strategy to exit its bond-buying programme bodes well for the economy and has historically benefited equities.\n\nAs the Fed \"tapers\" this month and buys fewer long-term assets, causing demand for them to fall, prices will fall and bond yields will rise, raising the cost of borrowing.\n\nInvestors typically fear that higher interest rates will negatively affect stock prices, by inducing a drag on the economy and causing assets to be valued less due to a larger discount rate on future cash flows being used.\n\nBut they need not worry, Mr Lim said, pointing to history.\n\nWhile a higher US 10-year Treasury yield causes price-to-earnings multiples (PE ratios) on the S&P 500 to fall, there is still some way to go before yield increases start negatively affecting stock valuations. The 10-year Treasury yield is at 3 per cent now and it is not until after the 6 per cent mark that valuation multiples typically fall, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the equities risk premium - how much investors are willing to pay for stocks over bonds - is still high, meaning there is much more to be gained from stocks than bonds.\n\nAnother indicator is how the Fed's exit strategy for its bond-buying programme had caused the bond yield curve to steepen, with higher rates for longer-term bonds and lower rates for short-term bonds.\n\nMr Lim said: \"Historically, it is unusual for the US to have a recession and go into a bear market under these conditions.\"\n\nMore importantly, consumer confidence is recovering in the US along with corporate investment. And even though earnings multiples point to the US market trading at above historical averages, investors \"should not be overly obsessed\" with them, he said.\n\n\"Just because the market is cheap doesn't mean the bear market is over. Just because they are expensive doesn't mean the bull market is over. They tend to overshoot on both sides,\" he said, adding that price-to-book (PB) ratios, another valuation technique taking into account a company's net-asset value, are still below average.\n\nIn Europe, the picture is one of slow but significant improvement, he said. Primary balances, a measure of whether the government spends more than it gets in revenues, have improved from five years ago. Italy and Greece are even running primary balance surpluses now - although this measure does not include interest payments on debt.\n\nEurope stock valuations, at 14.9 times forward earnings, are no longer cheap. But they are still lower than the 15.3 times for Japan and 16.6 times for the US. Corporate earnings should catch up along with the US as a cyclical recovery takes hold, Mr Lim said.\n\nIn Japan, stocks are likely to continue to do well because the Bank of Japan's money printing will devalue the yen, stimulating the economy and improving inflation expectations. If the percentage of stocks held by Japanese households goes back to 2007 levels of 12 per cent, up from current levels of around 7 to 8 per cent, a 20 to 25 per cent rally in the Nikkei can still take place. \"There's a huge amount of cash out there,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nFor emerging markets, valuations are near lows. Observers have been urging investors to stick to countries with current-account surpluses, as they will be less affected by fund outflows as US long-term yields go up and US bonds become a more attractive proposition than local-currency stocks and bonds.\n\nChina, Russia, Malaysia, Singapore, Korea and Taiwan are examples of current-account surplus markets, favoured over deficit countries such as India, Indonesia and Brazil, Mr Lim said.\n\nChina's economic restructuring, positive in the medium term, might cause \"some discomfort\" and stocks might not go up in the near term, but valuations \"trudging along at a bottom\" signal opportunities, he added.\n\nThe most significant risk to Mr Lim's positive stock views are US corporate earnings growing less than expected, as higher costs cause profit margins to come down from cyclical highs.\n\n\"But that's not the central case,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Protesters have yet to reveal exactly what they will target, or for how long.\n\nThe crisis is similar to previous years, with the country polarised over the political dominance of Ms Yingluck's brother and former premier, Thaksin Shinawatra, 64, who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid a jail sentence.\n\nMany of Bangkok's middle classes, old-money elites and royalists are angered by the influence of a man they say is a corrupt crony capitalist who manipulated the poor with giveaways designed to win votes and entrench the power of his billionaire family and business friends.\n\nHowever, millions of poor in the north and northeast who benefited from cheap healthcare, micro-loans and generous subsidies hail Mr Thaksin as a hero and are willing to take to the streets to defend his government.\n\nThose supporters, better known as the \"red shirts\", held mass rallies in support of Mr Thaksin in 2010, which ended with the deaths of more than 90 people in military offensives to retake occupied sites in Bangkok.\n\nThe red shirts, who were instrumental in bringing Ms Yingluck to power in 2011, announced yesterday that they would enter the fray by holding rallies of their own outside the capital to protect democracy and counter those staged by the anti- government group.\n\n\"Red shirts will gather across the country to show the world who are the owners of sovereignty,\" said one of their leaders, Nattawut Saikuar, who is also deputy commerce minister. \"We want an election and we will go for it.\"\n\nThe prospect of rival groups gathering in large numbers does not bode well for Thailand and risks intensifying a crisis that in recent weeks has seen sporadic bouts of violence, including clashes between demonstrators and riot police and several deadly shootings by mystery gunmen.\n\nAnti-government demonstrators plan to march through Bangkok daily starting from tomorrow in a bid to re-energise supporters after the year-end break, before which more than 200,000 had rallied peacefully in the capital.\n\nPolitical concerns have had an impact on markets and the currency, mainly due to worries that the Feb 2 election called by Ms Yingluck to reduce tensions would have the opposite effect.\n\nBearish bets on the Thai baht are at their highest in nearly two years as the political crisis escalates, according to a Reuters poll released yesterday.\n\nAny postponement of the poll, which the Election Commission has asked for, could seriously impact policymaking and expose the government to more attacks and the possibility of military or judicial intervention, analysts say.\n\nMs Yingluck refuses to cave in and says a change of the poll date would be unconstitutional.

But some of the danger of a hundred years ago is present today.\n\nThe years before 1914 saw the formation of trade blocs separated by high tariff barriers. Back then, the world was dominated by several roughly equivalent powers, albeit with different strengths and weaknesses. Today, the world is similarly multi-polar. The United States is in a position of clear leadership, but China is coming up fast. Europe is weaker than it was, but is still a force to be reckoned with. Japan, Russia, Brazil, India are also too powerful to ignore.\n\nA hundred years ago, big international infrastructure projects such as the Berlin-Baghdad Railway, and before it the Suez Canal, were built to protect favoured trading. Today's equivalent may be the bilateral mining partnerships forged between, for instance, China and mineral- rich African states.\n\nToday, the World Trade Organization offers some defence against tariffs. But protectionism could become entrenched if prolonged economic stagnation leads countries to pursue their own narrow interests.\n\nGermany, Austria, Russia and France lost between 20 and 35 per cent of national output between 1913 and 1918, according to Angus Maddison's data used in Stephen Broadberry's The Economics of World War One: A Comparative Analysis. British GDP declined in 1914 and 1915, but grew 15 per cent over the four years, as did the US economy.\n\nThe 37 million military and civilian casualties may tell a more accurate story, but if history were to repeat itself, the global conflict could be both more universal and more destructive. Nuclear weapons proliferate. Warped diplomatic anger could lead to the deployment of chemical and biological devices. Electromagnetic pulses could wipe out our fragile electronic networks.\n\nLike the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand that sparked World War I, the catalyst for cataclysm might be something quite surprising. A global run on bank and other investment assets or an outbreak of hyperinflation, maybe? These threats get more serious the more policymakers pump up equity, bond, property and banking bubbles. If global wealth evaporates, or is proven to be an illusion, today's largely cordial global entente could be smashed with precipitous speed.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Mr Gandhi has \"outstanding credentials\", he said, adding that top opposition candidate Narendra Modi \"would be disastrous for the country\" and that he had presided over a \"mass massacre\" of citizens in his state of Gujarat.\n\nMr Singh's successor will inherit an economy with the fastest inflation in Asia that is growing at the slowest pace in about a decade.\n\nOpinion polls show his ruling Congress party losing the vote, adding pressure on the 43-year-old Mr Gandhi to bolster a party controlled by his family and which has ruled India, except for a dozen years, since independence from Britain in 1947.\n\nMr Singh's appointment a decade ago sparked optimism that the former finance minister would build on moves he took in 1991 to open India's economy. He ended up helming a government seen as one of the most corrupt in the nation's history that is struggling to contain spending and a plunge in the rupee, which has stoked the cost of everything from onions to energy.\n\n\"The scams and economic struggles of the last three years will certainly cloud his legacy,\" said Brahma Chellaney, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi who worked on an economic task force led by Mr Singh. \"He's the captain of the ship and takes blame for these issues, and I think he knows that.\"\n\nMr Gandhi's family has dominated Congress and Indian politics for more than six decades. Jawaharlal Nehru, Mr Gandhi's great-grandfather and independence movement hero, became the country's first prime minister. He was followed by his daughter, Indira Gandhi, and her son, Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul's father. Both were assassinated, drawing comparisons with the Kennedy family.\n\nFor most of his political career, Rahul Gandhi has avoided weighing in on issues of national importance. He rarely speaks in legislative debates and has missed more than half of the sittings since the present term convened in May 2009, according to records on the parliament's website.\n\n\"I always felt that our government would have been strengthened if Rahul Gandhi was part of the government, but Rahul felt he had responsibility to the party, which did not permit him to join the government,\" Mr Singh said. \"Rahul Gandhi has outstanding credentials to be nominated as the presidential candidate (for the Congress party) and I hope our party will take that decision at the appropriate time.\"\n\nMr Singh defended his record yesterday, saying he oversaw the economy's fastest-ever expansion to lift 138 million people out of poverty. He urged Indians to look beyond the current economic slump and said most charges would be dismissed against officials accused of losing as much as US$53 billion in revenue in the sale of mobile phone licences and coal blocks.\n\n\"I have every reason to believe that when history is written of this period, we will come out unscathed,\" he said. \"This is not to say that there were no irregularities, there were irregularities but the dimension of the problems have been overstated.\"\n\nMr Singh more than doubled the guaranteed support prices for wheat and rice in the year ended June 30 from 2005-2006 to boost the wages of Indian farmers. He started a programme to employ one adult in every poor rural household for a minimum of 100 days a year, and enacted a law that will provide cheaper food to about two-thirds of the country's 1.2 billion people.\n\nIndia's consumer inflation exceeded 11 per cent in November, the highest in the Group of 20 major economies, as bottlenecks of everything from food to energy stoke price increases.\n\nMr Singh said that his government could have done better at controlling price rises. \"However, we should remember that our inclusive policies have put more money in the hands of weaker sections.\"\n\nMr Singh said that his best accomplishment was passing a bill that allowed India to import nuclear technology from the US, which he described as ending \"the nuclear apartheid that sought to stifle the processes of social and economic change\". His biggest failure was not doing enough to improve access to health care, particularly for women and children, he said.\n\n\"I feel I have done my best under the circumstances and that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media or the main opposition,\" he said.

To date, however, none of the half a dozen or so planned LNG export projects there have been built and the federal government still needs to sign off on the latest batch of export authorisations.\n\nWoodfibre LNG Export's incorporation here comes as more international LNG producers and traders set up shop in Singapore to capitalise on the growing Asian gas trade. The Republic, which just started up its multibillion-dollar Singapore LNG receiving terminal on Jurong Island last May, intends to grow into a regional LNG hub.\n\nA check with the companies' registry showed that Woodfibre, established last July, counts among its directors Ratnesh Bedi, president of Pacific Oil & Gas, the energy arm of the RGE group, and George Dantas, group head, Tax & Accounting, at RGE.\n\nAnd behind RGE - a global resources-based manufacturing group with more than US$15 billion of assets and offices in Singapore, Jakarta, Hong Kong, Beijing and Nanjing - is Mr Tanato, its founder and chairman.\n\nIn its application filed with the Canadian authorities, Woodfibre said the target markets for exports from its planned LNG facility near Squamish, British Columbia, include Pacific Rim markets, such as Japan, South Korea and China. The project will consist of a gas liquefaction plant and associated infrastructure and port facilities.\n\nWoodfibre is part of the Pacific Oil & Gas group, which is mainly involved in oil and gas exploration and production in Indonesia and also owns power generation plants in China. Pacific Oil & Gas also owns a 35 per cent stake in Jiangsu Rudong LNG receiving terminal in China and is one of only two foreign-owned companies permitted by China to invest in such terminals there.\n\nSingapore's Temasek Holdings had also invested in US LNG player Cheniere Energy as well as Cheniere's export terminal at Sabine Pass (although it reportedly has sold off its Cheniere Energy stake), but subsequently decided to go big and invest directly in the LNG industry - from upstream projects to downstream storage and regasification terminals - when it set up Pavilion Energy last April.\n\nIts biggest deal so far involves the purchase of an upstream LNG asset, when it paid US$1.288 billion for a 20 per cent stake in offshore LNG exploration concessions in Tanzania last November.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The companies are discussing if they can bridge the valuation gap, the people said. The Hong Kong bank has a market value of US$4.6 billion, which is 1.7 times its estimated 2013 book value, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.\n\nBuying Wing Hang would be OCBC's biggest acquisition. The Singapore bank, which gets almost two-thirds of its revenue from its home country, is stepping up overseas expansion plans as it seeks to offset the lowest lending margins in South- east Asia.\n\nHong Kong's family-run banks, squeezed for years by larger competitors including HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of China Ltd, are attracting interest from acquirers as the city's role in cross-border financing expands. Yue Xiu Group agreed last November to buy a majority stake in Chong Hing Bank Ltd for US$1.5 billion, the first acquisition of a Hong Kong lender since 2009.\n\nThe family of Wing Hang chairman Patrick Fung, its affiliates and Bank of New York Mellon Corp together hold about 45 per cent of shares in the Hong Kong lender. OCBC declined to comment in an emailed reply to questions. Connie Leung, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Wing Hang, declined to comment.\n\nOCBC, led by chief executive officer Samuel Tsien, has been expanding in Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China. The Singapore lender would need fresh capital to acquire Wing Hang and would likely seek full ownership, Citigroup Inc analyst Robert Kong wrote in a report last October.\n\nBanks in Singapore have an average net interest margin of 1.77 per cent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While that's higher than Hong Kong's 1.73 per cent, the Chinese city is seen by lenders as a gateway to the mainland and a way to benefit from increasing global use of the yuan.\n\nWing Hang would give a buyer a network of 70 branches spanning Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China. Its presence across southern China's Pearl River Delta makes it a more attractive target than other smaller family-owned banks in the city, Grace Wu, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd, said last September.\n\nAnbang Insurance Group, a Beijing-based insurer, indicated it won't pay more than 1.7 times the book value of Wing Hang, two people with knowledge of the matter said last month. Anbang said yesterday in a filing that it spent 1.43 billion yuan (S$296 million) to increase its stake in China Merchants Bank Co to 7 per cent, from 6.36 per cent.

I am confident that with the strong support from SGCC and SP, the Australian businesses will be well positioned for further opportunity and growth. The outcome has also affirmed Australia's strong support for businesses and foreign investments.\"\n\nSP's latest annual report also cited chairman Mohd Hassan Marican as saying that \"Australia forms a critical part of SP's growth strategy and will remain firmly so\". He added that the deals with SGCC will help enhance investment value and position it for future stategic growth.\n\nSP AusNet invested $881.4 million over the past year in capital expenditure to strengthen and expand its network. It also improved supply reliability, reducing the time that customers were without electricity by 13.7 per cent and gas by 11.7 per cent, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nRAKISHLY thin, affable and media-savvy, Jonathan Saunders certainly fits the profile - not quite a fashion wunderkind used to travelling with his posse of cool pals, but a confident industry player who has been at the job for some time. In the case of this Scottish-born designer, it's been 10 years in the fickle business of making frocks.\n\n\"It's been fantastic,\" says Saunders, known for his flair for eye-catching prints and electrifying palettes. \"It doesn't ever feel that long because when you're a Brit designer, you do your first collection from the bedroom, so it feels like I've been doing this really just four years ago.\"\n\nStudying product design and then textile design in Glasgow School of Art, before gaining his masters in printed textiles at London's famed Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design, the 36-year-old might consider himself a relative newbie in the scene. But with over 100 stockists around the world and a 120 per cent jump in annual sales last year, the strong colourist has evolved his designs into confident, sleek pieces that have won over women like first ladies Michelle Obama and Sandra Cameron, as well as stars like Diane Kruger and Sienna Miller.\n\nAnd while his peer Christopher Kane, who was a year below him at Saint Martins, may have made headlines early this year when his company was acquired by luxury group Kering, Saunders has had his share of career milestones: He designed prints for Alexander McQueen (a commission he snagged within 48 hours of showing his MA collection), consulted for Chloe and Emilio Pucci, and enjoyed stints at fashion houses Pollini and Escada. Next up: A consultancy position for British design doyen Paul Smith's womenswear collection.\n\n\"I really enjoy working with other companies perhaps because I have such a strong brand identity,\" muses Saunders, who made a 'zip-the-lips' gesture when quizzed about his next venture with the fashion house. \"I am fascinated with understanding the infrastructure of companies and how I could explore brand identity with every project that I do.\"\n\nBrought up in a strict Jehovah's Witness family, the British Fashion Council/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund 2012 winner never thought he would be part of the glitzy fashion firmament. Instead, he simply knew he wanted to create and looked to acquiring skills in carpentry and furniture-making. But his interest in composing labour-intensive, silk-screen prints on fabrics led organically to a career in fashion.\n\n\"I never think of myself as an established designer,\" says Saunders. \"But it's only in London where you could come straight out of college and land yourself the cover of Vogue.\"\n\nThe British edition of the fashion glossy featured supermodel Natalia Vodianova wearing his hand-printed Ziggy dress on its January 2004 cover, the skirt billowing skywards like that of Marilyn Monroe's dress in The Seven Year Itch. The kaleidoscopic design was part of Saunders' debut Spring/Summer 2004 collection.\n\nBut lest you dismiss the London-based designer as the product of a lucky break, he explains the pragmatism required to make it as a fashion house, especially in a very competitive market.\n\n\"My generation takes a creative idea and pushes it, and then balances it with what people want to wear - that is where London is right now,\" says Saunders, who returned to presenting his collections at London Fashion Week after showing for two years in New York.\n\n\"Also, the people who were really into big brands and logos are the same customers who don't want to wear something generic. We are now able to sell to women who previously wore just Vuitton, Prada and Gucci.\"\n\nAnd to capitalise on this recent adoption of indie labels by the well-heeled set, the business-centric talent rolled out his first menswear line early last year and is set to unveil a lucrative range of accessories next.\n\n\"A sweater I had made for womenswear was too big so I tried it on and it looked great,\" recalls the fine-featured, lanky designer. \"Some stores sold it and there was such a big reaction. There's a strong market for pieces that stand out because menswear is so classic. And it's a good starting point for me with menswear, because it helps inform my womenswear collection.\"\n\nPunctuated by the season's 'It' outerwear - the souvenir jacket, the label's Spring/Summer 2014 presentation featured plenty of borrow-from-the-boys pieces like low-slung Bermuda shorts, slouchy silk pants and chunky slip-on sandals. It was a departure from the sculpted, sophisticated silhouettes that have defined his recent collections, but, as Saunders declares: \"Fashion is all about newness.\"\n\nWhen asked about the anniversary collection, which treaded the fine line between 'offbeat-cool' and 'just-plain-eccentric', the fine arts grad says: \"The previous line was, like, tight '50s housewife vixen so after that direction for Fall, I thought to go more relaxed. At the back of my head was open-mindedness and happy '70s colours, playing on sportswear luxe.\"\n\nPerhaps the trippy pieces push the styling finesse of his current clientele - the cool girl who is all grown up, with a credit limit that matches her newfound status. \"My customer has grown up and yet gotten younger,\" observes Saunders.\n\n\"She wants to look like an individual. And she wants to look 25 - which is a good thing!\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 42.5 million new ordinary shares have been issued to Mr Ng at 24.93 cents each. The remaining $31.8 million of the consideration will be paid in cash.\n\nTo finance the cash portion, See Hup Seng said it had obtained the approval of shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday to issue 144.5 million new shares at 24.93 cents each to a group of high net worth individuals. This share placement will raise net proceeds of around $35.2 million.\n\nOn his part, Mr Ng has provided a profit guarantee to See Hup Seng, saying that the consolidated net operating profits of Hetat for the year ended Dec 31, 2013, and the year ending Dec 31, 2014, would be at least $5.5 million and $6.3 million respectively.\n\nHetat has been profitable since Day 1 and its bottom line has grown year on year since 2009.\n\nNet profit grew at a compound annual growth rate of 11.3 per cent to $4 million in 2012. For the eight months ended Aug 31, 2013, it achieved a net profit of $3.5 million on the back of revenue of $23.7 million.\n\nSee Hup Seng's executive chairman Thomas Lim said this acquisition would enable the company to offer Hetat's steel-engineering services to its customers, particularly those in the marine and offshore industry.\n\nHe described See Hup Seng's financial performance in the first nine months of 2013 as \"commendable\", as net profit increased 59 per cent year on year to $7.3 million.\n\n\"This was driven mainly by the stronger operational performances of our core corrosion-prevention and refined-petroleum businesses,\" he said.\n\nShares of See Hup Seng ended trading yesterday down half a cent at 32 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Maybe local investors heard only the second part of the Fed's message: that it was deferring the tapering of \"quantitative easing\" because the economy was still weak and in need of capital injections. Which means it was still not time to get back into stocks.\n\nYet, it could be that investors here were still disposing of more US stocks than they bought in Q3 because they were taking profits from a rising market, where the Standard & Poor's 500 put on gains of 5.24 per cent in the quarter even as the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite jumped 10.82 per cent.\n\nAccording to US Treasury figures, Singapore investors sold a net US$1.34 billion of stocks in the US market in Q3, after a net sale of US$1.47 billion in the previous quarter. This may be attributed to the Asian appetite for risk-taking or shrewdness. Singapore investors were not the only ones selling US stocks when others were buying. US Treasury figures showed that other Asians - the Japanese, Hong Kongers, Taiwanese and Thais - also continued to dump US stocks in Q3. Asians as a whole sold a net US$4.3 billion in that quarter.\n\nBut there must have been a sizable number of Asians who shifted to a neutral or back to \"buy\" position in Q3, because the total Asian net sales value of US stocks was down at 60 per cent of the total in Q2.\n\nJapanese investors unwound US$1.67 billion of US stocks in Q3, less than a third of their Q2 sales, while Hong Kong investors let go of US$1.69 billion, half of the previous quarter's sales. The drop was much smaller for local investors, whose sales fell only 9 per cent. The position for other global investors on Wall Street in Q3 was more clear-cut, with most moving from a \"sell\" to \"buy\" position. Overall, global investors sold a net US$24.32 billion of US stocks in Q2 and purchased a net US$12.71 billion in the same period.\n\nUS investors' stand in stock markets outside the US was not only clear, but also consistent. They have been on a buying spree since the start of 2013, though their purchases slipped from US$65.77 billion in Q1 to US$36.86 billion in Q2 and US$35.14 billion in Q3, Treasury data showed.\n\nAsian stock markets, including Japan, which gained around 6.3 per cent in Q3, drew US$14.93 billion in net purchases from the US, up from US$11.29 billion in Q2. Most of the purchases in Q2 were made in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and India.\n\nStock gains in Singapore were a modest 3.6 per cent in Q3, but US investors were net sellers rather than buyers here in the first three quarters of 2013.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dairy products, cereal grains, legumes, refined sugars and processed foods were not part of our ancestral diet and are avoided.\n\nThere has been research that shows that people on the Paleo diet tend to be free from chronic illnesses such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes. Some people also claim to have lost weight on the diet.\n\nMichael Tan, who has been in the food industry for over 30 years, first heard about the Paleo diet from a friend earlier this year.\n\n\"I studied what goes into the diet and it is a healthy one,\" says Mr Tan. \"I saw the potential of starting a food business specialising in this.\"\n\nMr Tan does all the cooking at the food stall. Due to the compact size of the kitchen, he keeps his menu small. Baked chicken is the main dish, cooked in three different flavours - Italian, Moroccan, and Mexican.\n\nMr Tan does not use any oil in his cooking, nor does he use any MSG or sugar. \"I use pure honey instead,\" he says.\n\nThe fresh chicken is marinated overnight using different herbs such as rosemary, thyme for the Italian flavoured one and oregano and some other spices for the Mexican one. The Moroccan chicken is baked with prunes and olives.\n\nA set meal, comprising a drumstick and two sides such as fresh greens and baked sweet potato, and a drink costs $7.90. A whole chicken on its own costs $14.90.\n\nMr Tan is generous in his use of herbs, which makes the chicken fragrant and tasty. The chicken is cooked in its own fat, so it is still juicy.\n\nSince Caveman Food opened in September, it has gained quite a following among the working and medical crowd around the area.\n\n\"I've had doctors and nurses from the nearby hospitals come to eat, because they know about the Paleo diet,\" says Mr Tan, who says he has lost 5kg since going on the diet four months ago. Other regulars include Muay Thai fighters, and Cross-Fit enthusiasts. Some even come everyday during the work week. \"About 30 per cent of my customers have heard about the diet, the others just want healthy food.\"\n\nThere is a small seating area near his stall, but most choose to do takeaways.\n\nMr Tan has plans to add more items to his menu, such as stewed beef and some seafood dishes.\n\n\"I want more Singaporeans to know about the Paleo diet, and to understand why some foods like refined sugar are bad for them.\"\n\nBy Tay Suan Chiang\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Union officials in Washington state want to preserve gains hard won from a company that has surging profits and record plane orders.\n\nBut the international leadership sees a different threat - the possibility of losing a large manufacturing centre and more than 10,000 union jobs to a right-to-work state where it would be difficult to win representation. And that could mean a big loss in dues - Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area paid US$25.5 million in dues to the international union in 2012.\n\nBoeing has promised to put final assembly of the 777X in the Seattle area, as well as fabrication of the aircraft's wings, if the 31,000 Boeing machinists vote to approve the revised deal.\n\nBut that is by no means a sure thing. The president of the international union, R Thomas Buffenbarger, defied union leaders in the Puget Sound area by ordering the new vote, and those leaders are urging Boeing workers to once again vote down the extension, which calls for numerous concessions.\n\nIn a message to Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area, Thomas Wroblewski, president of Machinists Union District Lodge 751, which is based there, said: \"Because of the massive takeaways, the union is adamantly recommending members reject this offer.\"\n\nMr Wroblewski has asserted that the revised deal is not different enough from the previous deal - which was rejected 67 to 33 per cent - to warrant a new vote.\n\nDistrict 751's leaders oppose Boeing's demand that the machinists approve a deal that would freeze their pensions in favour of less generous, riskier 401(k) plans. District 751's leaders also voice dismay that the deal would increase out-of-pocket health spending and includes raises totalling just 4 per cent over eight years.\n\nIf the machinists reject the revised deal, Boeing will continue its search on where to locate assembly of the 777X. The 777 is a long-range, twin-aisle aircraft that carries about 365 passengers. The 777X, which Boeing hopes to begin delivering by 2020, would be about one-fifth more fuel-efficient and carry up to 400 passengers.\n\nWashington state, where the 777 is assembled, has promised Boeing US$8.7 billion in tax breaks through 2040 if it puts the final assembly of the 777X in the state.\n\nSome workers resent being asked to approve a deal filled with concessions when Boeing has record profits and a record backlog of US$400 billion in orders. And those objections have grown since Boeing's board decided two weeks ago to raise the company's dividend about 50 per cent and approve a US$10 billion stock buyback.\n\n\"The optics of this are not good,\" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with the Teal Group. \"Boeing couldn't have timed this any worse from a negotiating standpoint.\"\n\nMany Boeing workers complain that the parent union has scheduled the vote for today, when many will still be on vacation for the holiday season. Many machinists also say they are not being given enough time to study and discuss the revised proposal - the new vote was announced four days before Christmas.\n\nFrank Larkin, communications director for the machinists' parent union, said it was vital to hold the vote soon. \"The timing was driven largely by Boeing's attempt to announce in early January its plans for where it will place assembly of the 777X.\"\n\nOn Dec 26, Mr Buffenbarger, the international's president, sent a letter to the 31,000 workers eligible to vote, praising the revised deal, without specifically urging a yes vote.\n\n\"The total value of the new improvements to the contract offer adds more than US$1 billion to the previous offer,\" he wrote. \"I believe this represents a significant improvement worthy of the membership's consideration.\"\n\nMr Buffenbarger said the revised deal added a US$5,000 one-time payment, payable in January 2020, on top of the US$10,000 bonus Boeing had previously promised upon ratification. In the biggest revision, the new proposal would preserve the current six-year \"progression\" it takes for new workers to reach full pay. In the first deal, that would have taken 16 years.\n\nDoug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said: \"The terms of Boeing's enhanced contract offer, which include placing final assembly and wing build of the 777X in Puget Sound, stand.\"\n\nOn their website, District 751's leaders have posted a detailed explanation of what they say is wrong with the revised contract extension, which would be added onto the contract that expires in 2016. One objection is that the extension calls for a one per cent raise every other year during the eight-year extension.\n\n\"It's a bridge too far; it's asking too much from us,\" said Wilson Ferguson, president of the Local A unit of District 751. \"The problem is that it seems that our international union is complicit and working with the company to push this thing through.\"\n\nDistrict 751's leaders say it makes irrefutable business sense for Boeing to put 777X assembly in Washington state, largely because there is so much manufacturing expertise and experience there. As a result, they see little justification for far-reaching concessions.\n\n\"There's an overwhelmingly strong argument for keeping this project in Puget Sound,\" Mr Aboulafia said. \"Boeing would have to be willing to inflict of lot of damage to itself to leave.\"\n\nThe Seattle Times obtained a copy of the request for proposals that Boeing sent to other states. It said total investment to build the 777X could reach US$10 billion. District 751 officials note that the Puget Sound already has most of the needed facilities as well as trained workers and a proven supplier network.\n\nMr Ferguson asserted that W James McNerney Jr, Boeing's chief executive, is so anti-union that he might decide to place 777X production outside Washington state even though, in Mr Ferguson's view, it would end up costing the company more and delaying production.\n\n\"I'd call it corporate suicide if Boeing moves this elsewhere,\" Mr Ferguson said.\n\nBoeing officials have long been dismayed with the militancy of the Puget Sound machinists; they have gone on strike against Boeing five times since 1977, including a costly 58-day walkout in 2008. Boeing officials cited these stoppages as a major reason for opening a second production line for the 787 Dreamliner in right-to-work South Carolina. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

It pops up sometimes, usually during the Singapore Arts Festival, or as an exotic offering at the M1 Fringe Festival.\n\nBut two upcoming works from Mexico and Portugal respectively could whet the local appetite for more, believes Felipe Cevera, a Singapore-based director from Mexico, who will helm The Mountain by the newly formed performance collective, The Art of Strangers.\n\n\"They can expect to watch fresh and compelling work produced in another part of this planet,\" he adds.\n\nThe Mountain is based on a short story by award-winning novelist Amitav Ghosh, and there will be an equal number of performers to audience members in every performance. In a mix of story-telling and role-playing, 15 performers will play to an audience of 15 spectators - with themes about art, people and global warming.\n\nIn the story, a group of foreigners announce their intention to climb the local mountain at a village. The villagers themselves have never climbed it because their forefathers told them not to. Consequently, they realise that the mountain is in fact an iceberg, and that it is melting. Only the storytellers of the village can offer refuge.\n\nThe piece is a critical allegory of the idea of \"progress\" in a world where people struggle to achieve an identity, and with the inevitable doom of climate change as a backdrop.\n\nApart from the distance, is there a specific theatre form in Latin or South America that is markedly different from Northern America or Western Europe?\n\nCevera notes that unlike many places in East Asia, Mexico doesn't have a tradition of theatre or performance per se. \"Our tradition comes from all around the world. For example, one of the first persons to teach realistic acting in Mexico was a Japanese who trained in Russia.\n\n\"In contemporary theatre, it is hard to say what exactly is \"Mexican\" or \"Portuguese\" about thw work. Nowadays, theatre knowledge travels very easily around the world and we can find taiji movements in a Guatemalan performance, be sure about that!\" says the 29-year-old who's married to a Singaporean, and moved to Singapore two years ago.The other two Latin American acts to be featured in the upcoming Fringe Festival is Por Piedad from Mexico and Mundo Perfeito from Portugal, shares Cevera.\n\nAna Graham, who heads Por Piedad, is the owner of Sarah Kane's rights in Mexico, and has produced the five plays written by the late British playwright, starring a Mexican cast. The play they are presenting at the 2014 Fringe is based on an Italian movie, featuring two highly regarded actors. The play explores the life-changing encounter between a housewife and a bachelor on the day Hitler visits Mussolini's Italy.\n\nPortuguese group Mundo Perfeito is presenting a work that deals with the relationship between the arts and the state, a piece that will resonate in Singapore.\n\n\"Mundo Perfeito (perfect world) is a group that engages very much with urban issues, and this may also be a great opportunity for Singaporean theatregoers to experience how they address common topics,\" he says. Mundo Perfeito's Three Fingers Below the Knee draws from the historical archive of 40 years of theatre censorship when Portugal was a dictatorship. Although profoundly Portuguese, it questions the limits of today's artistic freedom.\n\nWith their exploration of the ecology and community, political criticism and art censorship, the three Latin American plays share a common purpose - to strike a universal chord in Singapore.\n\nThe M1 Fringe Festival will be held from Jan 8-19. Mundo Perfeito's Three Fingers Below the Knee will be held from Jan 10-11 at the Esplanade Theatre Studio, The Art of Strangers' The Mountain will be performed from Jan 16-18, 8pm nightly at The Substation; and Por Piedad Theatre & The Play Company (Mexico/USA)'s Working on a Special Day will be held on Jan 16 and 17, at the Esplanade Theatre Studio.

Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stands ready to ease monetary policy even further if the economy looks like it is slowing.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the continuing success of Abenomics looks virtually assured in 2014, say some financial analysts, even as others see storm clouds on the horizon for Japan as a result of \"Abepolitics\".\n\nMr Abe's highly controversial visit last week to Tokyo's Yasukuni memorial shrine - where the names of Japanese \"Class-A War Criminals\" are enshrined with those of other Japanese war dead - guarantees growing friction between Japan and the rest of East Asia, Mr Abe's critics say.\n\nAmong these are former vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs (Asia) Kenneth Courtis, who told BT that \"the current government in Tokyo is making it virtually impossible through a series of provocations to come to any amiable settlement with China, Taiwan, the Koreas and Russia\".\n\nThe administration headed by Mr Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso is the most nationalist and far-right government Japan has had since the collapse of the Tojo wartime Cabinet in August 1945, said Mr Courtis, who is also co-head of Themes Investment Management.\n\n\"Do not be surprised to see more moves by the current Japanese government in the year ahead which will poison still further relations between Tokyo and much of the rest of Asia,\" he added.\n\nThis could damage the all-important trade and investment relations between Japan and the rest of the region, including relations with the Asean states; already, some, including Singapore, have expressed disquiet over Mr Abe's visit to Yasukuni, analysts say.\n\nThe visit provoked an unexpected rebuke from the US administration of President Barrack Obama, which described the gesture as \"disappointing\" and likely to further inflame ties between Japan and its neighbours.\n\nUS-Japan relations are at a sensitive juncture: Washington is embarking upon closer military cooperation with its \"ally\" Japan; the US and Japan are the largest economies leading negotiations over enlarging the 12-member Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) group.\n\nMeanwhile in China, which is scheduled to host important meetings of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) forum in Beijing this year, Chinese leaders have effectively ruled out any summit meeting with Mr Abe in light of the Yasukuni visit and territorial disputes between the two countries.\n\nJapan cannot expect to continue enjoying a golden age of \"Abenomics\" as long as it persists with actions that threaten to isolate it from the rest of the region, even though economic dynamics appear to be moving strongly in its favour for the present, some economists argue.\n\n*Round table: Where to put your money, Page 17\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/white-hot-allure-white-wine", "site_title": "White-hot allure of white wine", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWhite-hot allure of white wine\n\nYou can't go wrong with a good Chardonnay to ring in the New Year celebrations, writes NK YONG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jan 2, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHAT white wines for the new year? Chardonnay remains the most popular varietal by far, and I am encouraged by the increasing popularity of the simpler French Chardonnay wines over the past year. Other popular whites include Sauvignon Blanc, the varietal made famous by Cloudy Bay.\n\nJudging from last year's sales performance, Riesling also appeared to be increasing in popularity, as more wine consumers find the light sweetness of the Kabinetts well counteracted by the delicious acidity. Indeed for some wine critics, Riesling is their preferred varietal, their battle-cry being \"ABC\" - anything but Chardonnay! Then there is Gewurztraminer, the \"Lychee grape\", known best through the wines of Alsace, and a wine, which I am told by a Gewurztraminer fan, goes well with spicy foods, including curry. Other less commonly seen varietals are Tokay Pinot Gris, also mainly from Alsace; Chenin Blanc, the grape of the Loire; and Gruner Veltliner, the national varietal of Austria.\n\nPrejudice and personal tastes aside, white grapes offer a greater range of taste and styles than red. And they are just as well or better, being in most cases higher in acidity. The problem is to get past the colour.\n\nChardonnay\n\nThe best expression of Chardonnay is to be found in white Burgundy which also includes Chablis. The finest Burgundy is indubitably le Montrachet. It is the white equivalent of Romanee- Conti in red Burgundy; together they are the twin peaks of wine.\n\nLike peaks, Montrachets are difficult to reach. First problem is availability, the second and equally difficult is price.\n\nThe Montrachet vineyard is very small, all of 8 hectares, and is split up amongst over a dozen growers, most of whom have very tiny holdings. Domaine Romanee-Conti's Montrachet is the most expensive, closely followed by those from Leflaive and Lafon. For those intrepid wine lovers who wish to experience a Montrachet at least once, I would suggest the Montrachet, Marquis de Laguiche by Drouhin, my own first choice. (It fits my budget better!) It is very good, quite different from those of DRC, Lafon and Leflaive, but needs to be aged. Ten years would be the minimum, preferably 15+ years upwards. To drink a Montrachet too young would be a crying shame - it is not the money, it is infanticide!\n\nThe other Grands Crus white burgundies are Chevalier Montrachet, Batard Montrachet, Bienvenue Montrachet and Criots-Batard Montrachet in Puligny-Montrachet and Corton Charlemagne in Pernand-Vergelesses. These may not be quite as dazzling as Montrachet, but are nonetheless great white burgundies, priced within reach. Leflaive's Chevalier Montrachet is the most highly-regarded of these, a good second-best to Montrachet itself. Domaine Leflaive is one of the largest owners of vineyards in each of these Grands Crus, and held in high regard as the best of the rest. Domaine Leflaive - under her father Vincent - had become THE Domaine in Puligny Montrachet by the time Anne-Claude took over in the early 90s. She fully converted it to biodynamic farming by 1997, and the results are stunning. This is the name to buy; prices are not cheap, but relatively reasonable (by Grand Cru standards).\n\nThere are many other highly regarded names in white Burgundy worth looking up - Ramonet, Coche Dury , Lafon, Pierre Morey, Marc Colin, Guy Roulot, etc, but be advised also that productions are generally small and difficult to find.\n\nBut if one puts aside bias and prejudice, the Village level of white burgundies, labelled simply Puligny Montrachet, or Chassagne Montrachet, all of them, provide good starting points within reach of modest pockets.\n\nGoing further south from Beaune are the white burgundies from the villages of St. Aubin, Auxey-Duresses, Santenay, etc. The whites from these villages have improved considerably in recent years and not being big names in the white Burgundy world, availability and prices are much better.\n\nI would heartily recommend two relatively unknown or unfamiliar villages where very respectable white burgundies are now being produced, and by highly-respected names from the Cote d'Or at almost bargain basement prices.\n\nI am referring to the Hautes Cotes de Nuits Blanc and the white Macon from the Maconnais districts. The Hautes Cotes de Nuits comes from the hills behind Beaune, a region hitherto given over to vegetable and table fruit farming but which is now being slowly converted to vineyards.\n\nHautes Cotes de Nuits Blanc of two members of the Gros family, Domaine Anne Gros and Domaine Michel Gros, are astonishingly impressive and very inexpensive. (I would add the disclaimer here, that I am involved in the distribution of the wines of Domaine Michel Gros, Domaine Leflaive, Domaine Comtes Lafon and Domaine Michel Gros.)\n\nMacon whites have been given a huge lift by the entry into Macon of two of the most highly regarded white Burgundy producers, Domaine Leflaive and Domaine Lafon. Their Macons may be simple but they are simple and pure expressions of Chardonnay, at very reasonable prices. It has been said that the advent of Domaine Lafon into Macon raised the bar considerably, and it was soon followed by Domaine Leflaive. If you are looking for a really inexpensive white Burgundy with purity, crystalline clarity and balance, look no further. This is perhaps one of today's best kept secrets.\n\nOne French white wine region that is producing first-class Chardonnays but which are looked upon as second cousins to Burgundy is Pouilly-Fuisse south of Burgundy.\n\nI cannot recommend too highly those of Ch\u00e2teau de Fuisse, the most famous name in that region. Very different from the Chardonnays of Puligny and the like, but are very highly regarded and when given sufficient age, a Ch\u00e2teau de Fuisse Pouilly Fuisse Vieilles Vignes can produce the same \"wow\" effect as a good Puligny. And they age magnificently. The beauty of it all? At a fraction the price of a Leflaive Premier Cru Puligny -Montrachet.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

It did not explain what those would be.\n\nThe consortium said the overruns were the result of unforeseen events during construction, something which was \"normal\" in these kinds of projects.\n\nThe group said it believes the PCA had \"failed in its obligations as set out in the contract as well as in the inexactitude of the information provided to the consortium to carry out the project\". Under the terms agreed, the PCA has another 21 days to comply with the requirements, it added, during which work will continue.\n\nNo one at Sacyr was immediately available for further comment.\n\nProblems with the Panama project come at a bad time for Sacyr, whose total net debt stood at 6.9 billion euros (S$12 billion) at the end of last September, more than three times its market capitalisation. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The most popular debt instruments may include finance leases, bonds, Syariah-compliant sukuk, Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs) and debt.\n\n\"There is a strong expectation that the region's banks will play an increasing role in financing the region's airlines,\" Mounir Kuzbari, executive vice-president and board member of Novus Aviation, said on Sunday. \"There is still a significant surplus of Middle Eastern airline demand for financing over Middle Eastern banks supply, indicating an opportunity for the region's banks to play a greater role.\"\n\nCredit growth in the United Arab Emirates will accelerate to 8.4 per cent this year, up from 6 per cent last year and 2.3 per cent in 2012, the International Monetary Fund said in a Nov 12 report. Airlines Emirates, Etihad Airways PJSC, Qatar Airways Ltd and FlyDubai will contribute to that growth after announcing more than US$160 billion in combined plane orders at the Dubai Airshow last month.\n\nMiddle East financial institutions provided about US$4 billion for new Boeing Co aircraft to airlines in 2012 - almost double the figure for 2011, according to the Chicago, Illinois-based manufacturer. Bank debt will provide 25 per cent of financing to airlines around the world as they look to fund US$112 billion in jet deliveries this year, Boeing said in its annual market outlook report last month.\n\n\"The trend is definitely for a more important portion of financing to come from the region,\" Montasser Khelifi, a Dubai-based senior manager for global markets at Quantum Investment Bank Ltd, said on Sunday. \"Following the financial crisis, banks - especially big European banks that were involved in air financing - have shied away from the region and are back to their core markets, so there's an opportunity to replace these.\"\n\nSovereign ownership of the major Gulf airlines could help local banks to step up their air financing as some of those lenders are also government-owned, Mr Khelifi said. \"When there is a government-related entity that needs financing, there was always support from the local banks,\" he said.\n\nEmirates sukuk issuance last year involved four local lenders including Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC and Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, while Etihad obtained a US$359 million loan from First Gulf Bank PJSC in April to buy two Boeing 777s.\n\nPopular financing tools for the region's airlines could include EETCs, bonds specifically to pay for aircraft that aren't yet widely used locally, Sidanth Rajagopal, aviation finance partner at Clyde & Co, said on Monday.\n\n\"That's the scene going forward in the next two years - airlines will be looking to access the EETC market and the big three Gulf airlines have the name recognition,\" he said.\n\nEmirates is considering the sale of sukuk or bonds to raise US$4.5 billion in the financial year starting April to fund plane deliveries, Brian Jeffery, former senior vice-president for corporate treasury, said in August.\n\nKuwait Airways plans to finance the purchase of 10 aircraft by issuing bonds or sukuk and through loans from local and foreign banks, its financial consultant Amani Bouresli said in December.\n\nMiddle East airlines will need 2,610 new planes worth US$550 billion over the next 20 years as traffic grows rapidly in the region, according to Boeing. Local carriers probably made a combined net income of US$1.6 billion last year, increasing to US$2.4 billion this year, according to the International Air Transport Association (Iata).- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Fri, Jan 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHAVING grown up in Joo Chiat, it was only natural that when Alan Tan decided to buy his own apartment, it would be in the same area. \"Joo Chiat Road has lots of sentimental value for me,\" says Mr Tan, a director at architectural materials solution provider, Rice.\n\nHis home is an apartment at Sandalwood designed by architect Chan Soo Khian. Mr Tan has a second reason for buying in this area. \"Soo Khian is one of my favourite architects, and the units here are very hard to come by.\" So when an apartment was put up for sale, he immediately grabbed it. \"The condo is very charming and peaceful to boot,\" he adds. At slightly more than 1,000 sq ft, and with its dark interiors, the apartment looks small, but oddly feels spacious. Mr Tan points out that by practising a \"disciplined use of materials\", he has been able to make a compact space look bigger than it is.\n\nHis company offers a wide range of floor materials, from tiles to stone and mosaic. With more than a decade's experience in the industry, Mr Tan knew exactly which material he wanted for his home. His choice is a large format porcelain stoneware tile in a warm grey shade from Italy, for the kitchen, living and bedrooms. \"Using just a single type of tile makes the different areas in the apartment appear seamless and therefore bigger,\" he says. \"A large format tile has a more luxurious look compared with smaller tiles.\" He adds that perfectly matching coloured grout and tiles are crucial to achieve the seamless look.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/cfc3a0fda9e49af4a551af1249683492ed2c3ed66f7a43d2da7ec9c1db8cfffa?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "SEAMLESS LOOK The use of a large format porcelain stoneware tile in a warm grey shade for the flooring of the living and kitchen areas, and bedrooms make the apartment appear bigger and more luxurious.

And while private-sector economists saw it coming, they had forecast a 1.3 per cent drop.\n\nFor the full year, the economy is likely to have expanded 3.7 per cent year- on-year, up from 1.3 per cent growth in 2012.\n\nThe slowdown in Q4 cut across all major sectors. MTI blamed a slower rise in transport engineering output and a \"sharper contraction\" in the volatile biomedical industry for the growth moderation in manufacturing, which eased from 5.3 per cent in Q3 to 3.5 per cent.\n\nSlower growth in private-sector construction works trimmed construction growth to 4.7 per cent from 5.8 per cent. A similar slowdown in the wholesale & retail and finance & insurance businesses eased services growth from 6.5 per cent in Q3 to 5.5 per cent in Q4.\n\nOn a quarter-on-quarter basis, the services sector, which has been the main prop of Singapore's growth in recent years, slipped an annualised 1.7 per cent. In fact, all three key sectors - manufacturing (-4 per cent), construction (-6.9 per cent) and services - shrank in quarter-on-quarter terms in Q4.\n\nNoting in a brief report that it was services' first decline in two years, Barclays' Joey Chew said the decline partly dragged down Q4's economic growth. The other cause was the upward adjustment in Q3 growth.\n\nThe Q4 slowdown drew mixed reactions from economists on growth prospects for this year.\n\nMTI seemed to take a cautious stand in keeping the 2-4 per cent growth forecast it first made in November last year.\n\nCitigroup's Kit Wei Zheng maintained his 3.5 per cent growth projection, but said that \"weaker- than-expected Q4 growth implies a slightly weaker starting point for 2014 GDP and suggests stronger (global) demand has yet to translate into a sustained growth\" here.\n\nChua Hak Bin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch expected the economy to lose steam in Q4 and thought that the ongoing economic restructuring and tighter foreign worker policy would stand in the way of Singapore fully catching a global demand upswing.\n\nDr Chua tipped the economy to grow 3.2 per cent year-on-year in 2014, among the lowest projections by private-sector economists.\n\nBarclays' Ms Chew feels that domestic factors will cause growth this year to \"be slightly softer versus 2013\".\n\nANZ's Glenn Maguire said that while the economy's Q4 performance was disappointing, there was no cause for alarm. The \"uniform growth upswing\" in the US, Europe and Japan will smoothen Singapore's growth path and restructuring, he reckoned.\n\nANZ maintained that the economy will grow 3.2 per cent this year - \"slightly above the midpoint\" of the official forecast.\n\nDBS, Credit Suisse and UOB believe that stronger external demand favours stronger economic growth in 2014. Credit Suisse has raised its 2014 growth forecast from 3.7 per cent to 4 per cent, the same as DBS's forecast.\n\nUOB has pencilled in growth of 4.3 per cent, the most upbeat projection.\n\nDBS's Irvin Seah dismissed the advance GDP estimates, particularly for the quarter-on-quarter figures, saying they have been \"rather unreliable\" in recent years. \"So take this figure (-2.7 per cent) with a pinch of salt,\" he said. \"Our take is that it could be revised up to a less severe contraction of about -0.8 per cent when the final figure is out.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the last five years, annual volumes have hovered between 24,000 and 37,000.\n\nFor this year, analysts generally agree that prices will continue to soften, though they expect activity to pick up later in the year. The expectation is for prices to fall by between one and 8 per cent for the year as a whole.\n\nMr Mohamed Ismail said: \"I foresee this being a quiet year for the HDB resale market - similar to last year, which had seen the fewest deals in years.\"\n\nAt some point, however, sellers will eventually resist cutting prices further. On their part, buyers will get tempted away from the Build-to-Order (BTO) market as prices and COV continue to moderate, property consultants said.\n\nThe 18 per cent cut in supply of new three-room and larger flats this year to 18,600 units could send buyers into the resale flat market.\n\nERA Realty's Mr Lim said that he expects resale volume to rise 8 to 10 per cent over 2013's level, despite the overall expected decline in prices.\n\nBut Nicholas Mak, the head of research and consultancy at SLP International, noted that the overall supply of BTO flats targeted for this year is 24,300 flats - just 3 per cent lower than last year's 25,100 units.\n\n\"This will continue to weaken the HDB resale market as buying demand is drawn from the HDB resale market to the HDB primary market,\" he said.\n\nMr Ong cautioned that sellers cannot raise prices excessively even with improved demand, since the mortgage-servicing ratio cap essentially restricts buyers from borrowing more to finance their home.\n\nMajor policy changes from the government are unlikely, analysts said.\n\n\"As prices are declining gradually but consistently, the government is unlikely to introduce further measures, as it is not their intention to have government policies cause any significant price declines over a short period,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nMr Ong from R'ST said that it will not be necessary to loosen measures, since the government's intent was to encourage prudent buying; many owners putting their flats up for sale have seen prices appreciate over time, especially in the past few years.\n\n\"It doesn't really cause sellers to be in negative equity upon resale . . . even when prices fall in 2014,\" he said.\n\nThe resale price index for the full quarter and more detailed public housing data will be made available on Jan 24.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The highly regarded artist was once described by critic Karen Smith as the \"intellectual dynamo of the contemporary art world in China\". Popular among collectors, his works run the gamut from photography and video to calligraphy and sculpture. They often make profound statements about China as it evolves into a mature industrial society.\n\nIn the famous Tattoo photo series, for instance, Qiu painted negative symbols and characters on his body to show how, in a media-saturated age, \"signs and codes have overpowered actual human beings, and our bodies have become merely their vehicles,\" he says. His provocative yet elegant works are sought after and exhibited by top museums and galleries around the world, including the Victoria & Albert Museum of London and the Singapore Tyler Print Institute.\n\nHaving practised art since the 1990s, Qui has witnessed the phenomenal growth of Chinese art since it exploded on the international auction scene in 2006. The 44-year-old recalls: \"Many years ago, there wasn't any audience interested in what I was doing, and I was not the target of investment. At that time I knew that I was working more for myself, on a more spiritual level, and all the works at the time, I felt I had to do them. If I could not do them publicly, then I would do so privately.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

Not that there aren't a few laughs to be had but this Vince Vaughn vehicle, about a nice guy who has made bad decisions throughout his life and is then compelled by events to take an unconventional look at parenthood, can't make up its mind about which route to take. In the end, it is neither serious nor funny enough to pass muster.\n\nDelivery Man, directed by Ken Scott, is a remake of his French-Canadian film Starbuck, but something seems to have been lost in translation. By Hollywood standards, the storyline is sufficiently ludicrous - and therefore quite promising: the past catches up with David Wozniak (Vaughn) when the sperm bank where he made multiple donations in his youth (under the name Starbuck) informs him that he has fathered 533 children, some 142 of whom are now suing to find out the identity of their biological father.\n\nHe may have championship-calibre sperm but in real life Wozniak is a world-class failure, a disappointment to everyone including his long-suffering father (Andrzej Blumenfeld). He drives a van for his family's meat business but is totally unreliable and can't seem to run simple errands or make deliveries on time. On top of that he owes money to the mob, and his erstwhile girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) is pregnant. He implores his lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) to help keep his identity secret.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

But the members - which also includes singer Jehnny Beth, bassist Ayse Hassan and drummer Fay Milton - are not resting on their laurels as they speak to the press ahead of their upcoming appearance at the St Jerome's Laneway Festival in Singapore later this month.\n\n\"We're burning the wick at both ends - it's turned me into a very efficient person,\" chuckles Thompson lightly, about the late night/early morning phone call. There's a faintest tinge of fatigue in her voice as she pauses slightly before speaking but it could also be her habit of thinking through the questions carefully before replying.\n\nAfter all, it's not just Savages' revivalist sound and energetic live shows that have won over music fans who frequently compare them to legendary 1970s English rockers Siouxsie and the Banshees. Its penetrating melodies and lyrics, which mix hipster literature with art school chic, have also left critics praising the quartet for its brand of thinking (wo)man's neo-punk music.\n\nFrom the all-black ensemble they don on stage to the minimalist black-and-white artwork of their album, Savages takes its image as seriously as the music the women play. Thompson reveals Silence Yourself, which was released in the middle of last year, was always envisioned by the band to be pressed on vinyl, the long-forgotten format that was virtually wiped out by CDs but is currently staging a strong comeback.\n\n\"That was the main focus - it was important for us to think of it as a physical object; very much like how we used to listen to music when we were growing up,\" she says.\n\nHow Savages plays its live shows also depends on the venue it is in. \"Festival and club shows have very different atmospheres and vibes,\" Thompson shares. \"We prepare ourselves in very different ways, creating different setlists for different spaces that we play in.\"\n\nWhat remains consistent is that the audience is always asked to silence their mobile phones before their shows. Most of them comply, and Thompson adds that this helps improve interaction between Savages and their fans.\n\n\"We see the phone as a barrier between them and us; and we want direct contact with them,\" she adds. \"It's a very simple idea but it's so easy to be distracted; you have to be focused on what you're doing and and that's something that you can do in your everyday life.\"\n\nSavages is part of this year's St Jermone's Laneway Festival line-up. It will take place at The Meadow, Gardens by the Bay, on 25th January. For tickets and more info, check\n\nsingapore.lanewayfestival.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Perfection, according to Jewish law, is something reserved for the world beyond, its seller stressed.\n\nSo if the walls are unfinished and bent nails curve from the ceiling rafters, it should not be a big deal.\n\nIt is an unusual sales pitch, to be sure, but this is no regular listing.\n\nThe building houses Torah Animal World, a collection of hundreds of taxidermied and otherwise preserved animals that represents the wide range of creatures depicted in the Old Testament.\n\nIt is famous in the neighbourhood, and for some of the thousands of ultra-Orthodox Jewish children who have come on tours, it is the closest that they have ever been to a natural history museum.\n\nRabbi Shaul Shimon Deutsch, the exhibition's creator, is ready to consolidate the collection with a biblical antiquities museum that he runs a few doors away, and with two smaller collections that he has in upstate New York and in New Jersey, because the operating costs of running all the locations have gotten too high.\n\nSo though Torah Animal World will for now leave Brooklyn, he said that he hoped that the animals would soon migrate to larger quarters there.\n\n\"My real goal was to create a zoo in Brooklyn,\" Mr Deutsch, 47, said on a tour last week, after pointing out the ibex and orex, the African Cape buffalo and the kudu in the house's teal exhibition space.\n\n\"But we didn't want any wild lions getting loose in Borough Park, so we did the next best thing and used taxidermy.\"\n\nThe property has been on the market for several weeks, and given its contents, people have noticed.\n\nPoking fun at the listing's police-line-up-style photographs of grazing animals in the living room and the rundown state of the property, the real estate blog Curbed called it \"the funkiest listing in recent memory\" and pronounced its asking price of US$995,000 absurd.\n\nYet even though Mr Deutsch did not try to stage the 1,900 square foot building, there has already been an offer from a man on the block, if below asking price, said the broker, Menachem Trietel of Weichert Realtors.\n\n\"When I took pictures of the property, I tried to do as little animals as possible,\" he said of the listing's offbeat snapshots. \"But obviously, it's impossible.\"\n\nIt may not matter. With the exponential growth of the Orthodox Jewish community, and young families being priced out of Manhattan and trendier parts of Brooklyn, the quiet enclave of Borough Park has become an unlikely hot neighbourhood, several brokers said.\n\nHouses generally sell as is, because the inventory of homes is so low, and most end up being gut-renovated, anyway.\n\n\"I mean, the front of the house has a big giraffe on it, so it's a pretty tall and wide house,\" said Charles Fabbella, an owner of Ben Bay Realty, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, when asked to consider the property's price. \"It's going to go. It's a house in a prime neighbourhood.\"\n\nThe first floor is an open, barnlike space, with rows of taxidermied animals and simple wooden benches for visitors, who pay a suggested donation of US$10 each.\n\nAll the windows are boarded up, so rooms are cavelike.\n\nOutside, a 10 foot tall image of a giraffe looms over the doorway, next to a fibreglass moose head. \"We didn't want it to look perfect,\" Mr Deutsch said. \"We wanted it to look like you were going into an animal kind of environment.\"\n\nUpstairs, taxidermied ducks and geese swoop over tall birds, like an ostrich.\n\nIn the back, visitors can sit among animals that appear in prayers, including a white-tailed deer.\n\n\"Like a deer that stands on a mountain thirsting for water, so, too, my heart thirsts for you, God,\" Mr Deutsch said, providing an impromptu translation of Psalm 42.\n\nAmish groups have visited, as well as senior rabbis, to mull over displays, like the one that shows 30 kosher birds (a peacock is among them).\n\nUniquely, visitors may touch the animals. They can also hold many of the ancient artifacts at the Living Torah Museum, which Mr Deutsch has been operating two doors down since 2002.\n\nThere, the expensive relics, amassed through donations and visits to antiquities dealers, sit in niches meant to resemble walls in ancient Jerusalem.\n\n\"This here is an original signet ring that belonged to the minister of a pharaoh,\" Mr Deutsch said, sliding open a glass case and pulling out a gold ring with a scarab. \"Would you like to try on a US$165,000 ring from ancient Egypt?\"\n\n\"You see, I got sick and tired of kids sitting in class and thinking history was boring,\" he said, explaining how his life's work began.\n\n\"We are the only museum in the world that lets its visitors touch ancient items. And I do it so that it becomes more real to them.\"\n\nMr Deutsch's home is between the two museums, and accessible through a connecting room from Animal World's main floor.\n\nBecause he owns three buildings, he has been advised by brokers to sell them as a lot, so that a cluster of million-dollar condos could be built at the site.\n\nBut according to Jewish law, he cannot, he said, because the synagogue that he runs on the first floor of the antiquities museum must first have somewhere to go.\n\nSo the building that houses Animal World is on the market first, to provide capital for the future move.\n\nHis dream, he said, would be to find a 40,000 square foot warehouse with plenty of space for the animals, the antiquities, the 50-family Liozna synagogue and the charity food pantry that the synagogue runs from the basement.\n\nThe ideal buyer of the house containing Animal World, he said, will be someone who wants to start from scratch.\n\n\"You can do a tremendous thing; you can do your vision in this building,\" he said. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

By SAMUEL EE\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jan 1, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHAT will 2014 hold for the car market? Will COE premiums for small cars fall with February's re-classification of COE Category A? And will big car premiums continue to strengthen? The people behind some of Singapore's most popular brands give their take.\n\nNEIL FIORENTINOS\n\nManaging director of BMW Group Asia, the importer of BMW and Mini\n\nHow will the February 2014 re-categorisation of COE Category A affect BMW and Mini?\n\nThe re-categorisation will undoubtedly oust BMW from Cat A, whereas Mini will only be left with the Mini One variant that qualifies for the 130 hp Cat A criteria, at this point in time.\n\nThe BMW Group will continue to stay true to our Efficient Dynamics philosophy of achieving greater power without compromising on fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions, because we see this as the way forward in achieving sustainability. And we will continue to offer our customers the latest and most advanced technology without any compromise.\n\nHow do you see the Cat A and Cat B COE premiums trending over the next 12 months?\n\nCat A prices are likely to come down due to the 130 hp Cat A criteria, simply because there are less cars vying for the Cat A COE. In fact, the new ruling may have carved out a safe haven for certain 1.6-litre models that meet this criterion.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cat B price is likely to increase because more customers will be pushed into this COE category.\n\nDo you expect the COE supply to increase this year?\n\nThe COE supply is likely to increase, especially in the second half of 2014, as there will be more de-registrations due to COE maturity compared to 2013. This is a direct result of the abundance of registrations a decade ago.\n\nHowever, the COE supply may be affected by any premature de-registration as well. This will be hard to anticipate as it is fully dependent on the consumers' sentiment over the COE premium at that point and how comfortable they are with the total cost of car ownership in 2014.\n\nANDRE ROY\n\nCEO of Wearnes Automotive, which represents Bugatti, McLaren, Bentley, Jaguar, Land Rover, Volvo, Infiniti and Renault in Singapore\n\nHow will the February 2014 re-categorisation of COE Category A affect Renault or any of Wearnes' other brands?\n\nBecause we work with eight brands in Singapore and have products in pretty much all market segments, we are well hedged against many scenarios. We will just adjust our marketing strategies according to market demand.\n\nOur Renault business, for example, stands to benefit the most as they specialise in small-capacity engines and we have new products to launch.\n\nAt this point, it looks like the Grand Scenic will be one of the few seven-seat models eligible for Cat A.\n\nVolvo also has a strong line-up of entry models that will still be eligible for Cat A, so we see continued growth.\n\nWill the re-categorisation result in big changes to the market?\n\nI'm not sure it will be as extensive as everyone anticipates, but it's difficult to predict as there are too many factors at play right now.\n\nOn our side, we are actively working with manufacturers on different product/engine scenarios, so that we can quickly adjust our line-up, if new demand patterns emerge.\n\nHow will the Cat A and Cat B COE premiums trend over the next 12 months?\n\nIt is very difficult to predict as there are just too many factors at play.\n\nDo you expect the COE supply to increase this year?\n\nWe appear to be in a cycle where people are delaying purchases and hence not de-registering cars, hoping that COE prices will fall. So logically, we may not see an increase in the first half of the year.\n\nBy the second half, we should see an improvement, as more cars reach 10 years, so waiting will no longer be an option.\n\nRON LIM\n\nGeneral manager of Nissan distributor Tan Chong Motor Sales\n\nHow will the February 2014 re-categorisation of COE Category A affect Nissan?\n\nFortunately, all our current models classified under Cat A now will continue to stay in Cat A after February. So Nissan is all ready to fill up the void left by the affected models from competitors.\n\nWill the re-categorisation result in big changes to the market?\n\nYes, at least temporarily, as most luxury makes are taken out of Cat A, which could lead to a more significant correction in the Cat A premium.\n\nHowever, we expect these same luxury makes to come out with other models or variants to circumvent or challenge the new power output limit. If that really happens, then we might go back to square one again.\n\nSo whether the market will change much will depend on how the government can deal with this possible scenario, that is, keeping the luxury makes out of Cat A for good.\n\nHow will the Cat A and Cat B COE premiums trend over the next 12 months?\n\nThe Cat A COE premium is likely to see a more significant correction, at least temporarily as explained above, from February. However, if the luxury makes are able to make their way back into Cat A, then this correction could be short-lived, and premiums may end up being pushed even higher due to pent-up demand.\n\nThe Cat B COE premium will likely see further upside from the current level as competition will heighten in that category as more models will now be classified as Cat B cars from February.\n\nIn fact, with the expected drop in COE quota available for Cat B and Cat E (which is being largely used for Cat B cars) for the next quota period from February to July 2014, there is pressure for the Cat B COE premium to stay high.\n\nA reprieve for the two categories will only come in the later part of the year - August onwards - when more COEs will be issued due to the expected surge in de-registration in the first half of the year, not by choice, but because all these vehicles will hit their 10-year limit.\n\nDo you expect the COE supply to increase this year?\n\nOn a calendar-year basis, yes, although we are forecasting a 10 per cent drop in COE supply (excluding motorcycles) for the period from February to July 2014 (compared with current supply).\n\nBut we are forecasting a 25 per cent jump in supply for the period from August 2014 to January 2015 (compared with our forecast for February to July 2014).\n\nSo the net result is that we should see around a 10 per cent increase in the COE supply for the whole of 2014 versus 2013.\n\nONG LAY LING\n\nExecutive director of Eurokars Group, which represents Rolls-Royce, Porsche, Mini and Mazda in Singapore\n\nHow will the February 2014 re-categorisation of COE Category A affect Mazda?\n\nWith the re-categorisation of Cat A affecting a number of models in the market, Cat A will be less cluttered. This bodes well for our new Mazda3 which is expected to be launched in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nDo you think the re-categorisation will result in big changes to the market?\n\nWith the re-categorisation, competition in Cat B will intensify and therefore we expect the price gap between Cat A and Cat B to widen. Cat A will once again be dominated by Japanese brands while Cat B will remain dominated by the leading Continental brands.\n\nHow do you see the Cat A and Cat B COE premiums trending over the next 12 months?\n\nIt depends on the COE supply and the state of the economy. With the re-categorisation, we believe the Cat B price will remain supported while Cat A may soften.\n\nDo you expect the COE supply to increase this year?\n\nThere is a growing number of vehicles reaching their 10th year cycle in the next 12 months and thus we expect scrappage to increase and consequently, an increase in the number of replacement COEs.\n\nWhile last year's passenger car category totals 22,400 pieces, we expect this year's to be around 30,000 to 35,000 pieces.\n\nDAVID PANG\n\nDirector of sales for Alpine Group, which represents Opel and Chevrolet\n\nHow will the February 2014 re-categorisation of COE Category A affect Chevrolet and Opel?\n\nMost of our Chevrolet models will not be affected, that is, those which are in Cat A or Cat B will remain there.\n\nHowever, what this new categorisation does is dis-incentivise us to introduce better engines with better fuel efficiency. As you may be aware, Chevrolet is moving towards turbo-charged engines which deliver better performance with lower CO2 emissions. This is the path of development our principal has taken with regards to engine development, which we also believe is the correct direction.\n\nHowever, these cars will be disadvantaged by this new change in policy.\n\nAs for Opel, most of our current Cat A vehicles will shift to Cat B come February. We are re-organising our vehicle portfolio and will probably have to bring back some normally aspirated engines.\n\nThis is a great pity because Opel does have very good engines but this new policy definitely deals a blow to us. It also takes us time to re-negotiate a new line-up with the factory. It will certainly cost us in terms of time and money.\n\nDo you think the re-categorisation will result in big changes to the market?\n\nOver the medium term, we are not sure if it will serve the purpose which this new categorisation was intended to.\n\nSome mass market brands will benefit more than others, it's just the luck of the draw (ie which side of the magic 130 hp figure you fall on).\n\nAt the same time, we believe there will be little impact on the premium brands.\n\nHow do you see the Cat A and Cat B COE premiums trending over the next 12 months?\n\nUnless there are more COEs released early, we still see COE premiums on the high side. Of course, there will naturally be more pressure on Cat B.\n\nDo you expect the COE supply to increase this year?\n\nUnless the the authorities step in to release more COEs in 2014 to even out the cyclical swings, we should see the same number of COEs as in 2013. A slight increase in the COE quota may occur if there is an upswing in de-registrations this year.\n\nSTEFFEN SCHWARTZ\n\nManaging director of Volkswagen Group Singapore, the direct dealer of VW in Singapore\n\nHow will the February 2014 re-categorisation of COE Category A affect VW?\n\nVolkswagen will continue to offer a full range of models in both Cat A and B. Ten of the 18 model variants we currently offer in Cat A will be affected by the re-categorisation, but we will further refine our model line-up by February 2014 to offer customers the most attractive choices in both COE categories.\n\nWill the re-categorisation result in big changes to the market?\n\nWhat we can see is that a number of premium cars will be displaced from Cat A, but there are several others with less than 130 hp which will still be there. This, plus the fact that the COE quota supply is likely to remain low for the first half of this year, means that the premium brands are likely to remain the market leaders.\n\nHow will the Cat A and Cat B COE premiums trend over the next 12 months?\n\nThere will likely be a bigger gap between the Cat A and B COE premiums than there is today. However, we expect overall premiums to remain high up to July 2014. There may be some relief in the second half of the year if the COE supply increases in August.\n\nDo you expect the COE supply to increase this year?\n\nThe total market for 2013 will end up at around 26,000, which is the lowest level since the COE system started in 1990. With the current rate of de-registrations, the COE supply for the first half of 2014 is likely to remain at the current level, but we expect an increase of at least 30 per cent for the second half of the year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now the company wants to spend US$16 million to convert the terminal to ship coal.\n\nBans on iron ore mining and exports in India's top producing states of Karnataka and Goa have choked the industry so hard that MMTC is one of many firms exiting. Even if efforts to fully lift the bans make it past the many bureaucratic and legal hurdles, iron ore miners do not expect complete resumption of production until late 2014.\n\nThe bans, put in place as the government tried to clamp down on illegal mining, have cut India's iron ore exports by around 85 per cent, or 100 million tonnes, over the past two years. They have also reduced foreign exchange earnings by more than US$17 billion in the same period, according to the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI).\n\nThe structural shift in India's iron ore industry could be a blessing for other suppliers, as demand growth from top market China slows and Australian miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton ramp up output. It will also make it harder for India to regain its spot as the world's No. 3 exporter of the steelmaking raw material. \"It's pretty evident that there's lasting damage to the industry,\" said R K Bansal, a secretary-general at FIMI. \"But if the government of the day at the state and central level, as well as other authorities, stick their neck out and take decisions then this paralysis can go.\"\n\nMining in Goa was banned in September 2012, freezing shipments that reached about 50 million tonnes in the 2010-11 fiscal year. In neighbouring Karnataka, where the ban started in 2011, exports remain frozen even though it was lifted in April. In both states, the bulk of mining was done by private companies, which were accused of mining outside lease areas and in excess of set limits.\n\nMMTC was banking on business from Karnataka when it invested along with Indian partners Sical Logistics Ltd and L&T Infrastructure Development Projects in an iron ore terminal in Ennore Port in the southern Tamil Nadu state. \"We think that at least in the next five to six years there will be no exports of iron ore,\" said S M Babu, general manager at MMTC's Chennai office. Instead the joint venture company hopes to tap growing demand for coal-fired power plants in Tamil Nadu.\n\nOnly 16 out of 115 mines have resumed mining in Karnataka. For those keen on returning, the bureaucratic hurdles can be overwhelming. \"There are about 30 or 40 companies whose quantities are so low that they will never restart,\" said Basant Poddar, owner of Mineral Enterprises Ltd, which has four mining leases in Karnataka but none operating currently. \"For those willing, the issue is with forest clearances. The whole process goes through about 50 levels or officers for stage one clearance, and for stage two it's cut down to about 20.\"\n\nOn Monday, Vedanta Resources Plc, a London-based mining conglomerate controlled by Indian tycoon Anil Agarwal, said its Sesa Sterlite unit had resumed operations in Karnataka after clearance from a court-appointed panel.\n\nJiro Iokibe, analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, sees Indian iron ore exports of 15 million tonnes next year, rising to 20 million tonnes in 2015. This is well below the record of more than 117 million tonnes in 2009-2010.\n\nLower Indian supply has eased pressure on a market seen moving to surplus given expansion by low-cost producers such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Brazil's Vale while growth in Chinese demand eases. India's exports to China reached just over 10 million tonnes in January-November, down 68 per cent from a year earlier. \"Definitely people are not depending now on Indian material,\" said a trader in Shanghai who is among a few left selling only Indian iron ore to Chinese mills. \"Most traders have switched to mainstream cargoes from Australia and Brazil and cargoes from India are going at a discount of maybe up to US$4 a tonne.\"\n\nIndia's central and state governments, which put in place the various bans under direction from a Supreme Court determined to clamp down on illegal mining, appear keen on getting the iron ore sector back on its feet. \"We have placed all the regulatory measures we have undertaken in front of the Supreme Court so that we can resume mining operations,\" Prasanna Acharya, mines director in Goa, said in November.\n\nThe court has set up a panel that will determine a limit on Goa's production. The panel is expected to submit an interim report by Feb 15, but Mr Acharya has said he does not expect a resumption in mining before October at the earliest.\n\nWhen the iron ore miners give up, so do businesses relying on the raw material. Out of the 53 sponge iron making plants in Karnataka with annual production capacity of about three million tonnes, 19 have closed and 27 are operating at half their capacity due to a shortage of iron ore, said Deependra Kashiva, executive director of the Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association. India is the world's top producer of sponge iron, an alternative steelmaking ingredient that is economically viable where natural gas is abundant and cheap.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/0a7772cb3f8e9a4e48375cf39af1b5a2b91bdc85a0ec6ecbf9f8dac9c8e751af?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Struggling: An Indian freight train carrying iron ore.

Unlike many other airports in this fast-growing region, Singapore's airport can handle far more than the 53 million travellers that embarked and departed there in 2013.\n\nAnd even if they are delayed, the airport environment is relaxed, efficient and, with such over-the-top amenities as a free movie theatre, a butterfly garden and children's play areas, even fun.\n\nDespite all this, Singapore has big plans to expand the airport still further.\n\nBy the middle of the next decade, if all goes according to plan, Singapore's airport will have a third runway and two more terminals. The first new terminal, which is scheduled to open in 2017, will have a 300-metre-long shopping mall and greenery galore. A large bubble-shaped glass complex will sprout in a space between the existing terminals, providing extra space for travel facilities and still more shops, as well as gardens and a waterfall.\n\nIn this aspect, Singapore is forward-looking in its approach to expanding what is a lifeline for its economy. But the city-state's ambitious plans are just the most extreme example of the huge surge in airport construction across Asia. Kuala Lumpur, Seoul, Jakarta and New Delhi are adding or expanding terminals. Hong Kong is planning an additional runway. Beijing is building an entirely new airport. All are racing to stay ahead of demand that seems only to soar.\n\nAltogether, about US$115 billion has been committed to airport construction and development across the Asia-Pacific region, according to estimates from the Centre for Aviation, a research firm based in Sydney. That is about 45 per cent more than either North America or Europe is spending.\n\n\"There really is a lot going on - and there will be a lot more happening in the coming years,\" said Angela Gittens, director-general of the Airports Council International, a trade group for airports. Airport authorities are reacting to the region's sharp rise in traffic in recent years.\n\nJust seven years ago, airlines in the Asia-Pacific region carried 510 million people and flew 3,270 aircraft, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. Last year, 5,600 aircraft carried nearly 950 million passengers.\n\nBeijing, whose airport 10 years ago was not even among the world's top 30, now has the second-busiest airport in the world, after Atlanta's.\n\nThe growth is unlikely to fizzle any time soon. China's rising affluence and economic growth rates, despite a slowdown in the last year or two, remain well above those seen in the United States and Europe will keep airports busy.\n\n\"You have a large population that is close to entering the middle class and that has an increasing propensity to fly,\" Ms Gittens said. \"It's sheer arithmetic; that's what's playing out.\"\n\nAsians travel only one-tenth as much as people in Western Europe or the United States, said Corrine Png, head of Asia transportation research at JPMorgan Chase, based in Singapore. Ms Png forecasts that air traffic in the Asia-Pacific region will grow 6 to 7 per cent a year for the next three to five years. Beyond that, the expansion is likely to moderate as the market begins to mature, to about 5 per cent annually. But even that is well above the 2 per cent seen in the United States and the 3.5 per cent in Europe.\n\nLow-priced airlines, modelled on Southwest Airlines in the United States and EasyJet in Europe, have mushroomed in Asia, spurring air travel. Carriers like Cebu Pacific in the Philippines, Lion Air in Indonesia, VietJet Air in Vietnam, and AirAsia, which is headquartered in Malaysia and operates several subsidiaries elsewhere, now carry about one-quarter of air travellers in the region and fly to dozens of destinations that few Westerners would ever have heard of.\n\nThe travel rush has generated congestion at many Asian airports, as airlines vie not just for passengers but also for landing slots, aircraft engineers, baggage handlers and check-in staff. Unlike in Europe, where 45 per cent of the routes are served by just one or two airlines, three-quarters of the routes in the region are served by at least three airlines, and more than a quarter are served by at least five, said Andrew Herdman, director-general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.\n\nThe result, said Ms Png, is that \"air traffic has surpassed what planners originally anticipated. There are severe bottlenecks in some places\". - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The US recession was still a fresh memory, Europe remained mired in its sovereign debt crisis and there were still people betting on the end of the euro. In Japan, Shinzo Abe had just been elected prime minister. And gold was still viewed as a good hedge against global uncertainty.\n\nAs often happens, reality turned out to be quite different from expectations - in this case, substantially brighter. The benchmark S&P 500 jumped almost 30 per cent, the most since 1997. Buoyed by the potential positive impact of \"Abenomics\", the Japanese market did even better, with the Nikkei soaring 58 per cent - its best performance since 1972. The US economy recovered faster than most expected, with unemployment falling to a five- year low of 7 per cent by year-end, consumer confidence buoyant and housing prices firming. Gold was a victim of the US recovery, crashing 28 per cent after 12 successive years of increases. In the eurozone, the euro survived and a mild recovery got under way.\n\nLooking at how 2013 turned out, caution should be the watchword for anyone making predictions for 2014. But that said, it's worth pointing to some trends that are likely to continue into this year - and some risks. One trend that seems likely to persist is the US recovery. With monetary policy still loose (despite the start of \"tapering\" by the US Federal Reserve) and the fiscal position and job market improving, it would take an unexpected shock to derail the economy, which the Fed forecasts will grow at 2.8-3.2 per cent. That forecast seems reasonable. But whether a stronger economy will translate into another banner year for stocks is harder to call.

Henley Industrial Building, off Upper Paya Lebar Road, changed hands at $37 million. Pak Chong Building, another \"Business 1\" freehold development at Playfair Road was sold for $34.6 million.\n\n\"Industrial en bloc sales is a new trend that started in 2013. While we expect to see a few more coming onto the market in 2014, it is still expected to remain small,\" said Karamjit Singh, head of investments and residential, at Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nSerangoon Plaza's $400 million price tag made it the largest collective sale of a commercial property on record. Others that went through include San Centre at Chin Swee Road ($113 million) and Bright Chambers at Middle Road ($45 million).\n\nIn total, commercial deals shot up to $558 million in 2013, from $116.4 million the year before, while industrial deals contributed $117.4 million to the pot. No industrial collective sale deals were concluded in 2012.\n\nAs at Nov 6, total value of collective sale transactions for 2013 was $1.325 billion. While this is comparable with the $1.425 billion posted a year ago (after removing the failed attempt by Harbour View Gardens and Thomson View), it is worth noting that the number of successful deals fell from 25 to 15.\n\nAlex Oh, OrangeTee head of investments and advisory, expects developers to continue focusing on mixed development (residential/commercial), commercial and industrial projects, barring further policy changes and/or cooling measures. But this does not sound the death knell for the residential collective sales market.\n\n\"Smaller (residential) sites up to $50 million will continue to attract interest from developers, especially for sites with good attributes, but due to the slowdown in the market, especially in the residential sector, developers will be more price-sensitive going forward,\" said Mr Oh.\n\nUnsurprisingly, 2013's successful residential collective sales were generally of a smaller quantum.\n\n\"Developers prefer to be nimble as this allows them to react and respond better to changes in market conditions and any policy changes,\" said Tang Wei Leng, executive director of investment services, at Colliers International.\n\nDemand for private residential properties was much stronger in the mass market, with plenty of 99-year Government Land Sales (GLS) sites to choose from last year, pointed out JLL's Mr Singh.\n\nAs a result of this, residential transactions raked in about $650.2 million as at Nov 6, compared with $794.1 million a year ago. As a proportion of the total collective sales market, residential transactions fell to 49.1 per cent in 2013, from 85.3 per cent in 2011 and 55.7 per cent in 2012.\n\nThis could potentially change in the coming year however, with the government tapering supply through its GLS programme. Of the eight confirmed list sites, seven are private residential sites (including four executive condominium sites) and one commercial and residential site. In terms of pure residential sites, only seven will be rolled out in H1, from 10 previously.\n\nSeparately, it has been an eventful year in the courts, with the landmark cases of Harbour View Gardens and Thomson View making it clear that it was bad faith for either the Collective Sale Committee or the Marketing Agents to enter into any side agreements or sweeten the deal to entice owners to sign the Collective Sale Agreement, said Colliers's Ms Tang.\n\n\"The two cases are different but have the same effect in putting a stop to owners who try to hold out for more money,\" she said.\n\nThat said, the cases should not dampen collective sales as the spirit of it is to allow for rejuvenation to take place while enriching owners of properties that have reached value saturation point, said Ms Tang.\n\nIn the meantime, the tenders for two residential collective sales will close in January.\n\nJervois Gardens, which comprises two four-storey walk-up blocks, with 14 maisonettes and three apartments, on a 34,038 sq ft site, is on the market for about $72 million.\n\nEunosville, which could become the largest collective sale in six years, will also be closely watched. The 99-year leasehold property in Sims Avenue failed in its first attempt in June - the TDSR was introduced barely 10 days after the tender was first launched - and is back on the market for $688 million.\n\nThe tender for Eunosville closes at 2.30pm on Jan 14, while the one for Jervois Gardens closes at 3pm on Jan 22.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Dylan Tan\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Jan 30, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S no secret Chinese films released during the Lunar New Year season are often high on star power but low on everything else. More often that not, these blockbusters tend to be hit-and-miss affairs, though recent ones such as Eric Tsang's I Love Hong Kong franchise boasted better-than-usual plots instead of simply rehashing the same old family reunion theme that Raymond Wong's rebooted All's Well That Ends Well shamelessly did.\n\nBoth filmmakers have given their respective series a rest this year and in place are several new ones including King of Hong Kong trash cinema, Wong Jing, rebooting his God of Gamblers franchise from the 1990s. His latest, From Vegas to Macau, stars Chow Yun Fat as Magic Hands Ken, a casino security expert who can tell cards simply by touching them. He's forced to return to gambling when his daughter Rainbow (Kimmy Tong) is captured by Ko (Gao Hui), the cocky head of an underground gambling syndicate who has never lost a game of cards and is determined to test Ken's \"magic\" hands.\n\nNicholas Tse co-stars as Ken's protege and Rainbow's love interest while funnyman Chapman To provides ample comic relief. Like most of Wong's films, it mixes slapstick humour with action and to be fair, the nonsensical gambling action-comedy genre is something he pioneered and From Vegas to Macau is a throwback to that. Chow's natural charisma saves the film from going completely downhill with its pure absurdness. From Vegas to Macau is not the best bet but also not the worst this festive season.\n\nAlso being rebooted is Sandra Ng's Golden Chicken franchise. Golden Chickensss is the third instalment in the series and the first in a decade. While the first two films mixed social commentary with comedy, this new one goes mostly for mini-sketches in the first hour to allow its guest stars to play a series of hilarious roles; like Edison Chen as a sleazy Japanese brothel owner, Donnie Yen spoofing Wong Kar Wai's take on Ip Man and Louis Khoo hamming it up as a Mainland Louis Khoo impersonator.\n\nAny semblance of a plot only creeps in during the second half where Ng, reprising her role as the kindly prostitute, Kam, helps her old beau Gordon (Nick Cheung) get back on his feet in post-1997 Hong Kong after he's released from jail.\n\nPlot-wise, it's the weakest in the series but the endless cameos and sharply written jokes make up for things even if some of it are lost in translation with the Mandarin dubbing and English subtitles. But the stars' cameos alone definitely makes this whore-with-a-heart-of-gold tale worth revisiting.\n\nThe same can barely be said about Jack Neo's The Lion Men even though it features the same lovable cast from Ah Boys To Men. Instead of army recruits, they now play a band a brothers in the Tiger Crane lion dance troupe. Trouble starts to brew when their leader Supreme (Tosh Zhang) is banished because of a mistake he made and he goes on to form a new hip-hop lion dance hybrid group that will go up against Tiger Crane in a tournament.\n\nTo make things worse, both Supreme and Mikey (Wang Weiliang), who succeeds the former as the new leader of Tiger Crane, fall for the same girl, Xiao Yu (Eva Cheng). As if that's not complicated enough, she's also the daughter of the founder of Tiger Crane (Chen Tianwen) and the latter forbids her from dating boys from lion dance troupes.\n\nWith so much going on, it's no wonder Neo has split the film into two parts (the sequel opens during the March school holidays) but really there's no need for that if he had cut down on the blatant product placements and focused on tightening the draggy plot instead. Even the boys from the cast lose a bit of their natural charm here and resort to overacting to handle the drama. But like most of Neo's works, The Lion Men is review-proof and will probably do roaring business at the box office regardless.\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nRatings:\n\nFrom Vegas to Macau\n\n(B-)\n\n/ Golden Chickensss\n\n(B+)\n\n/ The Lion Men\n\n(C-)\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the first three quarters of 2013, going by data as at Dec 26, the number of caveats lodged for industrial property was 1,953, about 37 per cent lower than the same period last year.\n\nBut consultants also feel that more can still be done.\n\nNicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at SLP International, said that even as smaller sites and plots with shorter leases are being rolled out to cater to end users, land bids have been increasing.\n\nA 30-year leasehold site in Woodlands Industrial Park E9 launched last year drew 10 bidders and a top bid of $72.7 million or some $161 per square foot per plot ratio - a record price for a 30-year industrial plot, he noted.\n\nAnd even as more manufacturers are moving abroad (with a favourite being Johor, Malaysia and its upcoming Iskandar region) as a means of coping with higher costs, this is not a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n\"Not all are able to or would like to relocate their business operations to another country due to logistic and labour issues, as well as concerns over political risks and the unfamiliarity with the real estate or labour laws of another country,\" said Ms Chia.\n\nFurther, the line between traditional manufacturing and product-related services is becoming blurred in the wake of greater specialisation and with more work getting outsourced.\n\n\"The government therefore needs to ensure that manufacturing-related companies still have a place in Singapore's factories, and are not disqualified out-of-turn as commercial entities in today's evolving economy,\" said Ms Chia, who hopes the authorities can give greater detail on what the different requirements for business uses of industrial and commercial properties are.\n\nMr Mak suggested that void areas in strata industrial units not be classified as strata area. The \"void area\", which makes up saleable floor space but not GFA, refers to the horizontal empty space in a strata unit about three metres above the floor. (see diagram).\n\n\"That is why some developers like to build strata units with substantial amount of void area. They can sell the void area but it does not cost them in terms of GFA,\" he said.\n\nMr Mak also thinks industrial developers should face the same requirements as residential ones in providing a detailed breakdown of information in terms of the floor area for strata units.\n\nIn this year, the sense is that there will be a moderation in rentals and strata sales.\n\n\"Industrial property prices and rents could soften in 2014 - on the back of new market measures, loan policy tweaks and higher supply amid a cautiously optimistic economic outlook and industrialists' continued cost-conscious stance,\" said Ms Chia.\n\nSome 20.9 million square feet of space is due to come onstream, going by URA data - a historical high.\n\n\"While demand might be buoyed by a recovering manufacturing sector, there is the possibility that it might not be able to digest the high level of future and existing supply available,\" said Mr Sim, who expects industrial rents to face downward pressure.\n\nHe added that property measures have also \"sifted out most speculators\" and may lead to a more stable strata sales market.\n\nThe broad picture is unlikely to be too different from this year.\n\n\"We don't expect much change in the industrial property market landscape,\" said Mr Mak.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

US spot prices were about US$1,203.92 per ounce before the weekend.\n\nUOB attributed the lively retail market to changes in gold prices and the festive mood. Being able to take time off from work also contributed to the increase in retail purchases of gold.\n\nBeh Hsia Wa, director of UOB Bullion and Futures, said: \"Gold has always been a popular investment, especially for investors with a long-term outlook.\n\n\"Following the tax exemption on investment-grade gold in Singapore, there has been increased demand for physical gold.\"\n\nGold has come under pressure recently amid signals of modest growth in developed economies and the beginning of the end of US quantitative easing.\n\nA number of institutional investors are taking more cautious positions on the yellow metal.\n\nUOB Asset Management's views on gold for the first quarter of 2014 are neutral. It cited concerns that gold will look increasingly unattractive as US real rates turn increasingly positive once the US Federal Reserve starts to reduce monetary support. It added that the potential for a \"liquidity trap\" remains if higher rates stall US economic growth and prompt renewed levels of monetary support.\n\nVasu Menon, OCBC Bank's vice-president of wealth management in Singapore, advised caution on gold as tapering by the US Federal Reserve begins. This is likely to boost the US dollar further, which would be negative for gold. Bullion traditionally trades inversely to the US dollar.\n\nThe World Gold Council has also reported that the demand for gold fell 21 per cent in the third quarter of 2013 to the lowest level since 2009, as India took measures to curb imports.\n\nDBS Bank recommends that investors remain underweight on gold this year as the commodity remains expensive on an inflation-adjusted basis and it is no longer seen as an effective hedge against inflation/systemic risks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dance Company spearheading a uniquely Asian form of dance theatre with the use of the Chinese form of crosstalk.\n\nDancers will banter and exchange puns with one another and dance as well, in their own form of mashing crosstalk and contemporary dance.\n\nIt's a dance derived by the eight dancers, who come from Singapore, Taiwan, China, Australia and the Philippines, and the creation was a group effort, says Kuik Swee Boon, the artistic director of T.H.E.

Puns and allusions form the crux of crosstalk. In the production, Mandarin and English will be the main languages used, but also other languages and Chinese dialects such as Hokkien and Cantonese.\n\nThis full-length piece was developed by crosstalk; a short 20-minute piece was first performed at the NUS Arts Festival in 2012, choreographed by Wu.\n\nKuik said that it's a piece that's light-hearted as well as weighty because it refers to traditional Chinese culture, plus local issues. \"And what language can't really express, the body takes over,\" he adds. It's the most \"language-heavy\" piece the company has done, but also one that's easy to engage in.\n\n\"I never realised that my dancers could act so well until we did this piece.

When we build new hospitals that are state-of-the-art, these will require people who are skilled, and will also involve the PME (professionals, managers and executives) community,\" he said.\n\nOCBC's Ms Ling added that if social spending is done sustainably and effectively, it can \"promote growth, facilitate greater efficiency and alleviate some of the potential negative externalities associated with an ageing population\".\n\nArguably the most anticipated portion of Budget 2014, set for Feb 21, will be what Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam will reveal about the new Pioneer Generation Package.\n\nIt was at last year's National Day Rally that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong broached the move to develop such a package to recognise and help a special group of elderly and deserving Singaporeans.\n\nIn his annual Chinese New Year Message released this morning, he said that these are the seniors who saw Singapore through its most difficult times, having worked hard to build the country into what it is today.\n\nMP David Ong, a businessman by profession who has championed issues facing the elderly since his entry into politics in 2011, said many of these \"pioneers\" have, in many ways, been left behind as Singapore progressed over the years.\n\n\"Many would have missed out on the fruits of the nation's progress as their salaries were much lower then, and they have few safety nets such as savings and CPF.\n\n\"It is only right that we do what we can now for this group of people and share with them the successes of the country they helped to build,\" he said.\n\nOCBC's Ms Ling, while conceding that no one would begrudge having such a package for seniors, wondered whether this would be an ad hoc package or one that would pave the way for a more comprehensive support system for seniors and seniors-to-be on a rolling basis, as is the case with the Workfare scheme.\n\nAt a community event earlier this month, Mr Tharman disclosed that the Pioneer Generation Package would not be a \"one-year bonanza\"; rather, it would give its recipients sustainable help so that they can lead long, happy lives.\n\nKalyani Mehta, a social work academic who teaches Singapore's first Master's programme in gerontology at SIM University, expressed hope that the government would look beyond just healthcare provisions for the pioneers of this country.\n\nShe said: \"There should be more transport concessions or subsidies for their conservancy charges and PUB bills. These costs are going up, and any help would be most welcome.\"\n\nMr Ong said he would like to see the government restore the CPF contribution rate for older workers to plump up their retirement savings, and more incentives given to companies to retain and hire them.\n\nMr Tay said this is the right time for Singapore to invest more, given that the country is facing the twin challenges of an ageing society and a low fertility rate.\n\n\"We are making ourselves future-ready and future-proof. Now that we have a reasonably stable economy, we should start preparing while we can. We don't know how the global economy will turn out in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nAustralia and China call for more dialogue, cooperation at leaders\u2019 meeting\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:12 PM\n\nChina\u2019s economy slows as consumers tighten belts, US tariff risks mount\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:25 AM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nJapan\u2019s ruling coalition seen losing upper house majority: polls\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:25 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nTariff free or not, US cars could find less takers in Vietnam\u2019s tight, congested roads\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:20 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/3ef39cf0217a8e48a5766d891e74f55021de646088d7a3ff7e8e3fb3e6a519b0?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Lee U-Wen"}]}

The group will also be reclassified from \"Industrial Conglomerates\" to \"Real Estate Development\" under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) next month.\n\nTuan Sing shares closed unchanged at 28.5 cents yesterday before the results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The deal marked the first overseas investment in state land in 15 years.\n\nYields on Greece's 10-year government bonds have dropped to 8.38 per cent from a peak of 37 per cent in March 2012 and Moody's Investors Service raised the nation's credit rating by two levels last month, citing the country's progress in fiscal consolidation. Fitch Ratings increased its score for Greece to B- in May, six steps below investment grade.\n\n\"Stability and distancing from the grexit scenario has improved business sentiment with respect to real estate investment,\" said Ioannis Kaligiannakis, who is a co-founder of Redvis Ltd, an Athens-based property-valuation company.\n\nInvel Real Estate Partners last month agreed to buy most of National Bank of Greece's Pangaea property unit for 653 million euros in the country's largest ever property transaction. On Dec 10, the state privatisation fund chose the Jermyn Street Real Estate Fund IV as the preferred bidder for Astir Palace Vouliagmenis, a luxury-resort operator it jointly owns with the National Bank of Greece, after Jermyn Street bid 400 million euros for 90 per cent of the company.\n\nGreece, which had originally targeted 50 billion euros by 2015 from its state asset sales programme, has so far raised about four billion euros and directly collected 2.6 billion euros of that amount. That sparked criticism among European officials that the government isn't moving quickly enough to reduce debt.\n\nThe Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund has identified 40 uninhabited islands and islets that could be leased for as long as 50 years to generate income. The fund is currently marketing a 99-year lease for a larger project on the island of Rhodes that includes an 18-hole golf club.\n\n\"There is improved sentiment about investing in Greece,\" Andreas Taprantzis, the fund's executive director for real estate, said in an interview at Bloomberg's headquarters in New York on Dec 17. - WP, Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Of this, foreign employment contributed 1.6 percentage points to the growth.\n\nBy stripping out foreign domestic workers and construction workers, foreign employment contributed just 0.6 percentage point to the milder overall employment growth of 3.5 per cent, Citi research economists Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan found - suggesting that most of the foreign labour hired were lower-paid workers.\n\nAs at last December, locals accounted for about two-thirds of people employed in Singapore (excluding foreign domestic workers). Foreigners made up the rest.\n\nMeanwhile, unemployment stayed low and in line with economists' expectations, while income growth of Singaporeans strengthened over last year.\n\nThe annual average overall and citizen unemployment rates dipped to 1.9 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively, while the resident rate stayed unchanged at 2.8 per cent.\n\nIncome growth - which MOM measured using the nominal median monthly income of full-time employed citizens - also strengthened last year, amid the tight labour market.\n\nIt rose 7.1 per cent to $3,480 last June, better than the 5.8 per cent gain to $3,248 in the preceding year.\n\nAfter adjusting for inflation (which eased to an average of 2.4 per cent in 2013, versus 4.6 per cent in 2012), growth in real median income went up to 4.6 per cent in 2013, from 1.2 per cent in 2012.\n\nSeveral recent job surveys have pointed to weaker hiring intentions, but market watchers put this down to growing acceptance among companies that foreign worker tightening is here to stay.\n\nCIMB analyst Song Seng Wun added that hiring may be weak in sectors such as capital markets and manufacturing, but should remain brisk in the health sciences, hospitality, sales, marketing and the consumer clusters.\n\nUnemployment is expected to stay below 2 per cent this year while the local labour force's employment rate nudges higher. Companies are also likely to have to remunerate workers with higher salaries in the tight market.\n\nCiti's Mr Kit and Mr Tan believe more pro-productivity schemes may be needed, and the upcoming Budget in February is likely to extend and enhance the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme to help ease the pain of higher labour costs.\n\n\"We do not expect further foreign worker levy hikes as the current schedule already involves further hikes and quota cuts through 2016 - though further tightening on employment pass holders is possible,\" they said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As at end FY2013, 803 million units were in issue, versus 748.9 million units.\n\nUnitholders can expect to receive their DPU for Q4 along with their DPU of 2.13 cents for Q3, totalling 4.33 cents, on March 27.\n\nFor the quarter under review, net property income (NPI) rose 6.6 per cent to $25.8 million from $24.2 million a year ago while gross revenue rose 8.9 per cent to $41.2 million from $37.9 million.\n\nExcluding CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan, which is undergoing asset enhancement, the portfolio would have seen NPI grow 15.2 per cent, underpinned by rental reversions of 17.5 per cent, said Tony Tan, chief executive officer of CapitaRetail China Trust Management Limited, the manager of the real estate investment trust (Reit).\n\nIn yuan terms, gross revenue increased by 3.7 per cent to $202.6 million yuan while NPI rose 1.4 per cent to 126.5 million yuan.\n\nFor the full year ended December, DPU fell 5.5 per cent, from 9.54 cents to 9.02 cents, while income available for distribution rose 4.9 per cent to $70.1 million. NPI rose 3.4 per cent to $103 million, and gross revenue rose 4.9 per cent to $160.1 million.\n\nMeanwhile, asset enhancement works for CapitaMall Minzhongleyuan are on schedule and the mall is on track to reopen for business in the second quarter of this year. To date, more than 70 per cent of the mall's total net lettable area has secured leasing commitments, or are in advanced negotiations.\n\n\"With the completion of the acquisition of CapitaMall Grand Canyon on December 30 2013, the mall will start contributing income from this year. Since assuming joint management of the mall in July 2013, we have grown the mall's occupancy rate from 92.7 per cent to 95.9 per cent and recorded strong rental reversions averaging above 100.0 per cent,\" added Mr Tan.\n\n\"With the portfolio fully operational by the second half of this year, we are confident that CRCT will progressively set new milestones in the coming quarters,\" he added.\n\nCRCTML has elected to apply the distribution reinvestment plan to the distributions for the second half of 2013, which provides unitholders with the opportunity to receive distributions in the form of fully paid new units in CRCT instead of cash.

The median projection of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 13.8 per cent advance.\n\nA limited number of available properties is helping to sustain home price appreciation even as higher mortgage rates cool demand and leave purchases out of reach for some Americans. Further strides in the housing market this year would be made easier by a pick-up in job and income growth.\n\n\"Home prices have been doing exceptionally well,\" Eric Green, global head of foreign exchange and rates at TD Securities USA in New York, said before the report. The effect on prices from \"higher borrowing costs and downward pressure from more supply coming on is going to be balanced by the fact that you're going to continue to see the economy growing, incomes rising, and job growth.\"\n\nEstimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from year-over-year gains of 12.9 per cent to 14.7 per cent. The S&P/Case-Shiller index is based on a three-month average, which means the November figure was also influenced by transactions in October and September.\n\nHome prices adjusted for seasonal variations rose 0.9 per cent in November from October after a 1.1 per cent gain the prior month. That Bloomberg survey median called for a 0.8 per cent advance.\n\nThe month-over-month price gains were led by Atlanta and Miami, which showed a 1.6 per cent increase, followed by 1.3 per cent gains in Detroit, Boston and San Francisco. Property values rose in all 20 metropolitan areas, with the smallest advances coming in Phoenix and Seattle.\n\n\"Home prices continue to rise despite last May's jump in mortgage interest rates,\" said David Blitzer, chairman of the S&P index committee. \"Combined with low inflation - 1.5 per cent last year - homeowners are enjoying real appreciation and rising equity values.\"\n\nUnadjusted prices fell 0.1 per cent in November from the previous month after a 0.2 per cent gain in October. The year-over-year gauge, which uses records dating back to 2001, provides a better indication of price trends, according to Karl Case and Robert Shiller, creators of the index.\n\nAll 20 cities in the index showed a year-over-year gain, led by a 27.3 per cent advance in Las Vegas. Values climbed 23.2 per cent in San Francisco.\n\nAdvances in home equity may be harder to come by as Federal Reserve policymakers begin to trim stimulus, causing mortgage rates to climb. Fed officials said on Dec 18 that they would reduce monthly bond purchases intended to spur the expansion to US$75 billion from US$85 billion.\n\nPolicymakers were due to conclude a two-day meeting yesterday in Washington, and the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists calls for an additional US$10 billion of tapering.\n\n\"Home price appreciation has remained strong despite the decline in affordability,\" probably because of a lack of inventory, economists at Bank of America Corp in New York, said in a Jan 23 research report. \"That said, we continue to believe that price appreciation will slow into 2014 as investor demand declines and mortgage rates continue to head higher.\"\n\nBorrowing costs for prospective buyers have climbed since Fed officials last year signalled they would pare purchases of mortgage-backed securities and other bonds, a process that began this month. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

That is more than the 0.6 per cent increase forecast by economists in a Bloomberg survey. From a year earlier, prices climbed 8.8 per cent, the biggest annual increase since May 2010.\n\n\"The housing market is continuing to gather momentum on the back of further solid gains in employment, record-low mortgage rates and rising confidence,\" said Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide. \"The pick-up in activity appears to be fairly broad-based.\"\n\nSurging home prices prompted the Bank of England (BOE) to end support for home loans under its Funding for Lending Scheme in November. BOE markets director Paul Fisher said last week that sharply rising values are a potential source of financial instability, and officials \"should not risk adding policy oil to that particular fire\".\n\nConcern that a bubble may be forming comes as official data on Tuesday showed that the UK economy grew 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, capping the best year since 2007. While home prices are increasing, they are still about 4 per cent below their 2007 peak, Nationwide said.\n\nDemand has been partly fuelled by a government incentive programme known as Help to Buy, which guarantees loans to those who can only afford a small down payment. Nationwide said that first-time home buyers are \"a key driving factor\" in the market. UK mortgage approvals rose to 72,900 in December from 70,758 a month earlier, according to the median of forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. The BOE is due to publish the data today.\n\nBOE governor Mark Carney said last week that there is \"no immediate need\" to increase borrowing costs, after data showed that unemployment fell to 7.1 per cent, just above the 7 per cent level that policymakers set as a threshold for reviewing interest rates.\n\nThe labour market data \"raises the prospect of higher interest rates ahead\", Nationwide's Mr Gardner said. \"While we do not expect interest rates to rise until mid-2015, borrowers should be prepared for the prospect of interest rates increasing back towards more normal levels.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

We are in serious discussions with the government about what to do with the highway.\"\n\nThe Tokyo government and Metropolitan Expressway Co will spend 552.2 billion yen to build new roads and extend expressways, according to the Olympic bid documents.\n\nMitsui Fudosan is redeveloping about 309,100 square metres of floor space in Nihonbashi by 2019, the company said on its website. The Tokyo Stock Exchange and Nomura Holdings, Japan's largest securities firm, are based in the area.\n\nThe Muromachi Furukawa Mitsui and Muromachi Chibagin Mitsui buildings, the company's latest redevelopment in the area, will be completed by Feb 1, it said yesterday in a statement.\n\nAverage office rents in parts of Nihonbashi are 16,040 yen per tsubo, about half of the average in Marunouchi, the most expensive office area in Japan, broker CBRE Group said in a report.

The trouble is that they are talking \"at\" rather than \"to\" each other and it is more of a slanging match than a dialogue.\n\nThis tirade-trading could result, if not in an outbreak of \"war\" between Asia's two most important political and economic powers, then certainly in an accidental confrontation, and that could lead to wider conflict. Asia, and indeed the world, have been happy to ignore verbal and - occasionally - physical incidents which have been growing in number between Japan and China. \"They would never go to war; they depend too much upon each other\" has been the convenient fiction.\n\nYet, even Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reminded journalists in Davos last week that World War I broke out despite the strong economic relationship between Britain and Germany at the time. Equally disturbing were comments made last week by the commander of US forces in the Pacific, Samuel Locklear, who said that \"the calculation of risk can grow\" when major powers have a disagreement but are not talking to each other.\n\nThis disagreement, of course, centres upon the Senkaku islands in the East China Sea, which have become a bone of bitter contention since Japan effectively \"nationalised\" the isolated rocky outcrops in 2012. Relations deteriorated rapidly after that - a process that accelerated with China's decision to create an air defence zone over large areas of the East China Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, cat and mouse games involving both sides' marine vessels and fighter jets continue to escalate. Mr Abe's stepping up of military spending, creating a National Security Council, his talk of \"proactive\" self-defence and of revising Japan's pacifist post-war constitution, have all created the impression of heightened militarism. At the same time, he has sought to deflect any blame for such moves by taking every opportunity to point to China's own fast-rising military spending and to Beijing's increasingly assertive stance in the East China and South China seas. And so the \"blame game\" continues to escalate while other powers look on in dismay, taking comfort from the dubious assumption that Japan and China could never go to war when economic relations supposedly take precedence over all else.\n\nYet, as Adm Locklear pointed out, the people who have to make on-the-spot decisions that could lead to an incident \"in many cases are young naval officers or civilian mariners\". The US must encourage restraint by forces operating around the Senkaku Islands, while hoping for a diplomatic solution, he added.\n\nBut prospects for that seem slim, with Mr Abe saying only that his \"door is open\" to negotiation and China reluctant to knock on that door. Is it not time for Asean leaders - along perhaps with those from Australia, New Zealand and South Asia - to take the direct approach? Asian leaders, speaking directly and not through the usual diplomatic channels, could provide the kind of catalyst that might force the leaders of Asia's two politically and economically biggest powers to take more notice of regional and world opinion, if only to save face.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The doubters were soon proved wrong. Before too long, reporters from around Asia were flown out to Germany to witness the naming of the company's first newbuilding. I still have a model of the Star Leo in my office.\n\nStar and the other big cruise companies (notably, of course, Carnival) have turned the cruise business into a sector that seems to defy the cyclical nature of the rest of shipping.\n\nThat seems to have held good during the economic turbulence of the past few years, despite the Costa Concordia sinking and the accompanying very adverse publicity.\n\nNow UK-based Ocean Shipping Consultants (OSC) reports that, despite some challenges facing the cruise industry in the past 2-3 years, and the challenging situation facing the shipping industry overall, the cruise sector is enjoying rapid growth that is seeing dramatic changes shaping the profile of the industry.\n\nIn a new report, World Cruise Ports and Shipping to 2025, OSC says it expects global demand for cruising to grow strongly. It notes that new cruise terminals are being developed and cruise lines are introducing significant changes in the deployment of their capacity.\n\nOSC predicts that the equivalent of a total of 161 new vessels of an average 2,500-berth capacity will be required, in the years up to 2025. This is based on anticipated cruise passenger number growth worldwide of 68 per cent, from an estimated 21.7 million in 2013 to 36.4 million by 2025, though OSC also makes the point that average new vessel size continues to increase.\n\nVessel replacement\n\nActually, more ships will be needed because even cruise ships do not last forever. OSC says that the current seagoing cruise fleet has an average age of 20 years; and there are 47 ships that are over 40 years. So, as OSC notes: \"This presents a potentially significant source of demand for vessel replacement or repair in the coming years.\"\n\nI know where a significant number of old passenger ships can be found still working, although I am not sure whether they are included in OSC's statistics. Some veteran passenger ships can be seen in Hong Kong's anchorages, specialising in short trips for gamblers.\n\nThe chances are that some of the smaller older cruise ships discarded by the big players will find their way to this fleet. Incidentally, these old ships look well maintained, meaning that some repair yards must be getting their business.\n\nThat brings me to Singapore. OSC says that, with changing patterns of vessel deployment, the significance of the world's main cruise ship repair yards is also changing, and set for further development through the next decade. For example, it notes, the capacity deployed in Asia Pacific by major lines increased more than five-fold from 2003-2013, in comparison to just 36 per cent expansion in the Caribbean.\n\nIn other words, there are going to be more cruise ships operating in Asia that will need both routine maintenance and major refits.\n\nAnother development that is expected to spur ship upgrading work are the new emission controls. OSC says: \"Following the revised MARPOL regulations in 2010, all cruise ships berthing at or sailing in European and United States coastal waters will have to comply with the restrictions of the emission control areas (ECAs). This can be achieved through the installation of various scrubber systems at either the newbuilding stage or as a retro-fit. The implication is for more work for suitable (in terms of expertise and location) cruise repair yards.\"\n\nEmission controls\n\nIn fact, Hong Kong is bringing in emission controls now, and over the next decade passenger ships operating in Asia will increasingly come under the same pressure as those in North American and European waters.\n\nEven without the bonus of environmental refits, the existence of a large cruising fleet means a lot of work for repair yards, busy cruise terminals and a large source of seagoing employment.\n\nThe cruise sector has proved very resilient to challenges while the public, its customers, seem impervious to any worries about safety following high-profile incidents. That should not be taken as providing room for complacency; there are serious issues to address regarding the evacuation of very large cruise ships. Nevertheless, the cruising business is one part of the shipping industry that is doing well, and we should celebrate that.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As the latest incident caused only minor damage, Japan's Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry has no intention of taking such measures as suspending operations.\n\nYet, the cause of the trouble is still unknown and the ministry has begun investigating the case in cooperation with other entities, including the US Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe latest incident occurred on a JAL 787, which was being prepared for take-off on Jan 14 at Narita Airport. A mechanic detected white smoke coming out of the fuselage, and it was later found that its main battery in the front of the fuselage had overheated. The battery consists of eight lithium ion electric cells in a metallic container. The container had been partly deformed, and a stain, believed to be an electrolyte solution, had adhered to its side.\n\nBoeing has improved the batteries used in the 787s after last year's problems. Though the cause of overheating is unknown, the company identified about 80 factors that could lead to the cause. It came up with three safeguard measures: preventing batteries from overheating; preventing overheating in adjacent cells if a cell overheats; and preventing fire by having heat and smoke released from the fuselage.\n\nAlthough the 787s have been allowed to resume operations, the ministry is paying close attention to the latest problem, because it is similar to previous problems, including the fire and smoke emitted from batteries, which occurred on All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines planes in January last year.\n\nHowever, the latest problem differs greatly from those of last year in terms of the scale of damage. In last year's cases, the containers of the batteries became almost completely black and most of the eight cells were severely damaged. In the recent case, only one of the cells was said to have overheated, and the exterior was relatively unmarked, according to the ministry's Civil Aviation Bureau.\n\nThe ministry plans to analyse and examine the battery with the use of a CT scan. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The US banking giant's grey signage - along the side of the roof facing SBF Center next door - replaces the familiar green \"Capital Tower\" sign on the crown of the 52-storey building.\n\nAnother JP Morgan signage is expected to appear on the side of the roof facing Robinson Road - under terms for the bank's lease renewal at the Grade A, Green Mark Platinum office tower which took effect late last year. BT previously reported that JP Morgan renewed its lease at Capital Tower, though for a reduced space of about 150,000 sq ft - compared with the 200,000 sq ft under its earlier lease which expired towards the end of 2013. Under a front end-back end split, the US bank has also leased around 130,000 sq ft of business park space at One@Changi City. Its total real estate footprint in Singapore of around 280,000 sq ft is an increase of about 40 per cent.\n\nOver at Capital Tower, JP Morgan does not have exclusive roof signage rights. BT understands that \"CapitaLand\" signages will go up in due course on the other two sides of the building's crown - facing Cecil Street and Tanjong Pagar MRT Station.\n\nLast August, the property giant said that it would relocate all its strategic business units in Singapore to its headquarters at Capital Tower. The property group's units are now spread over several locations in Singapore, including Robinson Point, AXA Tower and Wilkie Edge, in addition to Capital Tower.\n\nIn the meantime, the Capital Tower name can be seen at street level at the building's entrance.\n\nCapitaCommercial Trust (CCT), which owns the property, began asset enhancement works in mid-November last year. Slated for completion in the second quarter of next year, the works include an upgrading of the main and mezzanine lobbies and restrooms.\n\nCertain technical specifications of the building are also set to be modernised. In addition, the main lobby will allow for a separate concierge for the major tenants of the building, and a turnstile system will be introduced to enhance security access. Including chiller replacement, the entire upgrading is expected to cost $40 million and generate a projected return on investment of 7.8 per cent, according to information released by CCT earlier.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last week rates for the transport of 40-foot containers from Asia to the US West Coast stood at US$4,220.\n\nExecutive administrator Brian Conrad from TSA acknowledged the difficulty of raising rates in a highly competitive market, but said that carriers have left a lot of money on the table in this market as partially successful increases have been eroded over time. \"There is now a growing sense that pent-up demand, depleted retail and business inventories, and a greater overall sense of economic security are converging in 2014. Lines are determined not to miss that opportunity,\" Mr Conrad said in the statement.\n\nFreight rates plunged to loss-making levels last year as a result of overcapacity in the market.\n\nFounded in 1989, the TSA calls itself a \"research and discussion forum of major container shipping lines\" serving the trade from Asia to the US.\n\nLiner shipping was previously organised in similar groups called \"liner conferences\" which met to discuss market conditions, freight rates and other common concerns.\n\nBut the European Union decided in 2006 to ban the practice as against competition rules and the ban took effect in 2008. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

With average urban incomes around 2,500 yuan a month, the prospect of making twice that much is enough to delay seeing their relatives.\n\n\"I may go and see the family in the summer when I will have more money ... and it won't be so cold then,\" said Ms Tian, huddling against the radiator. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

A respective $0.2 million decrease in administrative expenses and finance costs also contributed to higher profits.\n\nPartial repayment of loans and lower average interest rate led to a 9.4 per cent cut in the company's finance costs.\n\nEarnings for the quarter increased to 0.49 cent from 0.41 cent\n\nThe group said that hotel room revenue fell $0.2 million from the previous year as Fragrance Hotel - Elegance ceased operations after its tenancy agreement expired in November last year, leading to a $0.1 million loss in revenue. Although the remaining hotels contributed $0.6 million less in revenue, this was partially offset by higher revenue recognised from Fragrance Hotel - Ruby's post asset enhancement works.\n\nFor the full year, net profit climbed 5 per cent to $19.37 million while revenue inched up 0.8 per cent to $60.6 million.\n\nAs at Dec 31, 2013, Global Premium Hotels has cash and cash equivalents of $11.6 million, compared with $15.3 million a year ago.\n\nThe group expects tourists arrivals to remain relatively stable due to more Meetings, Incentive Travel, Conventions & Exhibitions (MICE) events and biennial events in the year ahead. However, it expects a challenging year because of growing hotel room supply and economic uncertainties.\n\nThe company proposed a final dividend of 0.26 cent per share, down from 1.01 cents a year ago.\n\nGlobal Premium Hotels shares closed up half a cent at 26.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All have been appointed for five years.\n\nA total of 16 pre-schools applied to be part of the scheme, after the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) called for proposals in June last year.\n\nThe new appointments will go some way in achieving the government's aim of creating 20,000 new childcare places by 2017. Collectively, the five anchor operators are expected to provide around 16,000 additional pre-school spots by then.\n\nIn selecting two for-profit childcare centres for the scheme, the government has made a distinct departure from its previous eligibility criteria, under which operators were required to be not-for-profit bodies.\n\nNoting that for-profit operators \"should not (be) ruled out\" if they can provide affordable, accessible and high-quality childcare services, Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing said yesterday that having a diverse group of operators would help to inject \"innovative ideas\" into the sector.\n\nJust as MY World was chosen for its strong sense of social mission, ECDA said, E-Bridge's strengths lay in its robust curriculum, while Skool4Kidz exhibited an outstanding commitment to the professional development of teachers.\n\nMr Chan added that safeguards have been put in place to ensure that government funds are not squandered. E-Bridge and Skool4Kidz are newly created legal entities, separate from EtonHouse and Kinderland, respectively. They will be subject to routine audits to ensure compliance with the Anchor Operator Scheme rules.\n\nAdded Mr Chan: \"I think they have made the commitment that the profit motive cannot be their No 1 objective. They're selected because they want to serve a higher goal, which is to provide quality development opportunities for our young children.\"\n\nIn exchange for the preferential allocation of choice HDB sites at subsidised rentals, and recurring government grants to offset costs such as teachers' salaries, anchor operators must not charge more than $720 per month for a full-day childcare programme. That means fees will be capped at rates much lower than the industry median, which stood at $830 in December.\n\nThey must also serve the needs of children from disadvantaged backgrounds, through the disbursement of scholarships and other assistance initiatives.\n\nEnrolment for the new centres will begin when the first anchor operators' centres come up in the second half of this year. ECDA said that the focus would be on high-demand estates first; these include Woodlands, Punggol, Sengkang, Tampines, Bukit Panjang and Jurong West.\n\nWhile Mr Chan said that it would be \"too premature\" to say whether more anchor operators would be added in the future, he did not rule out the possibility of that happening.\n\nHe added that additional announcements on manpower development plans would be made \"in due course\", with a focus not just on attracting more people into the sector, but also on retaining them.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The analysis also reveals the complexities of some of the issues, such as foreign- worker policies, that have occupied the nation.\n\nINFOGRAPHIC: Click here for 10 years of Budget Speeches\n\nIn the years since the Global Financial Crisis, two dynamics have dominated Mr Tharman's annual Budget speeches: raising productivity on the one hand, and inclusiveness on the other.\n\nBeginning in 2010, a $2 billion National Productivity Fund was created as the country emerged from recession and turned towards the future. The efforts were emphasised in 2011, when the goal of raising real incomes by 30 per cent over 10 years was stated. In 2012, foreign-worker quotas were cut, and in 2013, those policies were tweaked but not substantially relaxed despite loud complaints from certain industries.\n\n\"We are no longer a developing economy, but we have not achieved the level of productivity and income of an advanced economy,\" Mr Tharman said in 2013.\n\nBut the government has also sought to balance the productivity drive with stronger social initiatives for the young, the old and the poor centred around the buzzword \"inclusiveness\". The elder segments of the population, in particular, have seen initiatives targeted specifically for them in the past three Budgets.\n\nAlthough past Budgets have mostly sought to be progressive, inclusiveness has not always been a big issue. The 2004 Budget, for example, was notably a business-friendly package aimed at rejuvenating the economy, which was just emerging from the 2003 outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) crisis and the 2001 bursting of the tech bubble.\n\nIt was in that light that then-Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced the creation of the S Pass for skilled foreign workers to address businesses' struggles with finding talent. Keeping the foreign-worker spigot too closed would crimp the economy's ability to expand, it was reasoned.\n\n\"For our economy to grow, companies must be able to recruit skilled workers,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nThe rhetoric is different these days. In 2012, with the heartland still smarting from major MRT train disruptions, Mr Tharman said: \"Our increasing dependence on foreign workers is not sustainable. It will test the limits of our space and infrastructure, despite our efforts to build more housing and expand our public transport system.\"\n\nThe analysis of past Budgets also unearths interesting nuggets about the Global Financial Crisis. The 2007 Budget was clearly optimistic, with the looming housing crisis in the United States seen mostly as a serious but distant risk. A year later, those concerns had grown to the extent that the 2008 Budget was relatively conservative and appeared to be storing surpluses for a rainy day.\n\nThat conservatism proved to be wise as the crisis hit in 2008. Even so, the 2009 Budget showed how accurate forecasting can be a challenge for even the best of us.\n\n\"Like other governments and the vast majority of private forecasters, we did not anticipate the speed and scale of the deterioration in the global economy in the last six months,\" Mr Tharman said in 2009.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nAustralia and China call for more dialogue, cooperation at leaders\u2019 meeting\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:12 PM\n\nChina\u2019s economy slows as consumers tighten belts, US tariff risks mount\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:25 AM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nJapan\u2019s ruling coalition seen losing upper house majority: polls\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:25 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nTariff free or not, US cars could find less takers in Vietnam\u2019s tight, congested roads\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:20 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM", "images": []}

The legal industry recruited 68 IP lawyers and the technology industry in Singapore employed 100 new IP managers. Also, as a result of more R&D (research and development) offices being established or relocated to Singapore, the IP service providers saw more than 80 new patent and trademark agents coming into the market. Finally, the business advisory service sector hired 54 more business consultants practising IP.\n\nAn IPOS spokeswoman said that there is a healthy interest and confidence in Singapore's IP and innovation landscape. This trend is significant in the light of the announcement by Minister for Law, K Shanmugam, to establish Singapore as an IP Hub in Asia in 2012.\n\nA key driver has been the increase in demand for IP services. More high-technology companies, especially in the area of chemistry and biotechnology are coming to Singapore. Trademark and patent filings at the close of 2013 continued to register positive increase, according to IPOS. The total trademark applications have increased by close to 15 per cent over the past two years amounting to some 40,000 trademark applications last year.\n\nPatent applications by locals have also seen an increase of around 6 per cent last year. In 2012, Singapore was ranked within the world's top 20 patent offices in terms of the volume of applications received.\n\nTan Yih San, IPOS CEO, said that the organisation is enthused by the improved condition and good jobs created in the IP Industry in Singapore. \"This is a strong indicator of various efforts undertaken to shore up the IP industry as we move towards a knowledge-based economy.\n\n\"We will continue to work closely with all stakeholders and partners in the IP industry to build a better Singapore with IP. The journey towards becoming an IP hub in Asia has been as exciting and fulfilling as ever,\" Mr Tan added.\n\nLast year, the UK's IP Office (UKIPO) and the French National de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle (INPI) located their regional IP Office/attach\u00e9 in Singapore.\n\n\"Singapore's skilled manpower resources offer a supportive environment to service the growing needs of foreign businesses that are expanding into Asia. Flourishing trade relations between the East and West also put Singapore in an excellent position to play a facilitative, bridging role for regional and international IP and business transactions,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Salaries, in general, are likely to remain at the same level as in 2013 for employees who choose to stay on with existing employers though, it added.\n\nThe annual Global Salary Survey, released last week, is in its 15th year running and its findings were based on the analysis of Robert Walters' permanent, interim and contract placements made across the 24 countries it has a presence in.\n\nHowever, not everyone in the cloud computing arena will benefit from the increasing dependence on such technologies. Joel Hides, associate director at Robert Walters Singapore, told BizIT in a recent interview that companies have been moving their back offices and operations to cheaper regional markets. This, in turn, is negatively impacting the job prospects of tech professionals limited to these commoditised areas within organisations' IT environments.\n\nThe findings showed that locally based foreign banks, for example, restructured at the senior level in 2013, with the majority moving their commoditised skill sets to places such as Malaysia and India. \"There are less opportunities going forward for such executives as there are now more candidates in the lower end (of the skills spectrum),\" Mr Hides noted.\n\nThis dampened demand for those with limited skill sets can be seen in the starting salaries projected for 2014. For instance, systems administrators commanded a pay package starting at S$70,000 per annum, but this has dropped to S$48,000 per annum for this year. Database administrators, too, have seen their base pay reduced from S$100,000 to S$72,000 per year, the study showed.\n\nAnother area that IT professionals would do well to pay attention to is the customer experience arena. Mr Hides said that large companies, particularly in the financial services and FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) industries, are increasingly focusing their efforts on improving their customer engagements online.\n\nAn internal survey revealed that consumers' view of the usability of such engagement platforms has deteriorated since 2012, and this will be an area where companies will be looking to enhance in the next 12 months.\n\n\"Companies also believe providing good customer experience online would lead to more business,\" the executive said, highlighting the importance of software developers well-versed in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) skills.\n\nHow these developers fare in terms of salary will depend on their skills and the industry they work in. For instance, the salary survey found that Java, .NET and C++ developers are likely to see a wage range of S$72,000 to S$120,000 for 2014. In contrast, the range was between S$80,000 and S$90,000 the year before.\n\nThe wide range suggests that the more effective one is in bridging the gap between the latest technology and the right business tools to engage consumers, the higher the remuneration, the executive added.\n\nAny pay increment for local workers will have to be seen in the light of the soon-to-be-introduced Fair Consideration Framework, which requires companies to consider local candidates before Employment Pass (EP) holders. This is expected to drive higher salary levels in both the permanent and contract recruitment scene once it becomes active in August, the firm noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Today, companies across all industries have to posit a framework to manage their compliance amid the increasing number of rules and regulations.\n\nApart from the Companies Act, a listed company in Singapore has to observe the provisions of the Securities and Futures Act, and the rules of the SGX Listing Manual. Those operating in certain industries are further subject to regulations applicable to those sectors, such as the Banking Act for banks, the Telecommunications Act for telecom companies and the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act for newspaper companies.\n\nIn addition, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has issued a Code of Corporate Governance that listed companies must comply with, or explain the instances where they have not and the reasons for doing so.\n\nWhenever a new rule is introduced, it tends to be received as just another burdensome requirement for companies, with some rules being viewed as more burdensome than others.\n\nFor example, one recently introduced rule that was viewed as particularly problematic was Rule 1207(10) of the SGX Listing Manual. This rule requires the board to express \"an opinion on the adequacy of internal controls, addressing financial, operational and compliance risks\". Given the broad implication of the rule, boards, together with their professional legal and accounting advisers, spent much time and energy to work out acceptable responses.\n\nRule 1207(10) came into effect in September 2011 and made mandatory what was previously recommended good practice by the Code of Corporate Governance. The Code's recommendation in this area (Guideline 11.3) was also updated in May 2012 for the board to comment on both \"the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal controls\".\n\nA recent ISCA-KPMG Risk Management study found that compliance with the non-mandatory Code shot up from 23 per cent to 98 per cent after the mandatory Rule 1207(10) was introduced.\n\nWhile regulations clearly drive compliance - and perhaps anxiety and angst for directors and management - the question is whether it should be so.\n\nThere are perhaps two ways to view regulations: as laws to be followed otherwise there will be heavy penalties, or they are the right things to do.\n\nTake, for example, littering. In Singapore, litterbugs can be fined up to $1,000 for the first conviction and up to $5,000 for repeat convictions. In addition, litterbugs can be ordered to pick up litter in public for up to 12 hours. Some observers have wondered whether Singapore will be as clean if there are not such harsh penalties for littering - and if there is no army of street sweepers to clear the streets daily.\n\nJapan, which also boasts of very clean streets, seems to depend less on anti-littering laws. A Japanese movie, Departures, which I saw a few years ago, perhaps illustrates the psyche of the Japanese in this respect. In one scene, a mortician is seen stuffing his cigarette into a portable mini ashtray that he carries in his jacket instead of simply flipping the stub onto the ground. It was a three-second scene, but it spoke volumes of the Japanese attitude towards littering. The average Japanese does not litter because it is the right thing to do, and not because there is a penalty for doing so.\n\nIn this light, boards and management should therefore examine the underlying value of specific rules instead of just viewing them as burdensome requirements to be complied with.\n\nIf a rule does not appear to make sense, then directors and management could add their voice and weight to having the rules removed or moderated.\n\nSID seeks to assist in this respect. For example, when Rule 1207(10) was introduced, SID organised feedback sessions with its members, hosted several seminars on the revised Code, and made representations to the authorities. Following such feedback, the SGX issued clarifications and a practice note on Rule 1207(10) to provide more practical guidance on its compliance.\n\nOnce boards and management accept that a rule represents guidance as to the right thing to do, they would have internalised the requirement; and compliance then comes naturally.\n\nIn summary, the right spirit towards compliance is for boards and management to, first, want to do the right thing, and then to work with the regulators, the industry and SID to ensure that the rules actually encompass those right things. Companies should then comply with the rules from the standpoint of alignment with them and not just because the penalties for not doing so can be harsh.\n\nThe writer is a member of the Governing Council of the Singapore Institute of Directors\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The two-year-old site was launched in late 2011, and has raised US$10 million to date across its first three seed rounds, as well as its Series A round that it closed in July last year.\n\nA bridge round is Silicon Valley lingo for a round of funding that comes between two significant rounds. This bridge round is expected to sustain RedMart as it prepares to raise its Series B, which it said will close in the next five months.\n\nBy raising funds every half a year or so, RedMart's pace of fundraising is higher than the typical dotcom in Singapore, but the company needs to keep its capital-intensive operations running.\n\nThe company owns its own warehouse infrastructure and logistics dispatch, and it built the software to manage it as well. Its delivery vans are outfitted with mobile devices that direct them to optimised delivery routes, and report back to the warehouse as well, so users can get status updates on their deliveries.\n\nRedMart CEO Roger Egan said in reports that the company has been outgrowing its existing resources at a faster than expected pace, and needed the bridge round to grow its warehouse space and buy more delivery trucks to add to its current fleet of 16, to cope with growing user demand in the island state.\n\nMr Egan had said in July that the company was turning over about US$5 million in annual sales, across average basket sizes of S$75 per user.\n\nRevenue is growing at about 20-30 per cent each month, and the company has grown from 75 employees to 115.\n\nHe estimated that in Singapore, the online groceries and sundries market was worth a whopping US$5.2 billion, which the company intends to tap into quickly.\n\nRedMart competes with several large players in Singapore such as NTUC FairPrice, which has an online site at www.fairprice.com.sg, and Order Online, at www.orderonline.sg.\n\nThe RedMart team has a number of Web veterans onboard, including Todd Kurie, former marketing director at eBay, who was hired in 2012 as RedMart's vice-president for marketing. In July, it announced that it had hired Tim Klem, who used to be the product manager of logistics at 1990s dotcom bust Webvan; Trudy Fawcett, who was a buyer at Sainsburys supermarkets in the UK; and Howie Chang, who was head of user interface design at Viki.\n\nViki is a fellow Singapore-based startup that rocked the industry in September last year when it was acquired by Japanese Internet giant Rakuten for US$200 million.\n\nThis round of bridge funding for RedMart was led by Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin; Property Guru founders Steve Melhuish and Jani Rautiainen; Joyful Frog Digital Incubator co-founder Wong Meng Weng; The Lo & Behold Group founder Wee Teng Wen; and Lion Rock Capital.\n\nMr Saverin said on his investment in RedMart: \"I believe that time-starved consumers will increasingly value convenience in purchasing their daily essentials. The logistics and technology platform the RedMart team is building extends far beyond selling groceries in Singapore.\"\n\nRedMart was started by Mr Egan and Vikram Rupani, who started working on the project during their Insead MBA programmes in 2010. Later, they managed to court Skype co-founder Toivo Annus to come onboard for one of their seed investment rounds.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Closed on Sundays and public holidays\n\nFOR a city that is supposed to be predominantly Chinese, it's harder than you think to find independent Chinese restaurants in Singapore that don't fall under the umbrella of big guns such as Imperial Treasure or Crystal Jade. It's as if a home-grown chef would sooner open a modern European bistro or at most dabble in \"mod-Sin\" cuisine than get behind a wok and serve up comforting family-style Chinese recipes in trendy surroundings - or at least where the toilets don't strike terror in your bladder.\n\nThere are a couple that we can think of, such as Blue Lotus and Home, and now there's Tao Seafood Asia - which attempts to look like an upscale Cantonese-style eatery but actually hides a down-to-earth Singaporean warmth within.\n\nYou don't see it initially - literally - because it's hidden in the huge Asia Square Tower 2 food court dominated by salad bars, Mexican, Korean and ramen fast-food joints. In fact, with its large red signage and dressy surroundings, Tao stands out like an awkward guest who shows up at a beach party dressed in a three-piece suit.\n\nIt looks more towkay-ready than a quick lunch-hour spot for the Shenton Way crowd; nonetheless, the hospitable staff make you feel comfortable whether you're ordering a dish with rice or a full banquet meal.\n\nA name such as Tao Seafood Asia sounds like some fancy restaurant group, but it's actually the maiden venture of general manager/owner Adrian Lee, who started it with his father, a retired Chinese restaurant chef. For sure, it's not as slick as the big guys, but what it lacks in polish, it makes up for with thoughtful service, from the way the staff anticipate your cutlery needs to little touches such as offering you a ziploc for your mobile phone to protect it from any food spills.\n\nGranted, our expectations are initially very low, but we're soon won over by the robust cooking that's got a zi char feel to it - more rustic than refined, and boasting a fair amount of wok hei. It's Chinese food with a local touch and an anything-goes casualness to it.\n\nWhile its house special is the $68 signature shark's fin or fish maw soup (which they push quite extensively), you can also find joy in homey fare such as crispy deep-fried fish skin given a quick toss in a salted egg yolk sauce ($10), pot-roasted chicken in rice wine ($20) or the signature stewed rice vermicelli ($24).\n\nThe fish skin makes for an addictive snack despite a general oiliness, probably because of the slick of salted egg yolk that coats each crunchy piece. It isn't too salty, which means you'll be hard put to stop crunching on the stuff. Dunk it in the Thai-inspired green chilli dip on the table for extra kick. If you're a rice freak, you're going to need copious amounts of it to go with the pot-roasted chicken - juicy chunks of thigh meat infused with rice wine and cooked in a claypot over an open fire until the chicken is caramelised in the pot itself with an intense gravy. The flavour is one-dimensional after a while and the sauce is a little too salty but that is solved once the gravy is mixed into some white rice.\n\nChilli and pepper crab are among its signature dishes, and the chilli version packs enough heat in a sweet, tomato-based gravy. For the sake of convenience, we order the shelled crab claw (a pricey $18 each) which isn't as meaty or superfresh as we would like, served with a deep-fried mantou for dipping.\n\nApart from a serviceable spinach in superior broth ($18) with tiny cubes of salted and century egg, what seals the deal for us is the house special stewed noodles - the main reason for any return visit.\n\nThin beehoon gets a sheen from soaking up the goodness of the lightly thickened gravy covered with prawns, squid and (somewhat dry) crabmeat, topped off with a strong whiff of wok hei.

With the exception of the subindex for prices of completed non-landed private homes, which remained unchanged in Q4, the other sub-indices fared worse in Q4 than they did in Q3.\n\nIt was a similar story for URA's private residential rental indices. The overall rental index dipped 0.5 per cent in Q4, on the back of rising supply and moderating demand - marking the first decline since Q3 2009. Prior to this fall, the index had climbed 27.5 per cent between Q3 2009 and Q3 2013, observed Jones Lang LaSalle national director Ong Teck Hui.\n\nIn Q4 last year, 3,631 private homes received a Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP), taking the full-year tally to 13,150 units - the highest level since 14,000-plus units completed in each of 1997 and 1998. The ramp-up in housing completions is expected to continue, with 17,540 units this year, 21,299 next year and 27,321 in 2016.\n\n\"While completed new supply has been building up, demand has not kept pace as expat hiring has been more selective. The number of employment passes as at June 2013 has dropped some 2 per cent from December 2011,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nSome market watchers say that prospects for rental demand are unclear as it is not certain whether tightening in expat hiring will continue. \"As Singapore's economy scales up, the demand for skilled labour especially for higher-value services will grow. We may have to take in more expats for these roles,\" suggested an analyst.\n\nURA figures yesterday showed that developers sold 3,854 private homes in the October to December period last year in both primary and secondary markets - the lowest volume since Q4 2008, when only 1,639 units were transacted during the global financial crisis, noted Mr Ong. Transaction volumes halved from 14,755 units in the first half of last year to 7,873 in the second half after the rollout of the TDSR framework made it difficult for buyers to obtain financing.\n\nIn the primary market, developers sold 14,948 private homes last year, one-third below 2012's record volume of 22,197 units.\n\nAn interesting trend in Q4 is that across all three regions - Core Central, Rest of Central and Outside Central - prices of uncompleted non-landed private homes fared worse than completed ones, perhaps a reflection of developers trimming prices in their projects to move units. In contrast, individual owners of completed properties may be less inclined to do so.\n\nFor the full year, URA's overall private home price index ended 1.1 per cent higher - a smaller gain than 2012's 2.8 per cent.\n\nThis year, most market watchers are betting on a price fall, with developers' sales hovering at 10,000-14,500 units.\n\nSavills Singapore research head Alan Cheong, however, continues to believe that barring external shocks, \"buying momentum can be regained\".\n\n\"The unknown factor is how many potential buyers there are out there, with the means to purchase an investment property even with TDSR and the lower loan-to-value limit, but who have held back in the hope of lower prices,\" he said. \"The cauldron could already have been stirred because with the H1 2014 Government Land Sale supply reduced and if prices hold up or even rise, those holding back may be forced to show their hands.\"\n\nFigures from JTC - which has taken over URA's role on compiling and releasing statistics on industrial properties - showed a 3.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter decline for the All Industrial price index in Q4, compared with a 2.8 per cent rise in Q3. For the full year, the index climbed 3.2 per cent, significantly slower than a 25.8 per cent hike in 2012.\n\nKnight Frank executive director (industrial) Lim Kien Kim noted that the industrial property market has started to turn following the introduction of seller's stamp duty for this sector in January 2013, as well as the TDSR framework in late-June which finally reined in exuberance in this once bubbly market segment. The Industrial Government Land Sales Programme has also been ramped up. Mr Lim predicts an up to 10 per cent fall in strata industrial property prices this year. Rents for industrial space will probably ease 7-10 per cent, he added.\n\nJTC's multi-user factory rent index dipped 1.4 per cent in Q4, against a 4.4 per cent rise in the previous quarter.\n\nURA's office rental index climbed 0.5 per cent in Q4, a slight moderation from the 0.8 per cent increase in Q3.\n\nColliers International noted that the slower pace of rental growth during the quarter was in line with a moderation of net new demand to 323,000 sq ft in Q4, compared with 495,000 sq ft in Q3.\n\n\"Nonetheless, although full-year 2013 net new demand for office space was also lower at 1.3 million sq ft (the lowest annual take-up in four years), compared with the 1.9 million sq ft absorbed in 2012, new space absorption - on the back of improving market conditions and higher asking rents by landlords - provided support for rents to recover 1.3 per cent for the whole of 2013, annulling the 1.3 rental fall in 2012,\" said Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers.\n\nSimilar to the islandwide rental trend, URA's data shows that the price growth of office space eased for the third consecutive quarter to 0.5 per cent quarter on quarter in Q4 last year, halving the one per cent growth in Q3 2013. \"This is largely due to decelerating transaction activities as a result of the imposition of the TDSR,\" said Ms Chia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the full year ended December, the amount retained was $3 million.\n\nFor the quarter under review, net property income (NPI) rose 3.4 per cent to $38.8 million while revenue rose 3.6 per cent to $49.1 million.\n\nFor FY2013, DPU rose 13.9 per cent, from 4.39 cents to five cents. Income to be distributed to unitholders rose 22.8 per cent, from $85.3 million to $104.8 million.\n\nIn terms of portfolio performance, the Reit's Singapore portfolio, comprising interests in Wisma Atria and Ngee Ann City, contributed 65.8 per cent of total revenue while NPI grew 13.1 per cent to $102.6 million in FY2013. This was supported by positive rental reversions of 8.1 per cent and full-year contribution of the asset redevelopment units at Wisma Atria Retail, which increased NPI by 5 per cent in Q4. Meanwhile, the office portfolio enjoyed a high occupancy of 99 per cent and achieved a positive rental reversion of 12.3 per cent based on leases committed between January and December 2013.\n\nSeparately, the Malaysian portfolio contributed 15.1 per cent of total revenue. NPI for FY2013 was $29.4 million, 2.1 per cent lower than FY2012.\n\nOver in Australia, the portfolio contributed 9.3 per cent of total revenue in FY2013. NPI for FY2013 was $14.7 million, an increase of 21.6 per cent year-on-year, with the contribution from Plaza Arcade which was acquired in Q1 offsetting the depreciation of the Australian dollar against the Singapore dollar.\n\nRenhe Spring Zongbei Property in Chengdu, China, contributed 7 per cent of total revenue. NPI for FY2013 was $8.3 million, a decline of 16.1 per cent due to increased competition and higher promotional costs.\n\nIts six properties in Japan contributed 2.8 per cent of the group's total revenue. NPI was $2.8 million, a drop of 50.7 per cent mainly due to the depreciation of the Japanese yen, provision for rental arrears, and divestment of Roppongi Primo in Q1.\n\nOverall, NPI for the year grew 6.3 per cent to $157.9 million and gross revenue grew 7.9 per cent to $200.6 million.\n\nThe counter lost half a cent yesterday, to end trading at 76 cents, before the release of its financial results.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The foundation has a controlling stake of about 70 per cent in the club, but the latter owes Bankia more than 200 million euros (S$350 million).\n\n''Peter Lim's interest in Valencia is not financial and he has never expressed any interest in the acquisition of credits. He had presented an offer to all the parties involved (including Bankia) on Dec 10, 2013. The offer was premised upon the acquisition of the shares in Valencia FC held by the Valencia Foundation and aimed at a global project for the club. In Peter's view, such a project cannot be implemented without the involvement of the controlling shareholder and the management of the club,'' Mr Lim's spokesman said.\n\n''The offer, if accepted, would have put the Club on a sound platform for future growth,'' the spokesman added.\n\nThis would be the third time Mr Lim has failed to buy over a league club, having previously lost out in his takeover of England's Liverpool FC and Spain's Atletico Madrid.\n\nThe rejection came as no surprise to market observers, given the large investment in the financially-strapped club and a sale which comes with political implications and vested interests of the various parties involved.\n\nMr Lim, worth around US$2 billion, had submitted his offer on Dec 10, 2013 at Bankia's headquarters in Valencia, just hours before the General Shareholder's Meeting. But on Jan 15, Bankia revealed it had received ''multiple bids'' that were more attractive than his.\n\nHis offer had been supported by the club's president, Amadeo Salvo. His bid included 90 million euro in shares, 120 million euro to pay off the Bankia loan and a promise to invest 40 million euro in new players during the winter transfer window. The latter was bumped up to 50 million euro earlier this month.\n\nIt was also reported that Mr Lim's offer included the significant sums the club owe for the building of the Nou Mestalla stadium - the 250-300 million euro white elephant that has dogged Valencia since its construction began in 2007.\n\nInvestors that have been accepted by Bankia would go through to the second phase of the operation ''to find a comprehensive solution''. The bank together with KPMG will then narrow down the final candidates until the final bid is accepted and the new owner of the club unveiled.\n\nValencia has struggled with its finances amid a six-year real-estate slump that has roiled its plans to sell its Mestalla stadium and complete a new arena.\n\nEarlier media reports had speculated rival investors included American private equity investment firm TPG Capital and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its total revenue and net property income for the year increased by 18.3 per cent and 17.8 per cent year-on-year to HK$1.3 billion and HK$928.3 million, respectively, due in part to higher occupancy rates and strong rental growth across the entire portfolio.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}

Meanwhile, economic growth is improving the government's finances, and the corporate investment cycle looks poised for takeoff, he told The Business Times on Wednesday.\n\n\"Last year, the US had one foot on the gas pedal and another on the brake,\" he said.\n\nThe \"brake\" was the budget cuts, and the \"gas\", the US Fed keeping a near-zero interest rate monetary policy.\n\n\"This year, the brake pedal is completely released, and the brake could be worth 3 per cent of GDP. A lot of people are still looking in the rear-view mirror, extrapolating that the slow economic recovery would continue indefinitely . . . This year, without a fiscal brake pedal, monetary policy can have an electrifying effect.\"\n\nMr Keating, who is also Credit Suisse's deputy global chief investment officer, is one of the more bullish analysts around, a year after US stock markets rallied 30 to 40 per cent in anticipation of an economic recovery in the US.\n\nAfter stocks have doubled or more from their 2009 financial crisis lows, investors have been asking whether it is now too late to enter the stock market.\n\nWhile stock market valuations might generally be above historical averages, \"by definition you spend half your time above and half your time below\", Mr Keating said.\n\nAnd with the economy accelerating, interest rates still low, inflation under control, investors still cash-rich and with bonds yielding little, there is nothing else to invest in but stocks, he argued.\n\nPositive sentiment has returned, with three-quarters of clients expecting global stocks to be the best performing asset class this year, he noted.\n\n\"As an investor, you've got to put your money somewhere. I'm not trying to suggest we'll repeat last year's performance. Returns will be more modest, more volatile than last year. There might be significant setbacks. But still, there's a reasonably positive trend.\"\n\nIn the US, the automobile industry is already making a comeback, with vehicle production numbers back up. \"It's the first major sector going ahead with corporate investment. There'll be a domino effect through the system.\"\n\nHe said that as business confidence returns, the cash that has piled up on corporate balance sheets over the past few years of uncertainty will be redeployed in job creation, mergers and acquisitions, and more share buybacks. Growth in corporate earnings will benefit stocks, he said.\n\n\"Cash balances are at a sweet spot. It's fallen from its peak 18 months ago, but still at a very high level if you look back over 50 to 60 years. But it's high enough that it'll come down.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In other months, the coverage ranged from 97.87 per cent to 98.83 per cent.\n\n\"We note that M1's network delivered the best call quality, with the highest call success rate and the lowest call drop rate. M1 is committed to delivering a high quality mobile service, and in 2013 we invested $120 million into network infrastructure upgrades,\" an M1 spokesman said yesterday.\n\n\"These upgrades, including the nationwide rollout of 3G radio network on the 900MHz spectrum that will be completed by the end of this quarter, will further enhance our 3G coverage.\"\n\nYesterday, IDA noted that the $25,000 financial penalty imposed on M1 took into account the latter's \"continued efforts to improve overall coverage\".\n\nOn the in-building front, an IDA audit also found that while all mobile operators met its standard of more than 85 per cent service coverage in most of the buildings that it audited, some operators did not meet the QoS standard in particular buildings.\n\nNow, mobile operators have been given six months to improve the in-building service coverage that did not pass muster.\n\n\"IDA will audit buildings with weaker signal coverage again in early- and mid-2014 before deciding on a penalty,\" it said yesterday.\n\nFor tunnels, all three operators have met IDA's standard of more than 95 per cent service coverage.\n\n\"End-users may however experience occasional connectivity issues, depending on the availability of mobile capacity. IDA is currently studying the feasibility of formulating service quality standards of mobile broadband,\" the regulator added.\n\nUnder the QoS framework, operators may face financial penalties of up to $50,000 per month for each instance of non-compliance for each indicator.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gross revenue rose 3.1 per cent to $24.7 million, mainly due to rental income contribution from properties acquired in July and September. Additionally, higher rent from the Singapore properties - due mainly to the increased growth rate of 4.44 per cent for Year 7 of lease term commencing August - also contributed to the revenue growth.

By Dylan Tan\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 24, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH the world's best sushi restaurants (among other things) only about an hour's train ride away, it's easy to be tempted to head straight for Tokyo when you land at Narita Airport. But give the neighbouring prefectures of Chiba and Ibaraki a chance and you'll be surprised at how much both have to offer. They possess a skyscraper-free old-world charm that's a far cry from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Forget peak hour commuter jams. The roads are relatively clear at all times and most attractions are within a short distance of each other, making both prefectures ideal for a leisurely self-drive family holiday.\n\nSome of Chiba's tourist sights are practically at Narita's doorstep, a mere 20- to 30-minute car ride away. The Museum of Aeronautical Sciences (\n\nwww.aeromuseum.or.jp\n\n) is just south of the airport.\n\nWhen done checking out the models, simulators and other exhibits - the latest of which is the nose of a Boeing 747 through which visitors can climb into to check out the cockpit - you're welcome to sit back in the viewing gallery to watch planes take off from Narita, complete with \"live\" commentary from the control towers.\n\nA short drive away is the Naritasan Sinsyoji (\n\nwww.naritasan.or.jp\n\n) temple. Founded in 940AD, it has more than 1,070 years of history and is one of the biggest and most popular in Japan. On New Year's Day, it welcomes up to three million worshippers.\n\nOutside it is a narrow street lined with stalls on both sides selling souvenirs, the most popular of which is a pickled cucumber snack.\n\nIf you've worked up an appetite from all that walking in the 20 ha Japanese garden behind Naritasan Sinsyoji, be sure to drop by any of the restaurants serving grilled unagi (eel) with rice on the same tourist stretch. If you can stomach the sight of where your meal came from, you can watch live eels being slaughtered on the spot - by a nail driven through their heads - outside some eateries.\n\nAlso close by is Boso-no-mura (1028 Ryukakuji, Sakae-machi, Inba-gun, Chiba), an Edo period theme park modelled after a local village. It's so authentic that countless TV dramas and films have used it as a set. Many traditional businesses - dying trades such as candle-making, paper-making and blacksmith-ing - are still operating there.\n\nTo witness another profession that's going the way of the dodo, head to Takaraya Restaurant (\n\nwww.takaraya.awk.jp\n\n), one of the few establishments licensed to have geisha entertainment on-site. Established in 1897 and now run by a mother-and-daughter team, it's known for its juicy clams and fresh vegetables harvested from Kisarazu, a port town famous as a source of seafood.\n\nIf you want entertainment while dining, Takaraya can arrange for geisha who will sing, dance and play games like Scissors-Paper-Stone. They will also engage in friendly rounds of \"butt wrestling\", in which two opponents stand back to back and use their behinds to rear-end the other person, with the first one to lose his/her footing being penalised. It's all good, clean fun.\n\nBe sure to book earlier; geishas are in demand, and only 13 work in the area now, down from 200 during their heyday, when it was the dream of many girls to become a geisha.\n\nFor even more wholesome family entertainment, look no further than Mother Farm (\n\nwww.motherfarm.co.jp\n\n), a petting zoo and animal theme park four times bigger than Tokyo Disneyland. Located 300m above sea level, the air is exceptionally crisp and on a clear day, you can see Mount Fuji in the distance. In the summer, it opens its orchard so visitors can pick strawberries, tomatoes and blueberries; visit in the autumn for kiwis but don't leave without trying the delicious soft-serve ice cream made from milk fresh from the cows there.\n\nWhen it's time to call it a night, wind down in the tranquillity of the five-star Kamogawakan Resort and Spa Hotel (\n\nwww.kamogawakan.co.jp\n\n). The ocean-front luxury ryokan is a short walk from another family attraction, Kamogawa Sea World, and is built in the traditional sukiya (refined) style of Japanese architecture.\n\nChiba's neighbouring prefecture Ibaraki is equally enticing with the same mix of tradition and modernity. It's home to the tallest bronze Buddha statue in the world; at 120m, it's three times the height of the Statue of Liberty.\n\nStep inside the Ushiku Great Buddha (2083 Kuno-cho, Ushiku City) and travel up to its chest level at 85m for the observatory, where the Tokyo Skytree is visible on a clear day.\n\nGiving Chiba's Museum of Aeronautical Sciences a run for its money is Ibaraki's Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (\n\nwww.jaxa.jp\n\n), where the Tsukuba Space Centre conducts its research and space development and visitors can explore life-sized satellites and rocket engines.\n\nPhotography buffs will want to check out Mount Tsukuba, which changes colour from dawn to dusk. The locals call it \"the purple peak of Kanto\". At 877m above sea level, it is also the spot - on clear days - from which to catch views of Mount Fuji to the west.\n\nThe spectacular Fukuroda Falls (3-19 Fukuroda, Daigo Town) is another must for shutterbugs. When the winter becomes too harsh, the entire falls freezes and Mother Nature turns it into a pure rock-hard white surface which more adventurous visitors will take to for a spot of ice-climbing.\n\nAt the Kuroda Apple Orchard (4445 Konamase, Daigo Town), visitors can try their hand at apple picking. Over 80 species of apples are grown here, with the peak season for harvest falling between July and November. Each tree bears about 1,000 fruit.\n\nEn route to Narita, stop by the award-winning Kiuchi Brewery (\n\nwww.kodawari.cc\n\n) which has a 190-year history of producing some Japan's finest sake. The brewery is also behind the craft label Hitachino Nest Beer, which has won numerous prizes and is available in several high-end Japanese restaurants and supermarkets in Singapore.\n\nRight next door is the Kura + Soba Nakaya (1257 Konosu, Naka City), a restaurant converted from the brewery's old warehouse serving artisanal handmade buckwheat noodles. Try the sake soba which is cooked with sake, not water.\n\nWith all that Ibaraki and Chiba have to offer, we'll certainly drink to that.\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Year-to-date, the index has lost 92 points or 2.9 per cent.\n\nTurnover on Wednesday and Thursday picked up to around $1.3 billion but business yesterday fell back slightly to $1.1 billion, still above the daily average of $900 million since the start of the year.\n\nEven activity in the penny segment was subdued - yesterday's volume was only 2.2 billion compared with the average of about three billion earlier in the month.\n\nWall Street on Thursday reacted negatively to the China figures; one market report said the 1.1 per cent loss in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that day was because \"no China, no global synchronised recovery ... and if there's no global recovery, investors have to wonder whether the US can continue to do much of the heavy lifting on its own\".\n\nThis of course suggests that US investors are more concerned about the health of the economy than the pace at which the Fed will continue to hand out free money, which may not really be the case.\n\nEqually likely is that an overstretched, overvalued and overrated US stock market simply sold off on Thursday, partly because earnings reported so far have not been great.\n\nWith blue chips weak, it has been left to penny stocks once again to assume the mantle of market leaders and they did not disappoint. Heavy churning of pennies has become a hallmark of daily trading - perfectly understandable considering that retail participation is poor, thus forcing retail brokers to trade in their own accounts. In this connection, low-priced issues have been the most popular choices, though in some cases there have been accompanying announcements to underpin interest.\n\nAmong the counters in play this week were Digiland, HanKore, Advance SCT and CCM Group.\n\nIn its Emerging Asia: The Year Ahead, JP Morgan said emerging market (EM) Asian growth is expected to get a lift from firmer developed market (DM) domestic demand, especially from a turn in the capital expenditure cycle, while tighter external financing conditions and a policy-induced investment slowdown in China will act as a drag on activity in the region.\n\n\"As a result of these drags, EM Asia is not expected to respond as strongly to the pick-up in DM activity, leaving growth in the region below-trend for the third year in a row,\" said JP Morgan.\n\n\"Outside of China, growth is generally forecast to pick up as the smaller and more open EM Asian economies benefit from stronger DM growth.\"\n\nIn its chart analysis of the STI, OCBC Investment Research said immediate resistance-turned-sup-port is at 3,070.\n\n\"Below that, the next base lies at the 3,030 key trough. On the upside, 3,120 is now the newly established support-turned-resistance,\" said the broker.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Adapted by Tracy Letts from his 2007 Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play of the same name, the all-star black comedy revolves around a messed-up family and the eventual collapse when they all arrive for the funeral of the patriarch.\n\nAn on-fire Meryl Streep leads the ensemble cast playing the widow, Violet. She's suffering from mouth cancer but that can also be a metaphor for the verbal venom she spits at those around her. Not everyone takes it lying down like her youngest daughter Ivy (Julianne Nicholson); her eldest, Barbara (Julia Roberts) has an equally violent temper to match her mother's.\n\nThings get messier at the funeral when middle daughter Karen (Juliette Lewis) arrives with her sleazy fiance Steve (Dermot Mulroney), who tries to get fresh with Babara's rebellous teenage daughter Jean (Abigail Breslin).\n\nAnd when Ivy starts to fall for her aunt Mattie Fae's (Margo Martindale) quietly charming son Little Charles (Benedict Cumberbatch), a deep dark secret gets dragged out from the past. As the summer temperature continues to soar, things in this Oklahoma household also eventually reach boiling point.\n\nA performance-driven drama, August: Osage County is a talkie with a Hollywood dream cast with the actors delivering the goods by firing on all cylinders like they're in some sort of acting masterclass. Both Streep and Roberts have already been singled out for Best Actress and Best Support Actress awards respectively at the Oscars and deservingly so.\n\nThe former is no stranger to such nominations and here, she proves her worth with a performance that's fierce, funny and sad, all rolled into one. Roberts is equally delightful as the bull-head eldest daughter who's a bit of a chip off the old block; her character possesses Violet's tantrums but she's played by the actress with a bit more sense and sensibility.\n\nLetts's screen adaptation runs for about an hour shorter than the stage production but the film still feels a little draggy at times because of all that dialogue.\n\nA lot of it is delivered at top volume by the cast as well as the plot moves from one confrontational scene to another; all that eventually wears the audience down, especially since the character are shouting non-stop at one another.\n\nDirector John Wells, whose works are mostly restricted to television dramas such as ER and The West Wing, finds it difficult to shed August: Osage County of its theatrical origins and something seems lost in translation in this very stage-y big screen adaptation. Like his debut film, 2010's The Company Men, which starred Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner, Chris Cooper and Tommy Lee Jones, it's the ensemble cast who steal the show with their star power and strong performances.\n\nBut for all its flaws, there's no denying August: Osage County is a smart and entertaining piece of cinema - not exactly something you can say about most all-star films released during the festive season.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are voracious eaters and bargain hunters, and lifelong visitors to Chinese neighbourhoods everywhere. When we talk about a good Chinatown, we point to certain signs: live fish for sale, dragon eyes in sidewalk produce-displays, smokers, crowds.\n\nA few years ago, I wrote a book about American Chinatowns and my family's history in them.

And so: fish, dragons, smoke, crowds.\n\nLive fish mean that there are enough people buying to make the trouble of caring for the seafood worthwhile. The dragon eye - longan in Cantonese - is a strange fruit, a sweet, subtly fragrant exotic with coarse, sandpapery skin.

This was 6 per cent below market consensus estimates of $1.5 billion. Management highlighted that the decline was due to the absence of one-time gains from the sale of apartments at its Reflections at Keppel Bay in FY12.\n\nIncluding revaluation, major impairment and divestments, full year net profit attributable to shareholders fell 17.5 per cent to $1.85 billion.\n\nManagement has proposed a final dividend of 30 cents (27 cents previously), which brings total distribution to 49.5 cents per share, including an interim dividend of 19.5 cents.\n\nAt the group's results briefing yesterday, Keppel's newly appointed CEO Loh Chin Hua said he expects 2014 to be another challenging year. \"We remain cautious (in our outlook) as the environment is still uncertain.\" He highlighted that the property division will continue to be affected by the cooling measures while the group remained focused on returning the infrastructure division back to profitability.\n\nThe group's offshore & marine division remained the star performer with 4Q13 net profit rising 27 per cent to $270 million. During the quarter, the division completed four jack-up rigs, one accommodation semi, two semi-submersible upgrades and three specialised vessels.\n\nBesides the vessel completions, offshore & marine also secured $2.1 billion in new orders in the quarter and signed a memorandum of understanding with Pemex to develop a new shipyard in Mexico.\n\n\"This reinforces our near market, near customer strategy and places us in a strong position to capture opportunities not only from the potential in Mexico but also from the continued growth in the Gulf of Mexico,\" Mr Loh said.\n\nOffshore & marine FY13 net profit was flat year on year at $930 million (FY12: $937 million), and accounted for 66 per cent of the group's net profit. FY13 offshore and marine operating margins also improved to 14.9 per cent from 13.7 per cent in FY12. During the year, the group secured $7 billion in new orders and its net orderbook stood at $14.2 billion with visibility into 2019.\n\nDuring the year, Keppel Fels also secured contracts from Mexican drilling group Grupo R to build five KFELS B Class jack-up rigs worth over US$1 billion, which the group sees as a significant milestone. To close the year, Keppel Fels also announced a US$1.1 billion contract to build five KFELS Super B class jack-up rigs with options to build another five similar rigs.\n\nAs far as competition goes, he said the group will continue to differentiate itself, not just with safety, quality and on time delivery but with the application of innovation and technology. \"As an example, our decision to proceed with the construction of the new Keppel Can Do drillship, which was developed in close consultation with our customers, is a step towards meeting the needs of the industry,\" he said.\n\nThe group's infrastructure division continued to disappoint with 4Q13 net losses ballooning to $111 million from a loss of $72 million in 4Q12 as the group's EPC (engineering, construction and procurement) contracts in Doha North and Runcorn continued to face challenges, and additional provisions were made at the year end. Infrastructure losses in FY13 stood at $14 million.\n\n\"Our focus is to complete the projects and minimise the loss to the group,\" Mr Loh said, adding that it was encouraging that Runcorn Phase 1 is substantially completed and Phase 2 will be substantially completed in 2H this year. While he said the group was deeply disappointed on the need for the additional provisions, the group felt they were necessary and adequate at this time, but \"we cannot be certain until the projects are completed\".\n\nThe group also plans to scale up its data centre business with expanding portfolios in Singapore, Ireland and the Netherlands, as well as exploring a data centre Reit.\n\nThe group's property division's net profit fell 44 per cent to $442 million in FY13, largely due to the lack of one-time gains from the sale of units at its Reflections at Keppel Bay project. In 4Q13, the group sold more than 900 homes in its key markets in Asia, mostly in China.\n\nThe counter fell 12 cents to end at $10.88 yesterday. The results were released after trading closed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With units adjacent to Palmer Square, the elegant homes are a short walk from dozens of shops and restaurants and the vaunted gates of Princeton University.\n\nBut only seven of the 48 homes have sold, including a 3,200-square-foot townhouse that went for US$1.855 million. The rentals leased quickly and several more will be released onto the market this month, including two duplexes listed for US$8,600 a month.\n\nThe development was intended to tap into a desire among some Americans to trade in the car-dependent suburbs for more accessible urban centres. In a recent study by the National Association of Realtors, more than half of respondents preferred a neighbourhood with a mix of stores, other businesses and housing. About three-fourths said a neighbourhood was more important than the size of a home.\n\nGenerally, the lifestyle appeals to two distinct groups: young professionals without children and retiring baby boomers.\n\n\"People are buying more than just a house,\" said Christopher Leinberger, a professor and director of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis at George Washington University. \"They're buying a neighbourhood.\"\n\nAmericans are willing to pay more to live within walking distance from town, according to research by Mr Leinberger. But while living in downtown Princeton would give a buyer access to an excellent public school system and a pleasant neighbourhood with wine and cheese shops, there is no direct train to New York City, a deterrent for commuters. Instead, riders must take a shuttle ride to the nearby Princeton Junction train station.\n\nHomes in the Princeton development, called the Residences at Palmer Square, are priced at a premium, with 4,130-square-foot, three-bedroom condos listed as high as US$3.4 million.\n\n\"It's priced pretty high for Princeton,\" said Harveen Bhatla, co-founder of the Bhatla-Usab Real Estate Group at Keller Williams Princeton Realty. \"They were unfortunate in their timing; they were building high-end luxury homes when the market was going down.\"\n\nIn the last year, the Princeton housing market has begun to recover, with inventory tightening and prices rising. As of November 2013, the average selling price for a single-family home was US$1.698 million and the average selling price for a condo was US$743,500, according to data provided by Bhatla-Usab. Nearly all of the properties that sold for US$1 million or more were large homes with four or more bedrooms.\n\nPart of the residential complex sits atop a parking garage. Internal plazas provide benches, landscaping and walkways open to the public. But rather than face the bustle of downtown, the condos face inward, looking onto a setting that seems more like a serene private community than a new addition to a central square.\n\n\"It is very, very dense and I don't think that it helps the town,\" said Allan Kehrt, an architect who conducted a feasibility study for the site several years ago. \"It is this huge, almost inaccessible community that was plopped down in the middle of Princeton.\"\n\nThe development has struggled with setbacks for decades. In 1989, a developer built several housing units and parking spaces, but the development stalled and remained a half-built eyesore for years.\n\nAfter Palmer Square Management acquired the property in 1992, the company spent years negotiating an affordable housing agreement with the town. The final agreement called for 10 affordable rental units. By the time construction on the new residences finally began in 2009, the housing market was in the grips of the worst downturn of a generation.\n\n\"We knew that sales were going to be a little bit lagging as the country recovered from the recession,\" said David Newton, vice-president of Palmer Square Management, which also operates the retail and office space in Palmer Square.\n\nWhile the residential component struggles to draw buyers, the retail centre is nearly 96 per cent occupied with a mix of local shops and national chains. At the centre of the square sits the Nassau Inn, a landmark Princeton hotel.\n\nPalmer Square has long been a symbol of the potential - and the problems - of urban renewal. The zinc magnate Edgar Palmer began building the square during the Great Depression. Other sections were added over the years.\n\nTo make way for his idyllic vision of a new downtown, he uprooted an African-American neighbourhood. Later, in the 1950s, another African-American community was displaced to create a new street grid on the site that is now the Residences at Palmer Square.\n\n\"There is this enormous social justice wound and it's represented by that site,\" said Sheldon Sturges, a founder of Princeton Future, a community planning organisation.\n\nThe architect Thomas Stapleton designed the original section of Palmer Square in a neocolonial style. The quaint centre is a mix of brick, stone and wood shingle buildings with shop names etched in black.\n\nThe Nassau Inn recently finished a US$20 million renovation. Its ballroom, conference rooms, mechanical systems and guest rooms were all renovated. Small, outdated guest rooms were enlarged and updated, reducing the total number of rooms to 188. The ballroom was updated with new finishes.\n\nThe new condos and townhouses share the colonial style of Palmer Square, with wrought-iron banisters, 10-foot-high ceilings, crown molding and gas fireplaces. Kitchens have traditional finishes with maple cabinets and granite countertops. The townhouses are equipped with private elevators.\n\nCondos start at US$1.245 million for a two-bedroom and townhouses range from US$1.775 million for a two-bedroom to US$2.195 million for a three-bedroom.\n\nLast spring, Palmer Square Management revamped its marketing strategy to lure buyers. The complex is now advertised on Google China and the brochure has been translated into Mandarin in the hopes of luring international buyers. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Turnover velocity, a rough average of how often every listed share is traded, slowed to 35 per cent from 44 per cent a year ago.\n\nBut Mr Bocker said that the reasons for the weakness in securities were complex and could not be fully blamed on the penny sell-off.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of commentators and others out there trying to do a parallel into the penny stocks and all that, I think that's very hard when you look at the real statistics,\" Mr Bocker said. \"It's not really that clear because . . . there was a lot of flow back out of Asia back into US markets, and to some extent European markets that also happened in the fourth quarter that is also affecting us, so we cannot trace it back to what some, I know would like to trace it back to.\"\n\nThe growing derivatives business helped to pick up some of the slack from securities. Derivatives revenue rose 16 per cent in the quarter to $52.5 million, matching the contribution from securities. Mr Bocker said that SGX was seeing healthy momentum in its Indonesian index futures and iron ore futures.\n\nMs Lee saw some numbers to corroborate that view.\n\n\"Established products still managed to enjoy good double-digit growth, while new products (coming from a low base) registered good growth,\" she said.\n\nMr Bocker said that the outlook had improved.\n\n\"For you that read every word of our interim report in detail, you will notice that the first sentence of the outlook has now changed,\" Mr Bocker said. \"So instead of what we've had for so many quarters . . . we are now saying that we see the global economy is finally showing modest signs of recovery. The word 'uncertainty' is partly gone.\"\n\nMs Lee, however, saw continued pressure for the securities business.\n\n\"For Q3 FY14, I expect it to be somewhat muted for its securities business,\" Ms Lee said.\n\n\"Early indications seem to point to still slow numbers, and as we believe that property data will remain weak for the next one to three months, this could rein in market sentiment, especially for property and property-related stocks. However, the positive momentum for its derivatives business could possibly continue into Q3 FY14 and this could mitigate the softness from the securities side.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dallas Buyers Club is the true story of how a foul-mouthed, beer-swilling, coke-snorting, whore-loving homophobe transforms crushing adversity into opportunity and hope, channelling his anger and frustration into a larger cause.\n\nWhen rodeo rider Ron Woodroof is diagnosed with HIV in 1985 and given 30 days to live, he tackles the disease head on, informing himself through medical journals and newspaper articles. He becomes an outspoken critic of the limited medical treatment available in the US and an unlikely crusader for AIDs by smuggling non-approved drugs from other countries and selling them - by way of membership - to fellow sufferers. Along the way, he takes on the medical establishment, the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nA lifetime of reckless behaviour catches up to Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) when he suffers an accident at work and is sent to hospital, where grim reality finally bites. In rapid succession, he rejects a tightly controlled trial drug programme administered by the hospital, buys much larger quantities of the same drug in a failed attempt to get better and is shunned by his former buddies for having a gay person's disease.\n\n\"I prefer to die with my boots on,\" says Woodruff by way of explaining his unwillingness to simply fade away. Time is running out but he's not giving up without a fight - so he heads to Mexico where a renegade doctor (Griffin Dunne) supplies him with a well-researched (but non-FDA-approved) cocktail of drugs and supplements.\n\nThe treatment helps to keep the disease at bay, the days turn into months and Ron decides to smuggle large quantities of the drugs back to the US, where to circumvent the law he sells \"club memberships\" rather than the pills themselves. Of course, the demand is overwhelming.\n\nWoodruff has numerous run-ins with the authorities but he's convinced that his self-medication method trumps anything the hospital can do - and his continued survival is the ultimate proof of this. A doctor (Jennifer Garner) at the hospital is sympathetic to his cause and motivates him to regain some of his old swagger.\n\nHe's helped in his endeavours by Rayon (Jared Leto), a transgender drug addict with a quick wit and the proverbial heart of gold. It's a long way from the rodeo, the cowboy bars and his white trash former friends but in the desperate quest to prolong his own life, Woodruff also learns something about compassion for others and tolerance of minority groups.\n\nFor a film about death and disease, Dallas Buyers Club, directed by Jean-Marc Vallee and written by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, has its fair share of upbeat moments. This cautionary tale could have given in to melodrama but instead it's compelling stuff, worth watching for McConaughey's all-in performance alone.\n\nThere's a lot more to this film than a showy lead role, however. Woodroof makes no excuses for being the way he is - and there's much to dislike about him - but by the time this good old boy heads off into the sunset, we're glad we went along for the ride.\n\nRating:\n\nB+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Over the past few weeks, people have been engaging in some form of activity we can only describe as, well, \"not leaving\". Say if you took the day off to watch a Tamil movie premiere and they cancel the screening at the last minute, what do you do, leave? Heck, no. If your complimentary parking coupon at Lot One shopping centre doesn't work and 50 drivers are lined up behind you screaming abuse, what's the logical solution? Absolutely not leaving. And what do kidnappers tell you after they tie you up and toss you into the back seat of their getaway car? \"Auntie, don't leave, ok?\"\n\nThen there's the latest incident with the Porsche-owning expat who thinks MRT commuters are poor and smelly - ah, we don't think he's leaving either.\n\nIn order to understand exactly what makes one stay when etiquette and public opinion suggest the opposite, we consulted an expert with decades of experience in both behavioural observation and public transportation: the uncle standing beside me on the East-West line on the way to Commonwealth.\n\nHe looked like he'd been queueing for hours at Lim Chee Guan Bak Kwa and was therefore on the wrong side of the dewy-fresh fragrance meter. His bags of bak kwa, on the other hand, looked and smelled fantastic.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, would you agree with the notion that people who use public transport are poor and smelly?\"\n\n\"Who are you calling poor?!\"\n\n\"No, no, I don't mean you personally, I meant that rhetorically. Obviously with that many packets of bak kwa at Chinese New Year premium prices of $50 per kg or more, you are a person of some means but ah, ah . . .\"\n\n\"Why are you taking the MRT? Is your Porsche in the workshop? So you are not such a premium customer that they don't lend you another Porsche in the meantime? So you can take the train and look down on other people who cannot afford a car? Are you Singaporean? Are you a foreign talent? Are you talented?\n\n\"Oh dear. I'm very sorry to have offended and disrespected you. Please forgive me for my poor judgment and I'm sure my PR company will be in touch with you to convey my personal regrets . . .\"\n\n\"I'm not smelly, okay. You know how hot Singapore is? You try walking from your house to the bus stop. Your Chanel No 5 will turn into Eau de Hougang wet market before you reach Orchard Road.\"\n\n\"Again, I do apologise and hope that I will be able to rebuild your trust in me. But it still doesn't resolve the other part of my study, which is why, like in the case of the woman with the free parking coupon, she refused to leave when everyone else was yelling at her to do so?\"\n\n\"You don't get it, do you?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It's all part of a big plan - to give netizens something to do instead of complaining about the same old things like price increases and COEs.\"\n\n\"What? Is that why every week there's something new to annoy people?\"\n\n\"Either that or I see the seeds of a successful reality show called 'Singaporeans (and others) Behaving Badly'. Now, if you'll excuse me . . .\"\n\n\"Hey, uncle, wait, do you think you could, uh, sell me one of your packets of bak kwa?\"\n\n\"No, I lined up hours for it - hey, what are you doing? Get away from me! Let go! Help! Hey, somebody's filming this with their phone! Leggo!\"\n\n\"No, Uncle, don't leave!\"\n\nAnd here we go again . . .\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Analysts are expecting OCBC to pay about two times of Wing Hang's book value.\n\n\"We don't see what their strategy is,\" said Stephen Long, Moody's managing director for the financial institutions group in Asia, at a press briefing yesterday.\n\n\"It's hard to see why you would pay that goodwill for the domestic banking franchise of Wing Hang. Wing Hang has been a fairly conservative bank, it hasn't grown very rapidly in recent years,\" he said, adding that Hong Kong banks are typically targeted because they offer strong exposure to mainland business.\n\nWhether the acquisition would trigger a downgrade of OCBC's rating would depend on both the strategy and its financing plan, said Mr Long. The acquisition is billed as a \"credit negative\" for OCBC, given that it is unclear how it would avoid a \"material decline\" in its Tier-1 capital ratio.\n\nMoody's also has a negative outlook for banks in Singapore because of rapid loan growth and the surge in home prices.\n\nInterest rates are set to rise with the anticipated end of the third round of quantitative easing (QE3) in the US. With that, the period of cheap money is coming to a close, and concern about over-leverage will come to the fore. But the credit agency stressed that banks here have strong ratings, are well capitalised, and should be able to withstand a deterioration of credit quality.\n\n\"The outlook is negative, but it's coming from a very high starting point,\" said Mr Long.\n\nMoody's expects credit quality of financial institutions and corporations in both South and South-east Asia to be stable this year.\n\nAsset quality is the biggest concern for banks in Asia, rather than a drop in global liquidity, as the banks are funded by deposits, which are sticky. But Moody's also highlighted some pressure from competition for deposits, as well as lower loan growth and higher credit costs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All told, 21,067 private homes were transacted last year across primary and secondary markets, down 40.1 per cent from the 35,154 units in 2012.\n\nThe proportion of private home buyers with HDB flat addresses was about 44 per cent in 2013, similar to 2012. Looking ahead, this is expected to fall as the HDB resale market is also experiencing lower transaction volumes and softer prices.\n\n\"This affects the ability of HDB flat owners to upgrade or buy a private residential property for investment,\" said Ms Lee.\n\n\"Nevertheless, there will be a group of people sitting on capital appreciation for their HDB flats which they may have bought some time ago and who have enough funds - whether in their CPF savings or cash - to make the jump to the private sector,\" said Mrs Ong.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Police did not try to break up the protests, including one outside a complex where Ms Yingluck was working.\n\nBut highlighting the risk of the political deadlock turning violent, \"Red Shirt\" leader Kwanchai Praipana, who had warned of a nationwide \"fight\" if the military launched a coup, was wounded in the arm and leg in a drive-by shooting at his home in the northeastern town of Udon Thani.\n\nPolice said they believed it was politically motivated. \"From the way the assailants fired, they obviously didn't want him to live,\" his wife, Arporn Sarakham, told Reuters. Police said they had found 39 bullet cases at the house.\n\nMr Kwanchai leads thousands of pro-government supporters in Udon Thani province.\n\nOn Tuesday, he told Reuters that if the military attempted a coup: \"I can assure you, on behalf of the 20 provinces in the northeast, that we will fight. The country will be set alight if the soldiers come out.\"\n\nSo far the military, which has been involved in 18 actual or attempted coups in the past 81 years, has kept out of the fray. The police are charged with imposing the state of emergency, under orders from Ms Yingluck to treat protesters against her government with patience.\n\nPaul Chambers, director of research at the Institute of South East Asian Affairs in Chiang Mai, said the emergency decree was designed largely to give Ms Yingluck legal protection if there is violence and the police step in.\n\nNine people have died and dozens have been wounded in the violence, including two grenade attacks in the capital over the weekend, since protesters took to the streets in November to demand Ms Yingluck step down and a \"people's council\" be set up to bring sweeping reforms to South-east Asia's second-biggest economy.\n\nThe protests are the latest eruption in a political conflict that has gripped the country for eight years. It pits the middle class of Bangkok and royalist establishment against the mainly poorer supporters of Ms Yingluck and her brother, ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, toppled by the military in 2006.\n\nMs Yingluck called a snap election for Feb 2 in the hope of defusing the protests.\n\nThe Election Commission is worried it will fan the violence and says the protests have prevented some candidates from registering, meaning there will not be a quorum to open Parliament. It is asking the Constitutional Court to rule on whether it can delay the vote.\n\n\"If it happens on Feb 2, there will not be enough new MPs for a new government to be formed anyway. Then Thailand would move to a period of growing limbo where the anti-Thaksin judiciary would decide on whether to void the election or not,\" Mr Chambers said.\n\nProtest leader Suthep Thaugsuban has rejected the election outright. He accuses Thaksin of corruption and nepotism and wants to change the electoral system to eradicate the influence of Thaksin, who lives in exile in Dubai to avoid a jail term handed down in 2008 for abuse of power.\n\nMr Suthep, when he was a deputy prime minister, sent in troops to end mass protests by pro-Thaksin supporters in 2010. More than 90 people died in that unrest.\n\nThe crisis has hurt tourism and business confidence. But the central bank, in unexpectedly positive comments, said it thought the impact of the crisis would only be short term.\n\nAdding to Ms Yingluck's problems, farmers, who are part of her core constituency, have threatened to join the protest if they do not get paid for the rice they have sold to the government under a controversial intervention scheme.\n\nHer government guaranteed them an above-market price for their rice but the scheme has run into funding difficulties.\n\nThe government has sold a bond and is seeking loans to tide it over, but the Election Commission, which has to approve such action by the caretaker government, has declined to give its support. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Among various things, he had said that the emails and documents - mostly internal correspondence between senior CHC members - shown to him by the prosecution had raised \"a lot\" of doubts and concerns about the veracity of CHC's bond investments in Xtron and another company, The First National Glassware (Firna).\n\nUnder cross-examination by the defence counsel, Mr Sim clarified that he had not seen any of the emails and other documents shown to him by the prosecution before seeing them in court this week.\n\nTherefore, the doubts and concerns he raised about the various transactions were merely questions he had, based on his initial reading of the documents. He said he was not drawing any conclusions on them, and could not do so, without understanding their context.\n\n\"My answers are based on what was shown to me . . . I can't form a conclusion unless I have an opportunity to talk to those who are involved in the email and seek an explanation (from them),\" Mr Sim said.\n\n\"And evaluate the entire context and circumstances behind the particular email, correct?\" Edwin Tong, defence counsel for Kong, asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr Sim answered.\n\nHe also testified that he knew that the bond issues were paid for using money from CHC's Building Fund, which he said could be used for investments.\n\n\"The Building Fund can be used to make an investment and I don't think that is a problem . . . Based on the information shown to me, the issue or doubts I have are whether these transactions are investments or not,\" he said.\n\nHe testified on Tuesday that, based on a spreadsheet prepared by CHC which he was shown - which laid out the timeline of funds paid out from CHC for its various investments - it appeared to him that the funds had been roundtripped, using the various entities laid out in the timeline.\n\nHe said on Tuesday that the spreadsheet \"leads me to question whether the investments by CHC . . . are really investments in the first place\".\n\nThis evidence was revisited yesterday by Senior Counsel Kannan Ramesh, counsel for CHC finance manager Sharon Tan.\n\nMr Ramesh said the prosecution had posed questions to Mr Sim, using the assumption that the transactions in the spreadsheet \"were transactions which were carried out only with the knowledge and planning of certain members of management, including the accused\".\n\n\"If I ask you to tell me whether your views would still remain if these transactions, or the substance of these transactions, were disclosed to the board of the church, deliberated upon by the board of the church and approved by the board of the church, would your answers still be the same?\" Mr Ramesh asked.\n\n\"My answer would still be the same,\" Mr Sim said.\n\n\"Would you be able to take that position without speaking to the members of the board to understand why they had given the go-ahead?\" Mr Ramesh pressed.\n\nMr Sim replied: \"Just the matter of it having been approved doesn't mean very much to me as an auditor. The whole board could be in collusion to approve this. It makes no difference to the substance of the actual flow of funds.\"\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/sgx-introduce-circuit-breakers-feb", "site_title": "SGX to introduce circuit breakers in Feb", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSGX to introduce circuit breakers in Feb\n\nThey will apply to 80% of the market, including all counters priced 50\u00a2 and above\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Jan 22, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Market watchers who have been lobbying for circuit breakers to be introduced in the local stock market will soon have their way. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) said yesterday that circuit breakers will make their appearance here from Feb 24.\n\nCircuit breakers will apply to all Straits Times Index (STI) components, MSCI Singapore Index components and securities priced 50 cents and above. Since stapled securities, funds, exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded notes and extended settlement contracts are also included, this means that circuit breakers will apply to 80 per cent of the market.\n\nThe move was widely anticipated following SGX's release of a public consultation paper last June. Among the details included then and confirmed yesterday was that the circuit breakers will be dynamic instead of static as this satisfies international best practice and would bring SGX in line with bourses in other countries such as Australia, the US and Britain.\n\n\"The general response to the circuit breaker is that it's a good thing to have,'' said SGX president Muthukrishnan Ramaswami. \"After an industry-level test on Jan 11, we are confident that the infrastructure and brokers are ready.''\n\nA circuit breaker will be triggered when a trade is entered at a price which is more than 10 per cent away from the \"reference price\", this being the last traded price at least five minutes earlier.\n\nOnce a circuit breaker is activated, a five-minute cooling-off period will kick in during which trading can take place only within a price band 10 per cent above or below the reference price.\n\nThereafter, trading will resume with a new reference price established during the cooling-off period.\n\nIn addition, SGX will revise its error trade policy from Feb 24 for all securities except bonds.\n\nTrades will not be cancelled if the transacted price falls within a price range of 20 minimum bid sizes or 5 per cent from the last traded price - a move which Mr Ramaswami said will complement the introduction of circuit breakers and assure investors of continued safety and transparency.\n\nWelcoming the introduction of circuit breakers, Securities Investors Association (Singapore) (SIAS) president David Gerald said the five-minute cooling-off period was too short as remisiers may not be able to reach their clients in time.\n\n\"About 10-15 minutes would have been ideal,\" said Mr Gerald. \"We hope that Phase 2 will kick in without delay as most retail investors are in the below- 50 cents space, which is where problems are most likely to occur.\"\n\nJimmy Ho, president of the Society of Remisiers, said he supported the use of circuit breakers as they can cushion shocks.\n\n\"However, SGX will only be applying dynamic circuit breakers instead of measures that halt the counter for a long enough trading period, like in some other exchanges. So it's only a partial circuit breaker,\" said Mr Ho.\n\n\"Moreover, circuit breakers can only handle ad hoc stock plunges, which is not that useful if we have high- frequency trading (HFT) later.\"\n\nAsked about expanding circuit breakers to other stocks, Mr Ramaswami said this would be done progressively.\n\n\"We haven't set out a time frame, but my view is that the review of this will be done after six months and after one year. It depends on how volatile the markets are,\" he said.\n\nHe added that HFT was not prevalent here. \"Today, there isn't any evidence of high-frequency trading in our marketplace. And in a market where there is only one execution venue, there is generally not going to be that much high-frequency trading.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The annualised distribution yield is 5.74 per cent based on CMT's closing price of $1.88 per unit on Tuesday.\n\nThis was on the back of distributable income rising 18.3 per cent to $94.4 million, said the real estate investment trust (Reit), Singapore's oldest and largest by asset size.\n\nWilson Tan, chief executive officer of CapitaMall Trust Management Limited, the manager of CMT, said that retailers opting for smaller spaces give CMT the option of recalibrating its unit space and tenant mix.\n\nAt the Bugis Junction mall, for instance, space that became available on two floors was converted to feature new specialty shops. This trend also provides potential upside for rental reversions given that anchor tenants and mini anchors usually take up more space and are charged lower rent per square foot.\n\nFor the quarter under review, net property income (NPI) rose 11.1 per cent to $125.5 million, while gross revenue rose 6.9 per cent to $185.7 million.\n\nAs at Dec 31, CMT's portfolio registered a high occupancy rate of 98.5 per cent.\n\nLooking ahead, the Reit is looking to embark on asset enhancement works for Tampines Mall and Phase 2 of Bugis Junction, said Mr Tan.\n\nAsset enhancement works will begin at Bugis Junction this first quarter and are expected to be completed by the third quarter. At Tampines Mall, the asset enhancement initiative (AEI) involves converting the Level 5 roof area into new lettable area to house enrichment schools and educational tenants, and reconfiguring Levels 2 and 3 to enhance the fashion offerings. The mall will also sport a new facade and upgraded covered walkway to connect the mall to Tampines MRT station.\n\nThe projected capital expenditure for this initiative is $36 million with an expected return on investment of 8 per cent. Work is expected to be completed in Q4 next year.\n\nFor the full year ended December, DPU rose 8.6 per cent to 10.27 cents from 9.46 cents and distributable income rose 12.4 per cent to $356.2 million. NPI rose 12.9 per cent to $502.7 million while gross revenue rose 10.2 per cent to $729.2 million.\n\nThe growth was mainly on the back of 6.3 per cent portfolio rent reversions (629 new/renewed leases were achieved) and full-year contributions from JCube, Bugis+ and The Atrium - which underwent asset enhancement initiatives and were reopened in April, August, and October 2012 - and IMM which was repositioned and reopened in June 2013.\n\nOn Jan 3, options were granted to a consortium to purchase Westgate Tower for $579.4 million. The consortium has up to tomorrow to exercise the options.\n\nWestgate Tower is the office tower component of the Westgate integrated development in Jurong Gateway, the other component being a shopping mall named Westgate. In May 2011, CMT took a 30 per cent stake in the development.\n\nBarclays analyst Tricia Song reckons that the Reit could make some acquisitions this year, with the completion of the mall and proceeds from the office tower.\n\nAt the briefing yesterday, Mr Tan said that the Reit was waiting for the appropriate time when the mall is stable to look at acquiring it. \"Typically, any mall takes one to two years to stabilise,\" he added.\n\nHe also said that the payment for Westgate Tower is intended to be retained for capital expenditure purposes and general expenditure.\n\nCMT's counter ended trading up one cent, at $1.89 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The vast majority of the 2013 total can be attributed to three large spills, and about 1,000 tonnes spilt was relatively heavy fuel oil which was lost in one of those incidents.\n\nITOPF says these figures represent a slight increase in the number of large spills from tankers last year compared to the previous two years, but at the same time it notes that \"the downward trend has been maintained\". The total quantity spilt so far this decade is only a sixth of that spilt in the same period in the previous decade.\n\nThree oil spills of 700 tonnes or more occurred last year, with one incident accounting for the vast majority of the total. In October, the tanker Yong Win 3 capsized and sank, spilling an estimated 5,000 tonnes of diesel oil. Two other incidents resulted in a spill of about 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil and 800 tonnes of bitumen, respectively.\n\nITOPF says: \"These incidents illustrate the unpredictability of spills and the importance of preparing to respond to the range of oils involved. In the four-year period 2010-2013, there have been 28 spills of 7 tonnes and over, resulting in 22,000 tonnes of oil lost; 90 per cent of this amount was spilt in just eight incidents.\"\n\nIn other words, nobody can know whether we will wake up one morning to find that a laden VLCC (very large crude carrier) has suffered a catastrophic incident and that a quarter of million tonnes of heavy crude oil is washing up on the beach somewhere.\n\nNevertheless, the accident record of the tanker industry has improved beyond recognition in recent decades. In the 1990s, there were 358 spills of 7 tonnes and over, resulting in 1,133,000 tonnes of oil lost; 73 per cent of this amount was spilt in just 10 incidents. In the 2000s, there were 182 spills of 7 tonnes and over, resulting in 213,000 tonnes of oil lost; 53 per cent of this amount was spilt in four incidents. In 2010-2013, there have been 28 spills of 7 tonnes and over, resulting in 22,000 tonnes of oil lost; 90 per cent of this amount was spilt in eight incidents.\n\nThis remarkable improvement must partly be due to stringent checks made by the big oil companies before chartering tankers.\n\nSo the headline of a recent Intertanko press release made me sit up. It read: \"Is the US$300m tanker vetting industry out of control?\"\n\nMy immediate reaction was that tanker vetting is working, and \"if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it\".\n\nHowever, it seems, on reading the independent tanker owners' arguments, that Intertanko does have a case.\n\nIt claims that vetting inspections of tankers by oil companies are proliferating in frequency, rising steadily in cost and, at an estimated US$300 million a year, are well on the way to running out of control.\n\nThe Ship Inspection Report (SIRE) programme developed by the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) intended that tanker inspection reports should be shared by all OCIMF members. \"They are not,\" says Intertanko. The cost of inspections should be shared by both parties. \"They are not,\" says Intertanko again.\n\n\"And to make matters worse,\" Intertanko complains, \"ship operators often have to pay the costs of luxury travel for inspectors.\"\n\nIntertanko chairman Graham Westgarth says: \"Vetting plays a vital role in safety, one which our members respect and welcome. The highest-quality owners want to distinguish themselves from those with lesser standards. However, there are some very real concerns on the fact that the SIRE system is not being used by OCIMF members as it was intended, resulting in a multitude of unnecessary inspections: Intertanko's Council (meeting in Hong Kong late last year) expressed alarm at this trend.\"\n\nIntertanko's case is that the cost of vetting has become prohibitive for tanker owners as charterers implement fragmented vetting strategies, insisting on performing their own inspections at an average cost in the region of US$5,000 - using their own individual criteria instead of accessing valid, standardised inspection reports already lodged in OCIMF's SIRE system. In addition, it claims, tanker operators are obliged to cover \"unreasonable extra costs\".\n\nOne aggrieved Intertanko member says: \"We want to see better transparency over vetting costs - especially inspectors' travel expenses, which can cost almost as much as the inspection itself, but for which we don't receive a full breakdown.\"\n\nIntertanko managing director Katharina Stanzel says: \"Intertanko's council wants to encourage charterers, including traders and brokers, to use the SIRE system in the spirit that it was created by the oil majors, and to drive down the number of inspections and associated costs. This means aiming for one inspection per ship every six months by an accredited inspector, the report of which will be used by any OCIMF member wanting to vet that ship.\"\n\nThat does seem to be reasonable, but just as I felt Intertanko had won me over, I wondered how comfortable the boards of big oil companies would be at the prospect of possibly having to explain why they had not vetted the tanker that they had chartered and which had caused an environmental disaster. Unfortunately for Intertanko, were I to sit on one of those boards, I know which way my vote would go.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While Mr Obama is expected to serve three more years in office, there is a sense among Washington insiders that his ability to continue pursuing his policy agenda has been considerably curtailed after his performance during the first year of his second term.\n\nIndeed, despite his impressive re-election victory, a determined Republican-controlled House of Representatives continued rejecting all of Mr Obama's major initiatives, ranging from new gun control legislation to immigration reform and new environmental rules, not to mention resistance to a bipartisan deal to put America's fiscal house in order.\n\nAt the same time, even the White House's most ardent supporters agree that the Obama administration has botched the rollout of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), aka \"Obamacare\", which was considered to be Mr Obama's signature legislative achievement. And while Mr Obama has resisted pressure to entangle the United States in new military conflicts, his handling of several crucial foreign policy challenges has been less than effective.\n\nNo surprise then that he has been experiencing a plummeting in his popularity in recent months. There is a growing perception that he may lack the skills or the resolve to get things done according to his wishes.\n\nBut starting with his prime-time State of the Union address, Mr Obama has an opportunity to launch a course correction and push forward new policy initiatives. In a way, the perception that he is a lame duck gives him a political advantage. Since he won't be running for another term, he is now in a stronger position to advance policies and even make unpopular decisions.\n\nIn this context, he may have a unique strategic advantage if he decides to use some of his remaining political capital to pursue his ambitious global trade agenda, which includes negotiating historic free trade deals with the Pacific Rim economies and the European Union. These ideas are backed by a coalition of pro-free trade members of Congress, including the majority of Republicans, but have been resisted by a large number of Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe president could highlight during his address next week the contribution that growing trade would make in strengthening the American economy. His first step in that direction should be to call on Congress to extend his trade promotion authority. That could help recreate a bipartisan pro-free trade coalition and mobilise support for policies that would not only revitalise the Obama presidency, but also strengthen US global leadership and boost the world economy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A number above 50 indicates expansion.\n\nStocks extended losses as the data pointed to weakening domestic and global demand. While Bank of America Corp cautioned that figures may have been distorted by workers' holidays ahead of the Lunar New Year, a manufacturing slowdown would add to strains that include elevated interest rates and the risk of defaults on high-yield investment products.\n\n\"The policy focus should tilt towards supporting growth,\" Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief China economist in Hong Kong, said in a statement. \"The report implies softening growth momentum for manufacturing sectors, which has already weighed on employment growth,\" Mr Qu said.\n\nThe PMI reading is \"really dramatic\", Hu Yifan, chief economist at Haitong International Securities Co in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Rising funding costs are adding difficulties and the official PMI will also show a \"continued declining trend\", she said.\n\nThe manufacturing report gives one of the first indications of the economy's performance in 2014 after data earlier this week showed that gains in factory output eased last month, sapping momentum as a credit clampdown adds pressure on the outlook.\n\nEconomic growth slowed to 7.7 per cent in the fourth quarter from 7.8 per cent in the July-September period, according to Monday's figures from the statistics bureau. This year's target for growth is yet to be announced, after a goal of 7.5 per cent expansion in 2013.\n\nYesterday's report, known as the flash PMI, is based on 85 per cent to 90 per cent of responses to surveys sent to more than 420 manufacturers. Economists' projections ranged from 50.1 to 50.8, with a median of 50.3. The final reading will be released on Jan 30.\n\nThe government will wait for signals from its own PMI and indicators such as industrial production and electricity over the next few months before loosening monetary policy by mid-year, with the central bank likely to lower banks' reserve requirements by 50 basis points, Nomura Holdings Inc said in a note yesterday.\n\nGrowth is forecast to slow this year to a 24-year low of 7.4 per cent, based on the median estimate of 50 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey from Jan 17 to Jan 22. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

The improvement in net property income was due to higher revenue and a reduction in other operating expenses, on the back of reversal in provisions for rental arrears.\n\nFor Q3, a-iTrust's earnings per unit nearly doubled to 1.27 Singapore cents from 0.67 Singapore cent the year before.\n\nThe portfolio maintained a committed occupancy level of 96 per cent as at Dec 31, 2013, but that does not take into account its newly-developed Aviator building. The 601,360 square foot IT building in its International Tech Park in Bangalore, was completed last November but received its Occupancy Certificate only this month.\n\n\"The building is fully committed, and we have started handing over the space to tenants in phases. The completion of Aviator has increased the trust's portfolio floor area by close to 10 per cent to 7.5 million sq ft,\" Jonathan Yap, CEO of Ascendas Property Fund Trustee, the trustee-manager of a-iTrust, said.\n\na-iTrust also concluded 1.4 million sq ft of leases in the period April 1-Dec 31, 2013, excluding the leases that have been committed in the Aviator building.\n\nIn an announcement, a-iTrust also highlighted the aVance 3 building in Hyderabad as another source of growth besides the Aviator. a-iTrust said it has invested an additional 420 million rupees in aVance 3, as the building's leasing commitment has risen to 69 per cent, bringing its total investment in aVance 3 to 2.17 billion rupees.\n\nThe trust said it intends to acquire the property once it is substantially leased out. With its gearing at 22 per cent in December 2013, allowing additional debt headroom of $266 million before reaching the 40 per cent gearing mark, this provides a-iTrust with sufficient capacity to fund its growth using debt.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But combined profits for these firms were up just 2.1 per cent to $150 billion, compared to the same period a year ago.\n\nThe healthier bottom line was effectively lifted by strong performances in the services sector, given that eight of 11 main sectors in Singapore registered lower combined earnings.\n\nProfits in the services sector jumped 62.6 per cent to $11.5 billion in this year's ranking. This was driven mostly by the healthcare sector, which has taken advantage of the pressing needs of a \"silver generation\" in Singapore, and the demands of affluent patients from the region, said Chen Yew Nah, managing director of DP Information, at a press briefing yesterday.\n\nOverall profit margin for the Singapore-1000 companies ranked this year fell to 5.09 per cent, down from 5.78 per cent a year ago.\n\nThe margin pressures have also been felt among smaller firms, as shown in the ranking for the top 1,000 SMEs (small and medium enterprises) this year. While combined revenue rose 5.5 per cent for the period to $31.1 billion over the year, overall profit was up just 1.5 per cent to $3.4 billion compared to the same period a year ago.\n\nThese figures come as the government tries to wean companies off a dependence on foreign labour. Since 2010, the government has raised, and revised, foreign-worker levies. It has also put out stricter foreign-worker quotas.\n\nBut in a KPMG survey released this week, about 45 per cent of polled companies saw manpower costs increasing at a faster clip than productivity gains.\n\nCompanies in the IT sector have been particularly hit, with profit margins nearly halved to 8 per cent, data from DP Information showed.\n\nAmit Sujan, CEO of IT firm Itcan Pte Ltd, said that while costs have been increasing across most developed markets such as Singapore, he is seeing high local-staff turnover, and a general shortage of labour.\n\n\"In the last one year, I've been declining at least $1 million worth of work every month. Straightaway, we tell the clients: We do not have people,\" he said, adding that these lost clients are hiring IT firms in Hong Kong and Malaysia, instead.\n\nSingapore-based companies still have a strong credit standing overall, though the growth in the number of companies rated DP1 - a rating that reflects a default probability of less than 0.1 per cent - has eased for the first time in the post-crisis period. The proportion of DP1 companies has been on the rise since 2008, but it came down to 19.8 per cent (or 198 companies out of 1,000) this year, from 20.9 per cent in 2013.\n\nAbout three quarters of the Singapore-1000 companies have investment-grade ratings this year, though the exact percentage of 75.9 per cent has also come off slightly from 76.6 per cent a year ago.\n\nHead of commercial banking at ANZ Banking Group, Ng Wee Lee, said Singapore companies are still operating in a liquid environment. But she cautioned that some companies may be hesitant in hedging against the likelihood of higher interest rates, with the tapering of quantitative easing.\n\n\"Because we've enjoyed a low interest rate environment, people might have taken it for granted,\" said Ms Ng, adding that some companies might be looking to pass on some of the borrowing costs to clients instead. Companies could consider locking in loans at fixed rates for the next two to three years, and watch for currency risks, she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the city-state achieved \"stellar results\", unlike Hong Kong and Vancouver, where home prices have spiralled out of control.\n\nThe 10th Demographia International Housing Affordability survey, which studied housing prices in 360 metropolitan markets across nine nations, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand and the US, rates housing affordability based on the median multiple. The latter is the median house price divided by the gross annual median household income of specific markets.\n\nIt believes that if housing exceeds three times the annual household incomes, institutional failure at the local level results and there are \"serious political impediments that need to be addressed with respect to land supply and infrastructure planning, provisioning and financing\".\n\nThe survey rated Singapore's home affordability at 5.1 in the third quarter of 2013. A multiple of 5.1 or more is \"severely unaffordable\", while one below 3 is considered affordable.\n\nThe most affordable major cities were in the US, Ireland and Japan, each of which had a moderately unaffordable rating. Canada was rated \"seriously unaffordable\", along with the United Kingdom.\n\nThe survey noted that housing in Singapore - which boasts of an overall 88 per cent rate of home ownership, the highest in any place in the survey - is three times as affordable as Hong Kong. Hong Kong, Vancouver and Honolulu have the least affordable housing markets across nine nations in the survey.\n\nThe median home price in Hong Kong rose from 13.5 times in 2012 to 14.9 times last year - the highest recorded and least affordable in the 10 years of the survey. Again, Vancouver was second only to Hong Kong, with a median multiple of 10.3, followed by Honolulu at 9.4 times.\n\nIt also noted that restrictions on foreign ownership may have shielded the Republic from the cost escalation that may be occurring from globalisation of property markets in places, such as Vancouver, coastal California, Hong Kong and London. However, with severely unaffordable housing, Singapore has not been as successful as might have been hoped, according to the Belleville, Illinois-based consulting company.\n\n\"In some years insufficient supply was produced, which resulted in the now elevated costs,\" it said. \"But, by comparison to metropolitan areas that have followed the British urban containment model, Singapore's results have been stellar. Housing affordability has virtually spiralled out of control in places like Hong Kong, Vancouver, San Francisco, San Jose, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and London, reaching levels of 7.0 to nearly 15.0.\"\n\nThe report acknowledged Singapore's focus on maintaining an adequate supply of affordable housing: \"This is virtually the opposite of urban containment regulatory regimes, which (seek) to severely limit land supply and to virtually ignore the housing affordability impacts.\"\n\n\"Land use regulations and the availability of trunk infrastructure heavily constrain the supply of developable land,\" Alain Bertaud, senior research scholar at the Stern School of Business at New York University, wrote in the introduction to the report.\n\n\"There is no silver bullet to increase the supply of affordable housing. But if planners abandoned abstracts and unmeasurable objectives like smart growth, liveability and sustainability to focus on what really matters - mobility and affordability - we could see a rapidly improving situation in many cities.\"\n\nHousing mobility allows households to move to the location that best maximises their welfare. Affordability is the ability of any urban household to rent a dwelling for less than 25 per cent of its monthly income, or to buy one for less than about three times its yearly income.\n\nThe twin objectives of maintaining mobility and housing affordability should drive the design, financing and construction of trunk infrastructure.\n\n\"Here is a new simple job description for urban planners: plan the development of trunk infrastructure to maintain a steady supply of developable land for future development, but leave land and floor consumption per dwelling to the market,\" said Mr Bertaud, a former principal urban planner at the World Bank.\n\nWithin a few hours of its release, the survey drew criticism from New Zealand Property Investors Federation executive officer Andrew King.\n\nMr King argued that houses in New Zealand (also ranked \"severely unaffordable\") could seem to be less affordable than other countries' because prices included a larger land component and high building costs.\n\nThe high prices of New Zealand houses had a lot to do with the tax regime being favourable to home ownership and property investment compared with other forms of saving or investment, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These usually come in the form of investment notes, with derivatives embedded in them.\n\nThese derivatives allow issuers to customise the products to allow a defined exposure over a preset investment term. Typically there is a defined payoff for the investor.\n\nThe structured products are characterised by a risk level. Aligning the product with the clients' investment objectives and risk profile is a must.\n\nInvestors must understand what view they are taking, and how the structure may or may not pay off under a range of scenarios. As always in finance, there is no free lunch.\n\nFor some structures, the worst case may be a return of the investor's capital at the end of the tenor with no yield enhancement.\n\nFor others, investors may suffer some capital loss. Depending on the structure, the worst case may be that the funds are converted into an underlying asset, which may be a stock or a currency.\n\nHere are some examples of the themes which can be expressed through structured products. At the moment, the Bank of Singapore (BOS) has a moderately bullish view on the US dollar. The bank has customised a structured note that pays an enhanced return based on the currency movement of a basket of three underlying currencies (yen, euro and sterling) against the US dollar. The downside risk is limited to 5 per cent if the theme does not play out as expected.\n\nThere is also an appetite for an enhanced yield at a time when interest rates remain very low. BOS says it customises structures with tenors ranging from three months to one year, which can potentially offer yields as high as 10 per cent depending on the structure. In these structures, the investor takes on the risk of being converted into an underlying asset, which could be a specific stock, currency or index.\n\nThere are also structures with particular themes. For example, BOS is currently positive about Japanese equities and expects the yen to weaken further. The bank is able to structure a six-month note with the potential for an annual return of 8-10 per cent if the view is correct. The investor, however, takes the downside risk of the underlying asset if the downside buffer of 20 per cent is breached during the tenor of the product.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Goldman Sachs Groupsays that the gains will be short-lived.\n\nThe net-long position in gold climbed 7.6 per cent to 43,277 futures and options in the week ended last Tuesday, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data show. Long wagers rose 4.7 per cent, outpacing the 2.9 per cent gain in short bets. Net-bullish holdings across 18 US-traded commodities advanced 2.6 per cent, led by cattle, silver and soya beans.\n\nGold climbed for four straight weeks, rebounding 4.4 per cent this month after a 28 per cent plunge last year that was the biggest since 1981 as some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value.\n\nGold's fortunes\n\nLower prices are attracting buyers in Asia, with deliveries by the Shanghai Gold Exchange almost doubling last year. The bear market is unlikely to reverse, and bullion will \"grind lower\" over 2014 as the US economy gains momentum, Goldman analysts said in a report last Sunday.\n\n\"There's a tremendous divide in the gold market,\" said Jeff Sica, who helps oversee more than US$1 billion of assets as president of Sica Wealth Management in Morristown, New Jersey. \"Demand for jewellery in China is still relatively strong, and I think it will remain strong. The bears ignore physical demand and think that gold is not relevant when there's no economic crisis.\"\n\nFutures in New York rose 0.4 per cent last week to US$1,251.90 an ounce, as the Standard & Poor's GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials climbed 0.9 per cent. The MSCI All-Country World index of equities gained 0.1 per cent. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, advanced 0.8 per cent.\n\nThe Shanghai Gold Exchange, China's largest bullion bourse, delivered 2,197 tonnes to customers last year, compared with 1,139 tonnes in 2012, it said last Wednesday. The Asian country topped India as the world's top buyer last year as demand probably reached a record, the World Gold Council estimates.\n\nThe US Mint sold 83,500 ounces of American Eagle gold coins so far this month, heading for the biggest monthly total since April. Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded product backed by the metal, jumped 0.9 per cent last Friday, the biggest gain since November 2011. A day earlier, the assets were at the lowest level since January 2009.\n\nPrices will probably rise to US$1,400 by the end of the year as the trend of investor selling in ETFs reverses and demand in Asia gains, Commerzbank analysts led by Eugen Weinberg in Frankfurt said in a report last Friday.\n\nGoldman expects bullion to fall to US$1,050 in the next 12 months as the Federal Reserve reduces monetary stimulus, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie, the bank's head of commodities research, said in the report last week.\n\nPrecious metals are Morgan Stanley's \"least preferred\" commodities, and physical demand from China and India won't be enough to support prices, analysts Adam Longson, Bennett Meier and Peter Richardson said in a Jan 17 report.\n\nThe Fed, which said in December that it would trim its monthly asset purchases to US$75 billion from US$85 billion, will probably keep cutting bond buying by US$10 billion at each policy meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists on Jan 10.\n\nThe central bank next meets Jan 28-29. Gold rose 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more than US$2 trillion into the financial system. Futures have plunged 35 per cent from a record US$1,923.70 in September 2011.\n\nInvestor holdings through ETPs fell 33 per cent in the past year, erasing US$71.5 billion from the value of the funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Billionaire John Paulson, the largest holder in the SPDR Gold Trust, said in November that he personally wouldn't invest more money into his bullion fund because it's not clear when inflation will quicken.\n\n\"The concern is that the good economic news means the Fed will pull its taper off faster than people expect,\" said Dan Denbow, a fund manager at the US$950 million USAA Precious Metals & Minerals Fund in San Antonio. \"What's going to drive gold higher would be more concerns about geopolitical risks, an inflation scare and just a lack of good news. We still don't see that happening.\"\n\nBullish bets on crude oil slipped 7.1 per cent, government data show.\n\nPrices climbed 1.8 per cent last week. Stockpiles in the US, the biggest oil-consuming nation, reached 350.2 million barrels as at Jan 10, the lowest since March 2012, Energy Information Administration data show.\n\nSpeculators pared their net-long position in copper by 27 per cent to 25,664 contracts, the lowest since mid-December. Prices in New York capped the first weekly gain this year as signs of quickening economic growth boosted the outlook for demand. A supply surplus will shrink to 93,000 tonnes in 2015, from 167,000 tonnes this year, as gains in manufacturing boost consumption, Barclays analysts said in a report last Monday.\n\nThe World Bank lifted last Tuesday its forecast for 2014 global economic growth to 3.2 per cent from a June projection of 3 per cent.\n\nA measure of speculative positions across 11 agricultural products rose 35 per cent, the most since August, the CFTC data show. Soya bean holdings climbed 17 per cent, the largest gain in nine weeks.\n\nCattle contracts\n\nInvestors were less bearish on wheat, trimming their net-short position to 56,482 contracts, from 73,088 a week earlier, which was the biggest bet on a decline since the data begins in 2006.\n\nCattle wagers jumped 13 per cent to 118,856 contracts, the highest since October 2010. Futures in Chicago extended a rally to an all-time high last Thursday. Prices climbed in the five years through 2013, the longest streak on record.\n\nCommercial beef output in the US, the biggest producer, may drop 5.4 per cent this year to 11.03 million tonnes, the lowest since 1994, the government said on Jan 10.\n\n\"As we get an improvement in global economic growth, I think we'll start to see that in the demand trend, which will ultimately overtake some of the supply-growth prospects,\" said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior investment strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, which oversees US$113 billion. \"Ultimately, we'll see demand start to overwhelm supply.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Based on data by the Bank of International Settlements, global forex trading averaged US$5.3 trillion a day as at April last year, compared to US$4 trillion in 2010 and US$3.3 trillion in 2007.\n\nInvestors, whether or not they trade currencies, should keep forex in mind. This is because macro events, investor appetite and fund flows could cause marked trends and sharp volatility in currencies. These movements could make a significant difference to the value of their portfolios.\n\nSays Bank of Singapore FX strategist Sim Moh Siong: \"When you own assets, you are exposed to currency risk relative to a base currency . . . Clients generally want to know how to position themselves, not for the short term but for the medium term in terms of maximising the returns and preserving wealth relative to a base currency.\"\n\nAt the most basic sense, the base currency refers to the first currency in a currency pair; it is the currency against which exchange rates are quoted in a given country. For example, in the pair USD/JPY, the US dollar is the base currency. A base currency is also referred to as the accounting currency of a portfolio or business. For Singapore clients, the base currency may be the same as their home or domestic currency, which is the Singapore dollar. For some clients such as Indonesians, the base currency may be the US dollar, while their home currency may be the rupiah.\n\nMr Sim says that there are roughly two approaches that clients may take with regard to currencies. One is a strategic view, which takes a relatively longer-term view of one's currency exposure. The second is a trading or opportunistic view, which is fairly short term and relies on a combination of fundamental and technical views and market timing to get right.\n\nBOS advocates diversification, not just of assets but also of currency exposure. Its Monthly Investment Guide features a model currency portfolio, which represents the bank's recommended weights vis-a-vis three base currencies - the US dollar, euro and Singapore dollar. Mr Sim says: \"If the base and home currencies are the same, you generally do not want to take too much currency risk. In this case, we generally set a maximum limit of 30 per cent diversification into other currencies.\n\n\"In the case of the US dollar, there is a prevalence (among clients) of the home currency being different from the base currency. Then (the weights) will depend on the view of the US dollar against the home currency. We set our maximum limit wider. In case of dollar weakness, you generally want to reduce the dollar weighting closer to the lower limit.\"\n\nThe model currency portfolio in the December/January issue of the investment guide has an 84 per cent weight in the Sing dollar for those with the SGD as base currency. For these clients, the US dollar's weighting is 6 per cent and 2 per cent for other emerging market currencies.\n\nWhat major themes are expected to play out this year? One is a \"moderately stronger\" US dollar, thanks to a strengthening US economy and the Federal Reserve's signal that it will begin to reduce its monthly bond purchasing programme from US$85 billion to US$75 billion. Investors expect the Fed to continue reducing monthly purchases through 2014, although the latest weaker than expected jobs data has given some pause.\n\nMr Sim says: \"Slow US jobs growth in December looks like a one-off rather than a new trend. The Fed is unlikely to change its plans to continue to taper. We expect the Fed to gradually cut QE (quantitative easing) in the next few meetings, with the last cut likely in the fourth quarter of 2014. Better US data that keeps tapering on a steady course should lead to a stronger US dollar across the board, especially against the Japanese yen and the euro. At the same time, the Fed will be keen to stress the forward guidance of extremely low short-term interest rates for an extremely long time, which should keep US dollar gains moderate.\"\n\nBy \"moderate\", he means around 5 per cent appreciation of the US dollar. A \"significant\" appreciation would be 10 per cent or more. The \"highest conviction\" view is a stronger US dollar against the yen in the G-10 space. The sequence of monetary tightening is expected to extend from the Fed to the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and then the Bank of Japan.\n\nThis drives the BOS's preferences in terms of the forex outlook. The 12-month USD/JPY forecast of 110 is predicated on further aggressive monetary easing by the BOJ. A second major theme is that of caution with regard to higher-yielding currencies. Given the environment of very low interest rates, yield was a big theme in the past two to three years, as clients chased assets that earned an attractive spread over deposits, such as emerging bonds, dividend stocks and currencies.\n\n\"We advise clients to be careful and approach high-yielding currencies with more caution because of the Fed tapering. It impacts high-yielding currencies because it leads to higher external financing costs for many countries.\"\n\nClients are asked to cap the emerging market currencies exposure to 7 per cent or less. Says Mr Sim in the Monthly Investment Guide: \"The period of maximum shock is probably behind us as the Fed is likely to work hard to prevent a repeat of the surge in US bond yields. Sharp depreciation in many high-carry EM currencies, together with tighter monetary policy, help compress import demand and improve the current account position.\"\n\ngen@sph.com.sg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom: survey\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

This was a policy designed to protect local national car companies Proton and Perodua, which competed in the small-car segment.\n\nUnlike Perodua which has a long-time partner in Japan's Daihatsu Motor, Proton's future could become even tougher with the car market liberalised. The brainchild of former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad, Proton now claims only a quarter in market share, down from the 70 per cent it commanded soon after its inception in 1983.\n\nProton is now owned by the listed DRB-Hicom.\n\nMr Mustapa acknowledged that the national car project has been instrumental in upgrading local engineering skills and providing employment, but noted that the sector has been gradually liberalised in recent years as a result of commitments under free trade agreements.\n\nMalaysia has been losing auto investments to rivals Thailand and Indonesia, but the EEV policies are aimed at putting it back in the game.\n\n\"There are no investment and equity conditions, and also no export conditions,\" said Mr Mustapa.\n\nDuty and tax exemptions for locally-assembled hybrids will be extended until the end of next year, and till the end of 2017 for electric vehicles; after that, tax breaks will be based on the strategic value of the investments.\n\nNew EEV plants planned by Honda, Perodua and Mazda have already been given approval, with Honda already producing the hybrid Jazz locally.\n\nMr Mustapa said import and excise duty exemptions on imported hybrids enjoyed by mainly Honda, Toyota and Lexus in the last three to four years had not benefited the country and will be discontinued.\n\nExcise duties range between 65 per cent and 105 per cent, although after grants and incentives, the average excise tax levied is about 50 per cent.\n\nIt appears the NAP will need tweaking, since the current definition of EEV is based on fuel efficiency rather than carbon emissions. Malaysia is still stuck in Euro 3 diesel emission standards owing to its fuel subsidy issues, though it is planning a study on the costs and benefits of introducing Euro 4 diesel.\n\nAn in-depth study will also be carried out to assess how bumiputra participation in the sector will be affected if an import permit scheme for vehicles - called the approved permit or AP scheme - is scrapped by the end of next year as scheduled. Many individual AP holders, linked to top politicians, are said to be lobbying for the scheme to be continued.\n\nThe NAP aims to transform Malaysia into a regional automotive hub for EEVs and to raise the number of vehicles exported to 200,000 units by 2020.\n\nAbout 85 per cent of vehicles produced locally by that year are expected to be EEVs.\n\nOf an estimated 648,000 units sold in the country last year, some 16,000 (or 2.5 per cent) were hybrids.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And the biggest drop, in percentage terms, among the top four nationalities came from the Indians while the smallest was from the mainland Chinese.\n\nAccording to a caveats analysis by DTZ, the Indians picked up 460 homes, down 52.5 per cent from 968 in 2012. The mainland Chinese bought 1,479, or just 16.9 per cent fewer than the 1,780 in 2012.\n\nThis was smaller than the 36 per cent slide in purchases by the Malaysians, whose tally came to 1,303 compared with 2,037 in 2012. As a result, the mainland Chinese overtook the Malaysians last year to once again be the top group of non-Singaporean buyers of private homes.\n\nThe Indonesians, meanwhile, bought 41.7 per cent fewer homes last year - 880 units against 1,510 in 2012.\n\nDTZ combined Singapore permanent residents (PRs) and foreigners in its nationality breakdown of overseas buyers.\n\nIt found that the bulk, or about 65 per cent, of the 1,479 homes bought by the mainland Chinese were priced below $1.5 million. Around 62 per cent of the total were bought from developers. And more than 80 per cent were outside the traditional prime districts of 9, 10 and 11.\n\nThe three most popular planning areas among the mainland Chinese were Pasir Ris (131 units), Bukit Timah (129 units) and Bedok (123 units).\n\nNew project launches in Bedok last year include Urban Vista and The Glades. In Pasir Ris, D'Nest, The Inflora and Vue 8 Residence were among the new launches. The Bukit Timah planning area includes CapitaLand's D'Leedon project and Far East Organization's new development, The Siena.\n\nDemand from the mainland Chinese could be more resilient due to a few factors. Buying restrictions back home have led them to look overseas for opportunities, and Singapore is still one of their favourite investment destinations, said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ.\n\n\"They are attracted by the similarity in the culture with our majority Chinese population, and Singapore continues to offer a stable and secure environment for their investments. Some of them are investing in Singapore as they have business links here or are planning to send their children here for education.\"\n\nCurrency exchange rates may also have been a factor behind the smaller drop in purchases by the mainland Chinese compared with the other key nationalities. While the yuan strengthened against the Singapore dollar last year, the currencies of Malaysia, India and Indonesia weakened against the Sing dollar, making property here more expensive, market watchers say.\n\nIn DTZ's analysis, if PRs were excluded, foreigners' share of total private home purchases rose to 9 per cent from 6 per cent in 2012. This is because they posted a smaller percentage drop in units bought in 2013 compared with PRs and Singaporeans.\n\nWhile purchases of foreigners fell 20 per cent year on year to 1,821, the number for PRs declined nearly 41 per cent to 3,256 units.\n\nThe 15,798 units that Singaporeans bought represents an almost 42 per cent slide from 2012.\n\nMs Lee said: \"Although the year-on-year drop in foreign purchases in 2013 was the smallest across the different buyer groups, it should be noted that foreign purchases had already fallen about 60 per cent year on year in 2012, after the ABSD (additional buyer's stamp duty) was first introduced in December 2011.\n\n\"The impact of the increased ABSD in January 2013 therefore was felt less among foreign buyers who already had to pay ABSD (on all residential property purchases here), compared to Singaporeans buying their second property and PRs buying their first property, who previously did not have to pay any ABSD.\"\n\nIn 2012, purchases by Singaporeans and PRs rose 26 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively.\n\nAnother trend among foreign buyers was that their purchases of homes above $5 million held firm, even as overall purchases of properties in this price range fell 34 per cent. Foreigners bought 106 homes priced over $5 million in 2013 - similar to 2012. In contrast, purchases of such properties by Singaporeans and PRs slipped 44 per cent and 27 per cent respectively.\n\nOn the whole, foreign buying is expected to remain subdued this year in the face of the property cooling measures, the strong Singapore dollar and competition from overseas property markets, such as London, New York and Tokyo.\n\n\"However, some high-profile projects here - either those being built by foreign developers or marketed aggressively overseas - may draw a higher proportion of foreign buyers,\" said DTZ's South-east Asia chief operating officer, Ong Choon Fah.\n\nMainland China buyers are expected to continue outperforming the other three key nationalities of overseas buyers in 2014.\n\n\"Singapore will continue to be attractive to people from China - it's stable, liveable, close to China and a great place to learn English,\" said Mrs Ong. \"Often, they use Singapore as a first stop before moving on to the West. So Singapore tends to be 'a hotel' rather than a home for them.\"\n\nThe proposed establishment of the Asean Economic Community by 2015 will draw more buyers from the region to the Singapore property market in the longer term.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its China office, set up in 2005, has prepared reports for companies such as United Company Rusal Ltd, the world's largest aluminium company.\n\nIn an announcement last Tuesday, JES had said that Mineriver was estimated to have 4.2 billion tonnes of magnesium and nickel ores worth more than US$500 billion. This sent its share price soaring 26 per cent the same day to close at 18 cents.\n\nLast November, JES announced its plan to invest S$127 million (89 per cent of its market value then) to buy up to 30 per cent of Mineriver, on condition that the ores there be worth at least S$60 billion.\n\nReferring to ST's note of caution on JES International's share price, Voyage Research analyst Liu Jinshu said it would be hasty to conclude that the current JES share price was overstretched. He noted \"it ultimately still trades below its net asset value of about 24 cents per share, and within its 52-week price range of 11.5 to 23.5 cents\".\n\nCost estimates would be an important factor for Mineriver going forward, he added. \"The establishment of reserves (which indicates the economically mineable part of a resource) or production plans subsequently will help investors to better ascertain the value of the mine.\"\n\nJES finished trading at 17.4 cents yesterday, down 13 per cent from its peak of 20 cents last Wednesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The median estimate of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 985,000. Permits for future projects declined, a sign that activity may pause in early 2014.\n\nHousing remains a mainstay of the expansion, with builders breaking ground on more projects as an improved job market boosts demand for real estate. At the same time, bigger gains in employment and incomes will be needed to overcome the decline in affordability as property values and mortgage rates rise.\n\n\"Housing will make a significant contribution to growth this year,\" said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, who forecast a decrease to 997,000. \"Higher prices are bringing more building.\"\n\nEstimates for starts in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 925,000 to 1.08 million.\n\nApplications for building permits fell 3 per cent to a 986,000 pace in December, less than the projected 1.01 million, according to the Bloomberg survey.\n\nFor all of 2013, builders began work on 923,400 homes, up 18.3 per cent from the prior year and the most since 2007's 1.36 million.\n\nWork on single-family houses fell 7 per cent to a 667,000 rate in December from 717,000 the prior month. Construction of multifamily projects such as condominiums and apartment buildings declined 14.9 per cent to an annual rate of 332,000.\n\nTwo of four regions showed a decrease in groundbreaking last month, led by a 33.5 per cent plunge in the Midwest. Starts fell 12.3 per cent in the South, were little changed in the North-east and rose 15 per cent in the West to a six-year high of 269,000.\n\nWeather may have played a role in setting back some builders, car dealers and retailers as last month was the coldest December since 2009. Snowfall was 21 per cent above normal, according to weather data provider Planalytics Inc.\n\nStill, labour market gains and rising real estate values have developers upbeat about the industry's prospects. Homebuilder sentiment in January held near its highest level in eight years, dipping to 56 from 57 in December.

The US requires between 1.6 million and 1.9 million new units a year just to accommodate population growth and household formations, according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing.\n\nAs demand increases, builders are stocking up on land to develop, suppliers are boosting capacity and mortgage lending is growing.\n\n\"Babies are being born and people want to move up in housing so there's a growing demand,\" said Kelly King, chairman and chief executive officer at BB&T Corp, a regional bank and mortgage lender in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Operating leases allow airlines to avoid huge capital costs and rent a modern jetliner, potentially worth US$40-50 million at market prices, with all the latest equipment.\n\nA mid-level executive from Ireland's national airline Aer Lingus in the mid-1970s, Mr Ryan, who died in 2007, spotted the same opportunity as his great rival ILFC founder Steven Udvar-Hazy in California.\n\nWhen Mr Ryan was tasked with finding a home for a mothballed Aer Lingus Boeing 747 during the winter months, he flew around the world until Thailand's Air Siam agreed to take it. He quickly realised that serious money could be made by financing and operating planes for other airlines.\n\nAfter founding GPA in 1975, he surrounded himself with a team of ambitious young executives who travelled hundreds of thousands of miles a year - occasionally dipping behind the Iron Curtain - to match parked planes and expanding airlines.\n\nAt weekends they would retire to their country piles near the Shannon estuary, a key refuelling spot for transatlantic planes from the 1930s to 1960s, where locals suffering from the 1980s recession looked on in awe. \"They had more money than anyone in the town had ever seen,\" said the manager of the nearby Dromoland Castle Hotel, Mark Nolan, who remembers struggling to meet the demands of his \"spoiled, opulent\" clientele. \"But it all dried up pretty quickly,\" he said.\n\nThe good times ended when the first Gulf War hit the industry and torpedoed Mr Ryan's attempted IPO, leaving him with US$17 billion in orders and not enough capital to fund them. \"He over-reached himself,\" said Christopher Brown, author of Crash Landing, an inside account of how GPA crumbled. \"He bought too many aircraft and didn't realise the cycle was turning until it was far too late to get out of the hole.\"\n\nJust before turbulence hit, ILFC managed to sell itself to insurance giant AIG, guaranteeing it a steady flow of cheap funding, until it was laid low by the 2008 financial crisis, which froze its access to unsecured market financing.\n\nWhile Mr Ryan was ruined until Ryanair rebuilt his fortune, some executives joined the two entities that split from GPA, and others set up by themselves.\n\nGECAS, built by General Electric on about 60 per cent of GPA's fleet and 75 per cent of its people, went on to become the world's largest lessor, with most of its 1,700 planes owned and still managed from its Shannon office.\n\nOther executives played a key role in the rise of several of the top 10 lessors, including SMBC Aviation Capital, Babcock & Brown Aircraft Management and AerCap, now the industry number two.\n\n\"Ireland is the centre of air leasing in the world, and that came from GPA. The seeds were sown,\" said Mr Kelly, whose company AerCap acquired what was left of GPA after its carve-up.\n\nAs AIG desperately searched for an owner for its leasing unit last year, Mr Kelly stepped up again, orchestrating a merger with AerCap and bringing ILFC under what is left of GPA.\n\nWhile AerCap's corporate headquarters is in the Netherlands, it manages its fleet in Ireland, which remains the industry hub, thanks to what many say is an unrivalled web of international tax agreements, a low corporate tax rate and world-leading aviation financing expertise.\n\nThe deal, which is due to close in May, will create a listed company with a market cap likely around US$8 billion, hugely expanding the volume of publicly traded shares in the sector. \"This is a transformative transaction. It shows for the first time that large-scale consolidation is possible, and it should make the public market more attractive,\" said Domhnal Slattery, who started his career in GPA and now manages 182 planes at privately owned Dublin-based lessor Avolon. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Earnings per unit were 2.25 cents against FY2012's 2.35 cents.\n\nThe group's revenue fall was due mainly to its inclusion in FY2012 of construction revenue of $8.1 million following the completion of its flue gas treatment upgrade that year.\n\nExcluding the construction revenue, KGT's FY2013 revenue fell 1.5 per cent and net profit 1.9 per cent.\n\nOperation and maintenance (O&M) income - the main component of the group's revenue - dipped half a per cent to $50 million while the finance income component fell 4.2 per cent to $17.1 million.\n\nO&M revenue was flat because of lower output from its waste-to-energy plants and its NEWater plant.\n\nKGT invests in green infrastructure assets including waste management, water and wastewater treatment, renewable energy and other green initiatives in Singapore, as well as in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.\n\n\"K-Green Trust continues to deliver stable and predictable returns to our unit-holders,\" said Thomas Pang, CEO of Keppel Infrastructure Fund Management, the trustee-manager of K-Green.\n\n\"As part of our asset enhancement programme, we have installed a 1MWp solar photovoltaic (PV) system on the roof tops of Ulu Pandan NEWater Plant which has helped to reduce electricity intake from the grid, and operating cost of the plant.

It was not known who was responsible.\n\nThe government has rejected Mr Suthep's charge that it was responsible for the attack.\n\n\"The movement is desperate,\" said Anusorn Iamsa-ard, deputy spokesman for the Puea Thai Party. \"Its attempt to shut down this city has not been successful so it is trying different tactics, including staging attacks and blaming them on the government.\"\n\nForeign Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul earlier said that it was \"about time\" to take back control of Bangkok and that a delegation of officials, escorted by police and troops, would make a start by going to a government office that issues passports to try to persuade the protesters to let work resume.\n\nAsked if the government was now moving to end the blockade of ministries and key intersections, he told a news conference: \"Soon. It's about time. We have to start to do something.\"\n\nIn the end, however, the delegation never made it. \"Our security adviser, given the explosion earlier, advised us not to go,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Sek Wannamethee.\n\nThe agitation that began in November has been relatively peaceful until now, though sporadic flare-ups between protesters, police and government supporters have left eight people dead and scores injured.\n\nThe stock market fell as investors cut some risk exposure after the blast, ending 0.5 per cent lower. The baht also fell but was a shade higher on the day.\n\nAs the deadlock between the government and protesters drags on, many Thais believe the military could step in to break the impasse, especially if the protests turn more violent.\n\nEmbattled Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has vowed that an election which she called last month will still be held on Feb 2. The opposition Democrat Party is boycotting the polls.\n\nThe army has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years of on-off democracy but has tried to remain neutral this time.\n\nSecurity forces have largely kept out of sight since the blockades began this week, with the government reiterating yesterday that it was keen to avoid any confrontation.

The Business Times understands that the three local banks - DBS Group Holdings, OCBC Bank and United Overseas Bank - are among the top 10 in RMB clearing volumes.\n\nAltogether, 66 banks in Singapore clear RMB through ICBC Singapore, which launched its yuan clearing operations here last May.\n\n\"For Citi Singapore's market share in Singapore, we are looking at about 40 per cent,\" said Ms Loh.\n\nCiti's high market share is due to a few factors: the lender does business with almost all the largest multinationals in Asia and that Singapore is where these MNCs (multinational corporations) base their global or regional treasury centres.\n\nIn addition, China's relaxation of its currency controls has led to a big increase in cross-border lending since last year.\n\n\"Citi banks 95 per cent of Fortune 500 companies in Asia. Many of these MNCs have their regional treasury centres in Singapore and we are seeing greater interest from them to include RMB in the management of their global liquidity centrally in Singapore,\" said Ms Loh.\n\nLast year, China allowed inter-company cross-border borrowing which meant companies could now shift RMB out of China, and banks such as Citi are helping clients facilitate the process, she said.\n\nPreviously, RMB could only be sent offshore for trade settlement.\n\n\"Treasurers here are able to optimise liquidity now,\" said Ms Loh.\n\nIn the past, it could be a situation where a firm has lots of cash in China but is a net borrower in Singapore, leading to interest rate costs.\n\nCiti now helps firms via multi-currency notional pooling where the deficit in certain currencies is offset against the excess (RMB) funds, by pooling all the currencies in Singapore, she said. Effectively they save on interest expense, she said.\n\nClients are also seeing other cost savings from local RMB clearing including faster turnaround time and improved liquidity.\n\n\"At Citi Singapore, our customers enjoy about 60 per cent reduction in cost since we started direct clearing via ICBC versus when we had to clear through a third party bank in Hong Kong or China,\" said Ms Loh.\n\nThe better clearing times from October last year has levelled the playing field between Singapore and other countries, she said.Citi Singapore is also enjoying a surge in yuan deposits and loans, she added.\n\nLast year, the bank's RMB corporate trade assets monthly average rose by about six times versus 2012. Monthly average of RMB deposits increased 40 per cent last year over 2012.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The state-owned company expects to boost passenger numbers 6 per cent in 2014 from last year's 7.4 million.\n\nBahrain is touting for business after losing out to Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar in the competition for major hub status after national carrier Gulf Air grew at a slower pace than local rivals, leading to losses that resulted in job and route cuts. Terminal-expansion work at Bahrain International Airport should begin at the end of this year following a tender for construction contracts in the third quarter, Mr Al-Binfalah said.\n\n\"The fundamental market is there; to us it's a matter of who picks up business in the market, whether it's Gulf Air or regional carriers who have increased frequency to Bahrain,\" he said at the Bahrain Air Show.\n\nWhile the airport may not have access to the millions of customers lured by Dubai-based Emirates, the world's biggest international carrier, it serves as a gateway to Saudi Arabia, the biggest Gulf economy, and is integrated with Bahrain's Khalifa bin Salman port, he said. Dubai International Airport said that it was set to surpass its forecast of 65.4 million passengers for 2013.\n\nStill, the airport is now a \"tired asset\", Mr Al-Binfalah said, designed with a capacity of four million passengers - barely half 2013's total - and last upgraded in 1994.\n\nThe government plans to invest US$80 million on addressing the most urgent needs involving security, safety and maintenance, with US$900 million earmarked for terminal expansion.\n\nBAC signed a total of US$7 million in contracts for upgrades during the Bahrain Air Show, Mr Al-Binfalah said.\n\nPlans for a new airport will be reviewed in 5-10 years depending on passenger numbers and may involve expansion of the existing site or construction at a new site, he said.\n\nBahrain International is currently served by 23 passenger airlines and 11 cargo carriers, providing 724 flights a week to 41 destinations, with Gulf Air comprising 60 per cent of traffic.\n\nBAC plans to hold talks with Gulf Air about extra flights to under-served cities. Asian markets are where the greatest potential lies, he said, with 53 per cent of Bahrain residents being expatriates and almost half of them coming from India. The airport also aims to boost retail and engineering revenue.\n\nThe airport is targeting business travellers, passengers seeking flights to eastern Saudi Arabia, and tourists to Muslim religious sites in Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, Mr Al-Binfalah said.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

About 1,000 prospective buyers, who had earlier indicated their interest in the 60-year leasehold The Hillford, thronged the launch hoping to secure a unit.\n\nProspective buyers that BT spoke to cited affordability as the main driver for their decision to purchase a unit. Fifty-five year old Desmond Tan, who was the first in line to get a unit, opted for a pool-facing two-room unit (506 square feet). He paid $601,000 for his unit.\n\n\"The lease is only for 60 years, but the main consideration is affordability,\" said Mr Tan, who is self-employed. While his four children live with him, he hopes to live at The Hillford with his wife when his unit is ready. The project is expected to get its Temporary Occupation Permit in November 2017.\n\nUnits at The Hillford were sold at an average of $1,100 per square foot. The majority of the units - 186 - are in one-bedroom configurations (398-431 sq ft) and had a starting price of $388,000. The 52 two-bedroom units (506-560 sq ft) had starting prices of $498,000 and the remaining 40 two-bedroom dual key units (657 sq ft) had starting prices of $648,000.\n\nThe theme of affordability was echoed by another buyer who picked up a one-bedroom unit, stressing it was the price quantum, and not so much the facilities provided by The Hillford, that drew him to the project. A mix of middle-aged buyers as well as younger buyers in their 20s were seen at the showflat yesterday morning.\n\nAccording to the developer, World Class Land, a substantial proportion of buyers were over 50 years of age. \"We are very excited that The Hillford has sold out within the first day of sales,\" said Koh Wee Seng, chief executive officer of World Class Land. \"The response to Singapore's first retirement resort has been spectacular, with many buyers responding very positively to The Hillford's wide range of elder-friendly features, services and facilities specially introduced to serve their needs.\"\n\nThe project promises elder-friendly features such as non-slip floor finishes, wider corridors and doorways for wheelchairs, and grab bars in common areas and in the units as an option. It also boasts a 24-hour concierge service and a dedicated, full-time resort manager to take care of residents' well-being. The Hillford is located on Jalan Jurong Kechil, in Bukit Timah.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/chinas-smartphone-makers-eye-world", "site_title": "China's smartphone makers eye the world", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nChina's smartphone makers eye the world\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 19, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCHINA'S top smartphone makers are moving away from their dependence on the domestic market for growth, looking instead to making their mark on the international stage. Market watchers, however, think the vendors face an uphill task in establishing themselves as genuine contenders to Samsung or Apple.\n\nDuring the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held earlier this month in Las Vegas, companies such as Huawei Technologies, Meizu, Lenovo and ZTE showcased their latest smartphones, such as the Ascend Mate II, MX3 and Grand S II, among others.\n\nBesides announcing their products, Huawei used the platform to reveal its plans to ship 80 million handsets in 2014, up from the 52 million it sold the year before. Meizu, too, indicated its intention to bring its MX line of handsets to the North American market during the trade show.\n\nOther Chinese handset vendors that have indicated international expansion plans include Xiaomi and Oppo. Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun, in an internal memo to staff, said the company is committed to shipping at least 40 million devices this year - more than double the 18.7 million it sold in 2013. Oppo in December also began selling its N1 device in the United States and Europe.\n\nVery competitive domestic market\n\nThe shift in focus from domestic sales to international expansion comes as no surprise, according to Kiranjeet Kaur, senior market analyst at IDC Asia-Pacific's client devices group. She told BizIT that the domestic market has become extremely competitive, with many manufacturers entering the arena to capitalise on the burgeoning demand for smartphones. As such, global markets offer these vendors the potential to sell not only the very cheap devices, but also mid-range ones that come loaded with good features, she noted.\n\nWang Jun, senior analyst at research firm Analysys International, stressed the necessity of moving away from the domestic market for these ambitious handset manufacturers. While China is currently the biggest smartphone market, he said, the presence of factors such as strong market competition, increasing homogeneity among products, and the dominant nature of local carriers dictating the profit margins for vendors mean it makes sense for them to look abroad for sustained growth. \"Phone manufacturers now are limited to offering low-cost smartphones for sale through these carriers, which results in low margins and stifles their ability to increase brand prestige among consumers,\" Mr Wang said.\n\nBy developing the international market, they can better enhance their brands, increase profits and, in turn, gain better leverage to negotiate with domestic carriers on the type of phones the latter should carry, he added.\n\nWang Jingwen, research analyst at Canalys, pointed out that, while expansion may be a necessity for these vendors, they are unlikely to become the next Samsung or Apple in the mobile space. He said most of the Chinese manufacturers have limited resources to enter and gain a foothold in overseas markets, in general. For those aiming for the high-end smartphone segment, they would also need to have strong technology, content and intellectual property portfolio, in order to compete effectively, the analyst added.\n\nIDC's Ms Kaur said, in terms of sales figures, more established vendors such as Lenovo, Huawei or ZTE may pose a stronger challenge to the market leaders. Their weakness, however, lies in their level of innovation.\n\nSamsung, for example, she said, boasts not just a wide product range to address various price segments, it also offers innovation in the areas of service or applications - both internally developed or via third-party partnerships. One example of this is its partnering with Chinese Internet giant Tencent to offer its WeChat messaging app with its Samsung handsets to grow its market share in China.\n\n\"It will be hard to emulate (Samsung's) ecosystem offerings for individual markets as it did in the Chinese market. (The inability to compete in content) will limit Chinese handset players to price differentiation alone,\" she said.\n\nAnalysys's Mr Wang, however, was more upbeat in his assessment. He believes that Chinese handset makers will eventually grow to become genuine contenders to both Samsung and Apple.\n\nThe key lies in their ability to develop sustainable ecosystems for the component (such as CPU and storage) services and applications levels. This is something many Chinese handset vendors are focusing their investments on currently, which bodes well for their aspirations to be top international players, he said.\n\nLenovo is one that has stated its clear intention to become a \"significant global challenger\" to the two leading smartphone makers today.\n\nChallenging Apple and Samsung\n\nLiu Jun, senior vice-president of Lenovo's Business Group, shared with BizIT that a key to its smartphone success in China has been its breadth of offerings across different price points and features. Its rapidly scaling efforts in innovation and in-house manufacturing capability also help to bring about products faster and more efficiently, he added.\n\nThe company is thus hoping to replicate its domestic playbook on the international stage. Mr Liu said: \"For 2014, we are aggressively building our smartphone business by introducing premium designs with Vibe Z - Lenovo's first LTE phone - and offering consumers great smartphones at every price point.\n\n\"We've made no secret of our aim to become a serious challenger to Apple and Samsung, and we believe we are in a strong position to do so,\" he added.\n\nThat said, the Chinese manufacturer has shelved plans to enter the US market for now. Gerry Smith, president of Lenovo Group in the Americas, told Chinese news site Sina it would first establish its smartphone brand in Latin America and Brazil before entering the US in the next 2-3 years. CEO Yang Yuanqing had earlier said the company would enter North America this year.\n\nOne of the reasons for delaying entry is the lack of brand awareness in the US. While it's been growing - chief marketing officer David Roman said in the Sina report that 27 per cent of Americans would consider a Lenovo PC now, compared with just 4 per cent four years ago - brand awareness of its products, including smartphones, remains weak.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN Singaporean Shala S and her Dutch husband bought their home in Crans-Montana, a ski resort in south-western Switzerland, they knew exactly how they wanted it to be.\n\n\"I wanted it to be like a house in the Hamptons on the inside but a Swiss chalet on the outside,\" says Ms Shala, a former private banker. \"We don't like anything too woody and dark. Our style is more modern, very minimalist yet functional, and we like to keep things understated.\"\n\nThe couple gave interior design firm Ansana free reign over the design of their two-storey, 6,000 square foot home.\n\nThis is the Singapore firm's first project in Switzerland. \"We were not given a design brief, except for how the couple wanted to use the various spaces around the home,\" says an Ansana spokesman. \".But we knew instinctively that we wanted the interiors to project a modern, sophisticated look with a cool colour palette. The context of the environment enveloping the house was our inspiration, from the snow-capped mountains to the tranquil forest. There was so much of nature's own elements that inspired our design.\"\n\nGetting the look down pat was fairly easy as Ansana had previously designed the couple's penthouse at Sentosa. The logistics were the bigger challenge for the design team, such as adapting and understanding the Swiss way of renovations, as well as refining the design to suit the couple's budget and working with suppliers for the hardware and furniture for the home.\n\nSome of the changes made to the home included expanding the kitchen to accommodate a pantry and island counter as the design team knew from previous experience that Ms Shala and her husband would like them. The team also made the master bathroom more spacious and added a hammam for the couple. In place of sliding doors, large glass windows were installed, giving the family unblocked views of the mountains.\n\nEven the look in the bedrooms was inspired by the country's lakes, alpines and glaciers. For example, one guest room had a \"voyage\" theme as this bedroom had low, angled ceiling rafters similar to that in a ship. In fitting with the theme, the designers at Ansana created a graphic on the headboard, showing related prints such as postage stamps and a ship's steering wheel.\n\nMuch consideration also went into the choice of furnishings. For example, a Lou Read leather armchair by Philippe Starck for Driade is the key piece in the foyer. The design team was attracted to its cocooning, organic shape, and with its high back and short arms, it made the chair almost throne-like.\n\nTo create interest and command attention, the ceiling light in the foyer was sourced in Italy and selected for its airy look and the patterns the light created on the ceiling and walls when lit.\n\nThe couple, together with their 10-year-old son, moved into their home last September, and Ms Shala already has her favourite spots.\n\n\"Definitely the living and dining rooms and the kitchen,\" she says. \"The spaces are wide, open and inviting, with spectacular views of the Weisshorn and Mont Blanc mountains in the distance from our big picturesque windows.\"\n\nThe home has its own private access road, and the family always has a clear view of whoever's coming.\n\nIt is not just her home that she has fallen in love with. \"Living in Crans Montana gives me a good sense of balance,\" says Ms Shala. \"I have access to the outdoors right outside my doorstep, with the fresh mountain air and clean, sporty lifestyle. At the same time, I can dine and ship in style without the hassle of crowded big cities.\"\n\nShe counts English actor Roger Moore and French-born chef and restaurateur Michel Roux as neighbours.\n\nA typical day for Ms Shala involves grocery shopping and running errands in the morning, while her husband, who used to own a trust company, catches up on his e-mails. In autumn, the couple usually head out for two to three hour-long walks in the mountains, and the family naturally goes skiing during the winter months.\n\nThis mountain home has not only charmed the family, but Ms Shala's mother too, when she came to visit them. \"She loves that the house is elegant and warm at the same time. Mum thinks the house is very sleek and is very much like her daughter,\" quips Ms Shala.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/japan-firms-may-re-shore-production", "site_title": "Japan firms may re-shore production", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nJapan firms may re-shore production\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 19, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGROWING confidence that the Japanese yen will remain at or below current competitive levels for a considerable time is triggering speculation that Japanese companies will increasingly invest at home, rather than abroad, and possibly even bring overseas production back onshore, in the future.\n\nSuch a change could lower the level of investment by Japanese firms in Asean and regions including China and India, if it were to become a general trend. China, especially, has expressed concerns that the re-shoring of production by Japanese or other firms, on grounds of relative costs, could become a problem.\n\nSpeculation has been fed by news that leading Japanese camera and copier maker Canon Inc intends to shift a certain amount of production back to Japan. Some industry experts predict that Canon could be first of a series of firms opting to re-shore production facilities back to Japan.\n\nBut, while there is growing agreement that the yen will not rise again in the foreseeable future to levels in the past where it drove production offshore - resulting in the \"hollowing out\" of Japan's manufacturing base - interviews conducted by The Business Times suggest that globalisation of Japanese business is unlikely to be reversed.\n\nCanon's chief executive Fujio Mitarai, who is also a former head of the nation's leading business lobby, Keidanren, told Reuters in an interview last week that the firm intends to raise the proportion of products made in Japan to 50 per cent within the next three years, from 42 per cent at present.\n\n\"Right now, we have spare capacity at home because we gradually moved production overseas,\" said Mr Mitarai, referring primarily to cameras and photocopiers. Canon cut back production at home from over 60 per cent before the 2008 financial crisis to 40 per cent in 2009.\n\nMoving some production back onshore is designed to make manufacturing more flexible, and Canon will leave the option to move production back overseas open, should the yen strengthen again, Mr Mitarai added, though he indicated that he expects the currency to weaken further from here on.\n\nOther Japanese manufacturing firms could follow Canon's example \"one after another\", by re-shoring some production back to Japan, said Keikichi Honda, an adviser to Keidanren. He added that the factors influencing Canon's move are \"shared by almost all Japanese manufacturers\".\n\nHe cited the \"sustainability of the normalised yen parity\" as the first of such factors; there is also the need for internationally known brands such as Canon to preserve the made-in-Japan image, and to maintain an optimum balance between domestic and overseas production.\n\nMr Honda also pointed to \"labour union considerations\" in Japan and the need that these impose on Japanese companies to make \"optimum utilisation of domestic human resources\", plus the fact that the costs of offshore manufacturing are continually \"creeping up\".\n\nThere is also a need for Japanese manufacturers to consider the need for \"overall flexibility, substitution and diversification of production sites\", he added. \"This was a lesson they learned from the experience of the flooding suffered by Japanese production plants in Thailand and from the Tohoku earthquake.\"\n\nMr Honda noted, however, that Canon does not intend to close overseas production plants but is taking advantage of space capacity in Japan to meet additional demand. The shift of some production offshore, in response to past yen strength, had pushed domestic production below the break-even rate, he said.\n\nDespite moves by Canon and possibly other Japanese manufacturers to re-shore some production, globalisation is unlikely to be reversed, Japan's for-mer \"Mr Yen\" Eisuke Sakakibara told BT, even though he expects the yen to remain below 100 to the dollar in the foreseeable future.\n\n\"It's much better to produce where you sell and where the market is,\" said the former vice-finance minister for international affairs. \"Japanese manufacturers have done that, by going to China, South-east Asia and India, and I don't think there will be any major reversal of that trend.\n\n\"Wage rates remain lower elsewhere (outside of Japan), and a 10 or 20 per cent depreciation of the Japanese currency - the yen has fallen by around 17 per cent in value against the dollar over the past year - does not fundamentally change the situation,\" Mr Sakakibara added.\n\nWhile some believe Canon's announcement may be designed as a sweetener to labour unions, as the annual spring wage offensive (shunto) approaches, the president of the Japanese confederation of trades unions (Rengo) Nobuaki Koga also subscribes to the view that globalisation of production is irreversible.\n\n\"Globalisation will continue,\" Mr Koga told the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan in Tokyo last Friday. \"The overall national ratio of jobs to applicants in Japan has moved up to 1:1 (one to one) as a result of economic recovery, so there is no need from a domestic employment point of view to re-shore production.\"\n\nMeanwhile, analysts say future capital investment trends by Japanese manufacturing firms - in terms of domestic versus overseas investment - will provide a clearer indication of whether or not the re-shoring process, either in the form of switching to domestic production or closing overseas facilities, is taking root.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economists had expected a slight dip in growth in Q4.\n\nA further slowdown would test the government's willingness to implement the broadest policy shifts since the 1990s and tackle debt-fuelled investment, after President Xi Jinping scrapped a goal of \"relatively fast\" growth in his first year in office.\n\nMarkets responded negatively to the news. Stocks closed 0.88 per cent lower in Hong Kong and down 0.68 per cent in China. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 13.7 points to below 2,000, its lowest level since last July.\n\nFor the whole of 2013, the economy grew 7.7 per cent, the same pace as the previous year and slightly above market expectations for a 7.6 per cent expansion. It is forecast to expand 7.4 per cent this year, according to an analyst survey last month, the slowest pace since 1990.\n\nThe economy will be stable in 2014, Ma Jiantang, head of the statistics bureau, said at a media briefing yesterday. The contribution to GDP from tertiary industries such as services exceeded secondary ones, mostly manufacturing, for the first time in 2013, Mr Ma noted.\n\nWhile higher than the official target of 7.5 per cent, the annual growth figure was the worst performance of the world's second-largest economy since 1999, as it is saddled with debt and slowing overseas demand.\n\nThe government issued a massive reform plan at the Communist Party Plenum last November aimed at reducing imbalances of the economy. Reform of land rights, urban household registration, liberalisation of banking and an overhaul of the fiscal system are designed to make the economy more reliant on domestic consumption than massive infrastructure and government spending.\n\nThese reforms will weigh on growth, economists say, and policymakers will have to strike a balance between slower growth and keeping employment strong.\n\n\"This set of data is consistent with our call that the economy is steady, with a weakening bias. After the third plenum, the authorities' focus has shifted from maintaining stability to reforms and the anti-corruption campaign. These are positive for China in the long run, but do undermine the current growth momentum,\" said Dong Tao, research analyst with Credit Suisse.\n\nOther data released yesterday also pointed to a softening of the economy, with industrial production and fixed-asset investment both underperforming. They are consistent with purchasing managers data which all fell last month while staying in positive territory.\n\nDecember industrial production growth slowed more than expected from 10 per cent year-on-year to 9.7 per cent. Fixed-asset investment dipped a full percentage point to a seven-year low of 17.2 per cent, dragged down by infrastructure growth which plummeted by more than 15 percentage points to around 6 per cent.\n\nMuted activity was reflected in steel output, which dropped for the third consecutive month in December, while oil consumption rose at its slowest rate in five years in 2013.\n\n\"If policymakers tighten their grip on local government borrowing as they have signalled, this pillar of growth can hardly do better in 2014,\" said Yao Wei, an economist at Societe Generale.\n\nChina experienced two credit crunches last year, a strong sign that the central bank is keen to wean banks from cheap credit.\n\nLast month, China unveiled the results of a long-awaited debt audit, which revealed that liabilities carried by local governments had ballooned to 17.9 trillion yuan (S$3.8 trillion) as at end-June, up 67 per cent from the end of 2010. Economists say the debt pile will weigh on future growth as credit becomes tighter. Total debt reached more than 200 per cent of GDP by end-2013.\n\n\"There was steady economic progress (last year) and this was no small achievement,\" the National Bureau of Statistics said in a statement following the release of the data.\n\nIt added: \"However, we should keep in mind that the deep-rooted problems built up over time have yet to be solved in what is a critical period for China's economy. The risk of local government debt should be prevented and greater efforts are to be made to weed out outdated production capacity.\"\n\nNext year, economists expect the official GDP target to remain unchanged at 7.5 per cent, but see a downward trend as policymakers continue to rein in shadow banking and cap the growth of local government debt. \"Several borrowing channels have already started to cool, responding to tight liquidity conditions.

The 2012 fare exercise was suspended to give the Fare Review Mechanism Committee (FRMC) time to complete its work, but the government decided to apply the 2012 quantum in the 2013 Fare Review Exercise.\n\nFor 2013, the new formula resulted in a fare cap of 2.1 per cent for a total hike of 6.6 per cent.\n\n\"Clearly, 6.6 per cent in one go is very high, and so, to minimise the impact on commuters, it was quite obvious to us that we should just do part of the increase this year, and rollover the rest as provided for under the new \"rollover\" mechanism as recommended in the FRMC report, and came to the decision to do 3.2 per cent for this round, and rolling over the balance of 3.4 per cent to the 2014 exercise,\" said PTC chairman Gerard Ee.\n\nBut he added that because the 2014 fare adjustment formula will probably be minus 0.3 per cent, the remaining fare cap next year should be about 3.1 per cent.\n\nMr Ee stressed that the PTC's mandate is to strike a balance between fare affordability and the financial viability of the public transport operators (PTOs).\n\nWith this year's fare increase of 3.2 per cent \"significantly lower\" than the expected average national wage increase for 2013 - expected to be close to 5 per cent - he said that the fare hike is acceptable from the affordability perspective.\n\nFrom April 6, 2014, adult card fares for buses and trains will go up by four to six cents per journey, while student concessionary fares will rise by two cents per journey and senior citizen concession fares by two to three cents.\n\nBut cash fares will cost more, with adult bus and train rides climbing 20 cents per trip, and concession cash fares up 10 cents per trip.\n\nTo ensure fares remain affordable, existing concession schemes are enhanced. There will be free travel for children under seven years old (from below 0.9 metre tall); monthly concession passes for polytechnic students will be cut to the same as those for secondary school and junior college students; lower prices for all hybrid monthly concession passes; a new $120 adult monthly unlimited travel pass to help frequent public transport users cap their expenditure; a new $60 monthly unlimited travel concession pass for senior citizens; and the removal of the daily limit for all train and hybrid monthly passes.\n\nMr Ee added: \"All these enhancements are expected to benefit approximately half a million of the current 1.2 million existing concession beneficiaries, and these are on top of the two new concession schemes for low-income workers and persons with disabilities that would be separately implemented by the government.\"\n\nOf the $53.5 million in additional fare revenue, $36 million is for SBS Transit and $17.5 million for SMRT. As the bus business is less profitable than rail, the FRMC had recommended that the weightage for fare revenue allocation be set at 1.1 in favour of the bus mode. As a result, the bus mode will receive about $48 million while the rail mode gets $5.5 million.\n\nSBST operates three-quarters of all public buses in Singapore, while SMRT runs a bigger rail network.\n\nThe more profitable SMRT will contribute 25 per cent of the fare revenue increase to the Public Transport Fund, which helps needy families cope with fare adjustments. SBST's share is 20 per cent, taking the two PTOs' total one-off contribution to $11.58 million or 21.6 per cent of the extra revenue. SBST said that it would contribute $7.2 million to the fund.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The move is seen as a major step in succession planning at the property and hotel group.\n\nThe chief executive post that the 49-year-old Australian will assume from Feb 17 is a newly created one at CDL, which last year marked its 50th anniversary.\n\nThe group's managing director, 60-year-old Kwek Leng Joo, will relinquish his current post to assume the role of deputy chairman, another newly minted post. His elder brother, Leng Beng, 72, remains executive chairman.\n\nCDL is the last of the major listed companies in the Singapore Hong Leong Group - controlled by the Kwek family - to be run by an outside professional.\n\nMr Kelley, \"with his wide expertise in finance and international real estate investment . . . will initiate new strategies and intensify CDL's diversification plans\", said Mr Kwek Leng Beng in a statement.\n\n\"We need to be less Singapore-centric in light of limited opportunities domestically. These appointments will help strengthen and deepen the expertise of our management team as we shift gears and look outwards to capitalise on growth markets,\" he added.\n\nMr Kelley has more than two decades' global experience in corporate strategy, private equity and real estate investment in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. He also has experience in the hospitality industry.\n\n\"Leveraging on Grant's experience at Colony, where he managed a wide portfolio of hotel assets, he will be in a unique position to help monitor the performance of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels (M&C) plc, a major subsidiary and revenue contributor to CDL,\" said Mr Kwek Leng Beng.\n\nIn addition, Mr Kelley will enhance CDL's management structures and systems towards greater productivity. \"These plans are aligned with the Singapore government's productivity policies.\"\n\nMr Kelley started out in 1989 at Booz Allen (now known as Booz & Co), advising CEOs of major listed companies in the financial services, resources and healthcare industries. Prior to his CDL appointment, he served as head of real estate, Asia-Pacific at Apollo Global Management. From 2004 to 2008, he was the CEO of Colony Capital Asia.\n\nIn 2005, he led one of Asia's biggest buyouts when Colony acquired Raffles Holdings' entire hotel portfolio including the Singapore icon Raffles Hotel for about $1.72 billion.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2004, Mr Kelley was based in New York, where he was a principal at Colony with responsibility for the identification of US investment opportunities.\n\nMr Kelley was a director of Sentosa Development Corporation (March 2007 to February 2011) and of Sentosa Leisure Holdings (May 2007 to March 2009).\n\nLike Mr Kwek Leng Beng, Mr Kelley has a law degree. In addition to Bachelor of Laws from University of Adelaide, he holds a Master's in International Relations from London School of Economics, and an MBA from Harvard Business School.\n\nMr Kwek has in recent years repeatedly said, when quizzed on succession planning at the group, that he is not averse to getting an outsider to run the company, though many experienced and capable family members are also involved with the group.\n\nHis elder son, Sherman, is CEO of CDL China. Mr Kwek Leng Joo's elder son, Eik Sheng, heads CDL's corporate development department.\n\nAmong the non-family members running the other listed vehicles in Hong Leong Group are Wong Hong Ren, who is CEO at London-listed M&C; Philip Ting, CEO at Hong Leong Asia; and Ian Macdonald, president of Hong Leong Finance. Mr Kwek Leng Beng is managing director and chairman at Hong Leong Finance.\n\nCDL, at its last results briefing in August 2013, announced several new growth platforms to augment its domestic residential property development business, including steps to accelerate its overseas growth engine.\n\nBesides stepping up its existing China business, it is looking to engage in residential projects in Central London.\n\nMyanmar is another potential overseas market, starting with hotels. The group later announced the pruchase of multi-storey carpark in Knightsbridge for \u00a380 million (S$158.7 million) with the intention of redeveloping it into a luxury residential project.\n\nIn its statement yesterday, CDL said that Mr Kwek Leng Joo, as deputy chairman, will focus on product innovation and continue to provide leadership on corporate social responsibility and sustainability initiatives as well as corporate governance matters. Under his leadership, CDL has become a green building champion and a forerunner in CSR. He is also an avid photographer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Data for September was also overstated - NODX was initially said to have shrunk 1.2 per cent when the actual contraction was a larger 2 per cent - due to the \"multiple counting of some trade permits\".\n\nAs trade data for both months have been corrected downwards, total trade and NODX for the full year 2013 will now come in lower than expected, IE said in an annex to its trade report for December, released yesterday.\n\nIE will only announce Singapore's full-year trade data next month, but UOB economist Francis Tan estimates that full-year NODX would have dropped 5.4 per cent, taking September and October's erroneous figures, but could now fall a sharper 6 per cent. Both are worse than IE's forecast of a NODX contraction of 4 to 5 per cent for 2013, last revised down in November.\n\nMarket economists who follow Singapore's trade data closely expressed shock. \"It has to be once in a blue moon that such things happen,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nBut \"no great damage was done\", said Barclays economist Joey Chew. \"After all, the October red herring of a recovery was quickly refuted the very next month when November exports fell sharply, indicating that Singapore exports are clearly not yet out of the woods. The continued slump in electronics in December further confirmed that,\" she said.\n\nIE confirmed that trade data for November, released in December, was accurate.\n\nUOB's Mr Tan thinks it a \"blessing in disguise\" that the errors occurred close to the end of the year and only over two months. It would be quite different if the errors had occurred in January and February and were discovered in May, as that could change the trajectory and outlook for the year more significantly, he said.\n\nCiti economists Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan wrote in a note that although the two months' revisions suggest on face value that Q4 GDP may also be adjusted down, exports data could and does diverge from industrial production. But downward revisions in the non-oil re-exports will probably hit the transport and storage services sector's contribution to GDP, they said.\n\nIE said yesterday that the errors were traced back to changes to a trade declaration system known as Access, which is used by four air express companies to declare their consolidated imports and exports. In August last year, changes were made to this system to allow the companies to make amendments to their trade permit records, such as flight details.\n\nHowever, all amended permits were counted as new ones when transmitted from the Access system to the Singapore Customs' Trade Statistics System, and then to IE Singapore. In nominal terms, the counting errors meant a difference between an originally tabulated NODX value of $15.599 billion for October, and a corrected value of $14.757 billion.\n\nIn response to BT's queries, IE explained that the over-reporting was not immediately apparent as the values of the individual records still fell within the expected range. \"When unusually large numbers were picked up, IE Singapore worked with Singapore Customs immediately to investigate and rectify the issue,\" IE said.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah thinks internal processes need to be tightened when it comes to collecting official data. \"We have seen quite significant revisions, not just in NODX, but also in the advanced GDP estimates. Whether these are estimates or actual figures, there ought to be as little revision as possible. These numbers are important to everyone who wants a good gauge of where the economy is going, not just economists,\" he said.\n\nFor trade data, Singapore Customs conducts selective checks of trade permits against the commercial documents to verify the accuracy of data submitted by traders. \"IE Singapore also conducts checks on a monthly basis to track trends based on the value of goods and large ticket items. Export and import categories with significant data swings will be picked up for further verification and analysis in consultation with Singapore Customs,\" IE said.\n\nAs for whether these errors undermine the reliability of Singapore's statistics, Credit Suisse economist Michael Wan said that he sees them as inherent to the \"messy affair\" of collecting data. \"I don't think it raises questions about the integrity of Singapore's statistical collection fundamentally. It's always an ongoing affair to reduce the number of errors,\" he said.\n\nUOB's Mr Tan said: \"The good thing is that they are at least signalling that they are doing the right thing, by coming out and correcting the errors.\"\n\nA couple of errors ought not to affect credibility, said Barclays' Ms Chew. \"Especially if the errors are due to technological problems rather than data collection issues, or people gaming the system - for example Chinese exporters reporting fake trade.\"\n\nShe does have other issues to raise about Singapore's data though. \"First, the timeliness. We are one of the last to report CPI (consumer price index) in the region, and I don't understand why. Also, IE Singapore does not release a lot of the export data they collect,\" Ms Chew said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's been tough, but I'm very proud of what we've accomplished. And we couldn't have found a better partner anywhere in the world.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By David Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 17, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTRADITION. It's the very foundation upon which the Chinese New Year celebration is built upon. But with the slew of new-fangled yusheng variations (itself not a traditional dish), luxed-up pen cai and even non-Chinese chefs getting in on the act, where do the festive favourites of yore fit in?\n\nPerhaps a trifle uneasily, which is why putting together a reunion meal today that might resemble that enjoyed in the motherland is more an exception than the norm. But if you look close enough, you'll find a handful of purists in the restaurant scene who are still intent on preserving their heritage.\n\nIf you're aiming to bring some tradition back into your reunion dinner, here's a quick tour of the different Chinese dialects and their contributions to culinary history.\n\nHokkien\n\nHokkien cooking can be traced back more than 2,100 years, to the Han Dynasty circa 156 BC. The people lived on fertile land and this was reflected in their cuisine. Hence, farm produce was their mainstay, with wheat, potato, yam and radish being their main dietary staples. Meat and seafood were eaten only on special occasions, says chef Alfred Ow of Quan Xin Yuan Restaurant, adding, \"our cuisine is down-to-earth and hearty\".\n\nA bowl of noodles is a must on the first day of the Chinese New Year, as it symbolises long life for every member of the household. If chicken is served, protocol dictates that the head be offered to the most senior member of the family, the wings to the males who travel for a living, and the drumsticks to the children.\n\nVegetables are also symbolic, explains chef Ow. \"Apart from mustard green and chives, which both mean 'evergreen and everlasting' in our dialect, radish is a 'must' during the festive season. That's because radish is referred to as cai tou, which sounds like the phrase, 'Good things come in abundance'.\"\n\nRadish, then, is the main ingredient in Ganbei Luobo, a dish that Quan Xin Yuan offers during the festive season. \"We have served this dish for years at our 80-year-old restaurant,\" says Chef Ow, \"and nothing has changed in the recipe, except that fresh meat has been replaced by dried scallop\".\n\nLike much of Hokkien cuisine, the ingredients are straightforward while a lot of emphasis is placed on the cooking itself. \"Only radish, carrot, dried shiitake mushrooms, and dried scallops are used in this dish,\" Chef Ow explains. \"However, the key to the stock used for braising is the top-quality dried flatfish; it gives it a unique sweetness and aroma\".\n\nQuan Xin Yuan Pte Ltd\n\n252 Jalan Besar\n\nTel: 6294 6254\n\nTeochew\n\nAn ancient saying goes: \"fu li zi chu, shi zhu yin shi\". Translated, it means that while the food is good enough to be offered to the deities, it is also fit for people. The home region of the Teochews is located by the sea, sandwiched between Guangzhou and Fujian. Their food is deceptively simple, placing great emphasis on the freshness of ingredients, and complex cooking methods used to retain purity of flavour.\n\nTraditionally, the eve of Chinese New Year sees the Teochew family gathering around the dining table, or setting off firecrackers until dawn to chase away bad luck. During this prolonged eating ritual, a steamboat would be placed at the centre of the table. Zhang Xinmin, a Shantou-based expert on Teochew cuisine, explains, \"Every dish and ingredient that is used is significant in some way. The symbolism could lie in the shape of the ingredient or in its name, which may be similar in sound to an auspicious object or word.\"\n\nChinese New Year is also a period to splurge, especially on food. The Teochews are adept at cooking prized seafood, be it fresh produce or dried delicacies. It is also common to present family and friends with expensive foodstuffs during the festivities. Jasmine Lee, the fourth generation owner of Teochew restaurant, Huat Kee (1988) Pte Ltd, remembers how luxury ingredients were gradually introduced in her restaurant. \"It was the second generation owner - my grandfather - who started to offer Braised BaoyuHaishen, or abalone with sea cucumber. The name sounds like 'you are guaranteed for a promotion' in Mandarin makes it popular with customers.\"\n\nIn this dish, specially selected 24-head Australian abalone is braised with sea cucumber in superior stock for hours. \"In the past, the sea cucumber would be toasted over charcoal fire for extra crispiness and a caramelised taste before serving. Now, we use a blowtorch to scorch it instead.\"\n\nTeochew Restaurant Huat Kee (1998) Pte Ltd\n\n74 Amoy Street\n\nTel: 6423 4477\n\nCantonese\n\nGuangdong was one of the earliest provinces to attract migrants from across the Chinese mainland, as well as foreigners to trade and make a living. Thus the natives of Guangdong, the Cantonese, had long enjoyed a cosmopolitan lifestyle which is reflected in their rich cuisine.\n\nCantonese families would save for months to put together a lavish meal for Chinese New Year. Apart from the usual meat dishes, expensive dried delicacies would make their annual appearance on the dining table. More so than almost any other ethnic group, the Cantonese are obsessive about naming their food. Pig's tongue would be named to sound like \"profit\", dried oyster to become \"good blessing\", and fish made to signify \"abundance\".\n\nChris Kuang, chef of Moi Lum Restaurant Pte Ltd, says, \"Pig's trotters have always been important for Chinese New Year because its name sounds like 'good things will fall into one's hand'. Braised Pork Trotter in Black Moss is a dish that almost all Cantonese would eat at their reunion meal.\"\n\nBut certain adjustments had to be made to suit today's taste buds. Dried oyster used to be an ingredient in the dish, because its name ho xi sounded like good fortune. Unfortunately, its musky flavour did not sit well with young diners, so they dropped it. Black moss, on the other hand, was spared. Fa cai, or windfall, has always been a part of this dish. \"Luckily, everybody likes to have a windfall on their hands and we managed to keep it in!\" smiles Chef Kuang.\n\nMoi Lum Restaurant Pte Ltd\n\n38 Maxwell Road\n\nAirview Building\n\n#01-01/02\n\nTel: 6226 2283\n\nHakka\n\nThe Hakka were originally nomadic tribes from northern China. In historic times, they were uprooted and migrated southwards. The majority of them eventually settled in Fujian, Guangdong, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Hence Hakka cuisine today varies according to where its practitioners reside.\n\nThe Hakkas were a hardworking tribe who ate what they sowed. Because of their historic tribulations, the Hakkas are frugal, and even during festive seasons, expensive delicacies such as abalone and shark's fins are hardly seen on the dining table.\n\nPen cai, according to Lai Fak Nian of Plum Village restaurant, \"originated when families would bring a simple dish or two with them, when they visited the ancestral hall at festive times. The men would stay the whole day, loitering and playing card games. So when it came to meal times, the food would simply be stacked on top of each other for reheating\". Pen cai began as a communal dish; however most restaurants have turned it into an expensive dish by 'upgrading' it with abalone, sea cucumbers and other prime foodstuffs.\n\n\"My version of Pen cai came from my ancestral hometown in Meizhou, near Fujian,\" explains Mr Lai. \"The ingredients are even simpler than those offered in the New Territories in Hong Kong.\"\n\nWhile Pen cai may appear to be simply a pot full of various foods, there are certain ingredients crucial to the mix because of their auspicious significance.\n\nTo start, mustard greens are placed at the bottom of the pot to keep the meat from sticking. This also ensures that the vegetables absorb all the essence from the stock, becoming more tasty. When all the ingredients have been stacked, a few huge leaves of cabbage are used to cover the pot. \"These leaves retain the heat during cooking, so the whole dish would have a braising effect,\" Mr Lai explains.\n\nThe other ingredients that would go into the pot would be fish balls, pork balls, beef balls, pig's trotter, chicken and the ubiquitous stuffed toufu.\n\nPlum Village Restaurant\n\n16 Jalan Leban\n\nTel: 6458 9005\n\nZhejiang\n\nThe influx of mainland Chinese to Singapore has also meant the mushrooming of different cuisine variations beyond those of the Guangzhou region. Zhejiang, for example, is one of China's eight major cuisines. The province comprises the cities of Hangzhou, Shaoxing and Ningbo, and is simply known as the \"land of fish and rice\". The characteristic methods of Zhejiang-style cooking are frying, steaming and braising, its most famous dish being Dongpo Ro, which requires both quick-frying and braising methods.\n\nFor the past century, another Zhejiang dish that has been a must for Chinese New Year is Ba Bao Ji, or Braised Eight-Treasure Chicken. Although Eight-Treasure Duck was made famous in Zhejiang and Shanghai, it is believed that the original version came from Sichuan as Eight-Treasure Chicken. Eight carefully selected stuffings, such as lotus seed, bamboo shoots and gingko nuts, are used.\n\nAccording to Chef Colin Liang of Silk Road Restaurant, \"Chicken is also much preferred because ji sounds like 'luck' in Mandarin\". While the original version may be humble, nowadays abalone and black moss are added because of the affluence of our society. \"The preparation of the dish is time consuming: the chicken is deboned, stuffed, and deep-fried briefly, then braised before steaming,\" explains Chef Liang. \"The stuffing for this version would be gingko nuts, lotus seeds, chestnuts, mushrooms, roast pork, black moss and abalone.\"\n\nWhen served, the chicken would be sliced from the back and its stuffing exposed to the diners.\n\nSilk Road Restaurant\n\n165 Tanjong Pagar Road\n\nAmara Hotel\n\nTel: 6879 2655\n\nShanghai\n\nAlthough Shanghai is located next to Zhejiang, its cuisine has a unique identity and is known simply as Hu cuisine. Since the early days, Shanghai's population has been one of immigrants from the nearby provinces; its cuisine is thus a melting pot of Jiangsu and Zhejiang cuisines. The Shanghainese are specially known for using alcohol and soy sauce in their cooking.\n\nShanghai enjoys an abundance of fresh water ponds inland, and the East China Sea off its shores. It therefore enjoys freshwater produce as much as the catch from the sea.\n\nFood served during the Spring Festival is seldom lavish. In fact, most of the food is simple home-cooked dishes such as fried nianguo, smoked freshwater carp, Eight-treasure rice and Quan Jia Fu, which is a much lesser-known dish outside of the Shanghai family.\n\nAccording to Eve Liu, who runs Pu Dong Kitchen, \"Quan Jia Fu is a must for all Shanghainese families during the Chinese New Year. The name of the dish means 'the whole family will be showered with blessings through the year'. The ingredients are simple: meat balls, bamboo shoots, sea cucumber, squid, mushrooms, and lastly, fried egg dumpling.\"\n\nThe egg dumplings are made of thinly fried egg skin wrapped with meat stuffing. They are found in many Shanghainese dishes and snacks at home. These ingredients would be arranged in a pot and simmered in a tasty broth before being served to the family.\n\nPu Dong Kitchen\n\n271 Bukit Timah Road\n\n#B1-02 Balmoral Plaza\n\nSingapore 259708\n\nTel: 6732 8966\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Football may be his passion, but it seems owning a European league club may again elude the Singapore tycoon for the third time.\n\nYesterday, Bankia, the principle creditor and de facto owner of Mr Lim's takeover target, said that it has received \"multiple\" offers for Valencia, a two-time Champions League finalist.\n\nMr Lim, who has previously failed in his takeover of England's Liverpool FC and Spain's Atletico Madrid, will have to confront a bidding war if he remains keen on Valencia.\n\nHe is now in Spain and was not immediately available to comment.\n\nBankia disclosed that it has received \"more than one bid\" even though barely 20 minutes before Mr Lim's Jan 15 deadline for the bank to accept his offer, Valencia's president Amadeo Salvo claimed Mr Lim's was the only official bid received.\n\nBankia declined to disclose the number and identity of buyers. But serious rivals are reported to be heavyweights including Abu Dhabi's Mubadala (a main source of funding for the English side), Qatari Investment Authority and the American investment fund TPG (formerly known as Texas Pacific Group). The latter is rumoured to have the most attractive offer so far.\n\nAmerican fund GEM and Costa Rican mystery man Mario Alvarado are also rumoured to be interested.\n\nMr Lim's attempt to own a league club has been well reported. His \u00a3360 million (S$749.2 million) attempt to buy Liverpool was rejected in 2010 by club figures sceptical about his intentions. The English club was eventually sold for \u00a3300 million to New England Sports Ventures (NESV), which owns the Boston Red Sox baseball team.\n\nThe self-made billionaire has also been linked with moves to invest in Rangers, Atletico Madrid and Middlesbrough - all of which led to nothing in the end. He was reportedly put in touch with Mr Salvo by Portuguese \"super-agent\" Jorge Mendes.\n\nIn December, Mr Lim offered to spend between 30 million euro (S$52 million) and 50 million euro on players in January and assume the majority of its debt in the region of 354 million euro. His offer, which is backed by Mr Salvo, includes the significant sums the club owe for the building of the Nou Mestalla stadium - the 250-300 million euro white elephant that has dogged Valencia since its construction began in 2007.\n\nBut the sale of Valencia is anything but straightforward. The club requires Bankia to approve Mr Lim's offer. Mr Lim has given Bankia until Jan 15 to accept the offer.\n\nAccording to reports from Spanish daily paper AS, Mr Lim has been turned off by Bankia who have been giving him the silent treatment for quite some time and is very unhappy with the purchase process as a whole.\n\nMr Lim has even reportedly instructed his team to begin searching for clubs in the English Premier League that he could potentially invest in.\n\nHowever, Mr Lim recently reiterated his interest in completing the Valencia investment. He even promised a bigger war chest than had originally been suggested for transfer spending.\n\n\"I hope my offer is accepted. 40 million euro for signings is too little I feel. I have 50 million euro available to spend this month,\" said the man whose net worth is US$2 billion according to Forbes.\n\nValencia, 11th in Spain's La Liga, has struggled with its finances amid a six-year real-estate slump that has roiled its plans to sell its Mestalla stadium and complete a new arena.\n\nOn Nov 26, 2013, Bankia rejected a plan by the club to repay debt of as much as 250 million euro over 18 years.\n\nYet in many ways, troubled Valencia can be an attractive proposition for potential investors.\n\nWith a half-finished, 75,000-plus capacity modern stadium on its doorstep and a dedicated fan base ready to fill it, they are often described as the third biggest club in La Liga in terms of support.\n\nAlong with Atletico Madrid, Valencia also shares the biggest slice of the TV revenue pie outside of Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\nAs one Spanish football commentator noted: \"If the sheen of their name has been removed somewhat by their very public struggle with debt and subsequent sale of superstar players over the last seven years or so, they still remain, in principle, a club with significant potential both in a sporting and marketing capacity.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue surged to $30.2 million from $13 million.\n\nNet asset value increased to 31.4 cents per share as at end-December from 30.9 cents as at end-March.\n\nBut third-quarter minority interests grew to $2.3 million, from negative $113,000 a year ago, to take a chunk off the bottom line. Net profit margin fell to 17.2 per cent in the quarter from 28.2 per cent a year ago.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit stood at $9.5 million, or 0.82 cent per share, an almost fivefold year-on-year growth from $1.92 million.\n\nThe gains were helped by sales of residences and LDRs in Myanmar, which in Q3 generated $27.2 million, or 90 per cent of the quarter's total revenue. Nine-month revenue was $72.4 million, up from $38.2 million.\n\nYoma said it has sold all but two of the 528 units in two buildings within the Star City project. Only about $15 million of the $60.6 million of contractual revenue from those sales have been recognised so far, and the remaining $45.9 million of revenue is expected to be recognised within the next 12 to 18 months on a percentage of completion basis.\n\nThe new Balloons Over Bagan hot-air balloon business also began to contribute to sales, of $2.1 million, during the quarter as the business season opened in October.\n\nThe company said that it was \"confident\" in the outlook for 2014, citing ongoing reforms in Myanmar, growing tourism and opportunities in greenfield projects. Over the past year, Yoma has announced that it is looking to expand its fledgling motor vehicle repair business with Mitsubishi, with the possibility of motor vehicle distribution in the future.\n\nA Yoma joint venture with Digicel Group and First Myanmar Investment Co has also agreed with Ooredoo to build telecommunications towers in Myanmar as part of Ooredoo's plan to provide telco services in the country.\n\nYoma shares closed at 73 cents yesterday, down by 1.4 per cent or one cent, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is to help them pursue better job and training opportunities farther away from their homes. To be eligible, they must be Singaporeans aged 35 years and older, earning an average gross monthly income of below $1,900 and living in a property with an annual value not exceeding $13,000, among various criteria.\n\nPWDs will get a 25 per cent discount off adult fares with maximum fares capped at a distance of 7.2km. Alternatively, they can opt to buy a monthly concession pass with unlimited bus and train rides for $60 per month.\n\nSingaporeans and permanent residents below 60 years are eligible for the PWD concession scheme if, among various conditions, they are certified by a medical practitioner as having a permanent disability.\n\nBeneficiaries of existing disability schemes and services and members (with permanent disability) of relevant VWOs (voluntary welfare organisations) are automatically eligible for the scheme.\n\nTransport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said this is the first time the government is funding such schemes.\n\n\"The LWW concessionary fare, with 15 per cent discount off adult fares, will bring their public transport fares to price levels comparable to what they were paying 10-15 years ago,\" he posted on his Facebook page, adding that PWDs will get even bigger discounts, from 25 per cent to over 50 per cent.\n\nMr Lui said: \"And for the general population who need assistance to meet the cost of public transport, we will have available more than twice the number of vouchers that were disbursed in 2011, and make these available all year round.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Four successful movie adaptations and a hundred million books later, Clancy's familiar and much-admired All-American hero is still very much in the action-thriller frame.\n\nJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit is an origins story and the second cinematic reboot of the character created 30 years ago by Clancy, who died last October. The books tracked Ryan at various stages in his career and this film is the first original tale in the movie series - unfortunately, it shows. The storyline strains credibility while the attention to detail and the fully formed characters that were strong Clancy hallmarks are sadly missing. As a result, Shadow Recruit is a mere, well, shadow of its predecessors.\n\nThe new film, directed by Kenneth Branagh and written by Adam Cozad and David Koepp, follows the young Jack Ryan's early career, briefly chronicling his college days, his time in the Marines and a helicopter crash followed by a long rehabilitation in hospital, recovering from a broken back. It's an outline that includes Ryan's introduction to his future wife Cathy and his recruitment by the CIA.\n\nRyan's background was detailed in previous Clancy books but this time around the character is given a few tweaks and updated before being thrust into a modern-day adventure. Ryan (Chris Pine, taking over the role previously inhabited by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck) is a junior analyst in a Wall Street investment firm, where he works undercover and is tasked with looking for suspicious financial transactions that might be used to fund terrorist activities.\n\n\"It's going to get lonely, but that's how we like to do things,\" says William Harper (Kevin Costner), the naval commander who recruits him. Nothing gets past Ryan of course, and when he discovers that Russian oligarch Viktor Cherevin (Branagh) has been snapping up Treasury bonds and finagling the accounts, he flies to Moscow to confront the guy. The Cold War is long over and the battle lines are now drawn along economic fronts.\n\nBefore long, Ryan is caught up in a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with Cherevin, with fiance Cathy (Keira Knightley) as bait. The story involves a coordinated attack on the US financial system, action set pieces featuring several expendable Russian bodyguards and a whole lot of corny dialogue. It's all extremely forced and predictable and a far cry from the (mostly) well-paced, suspense-filled Jack Ryan outings of the past.\n\nDespite his stellar credentials, Branagh plays Cherevin as a standard one-dimensional villain with a bad accent and a permanent sneer while in the title role, Pine comes across as an enthusiastic Boy Scout with near-superhuman abilities - all he's missing is a red cape. The filmmakers may have set out to revive a potentially lucrative franchise but first, they need to rewrite the book.\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When the country had a change of government, the theatre archives were made available to the public, and that's when Mundo Perfeito director Tiago Rodrigues decided to go through the censorship material.\n\nHe trawled through pages of correspondence detailing why plays were censored and collated the lines which interested him. From there, he and the actors further selected the lines which they knew would work on stage. Then they crafted a structure to hold them together - so that the play we saw on stage had Acts and Scenes, styled within a mash-up of classic theatre pieces like Shakespeare and Greek works.\n\nBut all the text were completely made up of explanations given by censors when they cut out plays and suggested acting changes - when costumes were too revealing (skirts have to be three fingers below the knee) or actions too intimate, when suspected subversive metaphors were used, and even silences. What was most amazing is how censors became almost directorial in their changes, unleashing their inner directorial ambitions.\n\nActors Isabel Abreu and Goncalo Waddington - alternately campy and dramatic - together with their costume changes, kept the audience engaged throughout.\n\nThe most interesting premise, and poetic too, of Three Fingers Below the Knee was that it used the censors' words for the text; so that instead of shaping a play, they fleshed out the production - through their words and actions of cancellation and censorship. Director Rodrigues says no changes were made to the text at all, because then wouldn't he be censoring the censors? Besides, it wasn't meant to be an \"academic\" piece but there were sufficient \"signposts\" providing a context to the history of Portuguese censorship.\n\nWith the Singapore experience and a little knowledge of the struggles of theatre-makers against the censorship committee, it was gratifying to look into another country's experience of it - even if they harked back to another time in history.\n\nAnd was this play censored by Singapore censors, asked an audience member who was clearly surprised, and sounded disappointed, that it wasn't at all. But then, why would one country's censors censure another country's censored material, pointed out Haresh Sharma, co-artistic director of the M1 Fringe Festival, who chaired the post-show discussion.\n\nRodrigues, in turn, affirmed that historical material need not be incomprehensibly weighty, nor need one be too heavy-handed with the political comment - for the audience to grasp and better appreciate the nuances.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But bewilderment over the magnitude of the premium hikes remains. To recap, premiums for Integrated Shield plans were raised last March on the back of an adjustment of MediShield premiums. Among the Integrated Shield plans, the average premium increase in the various age bands was reportedly between 20 and 50 per cent. But that average masks some sharp increases among older age groups - where, for some age bands, annual premiums effectively doubled. To be sure, insurers were quick with the reassurance that benefits were enhanced, to include coverage for congenital and neonatal treatments, for example. The rub is that the older cohort of policyholders is likely to feel that the enhancements are not meaningful enough to justify the significantly higher premiums.\n\nBut the more salient reason for the hike is a markedly higher claims experience in recent years. At least one insurer has said that its average claims cost has risen by as much as 50 per cent between 2008 and 2011. For MediShield, a not-for-profit scheme, the amount of claims paid out nearly doubled between 2008 and 2012, while premiums collected rose 40 per cent. It has been reported that over the five years, the average payout per claim had risen 12 per cent.\n\nPolicyholders must keep in mind that Integrated Shield plans are offered by private insurers with a profit motive. Cherry-picking risks, for instance, are par for the course, and premiums are priced to generate a surplus. As long as premiums are not excessive, the result should be a sustainable product which is surely to all policyholders' benefit.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Virgin Australia (VA) - in which both SIA and Air NZ are major shareholders - is striving to gain market share Down Under, especially in the lucrative corporate travel sector.\n\nThe SIA/Air NZ tag-team, which comes after the move of Qantas' transit hub from Singapore to Dubai following an alliance with Emirates, could also divert traffic away from Australia since Qantas operates from Auckland to Singapore (via Sydney).\n\nFor consumers, this will provide greater choice as SIA and Air NZ seek to bump up capacity between the two countries by up to 30 per cent over time.\n\nFor Air NZ, not only does this mean the ability to reintroduce flights to Singapore after having pulled out in 2006, it will also deliver access to over 50 destinations in SIA's network via codeshare travel - not an insignificant number.\n\nIn return, SIA gets to strengthen its position with more domestic points in Air NZ's network as well in the Pacific Islands, albeit with traffic typically being seasonal. New Zealand doesn't tend to rate among Singapore's biggest source markets for tourist arrivals either. Some 123,700 travellers came here in 2012, according to figures from the Singapore Tourism Board.\n\nBut the bigger prize being dangled is the traffic that SIA could see onward from Singapore as Kiwi travellers leverage on the carrier's network to travel to destinations in Europe, Asia and Africa. In addition, as CAPA - Centre for Aviation analyst Brendan Sobie pointed out, if New Zealand pushes for a bigger slice of the tourism pie, the number of tourists from Asia headed for New Zealand - via SIA and Changi - could grow further.\n\nIn this respect, Changi Airport too gets a leg up from the alliance as more passenger could end up transiting there, which is important for the airport to remain a key regional hub.\n\nIn the last year or so, SIA has signed new codeshare deals with airlines such as Shenzhen Airlines, while expanding existing agreements with other carriers such as Scandinavian Airlines. And SIA is not done yet.\n\nFor SIA, alliances such as these mean lower risks - and possibly stronger returns - as opposed to acquiring or investing in airlines, as it no doubt discovered in its earlier dalliance with Air NZ. The Kiwi carrier had to be bailed out by its government after its subsidiary Ansett went belly up, which diluted SIA's 25 per cent stake in Air NZ down to 6.3 per cent. SIA eventually sold that stake at a loss in 2004.\n\nAfter all, SIA needs to be nimble and flexible, what with airlines facing a challenging operating environment - high fuel costs, uncertainties in the global economy as well as stiff competition from other carriers.\n\nSuch partnerships could also allow SIA to expand in other promising travel markets where there is room to build up a more sizeable presence, such as Africa and Latin America.\n\nAnd this new tie-up is a step in the right direction - a win-win situation for two carriers who face their own challenges but will likely do better tackling them standing together than apart.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Millions of people who didn't normally pick up romance novels clamoured for James's explicit stories of a dominant-submissive relationship between a rich businessman and an insecure, college-age naif.\n\nRandom House, whose Knopf Doubleday division published the Fifty Shades trilogy, posted record profits in 2012 and awarded each of its employees in the US - even warehouse workers - a $5,000 bonus. Barnes & Noble reported a rare strong quarter in August 2012, citing Fifty Shades as a significant source of revenue.\n\nDay, 40, has been a professional novelist for the last decade, writing more than 20 books that were released by a handful of publishers.\n\nBut she achieved blockbuster success in part because of the so-called Fifty Shades effect in publishing, which sent readers of James's series looking for similar books. (Headline writers have also used the phrase Fifty Shades effect to describe a spike in domestic handcuff-related mishaps, particularly in Britain.) Day's three Crossfire books, released by Penguin, were clearly packaged to attract a wide crossover audience. They feature sleek dark covers strikingly similar to the Fifty Shades books, and are frequently placed directly next to the Fifty Shades series in bookstores.\n\nThe immense sales that followed - and her inclusion on The New York Times' best-seller list, a career first - got the attention of other publishers, which suddenly began competing for Day's attention.\n\nJennifer Enderlin, a publisher of St Martin's, said that she had been an admirer of Day's work since 2006, but that she approached her only last year to discuss the possibility of publishing her next books.\n\n\"We sat down for drinks, and she said, 'Let me just put it on the table: I want to publish you,'\" said Day, who lives in Las Vegas but keeps a pied-a-terre in New York City.\n\nDay, in a telephone interview, rejected the suggestion that her success was primarily attributable to the enormous sales of Fifty Shades and the widespread interest in romance in 2012. \"The majority of readers say that they don't believe they're reading romance novels,\" she said of her books. \"For them it's just a story.\" \"Maybe people started realising that you could buy romance in mainstream locations - drugstores and Wal-Mart and that kind of thing,\" she said.\n\nEnderlin said she believes Day's books transcend categorisation.\n\n\"I'm making a pretty big bet that she will be the person who is talked about in mainstream terms like James Patterson or Janet Evanovich,\" she said. \"I see this as blockbuster fiction. That's how I view it. I don't view it as 'Are people going to read this kind of book?'\" The Blacklist books follow the story of a young couple in Manhattan - she is a student at Columbia, he at Fordham University - and the ups and downs of their relationship over the years.\n\nThe new series acquired by St Martin's will be released beginning in 2015. Penguin UK bought the rights to the Blacklist books in a seven-figure deal. Berkley Books, an imprint of Penguin, has already acquired the rights to the fourth and fifth titles in the Crossfire series; their release date has not yet been set, Day said.\n\nSome publishing executives speculated that another boom in romance books could occur when the film version of Fifty Shades of Grey is released early next year. The movie is being filmed in Vancouver, with Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson as its stars.\n\nWhile the Fifty Shades and Crossfire books proved that there is a large crossover audience interested in romance or erotica, booksellers who enjoyed the sudden boom in foot traffic wonder if those readers have already moved on.\n\nCarolyn Anbar, a buyer at Watchung Booksellers in Montclair, NJ, said that while hundreds of shoppers enthusiastically bought paperbacks of Fifty Shades in 2012, now sales have dwindled to a few copies each month. Day's series sold well last summer, she said, but have sold very little since then.\n\n\"I think what was great about Fifty Shades for us, because of the very New York-y crowd that we have here, it was like, 'Yea, let's read it,'\" she said. \"We had an 85-year-old man come in because his wife's book group was reading it. There was no shame. But at this point, the whole genre has definitely died down for us.\" - NYT\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You get some Zhang Xiaogangs but they're the prints instead of the real thing. It's as if the galleries have settled on bringing smaller works that can fit into Singapore flats. Where is the big, gobsmacking art? I see very little of that here compared to Art Basel Hong Kong.\"\n\nBut it's still the fair to come to for South-east Asian artists, he notes, and \"their works are amazing\".\n\nThe focus on Asian art and platforms showcasing emerging artists, curated independently and without consideration for gallery sales so much, could prove to be a winning formula for Art Stage Singapore rather than the \"in-your-face\" stuff.\n\nOn the first day of the fair, Singaporean Ruben Pang's works quickly sold, as did Milenko Prvacki's $120,000 piece - and the sales buzz was focused primarily on Asian and South-east Asian artists. They were the first to literally fly off the shelves. Galleries were more than happy to give collectors what they wanted, and in turn helping Art Stage Singapore find its footing as a Singapore-based art fair.\n\nThe South-east Asian focus is what drew Aya Mousawi and Simon Sakhai, the founders of The Moving Museum, an international travelling museum project that brings top artworks to arts cities like Dubai and London.\n\n\"Usually in London, we get maybe three or four galleries showing South-east Asian works. That's a pity because it's such an important region with such a diverse scene. That's why we felt we had to come here, to see the range and depth of the region's art and pick out artists whom we might want to feature in the Moving Museum,\" Mr Sakhai says.\n\n\"In the earlier edition, the Western galleries had come here, trying to sell American and European art. From what I gathered, that strategy didn't work so well. This year, I see mostly galleries selling Asian art. They've clearly learnt the lesson about what people here want to buy. Many of the works are very good,\" notes Amelia Abdullahsani, independent curator and art dealer.\n\nIf the Indonesian platform last year was controversial, no less because Art Stage Singapore tried to play a gallerist's role by representing the artists, then this year's Asia Pacific-centric platforms - anchored by eight major regions in Asia - proved to be the most positive development.\n\nLouis Ho, art historian and curator for Galerie Sogan & Art, says: \"Clearly, the galleries are here to sell, so their art tends to be more commercial. But having the country platforms are a good idea because they have done a good job of putting out some very interesting art. So we get works by Victor Balanon, Mark Justiniani and Anurendra Jegadeva - all very good and who may not be featured by the galleries.\"\n\nNg Joon Kiat, leading Singapore artist showing at Space Cottonseed, says: \"Generally, the fair has become more mature in the way it presents art. For me, personally, this year is better because of the South-east Asian platform. We get to see, among other things, a small but powerful display of artworks by Singapore artists such as Robert Zhao, Donna Ong, Jolene Lai, Sarah Choo and Jeremy Sharma.\n\n\"The platforms allow buyers to get a sense of the artists to spot from South-east Asia,\" notes Ong Keng Sen, artistic director of Singapore International Arts Festival. \"The market also needs this kind of space and not just the hard sales. As Singapore is the expatriate's gateway to Asia, so Art Stage Singapore is a good introduction to the regional market.\n\n\"In that sense, Art Stage this year is more focused - people are looking with the view to invest, who to watch out for. It is no longer the general museum audience. Many visitors are making mental notes about this or that artist. The questions are pointed, the answers are becoming more specialised, so sales isn't the only hard gauge of the success.\"\n\nAnother reason for the upbeat mood at Art Stage Singapore this year was the layout, where booths seemed more open, and evenly sized, and corridors wider. \"The layout has certainly improved. The corridors are wider, and it's a lot easier to navigate the fair,\" says Alexandra Seno, executive producer in Asia of debating forum Intelligence Squared Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This can be used in power generation or as a feedstock in liquid fuels, fertilisers or chemical products.\n\nThe technology is used to extract coal resources considered too deep or low quality for conventional mining - a category that much of South Africa's coal resources fall under.\n\nUnder the agreement, Exxaro, the second largest coal producer in South Africa, was given a non-exclusive licence to use Linc Energy's UCG intellectual property in the sub-Saharan African region, and an exclusive licence in specific areas in the region.\n\nIn return, Linc Energy would receive a total of A$30 million. The first A$3 million has already been paid, while the remaining A$7 million payment will be made when the project passes agreed performance tests, expected in 2017.\n\nBesides also receiving royalties for the synthetic gas produced, Linc Energy will have a minimum stake of 15 per cent in the first UCG project, which is expected to produce 250 megawatts (MW) in electrical power, and the option to hold up to 49 per cent of all other UCG projects that Exxaro develops.\n\nLinc Energy touts UCG as the next big clean energy platform, and is also evaluating another UCG project in Russia, while conducting exploration and drilling programmes in Poland and Alaska.

Of course, shareholders will be on the lookout for final dividend payments, particularly for high-yield stocks.\n\n\"We think earnings will largely be in line and likely a non- event, and blue chips, which are projected to deliver average dividend yields of about 3.3 per cent, should also be able to match this ratio,\" said Carmen Lee, head of research at OCBC Securities.\n\n\"We will be watching guidance from key corporates for profitability guidance and direction. In particular, land-banking intention and selling price guidance from the developers will be closely monitored.\n\n\"For the rest of the sectors, interest expenses and structure will be indicative, especially in an environment of potentially higher rates from FY2015 onwards,\" said Ms Lee in a reply to a Business Times results survey.\n\nAccording to DBS Vickers, the expected weak FY13 earnings performance will allow for stronger growth in FY14 as it is coming off a lower base.\n\n\"We are already looking at a full-year negative growth of 3.9 per cent for FY13 for STI stocks,\" said Janice Chua, DBS Vickers' head of research. DBSV expects FY2014 earnings to grow an average of 11 per cent with bank, consumer, industrial, and oil and gas stocks leading the way.\n\n\"We believe the earnings downgrade cycle has bottomed and the key will be whether management guidance (for 2014) will disappoint and whether it will lead to the need to cut growth expectations for 2014,\" she said.\n\nDBSV's estimate of an average earnings decline of 3.9 per cent for FY13 is being led by the healthcare, oil and gas and consumer sectors.\n\nIn fact, most brokers would usually have already made their key sector and stock selections for 2014 in November or December last year and in the first week of January, and published their 2014 outlook reports.\n\nFor 2014, most broking houses BT spoke with were positive on the banks, offshore and marine, the consumer and industrial sectors but neutral to negative on telcos, transport and residential property.\n\nKey stock picks or favourites among the brokers are bank stocks including DBS, OCBC and UOB; conglomerates including Keppel Corporation and Sembcorp Industries; offshore and marine names including Sembcorp Marine and Ezion, while DBS Vickers cites Ezra and Vard as turnaround plays.\n\nAmong the property trusts in the top buys lists are CapitaCommercial Trust, CapitaMalls Asia, Starhill Global and Suntec Reit.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Market odds on a move by June narrowed to near one-in-two, from one- in-four ahead of the jobs figures.\n\nIn a report littered with unwelcome milestones, the Australian Bureau of Statistics found employment fell by 22,600 in December, confounding forecasts for a modest rise of 7,500. Full-time jobs fared even worse by diving 31,600.\n\nWhile unemployment did stay at 5.8 per cent for a third straight month, it was only because the participation rate dropped to its lowest since April 2006. \"We had hoped things were getting better but this just re-establishes the poor trend that lasted for most of 2013,\" said Michael Turner, a strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \"This probably won't be enough on its own to get the RBA over the line for a cut. But if the jobless rate were to start rising again, it might not have much tolerance for a rate above 6 per cent.\"\n\nThe central bank has shown a preference for any further easing in policy to come via a lower Australian dollar, rather than a decline in borrowing costs that could add fuel to an already hot housing market.\n\nIt would have found some comfort, therefore, in the currency's rapid fall yesterday, as it sank almost a full US cent to US$0.8805. That was the lowest since August 2010 and a very bearish development technically.\n\nThe drop in jobs was also likely to generate a lot of gloomy media headlines that could threaten the recent recovery in consumer confidence and spending.\n\nThe news around employment has been worrisome for a while with a number of high-profile companies announcing future redundancies, including airline Qantas and automaker Holden, the local unit of General Motors.\n\nYet there are statistical straws in the wind suggesting that firms are rediscovering an appetite for hiring.\n\nA quarterly survey of 2,600 employers by recruitment business Hudson out earlier this week showed around 23 per cent of firms expected to raise their headcount this year, compared to just 11 per cent that planned reductions.\n\nAustralia's largest online job site, SEEK, reported a strong rise of 3.2 per cent in the number of new job ads in November, the largest increase since April 2011. As a result, new ads rose faster than new applicants for the first time in a year. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/retirement-ordinary-people", "site_title": "Retirement for ordinary people", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nRetirement for ordinary people\n\nRetirement systems around the developed world are facing the problems of not being able to pay out what was promised, or falling short of giving what people need for a reasonable standard of living in their old age. SMU president Arnoud De Meyer and MIT Sloan School of Management finance professor and Nobel laureate Robert Merton discuss how to tackle that. CAI HAOXIANG reports\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 12, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE problem is simply stated. One of the biggest challenges that the government is facing is how to provide for a shrinking and ageing population that is living longer. Issues span the socioeconomic and political spheres.\n\nSingapore is grappling with the problem of a highly competitive, stressful, unequal society focused on economic growth, while balancing people's demand for a slower pace of life and a more egalitarian approach to those who have fallen behind in the rat race. Amid all this, more people are getting old and staying alive longer. Life expectancies in Singapore are among the highest in the world with a newborn male expected to live to 80 and a female, 85.\n\nThe number of citizens aged 65 and above are expected to triple to 900,000 by 2030. By then, just two working-age citizens will support one elderly, down from around six now. A low fertility rate and later marriage age, partially caused by life in an urbanised, developed city, compounds the problem. The need to have a sustainable system to ensure the economy keeps humming so that Singapore's elderly can be taken care of thus preoccupies policymakers. Taxes might have to go up.\n\nPolitically, Singaporeans are increasingly resistant to government policy that brings in foreigners to bolster economic growth in an increasingly overcrowded island that experienced infrastructural strains and dramatic property price increases in the last few years.\n\nEarly last year, the government bit the bullet with a controversially timed Population White Paper that laid out these problems and suggested that Singapore's population, then at 5.3 million, could rise to 6.5 to 6.9 million by 2030. It was later made clear in Parliament that the 6.9 million figure was not a target but a planning parameter.\n\nResources have been pumped into raising productivity, but progress is slow. If people need to work longer, they need to be employable and have the necessary skills. A mandatory re-employment system is in place to help people keep their jobs from the current retirement age of 62 till age 65 and the next steps will be to raise that to 67. Retirement communities and more healthcare and eldercare services are in the works.\n\nIn terms of retirement financing, one of the biggest reforms made in recent years is to the nation's pension fund system, the Central Provident Fund (CPF). A lifelong annuity scheme put in place called CPF Life is meant to tackle the problem of people outliving their retirement savings, by ensuring they have enough money to meet basic needs for as long as they live (see story below). For health care, a universal health insurance scheme for life called MediShield Life is being discussed, which will cover large hospital bills.\n\nProblems with Singapore's system\n\nBut the tendency for Singaporeans to want to upgrade their homes might prevent them from meeting their retirement needs. A November 2012 study commissioned by the Manpower Ministry concluded that most young Singaporeans were able to fund their retirement. But it rested on several key assumptions, including the buying of a Housing Board build-to-order (BTO) flat, with the size depending on which income percentile they are in, and not upgrading.\n\nSingaporeans upgrade their homes for a variety of reasons, such as moving to a resale flat that is closer to their parents, getting a larger space for their children to grow up in, or buying private property because it is seen as prestigious to do so. Resale properties can easily cost more than $100,000 compared to their BTO counterparts. The average 1,000 square foot suburban condominium currently costs $1.2 million, double that of an HDB five-room resale flat in a mature estate.\n\nThe use of savings for housing needs has diverted much money away from retirement, said SMU president Arnoud De Meyer at an event last Friday. He pointed to research done by the Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics showing that most Singaporeans use their money for housing, leaving the remainder with the CPF, and in bank accounts paying low returns.\n\nHe cited high fees and inertia for the fact that few Singaporeans invest outside of the CPF and suggested that alternative products such as bonds and low-cost life-cycle funds could be useful to deal with the inertia. He also calls for \"restraint\" on the use of CPF for property purchases. \"If so, what should be the ceiling so that Singaporeans can own their own home and still have sufficient savings for retirement?\"\n\nThe risk of Singaporeans outliving their savings remains a challenge. Although CPF Life has addressed that by providing an income stream for life, longevity risk is not completely hedged against rising prices, Prof De Meyer pointed out. \"The current scheme is not inflation-protected and the payouts are contingent on prevailing interest rates. Research should be carried out on the feasibility of modifying the scheme to provide inflation protection as well as guaranteeing a minimum payout to ensure that retirees have sufficient financial resources for subsistence living.\"\n\nJane Austen definition of retirement\n\nMIT Sloan School of Management finance professor Robert Merton then laid out his thoughts on what a feasible retirement system could be. He developed one such system at Dimensional Fund Advisors, where he is resident scientist at. He won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1997 for a new method to determine the value of derivatives and has spoken in Singapore before on retirement financing.\n\nThere are two types of pension systems: defined-benefit and defined-contribution. In defined-benefit plans, employers bear investment risks and promise to pay a certain monthly amount upon employees' retirement. In defined-contribution plans, employees and employers contribute a known amount but the employee receives an unknown amount upon retirement depending on return rates.\n\nDefined-benefit plans worldwide are facing problems due to over-optimistic return assumptions and employees living longer than anticipated. By contrast, defined-contribution plans such as Singapore's CPF are seen as more sustainable, because employees take out what they put in.\n\nBut defined-contribution plans have their problems too, Prof Merton said. One design flaw is that they target to accumulate a lump sum of money.\n\nThis is not what people think about when they retire, Prof Merton argued. People aim for a fixed, inflation-protected stream of income every month based on their most recent standard of living, he said.\n\nA good retirement is defined by not wanting to live worse. \"By the time you retire, you've gotten used to how you want to live. The goal is sufficient funding to sustain the standard of living you've enjoyed in the latter part of your work life. Jane Austen didn't say Mr Darcy was worth \u00a310,000, but \u00a310,000 a year,\" he quipped, referring to a main character in the novel Pride and Prejudice.\n\nIn tackling the retirement problem, defining the goal is critical or a good solution cannot be found, he said. Goal-based investing is going to be more common in the future, he said. Saying that one wants to beat the Consumer Price Index (an inflation measure) by three percentage points is not a goal, he noted. \"It is more of a wish. The world gives you what it gives you. You can't dictate that.\"\n\nDesign principles\n\nA retirement system that can be practically implemented for large numbers of people should have a number of key design principles, said Prof Merton, who started out his academic career with a Bachelor's degree in engineering mathematics.\n\nStudies show that no matter how smart or well-educated people are, ordinary people tend not to get involved in personal finance, he said. \"As an engineer, if you design a system to work well to an extreme, it's a robust system. If someone has a solution that says people have to get up every day and check on a computer where they are and fill in forms, that's not a solution. It's like saying we'll solve obesity in the US by having everybody do calisthenics for two hours every day. That's not going to happen.\"\n\nAverages cannot be used in retirement planning as everyone has different needs. \"Suppose some people wear size 6 shoes, some people wear size 12 shoes. How do you think it'd work if you just had size 9 shoes,\" he said.\n\nRetirement income goals are treated as liabilities, which assets, including projected contributions, expected CPF benefits, and current account balances, are taken into consideration when thinking about how to match those liabilities. \"Some models treat future contributions as an exogenous factor. That's not okay for understanding risk,\" he said.\n\nThree choices relevant to people's lives are whether they want to save more, work longer, or take more risk with their money, he said. Conventional retirement or investment funds do not offer choices that make sense to ordinary people, and which people are ill-equipped to decide on, he said.\n\n\"When I look at most advice given to individuals, risk-return frontiers, questionnaires, are you aggressive or conservative . . . I think my answer to that depends on what day of week you ask me and whether markets had a good day.\"\n\nMerton's system\n\nProf Merton's portfolio management system thus aims to be relevant to people in terms of the choices they can make in saving more, working longer, or taking more risk. It has two targets: a \"conservative\" income goal that retirement monies invested aim to hit with a 96 per cent probability, and a \"desired\" income goal upon which, if met, no further risk will be taken.\n\nMoney in Dimensional's \"Managed DC\" system that Prof Merton developed is allocated across various assets, according to a 2012 article on Dimensional's website by retirement professor Wade Pfau. There are three underlying funds: a stock portfolio with world exposure, and medium-term as well as long-term inflation-linked fixed income funds. Asset allocation adjusts monthly depending on individual income goals. Costs fall in the range of 30 basis points (0.3 per cent) for the advisory fee and 40 basis points for underlying mutual fund expenses, Prof Pfau said.\n\nThe first part of the portfolio goes towards meeting the minimal retirement income goal with 96 per cent probability - the \"conservative\" income number. The rest of the portfolio will aim to increase the chances of meeting the \"desired\" income goal.\n\nIn a sample slide that Prof Merton showed on Dimensional's retirement system, people shift sliders on a screen, enabling them to recognise the trade-offs between various key inputs relevant to their lives. The four parameters are: desired income target, conservative income target, pay contributions, and retirement age. Moving these parameters will move a dial pointing at the probability of them meeting their desired income target.\n\nIncrease the minimum conservative income target, and a more defensive strategy is used that will cause the desired income level to come down. To get a higher desired retirement income, people will either have to work longer, thus delaying their retirement age, or contribute more from their salary. Otherwise, they will have to take more risk in their portfolio, meaning the probability of achieving their desired income would come down.\n\n\"When you push the button, it's real, it's an order, your next pay cheque is going to be smaller,\" he said. \"This tool allows families to sit down and talk intelligently about what really matters to them rather than risk-return frontiers.\"\n\n\"Are you willing to lower financial goals to retire early and go bird-watching, can we give up going out to dinner once a week, save a little more, can we take a little more risk? Instead of asking what return do you want . . . so much of this industry that I've been in is built on that,\" Prof Merton said. \"They're not dealing with real people, real decisions. The time, technology to do this is there, the need is there.\"\n\nhaoxiang@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So their expectations could actually go overboard.\"\n\nHe noted that the Monetary Authority of Singapore has already said that the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework would be a long-term measure.\n\nThe TDSR framework, the seventh cooling measure and introduced in June last year, limits a homebuyer's total debt obligations to 60 per cent of his gross monthly income\n\nFor the first six measures, it will be wiser to unwind them \"only when things get really quite bad\", said Mr Ng.\n\nThe brokerage firm has an underweight rating on the property sector, which it deems to be the \"biggest loser\" from the start of the tapering of quantitative easing (QE) in the US.\n\n\"The property sector has benefited greatly from the very low interest rate environment in the past few years,\" he said.\n\nThe tightening of the US monetary policy means there will not be as much liquidity as before.\n\nThe supply of private properties will also accelerate in 2015-2016, he added.\n\nReits, too, will suffer, because of a depreciation in their net asset value, which had been inflated by both the low-interest rate environment and \"massive liquidity in the system\".\n\nThe reversal of both due to the policy shift in the US \"could deter very meaningful yield-enhancing acquisitions\", said Mr Ng.\n\nThe start of QE tapering would have implications for the credit cycle in Asia as well, said Maybank Investment Bank chief economist Suhaimi Ilias in another presentation at the event.\n\n\"Such low cost of credit (in the past few years) has led to a surge in banking system loans, and by now the banking system loans in both Hong Kong and Singapore have reached quite high levels,\" he said.\n\n\"From an Asia perspective, there seems to be a threshold of banking credit to GDP, after which risk would be very high and the danger of a financial crisis is there.\"\n\nThis threshold is at 160-180 per cent of GDP, which some Asian countries are approaching, or have already surpassed, he warned.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Costing A$184.425 million (S$215 million), the property is fully leased to Optus Administration, a wholly owned subsidiary of SingTel Optus.\n\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition, AA Reit's portfolio size will increase 19.4 per cent to $1.3 billion; this will correspondingly drive up the Reit's 10 per cent development cap, thus providing it with more flexibility, said Koh Wee Lih, chief executive officer of AIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit Management.\n\n\"As a Reit, we are very committed to development opportunities, particularly unlocking value within the portfolio. We have quite a few properties in our portfolio with underutilised plot ratios,\" he noted.\n\nIn the coming 12 months, AA Reit intends to focus on development and acquisition opportunities in Singapore. Already, it has a committed pipeline comprising 20 Gul Way Phase 2 Extension (Phase 2E) and Phase 3, and Defu Lane.\n\nPhase 2E and 3 were kicked off in September last year, and is expected to add $89.4 million to 20 Gul Way's valuation, taking its total asset value to $306.4 million. Meanwhile, its property at Defu Lane is on track for completion in May this year.\n\n\"We are not closed to acquisitions, just that we find asset pricing to be a little on the high side now. That's why over the past two years, we've been developing rather than acquiring,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nIn anticipation of a more challenging outlook, the Reit is also beefing up its leasing and asset management efforts.\n\n\"We've had quite a good run over the last few years, and we are fortunate that our occupancy rate is at 98 per cent,\" said Mr Koh.\n\n\"Next year, about 17 per cent of the portfolio is up for renewal. Two master leases are coming off in the next financial year, but we have already started engaging them nine months ahead,\" he added.\n\nReturning to basics and focusing on adding value to existing assets while keeping an eye out for buying opportunities in Singapore will rebalance the Reit's exposure to Australia, said Andrew Bird, who stepped down as chairman of the manager yesterday.\n\n\"Whilst in the long term we hope to do more in Australia, the priority over the next period is to build up Singapore's opportunities,\" said Mr Bird, who is chief investment officer (property) at AMP Capital.\n\n\"We don't want to suddenly go overweight on Australia because we are - at the end of the day - a Singapore Reit, and will always have our main focus on Singapore. But this transaction gives us stable income on a long lease and it gives us a very solid base to grow on,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Optus Centre, AA Reit's exposure to the Australia market is 17.7 per cent. Previously, 100 per cent of its assets were based in Singapore.\n\nGeorge Wang, chairman and chief executive officer of AIMS Financial Group returned to the non-independent chairman's role. The role rotates between the manager's joint venture partners AIMS Financial Group and AMP Capital every two years.\n\nAA Reit's counter gained half a cent to end trading at $1.39 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/analysing-december-chill-new-jobs", "site_title": "Analysing the December chill in new jobs", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAnalysing the December chill in new jobs\n\nDismal employment data could be due to the weather, rather than the state of the economy\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Jan 12, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHIS week, traders will look at earnings and sales reports to divine whether a shockingly bad December jobs report was a function of the weather or of a faltering economy.\n\nUS employers added a mere 74,000 jobs in December, well shy of the roughly 200,000 forecast by Wall Street economists, according to a Labor Department survey. The workforce may be in hibernation rather than decline, however. Building sites across the South and Midwest of the country shut down for a week or more during bitter winter storms. Even more severe winter storms have now descended in the north and north-east of the US, suggesting that January data may also be weak.\n\n\"Much of it is being attributed to bad weather\", which kept job seekers at home, said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial. \"Many top economists who do this for a living think the number will be revised upwards.\"\n\nA separate survey revealed that the unemployment rate had declined three percentage points to 6.7 per cent. As has been the case recently, this drop resulted from people dropping out of the labour force rather than finding new jobs. Plus, some jobseekers suspended searches because they were snowed in.\n\nMr Krosby said investors had been prepared for a much stronger report. Weekly jobless claims are close to their lowest levels since before the recession and corporate layoffs are becoming increasingly rare. Aberrant weather effects notwithstanding, the stock market is likely to have slid after the report had it not been for the topsy-turvy logic of a market handicapping Federal Reserve policy. It's unlikely that one bad report will cause Janet Yellen, the new chairwoman of the Fed, to stray from Ben Bernanke's plan to \"taper\" the US$85 billion-a-month bond-buying plan in monthly reductions of US$10 billion. If the jobs report proves to be a turning point rather than a one-off, however, Ms Yellen might be faced with a tough decision in the next couple of months.\n\n\"Obviously, if there is a deterioration in the employment numbers, if this was not one that's going to be revised up in a dramatic way, their tapering may be slower or maybe they skip a month,\" said Mr Krosby of Prudential Financial. \"Certainly if other economic data come in in the course of the month suggesting that the economy has stated to pull back they may hold off.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, analysts anticipate a slight up-tick in December retail sales. Last week, major stores provided conflicting reports on holiday sales. Some, such as mall-based retailer Gap and teen outfitter Abercrombie & Fitch, boosted their profit projections because of stronger-than-expected demand. Others, such as luxury jeweller Tiffany, disappointed investors with their rate of growth.\n\nL Brands, which operates popular lingerie seller Victoria's Secret among other specialty stores, summed up the season by warning that promotions had driven sales growth higher but profit margins lower.\n\n\"Markdowns remained the one constant, with some companies posting promotionally driven (and margin-pressuring) positive holiday comparisons,\" said analysts at brokerage Nomura Securities, in a research note. \"We . . . expect the promotional nature of the fourth quarter to continue into the first half of 2014 and believe our coverage universe may see ongoing pressure in the face of ongoing negative estimate revisions.\"\n\nThe emphasis in the week will be on earnings. Aluminium processor Alcoa signalled that commodity processors are still waiting for a rebound in demand after two years of slackening industrial activity. Many Wall Street brokers, including KeyBanc, expect metals prices to rise. That's partly because the price of mining coal and minerals dropped during the slump, and partly because the European economy is emerging from recession, said analysts at KeyBanc.\n\nTomorrow, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, two of the biggest US banks by assets will reveal whether the recovery in US corporate and consumer borrowing is likely to last. Later in the week, conglomerate General Electric will give its expansive view of the global economic recovery. GE makes everything from jet engines to washing machines; if the pickup in economic growth that the latest stock-market rally was predicated on is coming, GE should know about it.\n\nSo far, the broad indexes have barely budged in 2014, with the broad Standard & Poor's 500 down 0.3 per cent. It's an unusually listless January. This is the month when pension funds and many other money managers usually add stocks to their portfolios. The major earnings reports this week, which will also feature an update from Intel, could break the ice, causing a definitive rally, or, if there are major disappointments, a definitive slide.\n\n\"(Now) earnings start rolling in and investors are either going to regain confidence that things are going higher or lose confidence and you have a selloff,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\n\"My sense is you're going to have surprisingly good earnings, based on auto sales and consumer confidence,\" Mr Pursche said.\n\nThe January effect, the traditional upward momentum of the stock market this time of year, may finally kick in this week.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's the siblings' ode to the folk music wave of the 1960s in America; one that captures the scene faithfully with both a fine eye for detail and a keen ear for music.\n\nThe brothers could well have made a Bob Dylan biopic with the setting but why simply settle for that when they've got a heartfelt original story plus an incredible set of songs written and performed by the multi-talented Oscar Isaac in the role of the titular character.\n\nThe tale spun by the Coens is one any struggling musician - past and present - can identify with. There are obvious shades of Dylan in Davis, the fictitious troubadour who roughs it out while waiting for his big break in the competitive Greenwich Village folk music scene.\n\nTo make things even more miserable, everybody else around Davis seems to be finding some degree of success while he just runs into one dead end after another.\n\nFed up with his agent not helping him get anywhere, he decides to take control of his own career instead by travelling to Chicago and putting his album, Inside Llewyn Davis, straight in the hands of famed promoter Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham).\n\nThe road to the Windy City is a turbulent one where he hitchhikes with a motley bunch including a junkie jazz musician (John Goodman) and a cat that's bent on giving Davis the slip.\n\nWith Llewyn Davis, the Coen brothers have penned a character that you want to root for and punch in the face at the same time; something which actually takes place in the opening scene. Davis is far from the nicest guy in the movie - imposing on his friends by constantly asking to sleep on their couches, criticising his peers and lashing out at anybody who doesn't share his opinion.\n\nYou'd change your mind though once he opens his mouth to croon his self-composed minor-key paeans to heartache. The emotions are raw and Guatemalan-born Issac's performance is a sight to behold with Oscar stamped all over it for nailing both the the singing and acting. The Coens clearly know they've got gold in their hands, allowing their leading man to play all his songs in full on the big screen instead of just editing them into excerpts. There's no escaping the melancholic sting of the lyrics and the tunes have their own stories to tell.\n\nWith Inside Llewyn Davis, the Coen brothers themselves have penned a moving multi-layered ballad of a film that's heartbreaking because we see the cosmic joke that's constantly been played on the titular character as life deals him one bad hand after another. To ignore something so tragically beautiful is also next to impossible so prepare to watch it and weep.\n\nRating:\n\nA-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We are encouraged by the preliminary results and it is important to reiterate that Block 120 has multiple exploration plays,\" Kris Energy's exploration and production director Chris Gibson-Robinson had said then.\n\nAccording to analysts, Vietnam's Block 105 and Block 120 had been the key drivers for the stock on a six- to 12-month basis, as the two blocks accounted for some 80 per cent of the company's unrisked prospective resources. \"These two blocks remain the key drivers of probable resource additions over the next 18 to 24 months,\" stated JPMorgan in its Oct 11 research report on the company last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BOML) analysts cut their target price on KrisEnergy by 13 per cent to $1.22 on the back of the news. \"We believe KrisEnergy will re-group and re-assess several other exploratory prospects that still can be drilled in both its large Vietnamese assets,\" BOML analysts said, maintaining their Neutral rating on the stock. \"Still, the new exploration strategy and subsequent drilling needs time, and we believe news flow could be scarce in the next six months.\"\n\nKris Energy was listed on July 19 last year at an IPO price of $1.10 with a total offering of 246,154,000 new shares raising net proceeds of US$203 million. Its key shareholders are Kris Energy Holdings with 45.2 per cent and Keppel at 31.4 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The regulatory hoops are important, because they legitimise these mHealth systems, increasing the likelihood of private investment into the sector.\n\n\"In the past, it would have been a riskier investment because companies wouldn't have been sure if their investments would be ruined by a change in policy,\" she said.\n\nAnd the healthcare industry is starting to rely much more heavily on technology, she said. \"It used to be that it was the technologists working on potential healthcare scenarios. But that was a lot of hammers looking for nails. Now that the healthcare industry realises it needs technology, it is seeking tech partners,\" she added.\n\nIn the near future, the healthcare industry will continue to be influenced by consumer technology trends, such as the Internet of Things, (IoT), she said.\n\nIoT is a catchphrase for the increased connectivity built into non-PC and non-smartphone devices, such as appliances and wearable gadgets. As they get connected and are able to communicate with each other as well as traditional computers, vendors are getting excited about the new applications that can arise from this.\n\nThe GSM Association estimates that the 9 billion or so connected devices in 2011 will hit 24 billion by 2020, out of which 12 billion of those are mobile.\n\nMs Mechael said: \"I think we're starting to see how the Internet of Things is creating a more holistic picture of the world we live in. The first time my phone told me that I had 10 minutes to get to the restaurant in my calendar, I freaked out. We're starting to see more applications intelligently built into the systems we already have.\"\n\nFrom the healthcare industry's perspective, the mobile phone will also gather plenty more data on user behaviour and habits, so that doctors can better identify the causes of illnesses.\n\nThis phenomenon is spreading globally, as mobile technology continues to get cheaper and more accessible to the masses, compared with PCs.\n\n\"We have US$50 smartphones that are now being used in African countries by health workers, who are able to use them to perform diagnostics on patients. That technology is only going to get cheaper and more powerful,\" she pointed out.\n\nIndia, for example, is experiencing an explosive growth in lower-priced smartphones. According to IDC, the Indian smartphone market grew 229 per cent year-over-year in the third quarter of 2013, with 12.8 million smartphone shipped in the quarter, compared to 3.8 million in the prior corresponding quarter.\n\nThe smartphone vendors winning in India highlight the trend towards the lower-priced segment: Samsung had a 33 per cent share of the market with its budget models. Other top smartphone vendors were Micromax, Karbonn, Nokia and Lava.\n\nBut the healthcare industry still needs much prodding when it comes to technology adoption, where in many countries, doctors stick to what they know because it's worked for decades. Thankfully, there are a growing number of technology champions within, she said.\n\n\"In developed countries, the one that seems most reluctant to engage tech is the physician. In developing countries, however, there's a much greater willingness to embrace change, because of the efficiencies and improved patient outcome,\" she said.\n\nThe physicians in developed countries are more resistant to change because what they've used so far has worked. The users which are most willing to change are those directly working with patients, especially in poorer nations where infrastructure is lacking, said Ms Mechael.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 62 per cent said that overvalued targets will create the biggest hurdle, compared with 48 per cent last year.\n\nSixty per cent said that regulatory issues will also be a challenge, especially among foreign private equity firms new or unfamiliar with local investment scenes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This challenges the notion of what's precious,\" she adds.\n\nShe also discovered a whole lot of Singaporeans who turned their HDB apartments into vintage stores - not so much antiques, as these were collected from the 1960s onwards.\n\nSurprisingly, Ng is not a collector herself; far from it, she says. \"I have very few things. I feel they weigh me down, so I'm in fact very good at throwing things away. Most people aren't like that - which is why I found it fascinating to explore what they collected.\"\n\nThe results can be seen in her solo exhibition, Windowshop: A Modern-Day Cabinet of Curiosities at Chan Hampe Galleries, which showcases \"nostalgia\" as a fad that has swept through not just Singapore but the world in recent years.\n\n\"It seems unique to this generation . . . we're constantly looking backward, and some even model our culture on the vintage lifestyle. What does it say about us - to look back and hold on to things that are past?\" she says.\n\nNg has a background in studio art and journalism, acquired at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, and the UCL Slade School of Fine Art in London. She's spent 10 years in Singapore, Paris and New York working in art, design and advertising.\n\nWhile researching for her exhibition, she was compelled to interact with collectors, which she enjoyed. \"The collectors have so much pride in their collections, and I found the stories they told quite touching.\"\n\nBut her 17 cabinets actually tell of the visual narrative that Ng had in mind when she embarked on her search. For more than half of them, she looked for specific objects. But some of the works did evolve from what she discovered on the trail.\n\nA \"waterfall\" of marbles, for instance, is created out of marbles in all shades of blue. And something like this was one of the hardest items to collect, she shares. Ng had to obtain her blue marbles from 10 different sources to make that large 1.5x2 metre piece. It's already a task to find glass marbles in Singapore, and even more so to limit it to only blue.\n\nAnother cabinet featured keys, which Ng says took her the longest to collect. \"Although people stopped using old or odd keys, they still have a close attachment to them, so you rarely found them in vintage stores. I think keys are very romantic because they're etched with a past and history - one never knew what doors they opened before.\"\n\nThe project also exposed her to people she didn't know existed in Singapore. When she needed coin-operated panorama telescopes for the show, she encountered a group of deaf electricians whose main job it was to repair and maintain children's toy rides.\n\n\"I had to communicate with them by writing and sometimes I would forget and call them on their mobiles instead of texting them!\" she recounts.\n\n\"It was just fascinating to meet such people in Singapore with their own stories and niche jobs - they go around maintaining these toy rides because these machines were imported from Germany in the 1980s and '90s. They have an entire workshop of these machines - waiting to be repainted and repaired.\"\n\nNg made the news last year when her collection of colourful chests was sold on the first day of the inaugural Art Basel Hong Kong, also represented by Chan Hampe Galleries.\n\nFor her, the empty chests told a story about the things you keep and move on from. \"Every time I moved, I had to pack my 'life' into 16 boxes,\" she reminisces.\n\nBut the chests were empty, and they could all fit into one another. Now, Ng has swung the other way with this artwork: by filling up cabinets with curious objects, unpacking her many thoughts and sentiments at the same time.\n\n'Windowshop: A Modern-Day Cabinet of Curiosities', a solo exhibition and installation by Dawn Ng, will be held from Jan 11-Feb 9 at Chan Hampe Galleries, #01-20/21 Raffles Hotel Arcade, 328 North Bridge Road. Tel: 6338-1962. There will be an artist's talk on Jan 18, at 4pm at the gallery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Since its discovery, it has drawn many Buddhists from all over the world to visit and worship the relic.\n\nThough the finger bone relic itself is being kept at the Famen Temple in China, the coffin-shaped box that contained it, along with over 100 other artefacts from the underground crypt and other leading museums in Shaanxi can be viewed at the Asian Civilisations Museum in Singapore from today till May this year.\n\nThey are here as part of an exhibition titled Secrets of the Fallen Pagoda, which is a showcase of the culture and beauty during the Tang dynasty from 618 to 907 AD. The exhibition will be split into five sections - Tang Tombs and the Afterlife, Buddhism, The Famen Temple and Crypt, Foreigners in China, and Women in Tang China.\n\nSome highlights include the reliquary, a lobed box which was a tribute item from Southern China to the Imperial court, and a cast bronze jug with features relating to the pottery of Iran and Khotan. According to curator Kan Shuyi, most of the objects uncovered after the Famen Temple pagoda collapse were from the later period of the Tang dynasty (the 9th century), which is why some other pieces from the earlier Tang period (7th and 8th century) were also included from other Shaanxi institutions to complement the existing collection. \"We wanted the exhibition to reflect the golden age of Chinese Imperial history and great artistry that was present during that time,\" she explains.\n\nDr Alan Chong, the director of the Asian Civilisations Museum, felt that the Tang dynasty was a significant time in China's history worth exploring. \"The Tang era in China was a time of openness and multi-culturalism. The capital Chang'an housed foreigners and many different religions, brought together through trade and cultural curiosity. Not all was smooth sailing, of course, but in general the Tang China is a model for the present day,\" he says.\n\nSecrets of the Fallen Pagoda runs from today till May 4 at the Asian Civilisations Museum. Opening hours are from 10am to 7pm daily, except on Fri when it is open from 10am to 9pm. Standard tickets cost $12, while tickets for Singaporeans and PRs cost $8.

Current rules prevent overseas airlines from flying aircraft bigger than the Boeing Co 747 into the country.\n\nEmirates, the biggest customer for the A380, and Deutsche Lufthansa have both said that they would like to fly the superjumbos into the country. Airbus said on Monday that it cancelled orders for five A380s from Kingfisher Airlines Ltd, the only Indian carrier to order the superjumbo, after the operator grounded its fleet more than a year ago.\n\nEmirates's decision to deploy the A380 in the country would depend on passenger demand on a particular route and the ability of airports to handle the superjumbo, once the government decides on its policy, said a spokesman of the carrier, declining to be named citing company policy.\n\nForeign airlines are attracted by the size of the opportunity in India. The country's local passenger traffic may reach 107.2 million by 2016, making it the world's fourth largest domestic market, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) said.\n\nCarriers in India, one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets, struggle as they face the region's highest fuel bills and airport charges amid stiff competition.\n\nMany airports across India, including in capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai, have undergone renovation and runway extensions that can accommodate the A380. The New Delhi airport added three gates specifically meant for the plane.\n\nThe Indian government is also planning to scrap a rule that requires local airlines to have 20 planes and five years of domestic operations to start overseas services, Mr Singh said.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

In terms of profit growth, the index was at 5.48, compared with 5.39 previously.\n\nBut SMEs said that they were less likely to increase staff strength for the next six months. The index score for hiring expectations fell to 5.55 from 5.69 previously.\n\nOverall, the SBF-DP SME index rose 0.5 per cent from 54.7 in the previous study to 55 - in what is the highest score recorded for business optimism in three years. SBF and DP said that a score above 50 indicates that SMEs are positive about business prospects for the coming six months.\n\n\"SMEs expect the global economy to continue to grow, albeit at a modest pace,\" said Chen Yew Nah, managing director of DP Information Group. \"They expect their sales and profits to improve, and their businesses to expand during the next six months.\"\n\nIndeed, the index score registered for business expansion was 6.16, a significant increase from the previous study's 6.06 reading.\n\nMs Chen noted that SMEs expect to be less active in making new hires partly because of the adjustment to a tighter labour market, where they have to compete to get the best talent and at the same time, work on productivity improvements to reduce dependence on labour.\n\nOf the five sectors, the construction and engineering sector was the only one that had moderated overall expectations, from 57.4 in the last study to 55.3 for the first half of this year.\n\nAside from relatively reduced private-sector activity this year, construction companies may take on fewer projects given the increase in manpower constraints, an SBF and DP spokesman told The Business Times.\n\nThe commerce and trading sector is the most optimistic, with overall expectations rising from 55.1 in the last study to 56.1 for the coming six months.\n\n\"The commerce and trading sector is driven largely from general positive regional outlook and performance, particularly in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia,\" said the spokesman, adding that SMEs' positive outlook for 2014 was largely in line with expectations.\n\nSaid SBF CEO Ho Meng Kit: \"SMEs should seize this opportunity of growth by strengthening their competitiveness through innovation and internationalisation. As inflationary pressure remains high, small businesses are looking to policymakers to introduce measures to rein in rising business cost and tight labour constraints.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And ensemble theatre group Nine Years Theatre (NYT) brought the points even closer to home by performing it in Mandarin.\n\nThis is why classics are classics - they have that timelessness that allows them to be re-adapted to contemporary settings. And how a good ensemble of actors can hold your attention for two straight hours, even if the seats at the National Museum Theatre don't have the cushioning to hold out for so long.\n\nNYT's co-founder and artistic director Nelson Chia did a great job with Ibsen's An Enemy of the People - firstly by his translation of the play into contemporary, everyday yet elegant Mandarin; and with the staging, striking a balance between realism and stage craft required for the play. Arguably, in the Singapore theatre context, this kind of realism could practically be seen as \"experimental\".\n\nIbsen was one of the earliest playwrights to present the idea of realism in many aspects of his plays - characters' psychology, stage aesthetics, dialogues, themes, etc. And NYT stuck closely to the spirit of the script. The play began with one of the actors narrating the scene. Although a little disconcerting at first, since the action on stage mirrored the narration, or vice versa, Chia gave a legitimate reason for it in the post-show dialogue. It created a sense that this was theatre, which helped in crossing the first visual and mental incongruity, since the set and the costumes were Western but the actors and the language Asian.\n\nFrom the opening scene, the story slowly unfolded. Dr Stockmann and his family live in a small coastal town in Norway, where his elder brother is the town mayor, and his father-in-law is a bit of a maverick. A regular columnist with the local liberal newspaper, Dr Stockmann is about to publish his most damaging article yet - that the town's natural hot spring baths are actually toxic because of waste water flowing in from the town's tannery.\n\nHis brother, the mayor, however, gets wind of this article and pressures the editor not to publish it. His argument is that it will cause financial ruin of the town, and result in a new public tax to pay for renovations to the baths.\n\nWhen Dr Stockmann's name is blackened in the process, with the mayor turning public opinion against him, he tries to hold a town hall meeting to put his views across. Again, he is thwarted by his brother and this time, even the editor, who had been his close ally, who hijack the meeting and manage to get the townsfolk to refuse to listen to Dr Stockmann.\n\nIt is at this point of the play that Dr Stockmann proclaims that the individual is superior to the multitude, which is easily led by self-advancing demagogues.\n\nEnemy is an illuminating play which highlights political processes, and how politics is often dominated by human egos. Two examples include Dr Stockmann's suggested improvements to the hot spring baths that would have to be borne by public taxes, even though the baths are run by a private company. And how the political process can be manipulated by a person or persons in authority to diminish the minority voice, for \"the sake of a greater good\" - in this case, money and livelihoods.\n\nActors Mia Chee, Hang Qian Chou, Neo Hai Bin, Rei Poh and Jean Toh performed commendably. Rei Poh deserves mention for the way he \"owned\" Dr Stockmann's character and for his comic timing. In fact, the rare but refreshingly absurd comedy of the play was brought out quite well in this play - which was adapted so that the original 12 characters in the play were collapsed down to eight, played by five actors.\n\nThe actors did a good job speaking a largely pitch-perfect Hanyu Pinyin Mandarin throughout, which apparently is a constant point of curiosity and debate during the post-show dialogues. The Mandarin is also more palatable than differing English accents, which invariably is usually the case when local theatre groups stage Western plays. Once you get used to the \"higher\" form of spoken Chinese, it is easier to lose oneself in this Norwegian play with its timeless political message.\n\n'An Enemy of the People', by Nine Years Theatre, runs until tomorrow at Gallery Theatre, National Museum of Singapore.

But Mr Teo alleged it was Mr Ling who had borrowed the money from Mr Foo to pay gambling debts owed to Marina Bay Sands (MBS).\n\nMr Teo, who is represented by lawyer Godwin Campos, claimed that Mr Ling frequently entertained businessmen at the integrated resorts and in April 2011, allegedly \"acted as a junket\" by offering credit in the form of non-negotiable chips to them, and allegedly earned a rolling commission from MBS. Over time, Mr Ling became indebted to MBS and sought to recover the \"credit\" he had provided.\n\nBut the parties settled on Feb 1, 2013, with Mr Teo agreeing to transfer 11.5 million Firstlink shares to Mr Ling and pay $330,000 in cash. However, they were back in court again after Mr Teo failed to fully satisfy the settlement.\n\nDefending against a second suit filed by Mr Ling to recover the $330,000, Mr Teo said the settlement was tainted by illegality and that there was an \"understanding\" he wasn't personally liable and would try to recover the money from friends who had incurred the gaming debt.\n\nMr Teo had won conditional leave to defend against the second suit, but Mr Ling appealed.\n\nIn reversing the lower court's decision, JC Wei raised the question of whether Mr Teo, having chosen to settle the first suit, should be \"allowed another opportunity to raise the same unproven gaming issues that were supposedly settled by agreement\".\n\nHe pointed out that the first suit was settled at a time when there was a serious dispute as to whether the claim related to moneylending, junket operations and gaming losses.\n\n\"It remains unclear as to what, if any, connection there was between the debt owed to Foo and the alleged junket/gaming activities. The allegations made by (Mr Teo) were very serious and had not been established at the time when the first suit was settled . . . There was no finding at all of illicit moneylending, and it was by no means certain that (Mr Teo) would have been able to establish the moneylending/gaming defence,\" JC Wei said.\n\nMoreover, Mr Ling has \"never admitted that the claim was in respect of gaming losses, and would no doubt have disputed the applicability of the MLA and CLA if the case had gone to trial\", he said.\n\nIn finding that the settlement agreement was not \"tainted by illegality, unfair or unconscionable\", JC Wei said: \"All (Mr Teo) has done is to rely on essentially the same facts and arguments which were in issue and dispute and raised in the first suit, and nothing more.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Thai law states that a poll must be held within 45-60 days after the House dissolution.\n\n\"(Ms Yingluck) thinks that there are still some unclear points in the EC's proposal. The best way is to meet and discuss it,\" said Suranand Vejjajiva, Ms Yingluck's secretary-general.\n\nThe EC - which has long called for the snap election to be delayed due to a lack of peace in the kingdom - has already proposed May 4 as a new date.\n\nEven a delay may not be enough to placate the determined demonstrators, however, as they took to the streets of the Thai capital in droves even before sunrise yesterday in an all-out effort to oust Ms Yingluck from power.\n\nThe flag-waving, whistle-blowing protesters from the self-styled People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) blocked seven main intersections in the heart of Bangkok, with many camping on the streets in some of the city's busiest business and tourism districts.\n\nThe protesters say they will occupy Bangkok until the embattled Ms Yingluck - whom they regard as a puppet of her elder brother, ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra - steps down and allows an unelected council to reform the political system.\n\nAround 140 schools in the capital stayed shut and many will remain closed for several more days. The roads outside central Bangkok were reportedly less congested than usual as many workers opted to stay home.\n\nThe situation could escalate if the protesters live up to their earlier promise to besiege more key institutions in Bangkok, including the SET's premises, if Ms Yingluck does not resign.\n\nBourse president Charamporn Jotikasthira maintained that there were enough back-up measures in place and insisted that there would be no disruptions to the trading system.\n\nMore than 120 branches of Thailand's major banks in Bangkok were temporarily closed yesterday, with more than half belonging to TMB Bank.\n\nThe fear among many is that the political unrest could drag on for days, if not weeks - a scenario that would severely damage South-east Asia's second- largest economy.\n\nEach day of the shutdown will result in estimated losses of between 700 million and one billion baht (S$26.7-38.1 million), according to a new study by the Centre of Economic and Business Forecast of Thai Chamber of Commerce University.\n\nThe latest round of protests began last November when the government tried to push through a political amnesty bill that would have allowed ex-premier Thaksin to return home without serving a prison sentence for corruption. The bill was eventually withdrawn but the protests have gathered steam ever since.\n\n\"Don't ask me how long this occupation will last,\" said Mr Suthep in a speech to his supporters yesterday, which was broadcast by the PDRC's BlueSky television channel.\n\n\"We will not stop until we win,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

US homeowners held US$9.7 trillion of equity in the third quarter, a 4.5 per cent gain from the earlier period, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nRising home values are boosting the economy by giving owners more confidence to buy appliances, electronics and cars, said RealtyTrac vice-president Daren Blomquist. Every US$1 gain in home equity adds as much as three cents to personal spending that accounts for about 70 per cent of the economy, said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

Even as it holds talks to acquire Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank, it is slated to increase its stake in China's Bank of Ningbo to the maximum 20 per cent from 15.3 per cent now.\n\nTrading in Bank of Ningbo shares was suspended yesterday pending an announcement of a private placement plan, according to a statement posted on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SSE).\n\nOCBC is expected to increase its stake in Bank of Ningbo to the maximum allowed 20 per cent via the private placement, a source said. Foreigners can own up to a maximum of 20 per cent in a Chinese bank.\n\nBased in Ningbo, a seaport city in Zhejiang province and 150km from Shanghai, the bank had a nationwide network of 173 branches and sub-branches as at Sept 30, 2012.\n\nIt was founded in 1997 as Ningbo Commercial Bank. In 2007, it changed its name to Bank of Ningbo and listed its shares on the SSE.\n\nOCBC has been ramping up its China operations, one of the three areas of focus for the bank outside its main Singapore market.\n\nLast September, OCBC opened its one billion yuan (S$209 million) China headquarters in Shanghai as its investments in the country swelled to $1.5 billion.\n\nChief executive Samuel Tsien had said then that \"Greater China contributes more than 6 per cent to group earnings\". Indonesia accounts for about 5 per cent and Malaysia, 22 per cent.\n\nGreater China has the potential to increase its contribution to the mid-teens, Mr Tsien said. \"Although it's not easy to do business in China, it's the driver of much of economic growth in Asia.\"\n\nOCBC's investments in China since local incorporation in 2007 are made up of 3.5 billion yuan in paid-up capital and a one billion yuan investment in its corporate headquarters in Shanghai's Pudong New District.

It is also well below Heathrow's original request for a rise in tariffs of 4.6 per cent above inflation, as measured by the retail prices index (RPI).\n\nThe previous five-year tariff was RPI plus 7.5 per cent. \"We want to continue to improve Heathrow for passengers,\" chief executive Colin Matthews said. \"We will review our investment plan to see whether it is still financeable in light of the CAA's settlement.\"\n\nThe airport, to the west of London which has expanded in recent years with Terminal 5 and the redevelopment of Terminal 2, said the new price limit would result in a fall in the cost charged per passenger from \u00a320.71 (S$43.20) in 2013-14 to \u00a319.10 in 2018-19 in real terms.\n\nIt said this would result in a rate of return on capital investment of an \"unsustainable\" level of 5.35 per cent compared with the 6.7 per cent it was seeking.\n\nThe CAA said it was confident its proposals would still allow Heathrow to invest sufficiently while reducing prices for consumers. It said it had toughened the regulation after seeing passenger traffic forecasts strengthen and the cost of capital revised at the airport.\n\nBut Heathrow questioned the CAA's forecasts for the next five years in terms of passengers and costs, and said it would have to cut operational expenditure by more than \u00a3600 million and increase commercial revenue targets by more than \u00a3100 million by increasing retail and car park charges.\n\nHeathrow, whose owners include Spain's Ferrovial and the sovereign wealth funds of Qatar, China and Singapore, is the third busiest airport in the world, with almost 200,000 passengers arriving and departing each day.\n\nAnalysts at Mirabaud said the news was very bad for Ferrovial. But they noted that it could be balanced by the increasing chance that Heathrow will be allowed to expand from two runways to three by 2030 as part of a government review to address a capacity crunch that could slow economic growth.\n\nFerrovial, which has been steadily reducing its stake in Heathrow and now holds 25 per cent, declined to comment.\n\nThe regulator had been reviewing the market power of the big airports - and whether this needed to be curbed by price caps - following complaints from the airlines.\n\nBritish Airways, the dominant airline at Heathrow, said the price curbs were a step in the right direction to address the excessive charges, while Virgin Atlantic noted that prices at the airport were triple the level they were 10 years ago. Virgin is the second largest airline at Heathrow.\n\n\"Coupled with ever increasing Air Passenger Duty, customers flying to and from the UK are facing some of the highest travelling charges in the world,\" said Craig Kreeger, Virgin chief executive.\n\nFor rival airports Gatwick and Stansted, the CAA said it would accept and monitor Gatwick's proposal to agree fair terms with individual airlines and not regulate Stansted at all.\n\nRyanair, Europe's largest airline by passenger numbers, condemned the CAA decision not to regulate Stansted, one of the low-cost airline's biggest bases.\n\n\"Today's decision is an example of the CAA's regulatory failure which will again harm consumers as Stansted will be able to further increase airport charges whenever it wishes, without any reference to competitive price levels,\" Ryanair's director of legal & regulatory affairs, Juliusz Komorek, said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

The bank will pay US$1.7 billion to settle the government's charges, US$350 million in a related case by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and US$543 million to cover private claims, the firm said in a filing.\n\nThe company \"failed miserably\" in its responsibility as a financial firm, Mr Bharara said on Tuesday at a press conference. \"The bank connected the dots when it came to its own profits but not when it came to its own legal obligations.\"\n\nJPMorgan, led by chief executive officer Jamie Dimon, has announced settlements of government and private disputes in the past two years equal to about three-fourths of the US$39 billion of profit that analysts estimate the bank will have earned in that time after it reports fourth-quarter results next week.\n\nThe bank will probably say earnings fell about 20 per cent to US$17 billion in 2013, ending three straight years of record profits under Mr Dimon's watch, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The cost of Tuesday's settlements reduced net income for the fourth quarter by about US$850 million, the bank said.\n\nThe agreements, which include a record Justice Department penalty for a violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, highlighted inadequate programmes for policing money laundering. The actions take JPMorgan a step closer to resolving a slate of probes that have engulfed the bank since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nJPMorgan's board needs to \"wake up\" and question the settlements reached during Mr Dimon's tenure, said Mark Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner who teaches risk management at Boston University.\n\n\"This is a continuation of a systemic problem at the bank,\" Mr Williams said. \"It's a cultural problem that stems from the top.\"\n\nThe bank reached a record US$13 billion settlement in November to end probes into mortgage-bond sales. The company also resolved inquiries last year into botched derivatives bets, energy-market manipulation and credit-monitoring products.\n\nMr Dimon, 57, has said that legal costs at the bank will remain high for the next few years as he attempts to deal with remaining probes, which include investigations into whether hirings in Asia violated anti-bribery laws and possible manipulation of interest rates and currency benchmarks. The lender added about US$400 million to litigation reserves in the 2013 fourth quarter on a pretax basis.\n\nInvestors aren't preoccupied with the legal costs because they think the worst has passed, said Charlie Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners LLC.\n\n\"The prevalent attitude is that whatever the litigation costs were in 2013, we think the peak is at hand,\" he said.\n\nWall Street firms have spent years fighting claims by Madoff's victims that the companies ignored wrongdoing to continue reaping fees. Madoff, 75, maintained accounts with JPMorgan for more than 20 years before confessing to running a fraud that cost investors about US$17 billion. He's serving a 150-year federal prison sentence in North Carolina.\n\n\"We recognize we could have done a better job pulling together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff from different parts of the bank over time,\" Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in an emailed statement. \"We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee knowingly assisted Madoff's Ponzi scheme.\" No individuals were charged as part of the agreement.\n\nWith Tuesday's settlement, the US and Irving Picard, the trustee unwinding Madoff's defunct investment firm, have recovered about US$14 billion. In the private accord, JPMorgan will pay US$325 million to Mr Picard and US$218 million to settle claims of class-action plaintiffs, the bank said.\n\nMr Picard has so far returned to investors about US$4.9 billion of the US$10 billion he has recovered since he started liquidating the firm five years ago, according to his website. The US will distribute its US$4 billion in recoveries through a separate process. The government has allowed people who lost money through feeder funds to also bring claims.\n\nFrom late 1986 until the Madoff firm's collapse, \"the Madoff Ponzi scheme was conducted almost exclusively through a demand deposit account and other linked cash and brokerage accounts held at JPMorgan\", prosecutors said in a filing in Manhattan federal court. \"Virtually all client investments were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at JPMorgan Chase Bank NA and virtually all client 'redemptions' were paid from a linked disbursement account.\"\n\nThe bank is charged with one count of failure to maintain an effective money-laundering programme and one count of failure to file a suspicious activity report. As part of the deferred prosecution agreement, JPMorgan promised to cooperate with the US government in its investigation for a period of two years from execution of the accord. Charges are usually dismissed after the term of such an agreement expires. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Under the deal, Vapores will take a 30 per cent stake in Hapag-Lloyd, the newspaper reported, adding that it was still unclear whether Vapores' 54 ships will be part of the transaction or whether they will just be leased to the German peer. Hapag-Lloyd has 152 ships on its own. Hapag-Lloyd declined to comment, while Vapores was not immediately available for comment.\n\nEarlier this year, the owners of unlisted Hapag-Lloyd called off a planned merger with rival German carrier Hamburg-Sued because terms could not be agreed. At the time, major Hapag-Lloyd shareholder Klaus-Michael Kuehne had said that the combination between the German peers was attractive, arguing it made sense to bolt Hapag's Asia focus to Hamburg-Sued's strength on South American routes. In the newspaper report, Mr Kuehne is quoted as saying: \"I see good chances of clinching a deal (with Vapores).\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

If the proposed acquisition is successful, OCBC's exposure to Greater China should rise significantly - from 15 per cent of total loans to around 25 per cent.\n\n\"This could potentially weigh negatively on the bank's credit profile, as the credit, operating and regulatory risks are higher in such markets than in its home turf of Singapore,\" it said.\n\n\"However, the extent to which the ratings could be potentially pressured in the near term depends in part on the cost of the acquisition and the manner of its financing.\"\n\nThe overseas expansion strategy of Singaporean banks is not a new phenomenon, and has been ongoing for the last decade, Fitch said. The Singaporean banking system is saturated, increasingly leveraged, and characterised by thin margins, so a greater reliance on regional markets for growth has become integral to Singaporean banks' operating strategies.\n\n\"Regional expansion heightens the risk for the banks' profile, but this has so far been managed in a prudent manner, with a sound risk management record and the maintenance of high core capital,\" it said.\n\nFitch said this trend is likely to apply downward pressure on the ratings of Singaporean banks in the medium term. This arises from the growing influence of high-growth but also higher-risk markets such as China, India and Indonesia on the banks' credit fundamentals, through their regional expansion and these economies' rising interconnectedness - especially with Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nIf the proposed deal goes through, it would be OCBC's largest acquisition since its US$2.8 billion purchase of Keppel Capital Holdings Ltd in 2001.\n\nWing Hang, with assets of US$26 billion, is around 10 per cent the size of OCBC.\n\nIn a related statement, Fitch said if the deal goes through and is executed successfully, OCBC could help Wing Hang penetrate the mainland China market better than remaining independent.\n\nThis potential transaction, the second in recent months involving a Hong Kong-based bank, highlights the dilemma faced by all small Tier 2 banks in this market: a lack of scale and weaker customer base and regional connectivity result in growing margin pressure in an increasingly competitive marketplace.\n\n\"Strategic investment by a larger player would give it improved flexibilities in funding and capital, and potential access to clients - all necessary ingredients for further expansion in a riskier but higher-growth market,\" it said.\n\nOCBC's aspiration to expand in China may accelerate Wing Hang's concentration on the mainland, notwithstanding its currently well-diversified operations with a strong foothold in Macau, it said. Wing Hang's mainland China exposure stood at 27 per cent of assets at end-June 2013 against a system-wide average of 31 per cent.\n\n\"However, we doubt the potential deal would result in aggressive expansion in China. This is because both OCBC and Wing Hang have traditionally relied on strong risk controls to keep asset quality pressures in check.\n\n\"Moreover, Wing Hang would be subject to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority's supervision - and indirectly to that of the Monetary Authority of Singapore - which should limit excessive risk taking,\" Fitch said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The opponents, however, argued that Ms Mills' ruling should stop the project dead in its tracks.\n\nWhile both sides claimed victory, only one thing was certain: The battle over the expansion will continue.\n\n\"It's a new day in New York City,\" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a plaintiff in the lawsuit whose district includes the university campus.\n\n\"Sometimes communities can win,\" Ms Glick added. \"The project was too big for the neighbourhood in which it was located and not essential to the future of NYU.\"\n\nThe university issued a statement on Tuesday evening saying that the \"complex ruling is a very positive one for NYU\", since the judge threw out five of the six claims made by opponents of the project.\n\nJohn Beckman, a spokesman for the university, said that the ruling would also allow it to proceed with the first - and biggest - of the four buildings planned for the expansion. Known as the Zipper Building, the first tower could be as tall as 26 storeys. Construction could begin within 18 months, NYU officials said.\n\nIt was unclear whether the university would appeal the ruling.\n\n\"Once we have a chance to thoroughly review the decision with our planning team,\" Mr Beckman said, \"and determine the precise impact of the ruling on our ability to implement other elements of the plan, we will work with the city to determine our next legal steps.\"\n\nBut Randy Mastro, a partner at Gibson Dunn who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the opposition, said that it was \"delusional\" for anyone to argue that one portion of what had been a comprehensive project could move forward alone.\n\n\"Any such piecemeal approach would constitute a new project materially different from that previously approved by the city and requiring its own separate environmental review and approval process,\" Mr Mastro said. \"So NYU has to go back to square one. Its massive project is now dead.\"\n\nThe City Council approved the expansion plan by a vote of 44-1 in July 2012, despite widespread opposition from the NYU faculty, preservationists, community groups and Glick.\n\nNYU, which has 50,000 students and 17,500 employees, has struggled to keep pace with its rapid growth over the past two decades. The university's president, John Sexton, is seeking to add 1.9 million square feet of classrooms, dormitories and office space to a 12 acre parcel where two university apartment complexes now stand, south of Washington Square Park.\n\nBut many local residents, including faculty members, loathed the idea of introducing more high-rise towers to the neighbourhood, along with the noise and disruption that would come with 20 years of construction.\n\nThe expansion plan was one of several reasons that the faculty at several of the university's schools approved votes of \"no confidence\" in Mr Sexton over the past year. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

By comparison, the purchase of ING Asia Private Bank, subsequently renamed Bank of Singapore (BOS), was touted as a transformational move for OCBC that gave the lender a decent-size private banking business. Yet it is unclear if the acquisition has translated into higher returns. (OCBC has consistently declined to disclose BOS's profitability, arguing that its rivals don't either.)\n\nMinority shareholders would do well to keep this in mind as they contemplate Mr Tsien's first major buy since he took over the reins of the bank: the proposed purchase of Hong Kong's Wing Hang Bank.\n\nEver since OCBC said on Monday that it was holding exclusive talks until the end of the month to take over Wing Hang Bank in a deal estimated at around $5.8 billion, or 1.7 times its estimated 2013 book value, minorities haven't exactly been chuffed. UBS analysts reckoned the deal would require \"sizeable capital raising\" by OCBC and would likely be dilutive for shareholders. They cut their 12-month target price for the bank to $10.90 from $11.30, saying that \"historically, acquirers of banks in Hong Kong have struggled to make a decent return on capital deployed\". OCBC's share price fell to a six-month low on Tuesday amid fears it may overpay for Wing Hang, but recovered one cent or 0.1 per cent to close at $9.76 yesterday. Rivals DBS Group Holdings and United Overseas Bank rose a respective 1.9 per cent and 1.8 per cent.\n\nWhat will OCBC get from buying Wing Hang, a small lender with 70 branches in Hong Kong, mainland China and Macau? To OCBC chief financial officer Darren Tan, Greater China is one of the bank's four core markets together with Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. He said: \"We have been building capabilities and investing in these core markets for several years, and will continue to do so, taking a long-term view towards growth opportunities in these regions. Greater China presents excellent prospects for OCBC as China increasingly becomes the driver of economic growth in the region, and its interconnectivity with the rest of Asia and the world in trade, wealth and capital flows have created significant business activities in the Greater China region.\"\n\nMr Tan's statement gives no indication of what Wing Hang offers or how OCBC will benefit from the deal.\n\nFor the first half of 2013, Wing Hang posted a 1.8 per cent year-on-year decline in net profit to HK$1 billion (S$164 million). This is lower than the RM475 million (S$184 million) OCBC Malaysia earned in the same period.\n\nWing Hang's net interest margin was 1.69 per cent and its return on equity (ROE) was 10.1 per cent. OCBC's net interest margin was 1.64 per cent while ROE was 10.9. This suggests that OCBC is buying a bank that has the potential to be a drag on its returns.\n\nBut Mr Tan's remarks do hint at the value Wing Hang could bring to the table. \"Its currency, the yuan, is fast becoming an increasingly prominent currency for international trade settlement and financing. Therefore, banking with businesses serving the China market onshore and offshore, and developing a customer franchise in Hong Kong, Macau (and Taiwan) to tap the fast-growing offshore yuan market have been a key focus for us,\" he said.\n\nThe issue is whether Wing Hang's network will deliver the goods. The Hong Kong lender has 43 branches in Hong Kong, 12 in Macau and 15 outlets in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Huizhou, Zhuhai and Foshan on the mainland. OCBC has one branch in Hong Kong, none in Macau and 16 in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\nIt is also estimated that with Wing Hang in the fold, OCBC's Greater China loan book could double to about $40 billion - or 22 per cent of the enlarged entity's gross loans - while pre-tax profit contribution from Greater China could rise to about 15 per cent from 5 per cent.\n\nAll told, Wing Hang is a small bank with ho-hum earnings. This means the acquisition will be relatively digestible, and as there is not much overlap in terms of network, integration should not pose a big challenge.\n\nAt the estimated 1.7 times that OCBC is said to be ready to pay, the deal is not that expensive when compared to a recent sale of another Hong Kong bank.\n\nOCBC's 1.2 per cent fall on Tuesday was nothing to agonize about; in April 2012, DBS shares fell more than 4 per cent just a day after it unveiled its bid to buy Indonesia's Bank Danamon, which was subsequently aborted last year.\n\nIndeed, OCBC's attempt to buy Wing Hang - the largest purchase by a Singapore bank since DBS bought Hong Kong's Dao Heng Bank for US$5.8 billion in 2001 - isn't that big a deal. Compared with that transaction, which cost DBS at least S$2.1 billion in write-downs, OCBC's latest overseas foray promises to be much less exciting - unless it doesn't go through.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For many tech enthusiasts, however, the annual event had lost some of its gloss in recent years; it had become more about bigger TVs, higher-definition displays and more powerful smartphones and tablets than about real cutting-edge innovation. But this year is different.\n\nCES 2014 is showcasing a whole new class of devices that previously wouldn't even be considered \"electronic\". For example, there's an Internet-connected tennis racket on display, a slow cooker whose cooking speed can be controlled by a smartphone app, and many other simple daily gadgets, including health and wellness products. All of these, as well as more traditional electronic gadgets like TVs, music players and fridges, are now Internet-enabled. They are all part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) revolution sweeping the industry.\n\nThis year is expected to be the watershed year when IoT becomes mainstream. However, as with most things connected to the Internet, security is a major consideration. Many security experts are voicing concern about potential security flaws that may be exploited by hackers and criminals.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAnother moon landing will take more than rocket science\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nSingapore\u2019s new grant signals the need to adapt to tariffs, not just ride them out\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nEroding US exceptionalism will impact world economy\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nBye-bye America First?\n\nJul 15, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\n2\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n3\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\n4\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\n5\n\nTemasek eyes more Indian family-run businesses after Haldiram\u2019s deal", "images": []}

This follows decreases of 1.3 per cent in 2012 and 1.9 per cent in 2011. These insights come from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited's (DTTL) latest industry outlook.\n\nThe United States is far and away the biggest contributor to total global spend on defence, at nearly 40 per cent, and the top 20 US defence firms have felt the impact of sequestration with revenues dipping 3.3 per cent in 2012.\n\nThe ongoing decline in defence spend is likely to encourage the industry to seek revenue contributions from new commercial ventures and innovations in areas such as cyber security and intelligence surveillance, according to DTTL.\n\nIn addition, this could also prompt acquisitions from firms looking to align themselves with businesses that offer economies of scale or synergies.\n\nOn the other hand, the commercial aerospace sector is likely to see \"high single to double-digit\" growth this year, bolstered by robust travel demand in high-growth regions such as Asia Pacific and the Middle East coupled with the transition to new, fuel-efficient fleets in the face of high fuel costs. Citing industry data, the report said that commercial aircraft annual production levels are expected to increase 25 per cent over the next decade.\n\n\"The Asia-Pacific countries recorded one of the strongest increases in the commercial aerospace sector during the last year, contributing over a third to the total growth in international premium travel and this trend is set to continue in the future given the positive economic growth expected across the region,\" said Hugo Walkinshaw, Deloitte (Southeast Asia) manufacturing leader, citing data from the International Air Transport Association.\n\nThe report also projected an increase in global merger and acquisitions for the industry this year and beyond, citing the lower rate of such transactions since the 2008 financial crisis due to the gap between asking and bidding prices.\n\n\"Private equity investors in particular have postponed exits from investments due to the recession and are now ready to sell,\" said DTTL.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For 400 yuan (US$65.85) a month in rent, there's no air-conditioning, the only suggestion of heat is a pipe snaking through to deliver gas to the apartments above and the bathroom is a fetid, shared toilet down the hall.\n\n\"I can't afford to rent a house,\" said Mr Hu as he showed off his meagre appointments. Living in basement apartments isn't illegal in China, but like anywhere else it is nothing to brag about and Hu, who guts fish for 2,500 yuan a month at a popular Sichuanese hotpot restaurant on the street above, declined to provide his given name. \"If I weren't trying to save money, I wouldn't live here,\" he said. Locals have dubbed Hu and his fellow subterranean denizens the \"rat race\" - casualties and simultaneously emblems of a housing market beyond the government's control.\n\nDespite efforts to discourage property speculation and develop affordable housing, a steady stream of job-seekers from the countryside and a lack of attractive investment alternatives have kept prices soaring.\n\nResidential property prices rose 10 per cent in November from the same month of 2012, according to data released last week, and have been setting new records every year since 2009. Prices in Beijing are rising even faster - 16 per cent a year - with rents climbing 12 per cent a year.\n\nThat's pushing more and more newly arrived urbanites underground. Of the estimated 7.7 million migrants living in Beijing, nearly a fifth live either at their workplace or underground, according to state news agency Xinhua. Beijing's housing authority refuted this statistic, saying in an email to Reuters that a government survey last year found only about 280,000 migrants living in basements and that only a small percentage of Beijing's basements were being used as dwellings.\n\nLast month, authorities sealed Beijing's manhole covers after local media discovered a group of people living in the sewers below, with one, a 52-year-old car washer, reported by the local media to have been living there for at least a decade. The sewer dwellers were relocated and those not from Beijing sent back home.\n\nSurging residential prices are both boon and bane to the government. China's booming property sector accounts for roughly 15 per cent of GDP and heavily indebted local governments rely on land sales - selling land earns them roughly three times what they collect from taxes.\n\nBut rising prices are putting home ownership farther out of reach for most Chinese, worsening the gap between rich and poor and breeding social discontent. The government has responded by restricting home purchases and boosting the supply of low-cost public housing. In Beijing, the total floor space of public housing rose 20 per cent in the first 11 months of 2013 from the year before.\n\nBut with the promise of employment and education beckoning in big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, the problem appears likely to only get worse. Beijing saw another 316,000 migrants arrive in 2012, lifting its population to 19.6 million.\n\nThat has made housing in Beijing more expensive relative to average incomes than in many developed countries. The median price for residential property in Beijing is over US$4,500 a sq m, according to property developer Soufun, with rents running at US$9.50 per sq m - in a nation where the average annual income is just over US$6,000.\n\nThat makes Beijing homes almost three times as expensive for Chinese as buying a home in New York City is for Americans, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the World Bank and San Francisco-based property website Trulia. Renting a 1,000 sq-ft apartment in China's capital would cost almost double the average citizen's monthly income.- Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

So, from the beginning of this year, junior civil servants will travel economy class on domestic flights; all federal offices will have to cut back on electricity usage by 5 per cent, presumably by turning up the temperature settings in their air-conditioned offices; renovations of government offices are on hold; and the use of consultants and event management companies is being curbed. The amounts of food, beverages and decorations at government functions are also to be less generous.\n\nOf course, Malaysian leaders did expect a fallout from the inevitable price rises as they attempted to rein in the country's fiscal deficit. The prices of petrol, diesel and sugar have already inched up late last year. The follow- on effect was also expected. Taxi, train and bus fares look likely to go up this year. Electricity tariffs are up by 15 per cent in the peninsula. The next round of private road toll hikes, which had previously been absorbed by the government, will now be paid by road users. Ever sensitive to accusations of being indifferent to the plight of the poor, the government has signalled that it will raise welfare payments to low-income families. They will receive RM650 (S$250) in 2014, up from RM500. Pensioners and lower-middle income groups will also receive extra financial assistance.\n\nOn the latest available figures, these cuts will save some RM3.3 billion from Malaysia's annual RM24 billion subsidy bill. On the downside, the reduction in fuel subsidies alone will trigger an almost one percentage point rise in the inflation rate to nearly 3 per cent in 2014, compared with the level in 2013, according to an International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate. Will Putrajaya be able to ride out the political backlash? Fortunately, so far, protests have been muted. The New Year's Eve protest in Kuala Lumpur did not cause much disruption, despite initial fears.

However, the general opinion was that the current trading levels of more than US$50,000 per day would be short-lived. Projections settled on a return to a spot rate of between US$15,000 and US$20,000 per day by next month, with the market remaining sluggish up to 2015 and 2016.\n\nBjorn Andersen, the chief executive officer of brokers Galbraith, put this down to the cyclical nature of the business and said that timing was the critical factor behind success.\n\nHe remarked that with between US$3 million and US$4 million in working capital needed each day to run a VLCC, it is certainly \"not a market for the faint-hearted\".\n\nSimilarly cautious views were expressed in the recent Moore Stephens Shipping Confidence Survey. The shipping accountant noted the concern over excess tonnage both among those already in the market and those about to enter it. One respondent said: \"We need to convince owners to stop building ships, especially tankers.\"\n\nOn a brighter note, the number of respondents overall who expressed an expectation of higher rates in the tanker sector over the next 12 months was up by 5 percentage points to 43 per cent - the highest since May 2011.\n\nOwners led the way, with 52 per cent anticipating higher rates, up from 37 per cent last time. Managers' expectations in this regard were up by one percentage point to 37 per cent. Among brokers, 40 per cent thought tanker rates were likely to go up over the coming year, up from 35 per cent before.\n\nCharterers, however, took a different view, with the number anticipating higher tanker rates falling from 43 per cent to 36 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, research by DNB Markets in November, when VLCC rates of US$60,000 per day were being reported, concluded that VLCC spot rates above US$40,000 per day were possible this year and the next - well above its previous forecast of US$19,000 per day for this year.\n\nSo the VLCC market is either set for some good times or for an extended period in the doldrums. If you happen to be a tanker owner, you would find yourself in an awkward place: Is it the right time to expand your fleet, or to sell to the optimists?\n\nWell, Belgian company Euronav has come down very strongly on the side of the optimists. On Monday, it announced that it was buying 15 modern VLCCs from Maersk Tankers Singapore Pte Ltd for a total of US$980 million, payable as the vessels are delivered.\n\nEuronav said that the vessels are four years old on average and that it would expand its already large tanker fleet of one ULCC (Ultra-Large Crude Carrier), 11 VLCCs and 23 suezmaxes. The vessels will be operated in the Tankers International VLCC Pool, of which Euronav is a founding member.\n\nNot surprisingly Euronav has an upbeat view of the tanker market. It said: \"The outlook for the large crude tanker market has improved significantly over the last months, indicating a resurgence of demand and an improved near-term outlook.\"\n\nIt said it considered the acquisition as a first step towards a wider consolidation of the world tanker fleet, \"with the concurrent benefits of synergy and logistical enhancement to the benefit of all stakeholders\".\n\nCertainly, nobody can accuse Euronav of being faint-hearted.\n\nEqually, Maersk can be seen as acting conservatively and seizing a financial opportunity that might not recur. Only time will tell who has had the best of this deal.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That would put the deal at up to HK$27.91 billion (S$4.6 billion).\n\nThe deal will be the first of several mega-sized offerings in the city in 2014, a year that could have some US$32.2 billion in new listings, advisory firm PwC estimated, nearly double the 2013 tally of US$17.1 billion.\n\nThat would make 2014 the fourth biggest year on record for IPOs in the city, Thomson Reuters data show.\n\nThe company cut the expected maximum market capitalisation of the trust to HK$55.7 billion from HK$63.4 billion announced in December.\n\nPower Assets also said that it will hold about 49.9 per cent of the trust, compared with as little as 30 per cent in the December filing. Based on the top market valuation of the trust and Power Assets' initial plan to float up to 70 per cent of the business, the IPO was expected to reach up to US$5.7 billion.\n\n\"Sometimes you go up with pretty aggressive valuations, then you start talking with investors and realise that you don't have a huge number of institutions that are actually supporting it,\"said Philippe Espinasse, a former equity capital markets banker at both UBS and Nomura and author of IPO: A Global Guide.\n\n\"Then you're forced to reconsider with something that is more palatable,\" he added, saying that the reduced deal would not have a direct effect on upcoming offerings.\n\nThe trust is expected to pay a distribution yield of 6.26 per cent to 7.24 per cent in 2014, the company said in the filing.\n\nPower Assets said in December that the IPO \"will enable the company to continue to pursue new acquisitions in the global power industry, while maintaining a strong financial profile\".\n\nThe reduced size of the IPO is not expected to hinder its efforts as the company has executed previous acquisitions without tapping the equity markets for funding.\n\nThe IPO will be only the third in the city by a single-investment trust, following HKT Trust, spun off from telecoms group PCCW Ltd, and hotel owner Langham Hospitality Investments Ltd.\n\nPower Assets said that it received initial commitments worth nearly US$1.34 billion from two investors for the IPO.\n\nGovernment-owned State Grid Corp of China agreed to make the largest commitment as a cornerstone investor, pledging up to HK$10 billion, while Oman Investment Fund agreed to buy HK$387.5 million, the filing said.\n\nCornerstone investors receive a guaranteed allocation in exchange for agreeing to retain their stakes for a set period.\n\nGoldman Sachs and HSBC were hired as sponsors of the IPO. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}

Broadly, these are mobile phones, social platforms and Big Data.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Forrester Research's senior analyst, Clement Teo, noted that most companies understand mobility to be key, because of the pervasiveness of mobile phones these days. But what companies need to realise is that context is what matters. Slicing the target population by behaviour and demographics, for example, is one way to approach different customer segments, which need to be fed relevant mobile advertising or businesses risk alienating them with blanket advertisements.\n\nThe second, social platforms, is an extension of this concept. Social networks are giving a voice back to customers, and a bad review spreading across a network can be disastrous for a retail or F&B (food and beverages) outlet, because reviews from friends carry more clout.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Technology\n\nSingapore ranks among top cities for tech talent as AI job listings surge globally: report\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:37 AM\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The BT Weekend team sips and nibbles its way through six new places to get your health food fix in the new year.\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGlow Deli and Afterglow\n\n24 Keong Saik Road\n\nTel 6224 8921\n\nOpen 11.30am-2.30pm for lunch, 5.30-9.30pm for dinner, 9.30pm till late for drinks, Mon-Sat\n\nAfterglow opens in Feb\n\nTHE first thing that strikes you about the latest raw food restaurant to hit town is that it looks nothing at all like one.\n\nIt isn't filled with new-age hippies snacking on barely-there salads, nor does it have posters preaching the benefits of eating natural foods cooked at less than 40 degrees Celsius.\n\nInstead, clad with chunky industrial metal lamps, restored vintage bicycles and custom-made wood tables, the space is more hipster coffee joint than health food eatery. And that's exactly what Glow Deli's founders, former public relations executive Carmen Low, and former project manager in an oil and gas firm, Lionel Ang, were hoping for.\n\n\"The last thing we want is for people to know that we're a raw food deli,\" says Mr Ang. \"We're a lifestyle-first space. Once people are comfortable enjoying the cafe's ambience then it's easier for them to open their minds to raw cuisine.\"\n\nThat is also why, unlike at more by-the-book raw food eateries globally, you'll find a range of New and Old World wines at Glow Deli, along with a espresso machine-mounted mobile coffee cart. After its official launch in February, the space will also double as an after-hours bar, Afterglow, serving alcoholic drinks and raw food snacks such as dehydrated crackers and dips on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nPurists, however, will be happy to hear the menu is as raw as it gets. Still in soft-launch mode, the deli serves only set meals for lunch and dinner for now, and the $16 to $20 sets comprises a soup, a salad and a bottle of home-made cold-pressed juice in flavours such as pineapple, bittergourd and mint and kaffir lime, spinach and cucumber.\n\nThe menu will gradually expand from next month to include appetisers such as crackers with hummus and nut \"cheeses\" (processed dairy is typically prohibited in raw diets); mains such as noodles made from zucchini and rice-less sushi rolls in Asian flavours such as kimchi, achar and assam; as well as desserts such as raw tiramisu made with coconut cream and cashew, and a chocolate orange mousse made with raw cacao powder. A cracker of dehydrated carrot tinged with Middle Eastern spices such as cumin, coriander and tamari, a gluten-free soy sauce, is so tasty you'd want to buy home a bag, but it is the \"cheese\" made with blended walnuts, garlic and chilli padi that will win over raw food sceptics with its spicy kick and cream cheese texture.\n\nAll dishes are created in consultation with Czech nutritionist and raw food advocate, Adela Stoulilova. Besides being heat-free, Glow Deli's dishes are also entirely sugar-free, and pink Himalayan salt and bamboo salt are used in place of regular salt, claim Ms Low and Mr Ang.\n\nThe Singaporean couple moved home from Shanghai, where they were based for four years, to set the business up late last year. They were swayed towards raw cuisine by the long line of food scandals in China in recent years.\n\nExplains Mr Ang: \"There was a six-month period where we couldn't eat any chicken, pork or seafood because of all the food scares in Shanghai, so we figured that if we have to go vegetarian, we might as well find some way to make the food more interesting.\" The duo then enrolled in a raw food cooking class and haven't looked back since.\n\nBesides just serving food, Mr Ang, who also owns week-old co-working space Keong Saik Collab across the road, hopes Glow will be a community centre of sorts for like-minded entrepreneurs. A retail shelf by the deli's front entrance stocks natural bath products made by Thailand-based social enterprise Urban Tree, the vintage bicycles are from local start-up Style Asia and the kitchen will offer employment to single mothers and people from low-income families.\n\nThere are also plans to hold lifestyle workshops such as essential oil and soap-making classes, as well as agro-tourism programmes to visit farms in Singapore and the region.\n\nMr Ang admits candidly: \"If I just relied on selling raw food alone, I probably won't survive.\"\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Today, only about 6 per cent of the global LNG tanker fleet can pass through the canal; after the expansion, about 90 per cent of tankers will be able to use it, according to a US government study.\n\nThe bigger canal would provide a quicker and cheaper way to ship natural gas from the US Gulf Coast and East Coast to markets in Asia that are desperate to secure supplies of natural gas.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Simply put, we wanted delicious fast food that was also healthy.\"\n\nSo what you get at Fresh Pressed are daily-made juices and salads that can be had dine-in, take-away or delivered to your doorstep.\n\nJuices come in 12 vegetable-centric flavours at Fresh Pressed and the Australia-imported, largely organic ingredients are cold-pressed - a low-heat way of juicing that keeps the fruits' minerals intact - and bottled at the store every morning.\n\nThe sweet-toothed can opt for the Spicy Tonic, a blend of apple, pineapple and just the faintest whiff of ginger, said to aid the digestive system while reducing fatigue and speeding up the metabolism. The best-selling Liver Scrub, a blend of apple, beet leaf, beetroot, carrot, celery and ginger is a spicier concoction with plenty of detoxing benefits packed in.\n\nA 250ml dine-in glass of juice costs $6.50 or take them home in 500ml bottles for $12. Or, opt for one, three and 5-day juice cleanse sets comprising six bottles of juice, two bottles of alkaline water and a sachet of herbal tea per day.\n\nThere's also a \"water bar\" stocking four different types of bottled water, including the carbon-neutral Antipodes brand from New Zealand, and the 8.4pH Icelandic Glacial alkaline water, as well as a yummy spread of smoothies and salads working in \"superfoods\" such as raw cacao, quinoa, chia seeds and tahini from the menu designed by consultant-chef Emmanuel Stroobant.\n\nThe roasted celeriac walnut chicken and lentils salad stands out for its robust nutty, roasted flavour and also impressive is the salad of pesto-dressed ratte potato, grilled artichoke and edamame topped with cured Spanish jamon.\n\n\"Healthy eating is a trend we see in London, New York, and Tokyo. Not only are there more health food options, but we also see more gyms, yoga studios, and wellness centres popping up,\" observes Ratner. \"Diets have evolved to be no longer about quickly losing weight, but rather about how to eat as a healthy way for life, not just for two weeks or a month.\"\n\nDebbie Yong\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Chinese currency is expected to appreciate around 3 per cent this year, the same pace as in 2013, traders said.\n\nBullish bets on the South Korean won also rose slightly, despite repeated comments from senior officials in Seoul that the currency's strength against the slumping yen could hurt export competitiveness. The won touched five-year highs both against the dollar and the yen on Thursday.\n\nThe South Korean currency is seen as relatively safer than other emerging Asian currencies on solid economic fundamentals, including a sizeable current account surplus.\n\nMeanwhile, short positions in the Indonesian rupiah eased slightly after the country posted a surprise trade surplus in November.\n\nThe Reuters survey is focused on what analysts believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee , Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.\n\nThe poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3.\n\nA score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long US dollars.

The European Commissioner for the internal market is weeks away from releasing the final plan for making the region's financial system safe.\n\nIt is likely to include a ban on proprietary trading - already being dubbed the \"Barnier rule\" - and restrictions on market making, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nProp trading - banks trading on their account purely for the sake of making money - is risky but it was not the central cause of losses in the financial crisis. What's more, regulatory pressure has already forced banks to cut back. France and Germany have both passed laws to allow the practice within separately capitalised institutions.\n\nOnly the big French banks say that they are still in the game, and the activity was a mere 340 million euros (S$589.6 million), or 0.5 per cent, of group revenue at BNP Paribas and Societe Generale in 2012.\n\nAn outright ban on prop trading, emulating the Volcker rule of the US, should not make a huge difference to European banks right now - although it will prevent the activity from staging a comeback and posing a risk in future.\n\nIt sounds innocuous. But there is an important question on the definition of proprietary trading. One fear is that dealings with hedge funds as counterparties, even as clients, could be deemed to be proprietary trading.\n\nRestrictions on such activity would be bad for markets and seem hard to justify - hedge funds did not cause the crisis either.\n\nThere is also the worry that very illiquid markets like peripheral sovereign debt cannot function with banks taking what are effectively proprietary positions in anticipation of future client activity.\n\nBigger risks lurk in trading books that hold inventory for client activity or treasury operations.\n\nTo tackle these, Mr Barnier proposes that market making in financial securities should take place within separately capitalised subsidiaries when activity exceeds a certain level. That idea emulates the Vickers reforms of the UK - although is softer.\n\nIt looks as though Mr Barnier has opted to blend US and UK reforms. With only a few weeks left before its publication, the danger is that haste may result in a fudge.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

A reading above 50 indicates expansion while one under 50 denotes contraction.\n\nEconomists said this suggested a soft start for industrial production this year and reinforced their longer-term view that local manufacturers may not reap the full benefits of the global recovery due to structural domestic issues such as labour supply and costs.\n\nSingapore's PMI was the only one in the region which fell under 50 for the month of December. In contrast, Taiwan's manufacturers reported the strongest improvement in operating conditions since April 2011 with a reading of 55.2, and the HSBC South Korea PMI hit a seven-month high of 50.8. Even China's HSBC manufacturing PMI, which fell to 50.5 in December, stayed in expansion mode, though growth was slower.\n\nThe time of year may have played a part. UOB economist Francis Tan said the PMI is not adjusted for seasonal factors and has tended to be lower at the start and end of each year.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah said that, with \"the post-Christmas season moderation in demand, and forthcoming Chinese New Year lull\", a more sustained improvement can be expected only from February.\n\nBut seasonal factors only partially explain December's weaker print. Economists add that Singapore being out of sync with its regional peers suggests that structural constraints may be in play too.\n\nMr Seah said: \"The sector is losing its competitiveness amid the transition drag from the restructuring exercise. Rapid increases in underlying costs have taken their toll on companies' margins and ability to compete effectively.\"\n\nThis weakness is most apparent in the electronics sector, said Barclays economist Joey Chew, who noted that Taiwan and Korea's PMIs had continued to rise, with no sign of post-Christmas weakness.\n\nSingapore's electronics PMI fell sharply to a reading of 50.1, keeping just above the 50-point threshold in expansion territory. This was down from November's 51.2, and under the market forecast for a reading of 51.4. OCBC economist Selena Ling said electronics firms may be turning cautious, as the pace at which their imports grew slowed sharply last month.\n\nThis is among the reasons she found the overall PMI's fall \"rather disconcerting\", even though the fall in PMI is in line with the Q4 flash estimates of manufacturing growth released by the government last week. The official flash estimate of 3.5 per cent year-on-year manufacturing growth in Q4 2013 already implied that December's industrial output fell 1-1.9 per cent year-on- year, going by economists' estimates.\n\nThe PMI report, compiled monthly by the Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM) from a survey of more than 150 industrial companies' purchasing managers, attributed the PMI drop to slower new domestic and export orders growth, contracting factory output, imports, finished goods stocks and manufacturing employment sub-indices. Last month, HGST, the enterprise hard drive subsidiary of Western Digital, axed 530 employees - almost a quarter of its Singapore staff.\n\nBut the overall inventory sub-index rose, which SIPMM executive director Janice Ong said suggested that local manufacturers are building up inventory ahead of future demand.\n\nBarclays' Ms Chew said she expected revived biomedical production and general manufacturing to offer some support to manufacturing in the coming months, though this could be tempered by slowing industrial momentum in China and Asean; Indonesia's imports have fallen sharply, and political unrest in Thailand may hurt business sentiment, she said.\n\nFor the year ahead, Ms Ling said she expects the \"modest upward trajectory\" for manufacturing to be sustained, given the low base in the first half of 2013. Apart from the \"hard-to-measure hindrance\" of supply-side constraints, UOB's Mr Tan said he viewed last month's PMI a blip as the local manufacturing sector rides on the rising global economic tide.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Most brokers predict an uneven year and modest gains in 2014 as an uptick in interest rates caused by the gradual pullback of Federal Reserve stimulus slows the bull run.\n\n\"Are we going to match this year? That would seem almost impossible,\" said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"The returns on the S&P 500 were absolutely huge. We can't repeat that year after year. If we did, we'd all be very wealthy.\"\n\nAfter rocketing to the stratosphere last year, the stock market will hit some resistance in 2014, Mr Kinahan suspects.\n\nBen Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman who orchestrated financial market's recovery from the devastation of 2008 and 2009, will give up his chair to Janet Yellen - an unknown quantity.\n\nWhen he launched the \"tapering\" of quantitative easing, Mr Bernanke set a target of US$10 billion in reductions at every Fed meeting. With roughly eight meetings a year, that would bring the bond-buying programme from its current level of US$85 billion a month down to zero by the end of 2014.\n\nBut, he also gave Ms Yellen some wiggle room, saying that tapering could be adjusted as economic conditions warrant. Like sheep in the care of a new shepherd, stock traders may be jumpy at the start of Ms Yellen's tenure.\n\n\"Every single number is going to be watched for what it means to the Fed,\" said Mr Kinahan. \"I think this year has great potential for volatility.\"\n\nSimilarly, strategists for Barclays' money management arm predict that the broad S&P 500 will rise roughly 5 per cent and do so \"by a more circuitous route\".\n\nThere are solid statistical grounds for this prediction.\n\n\"History does tell us that 'good' years typically follow 'great' ones,\" said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist with Standard & Poor's Capital IQ stock research arm in a note to clients. \"Since 1945, there have been 21 times that the S&P 500 gained more than 20 per cent. In the following year, the S&P 500 recorded an average increase of 10 per cent, versus an average price gain of 8.7 per cent for all years since World War II.\"\n\nMr Stovall added that in roughly half of those 21 occasions, the S&P 500 experienced a correction of more than 5 per cent on its way to a higher close.\n\nStrategists such as those at Barclays also have \"fundamental\" explanations for their tempered optimism.\n\n\"We anticipate US economic growth will accelerate in 2014 as the drag from fiscal policies should be smaller than it was in 2013,\" said strategists at Barclays Wealth & Investment Management unit in a research note. \"After all, sequestration cuts to government spending are already in place, and taxes have already risen.\"\n\n(The Barclays strategists say \"should\" rather than \"will\" because the compromise between Republican Congressman Paul Ryan and Democratic Senator Patty Murray could yet fall apart.)\n\nIndeed, most of the clouds that hung over the US market previously have all but disappeared. Europe has stabilised Greece, Portugal, Italy, Ireland and the banks that lent to them; healthcare reforms are now a challenging reality to US corporations rather than a mysterious phantom; the jobs market is finally showing consistent growth; the Chinese economy is neither too hot nor too cold; and Republicans and Democrats are actually talking to one another in Washington DC.\n\nIf Ms Yellen completes the task that Mr Bernanke has begun, inching out of stimulus without causing a damaging spike in interest rates, there is a chance that Wall Street strategists are underestimating the stock market's 2014 potential.\n\nThe rate of economic growth and earnings growth is likely to be higher in 2014 than in 2013. In recent weeks, data on unemployment, housing, consumer spending, manufacturing and broad economic growth have all exceeded the average economist target.\n\nStill, there are some lingering economic worries. Chief among them is the notion that a \"structural\" change has taken place in the US workforce.\n\nMany workers who lost their jobs during the last two cyclical downturns - the recessions of 2001 and 2007 through 2009 - may lack the skills required to gain employment in an information technology-based economy.\n\nEconomists at Morgan Stanley said that they do not expect improvement in one crucial job-market statistic: workforce participation. Since 2000, the percentage of the US population that makes themselves available for work has been in a consistent slide.\n\nThe ageing of the baby- boomer generation only partially explains this conundrum, the Morgan Stanley analysts said. These structural problems in the labour market may hurt the US stock market - and society - for many years to come.\n\n\"Long spells of unemployment can have destructive impacts on human capital,\" they said. \"They can shallow out skills and know-how, distance former employees from workforce connections, and strain communities.\"\n\nAnother worry is what some analysts see as the similarity between the recent stock rally and the dotcom bubble. Both were partly inspired by loose monetary policy, these critics say. And both were led by risky, unproven companies, they point out.\n\nEven if this bull market turns out to be another speculative bubble and Twitter ends up looking more like Pets.com than the future of newspapers, it is a bit early for the bubble to burst. After the 1997 rally, stocks had two more positive years before crashing in 2000.\n\nMarkets often roll with momentum, and the duration of that momentum often defies expectations. Look at the run-up in the price of gold. Some people thought that the gold price of US$1,000 an ounce, first crossed in 2008, was unsustainable. The precious metal eventually peaked in 2011 around US$1,900 an ounce.\n\nThe same could be said of the oil market between 2005 and 2008, or the Treasury market from 2008 to mid-2013. Gravity eventually catches up with all speculative markets, but it can take years.\n\nAnd outside niches such as social networking, electric-car manufacture and 3-D printing, valuations are not as high as those in 2000.\n\nThe S&P 500's aggregate price-to-earnings multiple of 17 times 2012's earnings is not that out of line with long-term averages.\n\n\"The only bubble is in people talking about bubbles,\" said Mr Kinahan of TD Ameritrade.\n\nJudging by recent mutual-fund flows, analysts at research firm Schaeffer's Investment Research maintain that the investing public seems to be midway through an unwinding of a historic flight from stocks.\n\n2013 was the first year in five that investors put more money into stocks than they took out of them. While some strategists are concerned that the rush into stock funds could reverse itself, others argue otherwise.\n\n\"It's no secret to anyone in the world that rates are heading higher, so you might see more money move out of fixed income into stocks,\" Mr Kinahan said.\n\nThe rotation from fixed income into stocks is one reason Schaeffer's has a relatively high target for the S&P 500 at the end of 2014. The firm expects the broad gauge to rise 14 per cent to 2,100.\n\nEven if the market ends up there, the ride is unlikely to be smooth, said Mr Kinahan.\n\n\"The (economic) trend has definitely been nothing but positive and, it looks like the trend is continuing that way,\" he added.\n\n\"But if we do see a bad number, even though it's only one point of reference, if it's outside the trend, (people) are going to say 'Omigod, they shouldn't be tapering'.\n\n\"The second-guessers are going to have a field day.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From a strategic point of view, it's necessary to grow business beyond Singapore.\"\n\nOverseas assets currently make up 36 per cent of FCL's $9 billion portfolio as at the end of FY2013 on Sept 30. The bulk of these assets are in its core markets Australia and China, which account for 15 per cent and 9 per cent respectively of its overall portfolio.\n\n\"We are trying to hit 50-50 (between Singapore and foreign assets). Hopefully we can hit 50-50 in five years' time,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nFor its residential development business, overseas projects currently contribute less than $80 million in profits before interest and taxes (PBIT) per year on average, while PBIT from its Singapore projects average above $200 million a year, said Chia Khong Shoong, FCL's chief financial officer. The plan is for both the Singapore and overseas residential development business to respectively sell 1,000 units and contribute PBIT of at least $200 million each.\n\nMr Lim said that FCL's overseas push will continue to focus on Australia and China. But the group may develop a new core market: Thailand.\n\nFCL has developed condominium projects and has serviced apartment operations in Thailand, but the country has always been a peripheral market, and is home to less than one per cent of FCL's assets.\n\nSaid Mr Lim: \"The problem with the Thai market is that if you are a foreign developer, most of the time you are not allowed majority control.\"\n\nBut this hurdle is now cleared because FCL's majority shareholder is Thailand-based TCC Group, whose main business interests include property.\n\n\"TCC is our parent, so if we do a joint venture with them it is as good as us going there ourselves in terms of the levels of trust, corporate governance and control. Also, TCC knows the local market well,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nFCL is now looking at working with TCC on \"two or three projects\" in Thailand, said Mr Lim. These would mainly be in Bangkok and cover a mix of developments: residential, office and retail malls.\n\n\"We are still at the evaluation stage. Some of the land is already owned by TCC, while we are looking at jointly bidding for others,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the plan for FCL's overseas ventures is to build more mixed-used developments, which would fulfil FCL's aims of boosting earnings from overseas residential projects, growing its foreign assets and raising recurring income.\n\n\"We are very strong in mixed developments,\" said Mr Lim. \"We have the expertise and we can bring this out of Singapore. So we will be doing more mixed developments overseas, either on our own or through joint ventures with others.\"\n\nFCL, together with Sekisui House, is already developing One Central Park in Sydney - a 5.8-hectare (624,307 sq ft) parcel of inner-city land that, when completed, will have residential, office and retail facilities. In Singapore, FCL has worked on mixed-use developments such as Changi City and the Watertown in Punggol.\n\nThis year, FCL will be launching more residential units for sale overseas than in Singapore. After the Chinese New Year period, it will launch the 99-year leasehold Fernvale Close project being developed with Far East Orchard and Sekisui.\n\nIt will also continue to put in bids for residential and commercial space under the government land sales (GLS) programme to build up its land bank.\n\nSaid Mr Chia: \"We may have quite a lot of units that we will launch in China, so that may push the numbers up. We do have quite a large pipeline there.\"\n\nThe group's residential landbank is in Suzhou and Shanghai.\n\nIn Australia, FCL expects launches at three projects during the course of the year, involving hundreds of units, said Mr Chia. Two of these projects are in Sydney and one is in Perth.\n\nAnother key plan of FCL is to grow recurring income to match income from development projects.\n\nIn FY2013, recurring income was $244 million, or about 43 per cent of PBIT, while development accounted for $360 million.\n\nSaid Mr Lim: \"We are trying to build a sustainable income stream which comprises our investment properties - like hospitality, the retail malls, offices, as well as our management fees and fee income - and income from development properties.\n\n\"The bulk of it (income) currently comes from development properties. We are trying to even that out by having a balance between the two.\"\n\nA big contributor to recurring income would be its serviced apartment business, said Mr Lim. \"I think this is one of the most scalable businesses within the group.\"\n\nAs at June 30, 2013, FCL owned only 20 per cent of its serviced residence units. Some 77 per cent are under management, while a further 3 per cent are leased.\n\nSome of the serviced residence apartments and hotels owned by FCL and TCC will be spun off into a real estate investment trust that FCL is planning to launch this year. Although previous reports suggested the Reit will list in the first quarter, Mr Chia said a definitive date has not been set.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company is focusing on the south zone where neighbourhoods such as Leblon have apartments selling for 12,974 reais (S$6,937) per square metre.\n\nFour Seasons plans to probably buy an existing asset, Mr Azevedo said. The company is \"closely monitoring\" the iconic Hotel Gloria in Rio, which is being sold by former billionaire Eike Batista.\n\nVeja magazine reported in August that the Switzerland-based investment fund Acron AG is probably planning to buy the hotel for 225 million reais. While high taxes affect development and operational costs in Brazil, Mr Azevedo said that he foresees hotel development taking off as real estate investors move away from the boom of building and selling residential and commercial assets, and towards longer-term investments such as hotels.\n\n\"The market is evolving,\" Mr Azevedo said. Credit from national banks \"makes it financially more appealing to build hotels\".\n\nGlobally, the luxury segment is recovering, Mr Azevedo said, with 2014 looking to be the strongest year since the 2007 peak. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

That was less than the median 51.2 estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 29 economists and November's 51.4. A number above 50 indicates expansion.\n\nSwelling local government debt, surging property prices in some cities and volatility in money-market rates are risks as Mr Xi embarks on reforms intended to lay the foundations for more sustainable long-term growth. The Chinese economy may have expanded 7.6 per cent in 2013, the slowest pace in 14 years, according to a State Council report last week.\n\n\"The Chinese leadership has made it clear that they want stable growth this year - neither a sharp fall nor a quick rebound,\" said Zhu Haibin, Hong Kong-based chief China economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \"The central bank will remain neutral in its policy operations.\"\n\nThe Shanghai Composite Index fell 6.8 per cent in 2013, a third year of declines out of four, as climbing money-market rates fuelled investor concern that corporate profits will decline.\n\nWhile the Chinese economy is powering down from an average growth rate of more than 10 per cent in the decade from 2000 to 2009, the ruling Communist Party wants sufficient expansion to protect jobs.\n\n\"Future economic growth may soften,\" Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the Development Research Centre of the State Council, said in a statement commenting on the PMI report. Yesterday's report showed declines in gauges for manufacturing output, new orders, export orders and imports.\n\nLocal government debt, including contingent liabilities, rose to 17.9 trillion yuan (S$3.7 trillion) as at the end of June, the National Audit Office said in a report on Dec 30.

Prices climbed 0.7 per cent from November.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang has refrained from adding national property curbs that could hurt economic growth, after predecessor Wen Jiabao in March stepped up a three-year campaign to rein in home prices.\n\nAlmost one-fifth of respondents in a Renmin University of China survey gave a zero score on the government's property policies, indicating \"near despair\" on housing prices, the official China News Service reported earlier this week, citing survey results.\n\n\"The supply shortages remain noticeable in some hotspots, and the pressure on home-price gains continues to exist\" going into 2014, SouFun said in the statement.\n\nAt least 10 Chinese cities, many of them provincial capitals, have tightened local property policies since November, with the major cities of Shenzhen, Shanghai and Guangzhou all raising minimum downpayments for second homes to 70 per cent.\n\nBeijing was the first to lift the level from 60 per cent in March after Mr Wen told cities with excessive price gains to do so.\n\nNew home prices in Shenzhen posted the biggest gain in almost three years in November, rising 21 per cent from a year earlier, alongside Guangzhou, according to the latest data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Dec 18.\n\nThe city of Xiangtan in Hunan province led gains in December, with prices rising 3.5 per cent from the previous month, according to SouFun data.\n\nPrices fell 3.3 per cent in Foshan, located in the southern province of Guangdong, the biggest decline nationwide.\n\nBeijing and Guangzhou posted the largest year-on- year gains among the 10 biggest cities, SouFun found, both rising about 28 per cent.\n\nTianjin recorded the smallest increase, with new home prices climbing 6.1 per cent, according to SouFun, which did not provide year-on-year changes for the remaining 90 cities.\n\nA statement issued after last month's annual Central Economic Work Conference didn't mention real estate curbs as a policy initiative for this year.\n\nGuangzhou's housing bureau director, Li Junfu, told local lawmakers on Dec 24 that the city would study gradually scrapping administrative measures such as home-purchase restrictions in 2014, Beijing News reported on Dec 26. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Our new shareholder is involved at the executive committee and board level but for the day-to-day operations, TCC leaves me to run the company.\n\n\"It's only when there are major decisions to be made that I have to submit papers to the executive committee. That's when TCC is involved. But it's good that they are taking interest. They are very nice people, very personable.\"\n\nTCC is controlled by Thailand based Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, a major shareholder of Fraser & Neave. Mr Charoen flies to Singapore once a month and can stay about a week, which is mostly spent making important company decisions.\n\n\"When he is in Singapore, he works round the clock,\" said Mr Lim. \"He likes to be involved in all the major decisions and so far, most of our recommendations have been accepted. He has been very supportive so far because he treasures and respects the experience that the FCL management team has.\"\n\nAdded Chia Khong Shoong, FCL's chief financial officer: \"He has spent a lot of money on the company so it is not unreasonable for him to want to understand how it works.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Lim, Mr Charoen works by a number of philosophies. \"To him, business is not the be all and end all. It's more about relationships and keeping in harmony with people, maintaining inner peace, and avoiding conflicts. It's not always about winning.\n\n\"He believes that if you are able to maintain inner peace, you are able to think clearer and make better judgements.\"\n\nThe comments about how F&N - and in particular FCL - has changed stem from the bids that the property unit had put in for government land sales.\n\nMarket talk is that FCL has transformed from a company that traditionally bids conservatively for land, into an aggressive bidder whose bid price far exceeds that of its competitors. Observers point to two plots of land that FCL has snapped up recently, a 99-year leasehold commercial site at Cecil Street where the company forked out $924 million - a price that was 18.8 per cent higher than the next highest offer, and a mixed-use 99-year leasehold commercial and residential plot at Yishun Central, where it put in a top bid of $1.4 billion - a whopping 47 per cent higher then the second-highest bid.\n\nMr Lim said that there were compelling reasons why FCL put in strong bids for the two sites. \"If you talk about those two sites, it reflects our optimism in the commercial market in Singapore.\"\n\nThe Cecil Street plot, he said, is a very rare site because it is one of the last available land parcels in the Central Business District that has a MRT line linked to it.\n\n\"Our bid was supported by valuations, all the valuations that we received,\" he added.\n\n\"For the Yishun plot, it is unique for us. We are different from all the other developers bidding for the site because we already have Northpoint 1 and 2. If we combine Northpoint 3 with Northpoint 1 and 2, we will have one of the biggest malls in Singapore with more than 600,000 square feet of leasable area.\n\n\"So Northpoint 3 should not be looked at in isolation. Also we are more familiar with the rent there, so we are in a better position to estimate cost and revenue.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite having projected single-digit returns next year, equities are seen as the only game in town for inflation-beating returns in a fragile global economy and liquidity-flushed markets.\n\nOlivier d'Assier, Asia-Pacific managing director of risk manager Axioma, told The Business Times that portfolio managers he had spoken to \"have underperformed in 2012 and 2013, and can't afford to underperform again\".\n\nPortfolio managers are facing increasing pressures to do well to attract investors so their commissions will go up, he said. Otherwise, money will flow to other better-performing funds.\n\n\"For years they've been calling us on how to de-risk their portfolio in a post-global financial crisis climate. But now they are concerned about how they don't have enough risk,\" he said.\n\n\"They don't have the returns they want, and need to undo hedges, take more concentrated bets. Sovereign wealth funds, pension funds are faced with ageing populations and pressure on their liabilities,\" he said.\n\nSimilarly, Deutsche Bank's co-chief investment officer Asoka Woehrmann, who was in Singapore last month for client meetings, told BT that pension and insurance funds feel that they have no option but to go into equities. \"They can't stay in cash any more, or they will have a negative real return. This is what they are realising now, quite late in my opinion,\" he said.\n\nPension funds invest a lot of money in relatively safer bonds, but easy monetary conditions worldwide since the global financial crisis have caused yields to fall on newly issued bonds, resulting in lower projected returns.\n\nUS pension funds that have used overoptimistic rates of return and paid out generous benefits are running into trouble funding their liabilities, with the state of Illinois cited as the worst example with a US$100 billion debt gap to fill. Last June, Japan's national pension fund, the world's largest, announced that it will take on more risk assets like domestic and foreign stocks, and foreign bonds, while cutting holdings in domestic bonds.\n\nA month earlier, life insurance companies in Singapore said they would use a set of lower projected investment returns to market policies to clients given the low interest rate environment.\n\nDr Woehrmann said that he did about 150 client events last year and people mainly asked if the rally in stock markets will continue. \"The most-asked question is, can we really go into equities at these historical heights,\" he said.\n\nHe expects, however, that equities will continue to offer a \"normal\" return of 9 to 15 per cent this year, after an extraordinary 27 per cent gain for the MSCI World Index last year, including reinvested dividends.\n\nThe S&P 500 shot up 32 per cent and the Nikkei 225, almost 60 per cent in 2013. The S&P 500, at about 1,850 points, is now up over 160 per cent from 2009 lows.\n\nBut the average of 20 estimates compiled by Bloomberg show end-2014 forecasts for the S&P 500 to be 1,950 points, or barely 5 to 6 per cent higher than current levels.Analysts still prefer equities as an asset class over bonds in 2014, however.\n\nGlobal growth and low inflation is \"supportive for risk assets\", Fidelity Worldwide Investment said in its outlook report. The five-year stock-market rally might continue as many people are still underinvested, Deutsche Bank said.\n\nDeveloped markets such as the US (falling unemployment), eurozone (low valuations) and Japan (weakening yen boosting profits) are still popular with conservative investors, though some pockets are becoming expensive.\n\nBut analysts have been saying that stock returns are likely to come from companies earning more profits, rather than people willing to pay higher earnings multiples for stocks. \"It is not too late to enter but investors have to differentiate,\" Dr Woehrmann said.\n\nOthers are becoming more cautious. Asked to sum up his message for investors, Alain Bokobza, head of global asset allocation at Societe Generale cross-asset research, said: \"Don't be too greedy. Financial markets have already delivered a lot for the developed world.\"\n\nHSBC Global Research said that equities are entering the \"mature stage of a bull market\", forecasting single-digit returns this year. Mark Burgess, chief investment officer of Threadneedle Investments, said: \"Companies will have to step up their game and earnings will have to pick up significantly if equities are to sustain or even come close to the rally we have seen in developed markets during 2013.\"\n\nMr d'Assier of Axioma said he is advising clients to pick companies that do well in rising interest rate environments, as well as cash-rich countries and companies. \"Stop hedging China and go back, go back to Japan but pick carefully, pick exporters and innovative companies,\" he said.\n\nThe United States, with its highly educated workforce, can pick itself up quickly once unemployment comes down, he added.\n\nThe biggest unknown shaping markets still looks to be how fast the Federal Reserve is expected to taper its bond purchases. UOB Bank told BT that in a survey of 200 wealth management customers last September, respondents are most worried about interest rate fluctuations, currency fluctuations, and tapering, even as they see a US recovery and strong economic growth in Asia as opportunities.\n\nBut some analysts also said that in spite of US tapering, central banks look like they will continue with loose monetary policies. This creates a positive environment for equities as interest rates will remain low in the foreseeable future of two to three years. High-dividend stocks will do well in this scenario, Allianz Global Investors said. It called the global recovery fragile and predicted \"looser for longer\" monetary policy.\n\nPascal Blanque, chief investment officer of asset manager Amundi, told BT: \"Many people think that they will wake up one day and there's no more intervention, we're back to the classic (monetary policy) framework with one tool, interest rates, and no intervention in asset classes.\"\n\nBut the surprise might not be a world of normalising interest rates, but a world where the Fed wants to keep asset prices high. This stokes up expectations of inflation, thus depressing real interest rates to encourage borrowing and stimulate the economy, he said.\n\nSaid CIMB head of Singapore research Kenneth Ng: \"In reality, the US is still buying loads of Treasuries each month. Looking ahead, the test is when they finally stop buying altogether and let markets dictate interest rates.\"\n\nDBS Bank economists have forecast, in a decidedly contrarian vein, that the US economy will not take off this year, growth will slow, the Fed starts QE4, and markets will panic.\n\nUS economic growth will be key, HSBC pointed out. \"Our analysis of previous Fed cycles shows that the first tightening usually causes equities to wobble but not to enter a new bear market - provided that the tightening is driven by a better growth outlook, as in the past three occurrences, rather than inflation risk, as in the 1970s and 1980s.\"\n\nMeanwhile, on a brighter note, JP Morgan coined a mnemonic for Asian investors this year of the Horse: Healthier global economy, Optimism in equities, Re-position portfolios for rising rates, Selective in fixed income, and Emerging markets differentiation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Jan 3, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN you're constantly assaulted by the non-stop crowds and frenetic tourist activity on Paris's most famous drag - Champs Elysees - it's easy to walk right past your hotel without even noticing it. Especially when the only hint you have that it's a hotel is the tiny gilded entrance and an even more discreet sign that says Le Claridge.\n\nThere isn't even a sign to say that it's a Fraser Suite or any hint that the upscale boutique hotel/serviced apartment is part of Frasers Hospitality's European portfolio, because its heritage status doesn't allow for it, says the Singapore company's CEO, Choe Peng Sum.\n\nWhile Asian-owned or managed hotel properties isn't a new phenomenon, the concept of a Singapore hotel group which takes an active role in conserving its heritage properties in Europe is less well-known. But it seems to be a growing trend led by Frasers Hospitality, which has taken crumbling old buildings in Paris, London, Glasgow and Edinburgh and restored them to their former glory, turning them into elegant hotels in the process.\n\nIt's not an easy job, and the 53-year-old Mr Choe has some quirky tales to prove how heritage conservation has inadvertently become one of Frasers' core areas of expertise, aside from its bread-and-butter hotel management services.\n\nTake the Fraser Suites Edinburgh, which Mr Choe says was the most challenging, but most satisfying, project of the four heritage projects they have.\n\n\"It was an 18th century building right in the city centre. It was used as an office by the city council, but there was a plan for all government offices to move out of the city so we bought it. But even before the city council was using it, it was an old printing press. When the council moved in, they boarded up a lot of the original stained glass, spiral staircases and even the ceiling cornices. But we didn't know that until we started tearing things down for the renovation.\" The discovery turned out to be a major historical find and the responsibility - and expense - of preserving it fell on Frasers' lap.\n\n\"There are six suites on the ground floor which have very high ceilings, with the cornices. Within each suite, we created a room within a room (with walls that ended just below the original ceiling so that the cornices remained intact). It took a long time to do - we could easily have just left them covered up but we decided to report it (to the heritage board) and conserve it. Now, the suites are the most popular, and people appreciate it because you can see the intricate cornices.\"\n\nHeritage conservation was not a deliberate goal for Frasers, Mr Choe points out. Rather, it's the location. \"For example, Le Claridge is an ideal location. We were looking around in Paris for a long time and this was an opportunity we came across, so of course we need to make sure we do the renovation.\n\n\"In London, it was also the location. I was actually looking for another property, further down the road from Kensington. But then I saw this property which was called Stanhope Gardens. We had limited funds then so we joined up with Halifax Bank and LaSalle investment. But we recently bought it over 100 per cent. The same with Queen's Gate opposite. We were previously running it as it was owned by Irish bank investors. But Ireland was going through a bad financial patch so again we thought it was a good opportunity because it was the location we wanted.\"\n\nRenovation, however, was a big headache structurally and financially. The plan was for Queen's Gate to be completely gutted and refurbished. \"We got the consultants, we had our budget and the board of directors approved it.\" But once they started tearing things down, \"We found that the entire electrical and fire safety systems were in very bad shape, and the floors were so thin - we had to reinforce them and redo the entire fire safety and electrical systems. That cost a big unbudgetted amount but we had to do it.\"\n\nOf course, the temptation was always to just feign ignorance. \"There were design consultants who told us not to report what we found - for example in Edinburgh, no one would know about the boarded up stained glass windows and cornices, and in Queen's Gate the the fire safety system is behind the wall, no one would see it. But no, we couldn't do it. We're in this business for the long term - we want to own this forever.\"\n\nBut it's tough. \"It's cheaper and faster to just rebuild. To conserve you have to be very careful, and after everything you have to get the local heritage board to inspect it. They make sure nothing is damaged and then they pass it. It's a long process.\"\n\nPlus you need to be sensitive to the feelings of the local communities too.\n\nIn the case of Le Claridge, which Frasers has a management agreement with, \"we couldn't use the name Fraser Suites Le Claridge because the name Le Claridge itself is listed, not just the building,\" he explains. \"So we had to call it Le Claridge by Frasers - we were so envious because the Marriott next door has such a big sign but that building isn't listed. And we can't even explain why we can't put up our signage.\"\n\nIt was the same with Fraser Suites Kensington and Fraser Suites Queen's Gate. \"The council and the people around the neighbourhood were so sensitive about our signage. At first we put up a nice big Fraser Suites sign and we were so proud of it. And then we received a letter so we kwai kwai took it down and put up a small one. Our board of directors paid a visit and asked why there was no branding - we had to tell them the whole story.\"\n\nStill, it's all worth it in the end, as the local residents can see that \"we are reconditioning the buildings back to their former glory\". And Frasers wants to be known as a responsible company that can be trusted with a city's beloved buildings. \"In the end, we sleep easy knowing we've done the right thing,\" he says, adding that if all goes well, Frasers might add another heritage building in Munich in the near future.\n\nOf course, \"It's not always nice to go back to the board to ask for more money, but I'm very thankful that when I say it's a must, they say ok. In a way, you can't run away because in many of these cities the central location is already built up, unless you go outside. I'm glad the board is supportive but of course they say, 'then earn more money',\" he laughs.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Q4 index is still 1.2 per cent higher than the year-ago period, though less than the 2.8 per cent rise for 2012.\n\nMost property consultants expect the index to fall on a full-year 2014 basis, though predictions vary widely: one per cent to 10 per cent. The negative factors weighing on private home prices include the Total Debt Servicing Ratio (TDSR) framework, which has eroded borrowing capacity; weaker HDB resale flat prices, which will affect upgrader demand for mass-market private condos; and a significant supply of nearly 20,000 private homes expected to be completed this year.\n\n\"This year could be more of a buyer's and tenant's market,\" said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ, \"with prices expected to continue to soften against a low transaction volume and rents could be affected by the large supply that will be completed this year.\n\n\"However, we do not expect a major price correction given moderately improving economic sentiment, and interest rates expected to still remain low.\"\n\nURA also provided flash estimates for non-landed private homes in the three geographical regions.\n\nIn Outside Central Region (OCR), prices slipped 0.6 per cent in Q4, but the full-year increase of 6.8 per cent was ahead of 2012's 6.5 per cent. In Core Central Region (CCR) - comprising Downtown Core planning area (this includes the financial district), the old postal districts 9-11 and Sentosa Cove - prices declined 2.2 per cent in Q4 and 2.1 per cent for the full year. In Rest of Central Region (RCR) - which includes Bishan, Toa Payoh, Little India, Queenstown and Geylang - prices rose 0.8 per cent, in contrast to a 0.9 per cent drop in Q3. This was probably caused by a couple of major projects - Sky Vue in Bishan and Thomson Three - launched in Q3 at relatively attractive prices but transacted mean prices in the two projects were higher in Q4.\n\nOCR's price drop may have been triggered partly by the Q4 launch of The Inflora in Upper Changi at an average price understood to be around $950 per square foot (psf) - below prices of existing projects in the location.\n\nKnight Frank research head Alice Tan attributed the drop in CCR chiefly to Duo Residences in Bugis - at the fringe of the CCR - which was launched in Q4 at an average price of around $2,000 psf, significantly below prices in other parts of CCR including Marina Bay (where prices hover at $2,500 psf and above) and the Orchard area (above $3,000 psf).\n\nOrangeTee research head Christine Li expects CCR to continue facing headwinds this year, as more \"foreign\" developers (which includes those listed on SGX) approach deadlines for completing and selling out residential projects, stipulated under Qualifying Certificate conditions. These projects are mostly on prime district sites bought through en bloc sales before the global crisis. \"Developers of these projects may have to adopt a price-to-sell strategy if they don't wish to pay extension charges,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, developers will soon be required to declare net sale prices for new homes to URA. As the practice of giving incentives is more common for the high-end sector, this could cause a one-time technical downward adjustment to CCR index in Q1 or Q2, depending on when the change is made, she said.\n\nAlan Cheong, research head at Savills Singapore, said that URA's price index may not trend uniformly down through 2014 as \"it is not sensitive enough to factor out micro-locational and other softer attributes like the perceived quality of a project, design, layout, etc\". \"So depending on what gets launched in the quarter, we may see the index behaving in a saw-tooth fashion.\"\n\nHe predicts a 1-2 per cent dip in URA's overall private home price index this year. \"Barring unforeseeable shocks, the market may surprise on the upside rather than down. Rooting for private residential prices to come down has now become group think and this is where the risk lies. (Based on) an objective assessment of the cost of production for the supply side . . . both land and construction costs have been increasing.\"\n\nDevelopers may ultimately still be able to sell out their projects at an average price above the previous benchmark. This may be accomplished by marketing the lower floors first, giving the perception that prices are lower than the previous benchmark in the area. If the initial hype draws strong response, developers may open up better units - at higher prices, said Mr Cheong\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Rio has a combined export capacity of 225 million tonnes at its Dampier and Cape Lambert terminals, according to the company.\n\nPort Hedland, the world's largest ore-export terminal, was assessing the impact of the storm and preparing to resume operations, Port Hedland Port Authority said on Tuesday. The facility, which exports iron ore from mines owned by BHP Billiton Ltd and Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, shipped about 252 million tonnes in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAustralia probably accounted for about 52 per cent of global seaborne iron-ore supply last year, according to Morgan Stanley. Iron ore, which was unchanged at US$134.20 a dry tonne on Tuesday, has rallied 22 per cent from a low in May as China boosted stockpiles to the highest level in a year and economic growth rebounded from a two-quarter slowdown.\n\nBut iron ore may drop 7.5 per cent this year as global supplies increase, according to Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.\n\nThe storm, which reached Category 3 at its strongest, weakened below tropical cyclone intensity as it moved south-east across the state, bringing winds with gusts of about 85 kilometres per hour at its centre, the Bureau of Meteorology said yesterday.\n\n\"Damaging wind gusts are likely to continue on the north-eastern side of the system,\" the bureau said in an update posted at 2.19am local time. It earlier cancelled the cyclone warning for the coast. A floodwatch has been issued for the Goldfields region, the bureau said.\n\nWoodside Petroleum Ltd, Australia's second-largest oil and gas producer, said that staff were returning to work at the North West Shelf liquefied natural gas project in Karratha and the nearby A$15 billion (S$16.88 billion) Pluto LNG plant.

Because to him, the fact that he's gay is as simple as his name, his age, his height. It's just a fact. So when there's a reaction to it, that surprises him,\" explains Garner, who will also play the role of Lemming's best friend and teammate, Kippy Sunderstrom.\n\nFortunately, his own friends have not been victims of discrimination in Singapore, but Garner hopes to change the perception of the more conservative members of the public, by getting them \"to start taking notice that 'Hey, these are people'- full stop.\"\n\nFor that reason, Garner plans to continue staging shows with similar content, simply because he feels there are many great LGBT productions out there that have not been done in Singapore yet.\n\n\"I will simply present them as great pieces of theatre, with gay people and themes. There's more openness about this now, and if there's some way for my productions to make a difference, then fantastic. Otherwise, it would at least be some great entertainment,\" he adds.\n\nTake Me Out runs from Jan 8 to Jan 16 at the DBS Arts Centre, at 8pm daily, with an additional 2pm matinee on Sat. It will then continue from Jan 18 to Jan 31 at the Alliance Francaise Theatre at 2pm on Tues and Sat, and 8pm from Wed to Sun. Tickets cost $65 and $75.

Research by accountants PwC found 72 of 100 town centre retailers were offering discounts or advertising promotions.\n\nA decision by Britain's biggest clothing retailer Marks & Spencer to slash 30 per cent off all clothing prices in the Christmas build-up - the group's first such move in five years - has raised fears it too has endured a tough festive period.\n\nNext, Britain's second-biggest clothing retailer, is due to publish a trading update today, while M&S is due to report on Jan 9.\n\nReflecting Britons' increasing tendency to shop via their smartphones and tablets, John Lewis said online sales in the five weeks jumped 22.6 per cent on a year ago and accounted for 31.8 per cent of total sales in the period, helped by record online orders on \"Black Friday\" (Nov 29), a US-originated promotion day becoming more common in Britain.\n\nElectrical and home technology sales rose 10.7 per cent, while fashion and beauty increased 8.5 per cent, the firm said. \"With new highs in branches as well as for johnlewis.com, this has been a genuine omni-channel Christmas,\" Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, said, adding the sales growth boded well for trading in 2014. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}

We foresee global container demand to be higher than last year, but still in the range of 4-5 per cent, which is below the historic average,\" said Thomas Knudsen, CEO of Maersk Line in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nIndustry recovery has slowed, he said, because demand on the East-West trade routes, which form the bulk of global trade, is expected to grow slightly less than that on the North-South routes.\n\nWith supply expected to grow about 6 per cent in 2014, Mr Knudsen noted that overcapacity will continue to pose a challenge unless there are large increases in scrapping and idling of ships by carriers, as well as slower steaming, where ships sail at slower speeds, thus regulating supply.\n\nIronically, the problem of increasing supply stems from poor demand. Rahul Kapoor, director of Drewry Singapore, explained that shipping companies are continuing to order large ships next year to address the problem of stagnant growth in cargo volumes. Larger ships help liners achieve greater operating efficiency by transporting more in one vessel.\n\nMr Kapoor expects this demand-supply disequilibrium to continue for the next couple of years; a full recovery is likely to be delayed till early 2016 when supply is expected to recede as most of the large ship orders would have been completed by then.\n\nTo make matters worse, regulatory factors are also expected to add to the operating costs of some liners in 2014.\n\nKenneth Glenn, president of APL, said that this year will present challenges on the sustainability front to shipping companies.\n\n\"Ports in California will begin enforcing cold-ironing regulations on vessels at berth, while liners must also start preparing for their ships trading in the Emission Control Areas (ECAs) to consume marine fuel with sulphur content not exceeding 0.10 per cent,\" he said.\n\nBecause of the reduced fuel sulphur limit, ships trading in the ECAs must from 2015 consume ultra-low sulphur gas oils for prolonged periods, as heavy fuel oil cannot comply with the 0.10 per cent sulphur limit.\n\nMr Glenn said that since gas oils are much more expensive than the heavy fuel oil most ships are built to consume, this will result in an increase in bunker costs. As a result, companies will be forced to adopt new procurement strategies and onboard fuel consumption routines in 2014 before the stricter fuel sulphur limit is enforced.\n\nAmid rising costs and lower freight rates, liners will have to turn to cost-cutting measures to be profitable. \"Profitability will be defined by cost leadership,\" said Mr Kapoor.\n\nIndustry players believe this will primarily force carriers to form alliances to be more cost-efficient. Mr Knudsen said that such alliances are advantageous to the industry as they allow the liner companies to reduce their network costs and reap the benefits of deploying larger vessels.\n\nThese alliances are likely to become more strategic as competition intensifies and may become a feature of the industry, noted Mr Glenn, adding that the biggest carriers will form mega-alliances to realise more operational efficiencies than could be gained on their own.\n\n\"Existing alliances will also up the ante by expanding their cooperation, introducing new routes or beefing up current services,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So much so that it continues to shape the works of the 38-year-old artist today.\n\n\"I was overwhelmed by my new environment when I first arrived,\" recalls Widjaja, who grew up in Singapore, trained as an architect but became a full-time artist in 2011.\n\n\"I also didn't speak English and Chinese much back then. So my experience of the city was purely as space and time. Those were the characteristics of the new environment that I could grasp. We didn't have paved roads in asphalt in my hometown, nor buildings of glass and steel. The difference in physical textures really left a big impression on me. And time was dictated by the clock,\" he explains.\n\nWidjaja's first contact with Singapore forms the departure point for an upcoming solo, in his artistic explorations of time and space in the city - specifically, in drawing. \"I try to use drawing to talk about those two concepts.\"\n\nThen he recently read an article about American experimental musician John Cage, whose infamous 1952 composition, 4'33'', is also known as \"four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence\". Says Widjaja: \"I read this article that talked about Cage's silent piece, where he got a pianist to sit in front of a piano without playing a single key. Cage was also known for his ideas of indeterminancy, using the ideas of I Qing as a way to determine when sounds should be produced and so forth.\"\n\nThe I Qing is a Chinese classic text that is commonly used as a divination system. Cage applied it to large charts of sounds, durations, dynamics, tempi and densities.\n\n\"Cage was quite influential in using these random methods to get the artist out of the process of making art. It was a random encounter for me, with John Cage's ideas through that article.\"\n\nIn the last 10 years of his life, Cage was also making stone tracings. One of his notable works was of the Ryoanji temple in Kyoto which has a famed Zen Buddhist rock garden. \"There are 14 rocks in that garden. And supposedly, if you sit there long enough, you're able to see the 15th rock which isn't physically there,\" says Widjaja. \"So Cage would collect stones and use the random method to determine the position of the stones on a piece of paper, and use the random method also to decide which media to use to trace that stone's outline on paper.\"\n\nWidjaja himself does stone tracings - which is essentially drawing outlines on paper. For one of his exhibitions at Gillman Barracks, he used stones sourced from the Yellow River and Fort Canning Hill. He had returned from a visit in Japan when he read that article on Cage, \"so there was that interesting alignment of time and space!\" quips Widjaja.\n\nWidjaja wanted to draw Cage's portrait from a photograph, but as he tried, discovered that he couldn't really because of the great distance between him and his subject. \"Hence I started to look for other methods to draw Cage's portrait, methods that would enable me to draw closer to the musician. I used his ideas of making sounds for my drawing, and stone tracings,\" he explains.\n\nIn his upcoming exhibition, entitled Drawing Cage, one of Widjaja's eight works on display is made up of digital imagery such as photographs he took on his China travels in 2012. \"I went with my parents to visit the village where my maternal grandfather was born.\" Widjaja then treated them with a pigment powder, held together with a substance, and applied directly onto the photographs with brush-like gestures. Stone tracings were then made using a marker pen.\n\n\"The idea is to try to complicate or pull the time-space of the photograph into the viewers' time-space; by using the materiality of pigment and directly-applied drawing lines,\" he says, adding that the emphasis is about using stones to make compositions and relationships on the paper's surface.\n\nIn another installation piece, Widjaja got 12 friends involved - inviting them to draw a straight line between two dots 1cm apart in a span of four minutes and 33 seconds. Then he travelled to the 13 neighbourhoods in Singapore that he had lived in before, by walking, running in each, and videographed lines in the city.\n\nWidjaja became a Singapore citizen in 2013, but conversely, it has made him feel more disconnected to the city. \"The feeling that I'm a foreigner in the city is even stronger than before, so I decided to turn it into an ongoing art project, as a way to tangibly reconnect with the city.\"\n\nThe artist's personal sense of displacement dovetails with the artistic community's; in a couple of other group exhibitions held last year, Widjaja created and presented works that were shown in buildings about to be torn down. \"There is a lot of discussion among artists in Singapore about memories and how Singapore's landscape is changing so quickly; and memories that don't have places to 'live in' and get displaced.\n\n\"Drawing for me is a tool to look into identity and place, and experience the emotion of places that are related to a person's memory and history,\" he adds. He's loved drawing since he was a child, \"Firstly, it's not an academic skillset that I acquired by attending art school, and to me it's a natural movement. It's involuntary that I draw as a way to conceptualise and analyse the reality that I perceive.\"\n\nThis exhibition is Widjaja's third solo, and in a temporary pop-up space curated by U Factory. Drawing Cage will be held from at Block 38, #01-06, Gillman Barracks, from Jan 12-26, Tues-Thurs, 3pm-7pm, and Fri-Sun, 11am-7pm\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A learning curve for new vessel types could also be an initial dampener on margins.\n\nHigher funding or borrowing costs could also be on the horizon as the US Federal Reserve initiates tapering of its bond buying programme from this month, particularly for those who did not lock in funding on still attractive terms offered last year. For the capital-intensive industry such as the offshore oil and gas businesses, this will be something to contend with.\n\nStill, the earnings outlook for 2014 remains bright for leading offshore rig and vessel builders such as Keppel Corp and Sembcorp Marine. At the close of 2013, they built up record net order backlog of over $15 billion and $13.8 billion respectively.\n\nAnalysts expect the record order backlog for the two yards to help bolster earnings in 2014 and into 2015. \"This is the largest ever order book for Keppel, a 17 per cent growth on 2012-end order book, and would drive a significant 18 per cent profit growth over 2013-2015,\" said Macquarie Equities Research analyst Somesh Agarwal.\n\nAs for new orders secured in 2013, Keppel's offshore & marine division closed 2013 with $7.1 billion in new orders, while SembMarine's was $4.2 billion, most of which were for offshore jack-up, semi-submersible rigs, accommodation vessels and offshore platforms.\n\nFor 2014, analysts are forecasting that the two groups should be able to sustain new orders at relatively creditable levels despite the robust orders secured in 2013.\n\nDeutsche Bank's Kevin Chong said: \"Keppel appears well positioned moving into 2014 as more contracts could be secured with major drillers and national oil companies. Potential contracts worth US$3.7-4.1 billion versus our estimate of S$7 billion may be won in 2014, just based on a few recent major agreements and options.\"\n\nMacquarie remains equally positive, having raised its 2014 new orders estimates to $6 billion for Keppel, from an earlier estimate of $5 billion.\n\nDeutsche Bank also expects SembMarine to secure $5 billion in new orders in 2014 versus $4.2 billion secured in 2013, as increased capacity in its new integrated shipyard comes onstream. DBS Vickers Securities is also upbeat on SembMarine's new yard, saying that it \"opens up new opportunities and target markets for SMM, as the yard is equipped with four VLCC drydocks with total capacity of 1.55m dwt\".\n\n\"SMM is well-positioned to take on repairs of larger vessels, leading to higher contract values per vessel,\" said DBS Vickers analyst Janice Chua. \"The new yard should be positive for margins in the long run, due to increased efficiency, reduced docking time, lower wastage and improvement in logistics.\"\n\nAnalysts remain positive on Keppel with 20 buy ratings and just seven holds, according to Bloomberg. Keppel's FY13 earnings are due on Jan 23, with mean estimate net profit at $1.51 billion.\n\nThe global outlook for capital expenditure on new offshore oil-related contracts this year remains positive as well. On a global basis, oil and gas companies are estimated to spend some US$723 billion on exploration and production, an increase of 6.1 per cent from 2013, according to Barclays Bank's Global 2014 Exploration & Production Spending Update.\n\nBarclays expects growth in E&P spending in North America to rise more than 7 per cent to US$199 billion (led by the US), and expects continued growth in international markets (up 5.7 per cent at US$524 billion), particularly in the Middle East, Latin America and Russia.\n\nIn its survey of more than 300 oil and gas companies worldwide on their spending intentions next year, Barclays found that spending in India, Asia and Australia is projected to post modest growth (up 3 per cent year on year) on solid spending increases from Petronas, Pertamina and ONGC. But this will be partially offset by declines from Inpex and Santos. Chinese national oil companies are planning mostly flattish spending.\n\nOn the flip side, the Middle East, Latin America and Russia will show the fastest growth, with the Middle East being the fastest-growing oilfield services market at more than 14 per cent in 2014, led by Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Oil Company.\n\nExploration and production companies are basing their spending budgets for next year on oil prices of US$98 per barrel for Brent and US$89 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate, and a benchmark natural gas price of US$3.66 per British Thermal Unit. According to Barclay's, this could mean that E&P spending could be higher as current price levels are already higher than the base price used for their projections.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The economic impact from the urban-planning changes will be \"extremely big\", he said.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe is trying to sustain an economic rebound that risks losing steam in April when a sales-tax increase will damp consumer spending. While Mr Hatta's comments offer some insight into the government's plans for special economic zones, investors are still waiting for fuller details of Mr Abe's growth strategy in what Goldman Sachs Group calls a \"critical year\" for Abenomics.\n\nHome prices in Tokyo are around 120,000 yen (S$1,470) to 150,000 yen per square foot, Chicago-based Jones Lang LaSalle said last year. That compares with about 280,000 yen to 400,000 yen in Hong Kong and 200,000 yen to 250,000 yen in Singapore, it said.\n\nAccording to Mr Hatta, the changes will make it easier to construct residential buildings in business districts in designated zones, creating opportunities to improve urban planning and make cities more enticing for employees of foreign companies.\n\nThe bursting of a bubble in the stock market, which peaked in 1989, and a real-estate market bust in the 1990s saddled banks with bad loans, plunging Japan into a deflationary slump that it's still trying to shake. Tokyo's real-estate market has started to rebound as Mr Abe tries to end the deflationary malaise that began with stock and property bubbles bursting more than two decades ago.\n\nWhile prices in some cities picked up after former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi cleaned up the banking system in the early 2000s, a sustained rebound has been elusive. Nationwide residential real-estate prices at the end of September were down 51 per cent from a peak in 1991.\n\nIntroducing special economic zones is a cornerstone of Mr Abe's effort to create opportunities for Japanese companies, along with steps to boost industrial competitiveness and open up the country more to international trade.\n\nThe government may decide in March where it will locate the special zones, Mr Abe said on Jan 7. The council will decide on criteria for selecting these areas at its next meeting expected to be held at the end of this month or early next month, Mr Hatta said. There will be a maximum of five zones, with one or two \"virtual\" areas and the rest in big cities, he said.\n\nTokyo's real-estate market has started to perk up, helped by unprecedented monetary easing by the Bank of Japan and the city's successful bid to host the 2020 Olympics. The monthly average vacancy rate in Tokyo business areas fell to 7.34 per cent at the of last month from 8.67 per cent a year earlier and 9.01 per cent at the end of 2011, according to data from Miki Shoji Co.\n\nThe real-estate sub-index of Japan's benchmark Topix of shares climbed about 62 per cent over the past year, outpacing a 43 per cent gain in the Topix index.\n\nJapan's commercial real-estate transaction volume jumped 41 per cent in October-December from the previous quarter, led by Japan Real-Estate Investment Trust activity, according to DTZ Research. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

SIA - which typically operates around five flights a day to the Thai capital - had said earlier that it was cutting 19 flights over a six-week period from Jan 14 to Feb 25.\n\nAn SIA spokesman said: \"We will be monitoring the situation and will provide updates on our website whenever necessary.\"\n\nPassengers affected by the cancellations will be re-booked on other flights or given a refund. In addition, SIA is waiving fees and penalties for re-booking and re-routing for those holding tickets to Bangkok from now until Feb 9.\n\nOther carriers which have been forced to cut capacity in the face of weaker travel demand include Tigerair and Thai Airways.\n\nBudget carrier Tiger has no immediate plans to cancel more than the six flights it had previously announced it would cut this week. But it is extending its fee waiver for changes to destinations and travel dates for those booked to travel between now and Feb 10.\n\nMeanwhile, Jetstar Asia - which is operating to Bangkok as usual - is also waiving penalty fee charges. It has been letting customers booked to travel to Bangkok from Jan 11-26 to make changes to their travel dates. Customers looking to cancel their trip will get a voucher.\n\nTravel agents BT spoke to said that cancellations have started to come in over the past few weeks, with some customers postponing their trips and others opting to go to other destinations instead.\n\nDynasty Travel expects a 70-80 per cent plunge in sales in Q1 to Bangkok as enquiries from customers have dried up. This has been a boon for other destinations, however, with 60 per cent of Bangkok-bound passengers postponing or re-routing to other cities since December.\n\nOn Tuesday, a tour group of 120 travellers had to avoid popular shopping mall Mahboonkrong Centre because of the anti- government protests.\n\n\"We are hopeful that normalcy will return by mid-February and not affect the March school holidays. However, if this situation continues, it will definitely have a significant impact on (Thailand's) tourism landscape, not only affecting the leisure market but also the meetings and incentives market,\" said Alicia Seah, Dynasty Travel's marketing communications director. Some of its hotel partners, she added, have suffered double-digit drops in occupancy.\n\nAt CTC Travel, 40 customers have changed plans for travel to Bangkok this month, with the majority of customers asking to to postpone their trip.\n\n\"They will still (travel) to Bangkok once the airline resumes full operations,\" said a CTC spokeswoman.\n\nOver at Chan Brothers, there were five cancellations last week for departures during the Chinese New Year period as the political situation took a turn for the worse. General enquiries and bookings have slowed down because of the Chinese New Year period, too. \"The majority of our customers are still proceeding with their travel plans,\" said a Chan Brothers spokeswoman, adding that some are also asking to change their travel plans to go to other parts of the country such as Chiang Mai.\n\n\"Singaporeans who wish to travel to Bangkok during this period should avoid large gatherings and protest marches, as well as all protests sites and their vicinity during the day and especially at night,\" Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) said in a travel notice yesterday.\n\nSingaporeans are also advised to buy travel insurance and register online with MFA (\n\nhttps://eregister.mfa.gov.sg\n\n).\n\nThailand has always been a popular destinations for Singapore travellers, with 936,477 visitors from the city-state making their way to the Land of Smiles last year - nearly 13 per cent more than 2012.\n\nThailand received 26.73 million visitors in 2013, data from the Thai authorities showed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even if they all succeed in staving off a default, the process, akin to a stress test, could weaken confidence in the Chinese financial system.\n\nChina Credit Trust is the first to test the market. It had been working to stave off what would have been the first default of a shadow banking product and the country's biggest default, a three billion yuan (S$633.3 million) trust due to mature on Jan 31.\n\nYesterday, China Credit said that it was close to signing an agreement with investors. \"China Credit has reached an agreement with interested parties, and is in the process of reaching a consensus with investors who would take over the trust,\" it said. The statement did not identify the source of funds, or say whether investors would get their money back.\n\nA day before, on Sunday, Caixin Media, China's leading business media group, disclosed that China Credit was in talks with strategic investors whose names were put forth by three parties involved, namely China Credit, a local city government and China's largest bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China known as ICBC. The purpose was to have these outside investors take over the trust and repay investors.\n\nCaixin quoted unnamed sources close to China Credit as saying that, \"the only disagreement is whether the interests paid to investors could be counted as the trust's principle\".\n\nThe Caixin report also pointed out that Chinese regulators opposed an alternative proposal to allow the default of the trust, which would have sent a warning signal to wayward participants. \"The money involved, three billion yuan, is too big to allow a default. If it's only 200 or 300 million yuan, we would try it out,\" a regulatory official was quoted as saying.\n\nEarlier, various Chinese media reports suggested China Credit was spurned by the local government and ICBC in its proposal to seek both to help shoulder a big chunk of the payout.\n\nChina Credit sold the trust - known notoriously as Trust No 1 - to retail investors since 2010 through ICBC's branches and used the proceeds to lend to a coal miner in China's mining heartland of Shanxi province, Zhenfu Energy Group, for a 49 per cent stake in Zhenfu Energy.\n\nBy May 2012, it became clear that Wang Pingyan, the boss of Zhenfu Energy, was in financial trouble and he was prosecuted for raising funds illegally from the public, a personal fund-raising activity unrelated to the trust. The revelation brought to an end the two-year boom in the issuance of mining-related trust products.\n\nYan Yuxia, a researcher at Shanghai-based Use-Trust Studio of the Yuanglee group, which tracks the trust industry, said that these mining trusts were mostly backed by coal mines and raised funds in 2011 and 2012. They will be mature within these two years, she said.\n\nAt its peak in the first half of 2012, a total of 90 mining-related trust products were issued by 25 trust companies to raise 31.5 billion yuan, about 8 per cent of the total trust market at the time, according to Use-Trust Studio.\n\nBy comparison, the scale of mining-related trusts was dwarfed by that of trusts backed by real estate and infrastructure projects during the same period, which were more than twice as big in dollar terms. \"The returns of these mining trusts are slightly lower than those backed up by real estate products,\" she said.\n\nAssets managed by China's 67 trust companies soared 60 per cent to US$1.67 trillion in the 12 months ended September, according to the China Trustee Association, even as policymakers sought to curb money flows outside the formal banking system. China's shadow banking industry, which includes wealth management products issued by banks, has expanded to US$5.95 trillion, JPMorgan Chase estimated in May.\n\nA bailout of the trust product would leave Chinese authorities with a growing problem of moral hazard and other potential problems in the system, Standard & Poor's said in a Jan 24 statement. An opportunity for \"instilling market discipline\" will have been missed, it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Among other things, he said Lam had discussed with him the bond issues made by Xtron to CHC, and had brought up the fact that the people running Xtron and those in CHC \"have a common interest\".\n\n\"John Lam was making a disclosure in a forthright way, that there was clearly a link (between Xtron and CHC) because they are church members?\" Mr Tan put to Mr Sim.\n\nBut, Mr Sim said: \"If you are saying that John Lam tried to tell me that the two entities are related, then why was it signed off in the financial accounts as them being unrelated parties? Why was there no disclosure? They (the board) signed the accounts, they approved the accounts.\n\n\"You're right in saying that John Lam said they wanted to maintain an arms-length (relationship between the two entities). For governance purposes, the board should maintain an arms-length view of all transactions . . . But I don't see how you can jump back to how he disclosed anything to me,\" Mr Sim added.\n\nMr Tan then asked: \"However, in your view, after considering all the responses, which you obtained (from a meeting with relevant CHC members), you were comfortable with signing off the FY2008 accounts as it was signed off eventually? Which did not include Xtron as a related party of CHC?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Mr Sim said.\n\nThe line of questioning came after several e-mails were tendered as evidence by the prosecution earlier this week.\n\nOne was an e-mail from former CHC finance manager Serina Wee to deputy senior pastor Tan Ye Peng in June 2009, expressing her concern that Mr Sim might \"say that CHC is running Xtron\".\n\nAnother was an e-mail from former CHC board member Chew Eng Han to Wee and Tan in July 2008, which said that \"we don't want them (the auditors) to think we control Xtron\".\n\nMr Sim had said then that the e-mails seemed to suggest the CHC members were eager to hide any link between Xtron and CHC from him, and that the e-mails would make him question the bond issues made by Xtron to CHC - \"is there something more to (the bond issues) than what is represented to us?\"\n\nSenior Counsel Andre Maniam, who represents Wee, then sought to show that CHC members had not attempted to hide such issues, as they had raised them with Baker Tilly TFW's then-managing partner and CHC's first audit engagement partner, Foong Daw Ching.\n\nMr Maniam showed Mr Sim, who is the current managing partner of Baker Tilly TFW, CHC correspondence and documentation - such as minutes of meetings - which seemed to show that any concerns the CHC members had about the Xtron bonds and the possible link between Xtron and CHC had been raised and discussed with Mr Foong on several occasions.\n\nThese were documents which Mr Sim said he had not seen during his audit of CHC and Xtron, nor before this trial.\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Adding to the gloom was a Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey that confirmed that China manufacturing contracted this month for the first time in half a year, indicating that economic growth there continues to slow. But analysts remained positive on Japan, while being cautious on China.\n\nJapan was hit the hardest, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 Index falling more than 3 per cent to below 15,000 points yesterday morning. The index had shot up 60 per cent last year as investors betted on the success of aggressive money-printing by Japan's central bank reviving Japan's economy and a devalued yen driving up corporate profits.\n\nIndices in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand also fell. Taiwan fell 1.6 per cent. Korea and Malaysia added about one per cent. Investors fear that as US bond yields go up with tapering, liquidity will flow out from emerging markets.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse in a note to clients: \"We reiterate our 'underweight' call on the four most overvalued markets currently, which are Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.\"\n\nKorea and China, by contrast, \"appear closest to trough valuations\". MSCI Korea's price-to-book ratio has dropped to 1.04 times, just 7 per cent above global financial crisis lows of 0.97 times, Credit Suisse said. MSCI China's price-to-book ratio is now at 1.4 times, just 3 per cent above last June's lows of 1.36 times, when a cash crunch there caused interbank borrowing rates to spike and prompted fears of a breakdown in China's financial system.\n\nChina was the only region in Asia ex-Japan to see fund inflows for the week, Citi Research said in a Jan 24 note. Analysts, however, warn about the risks in the shadow banking sector. Increased regulation there will reduce liquidity especially to troubled borrowers, said Nikko AM chief global strategist John Vail yesterday. \"We have long been cautious on Chinese equities and, despite low valuations, we continue to believe that corporate profit margins will be under pressure and that bank earnings understate the true problem of bad debts,\" he said.\n\nBy contrast, analysts remain positive on Japan, noting that its economy is beginning to shake off a long slump. French bank Societe Generale liked how Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had outlined a swathe of reforms recently, including reductions in corporate tax rates, measures to raise the female work participation rate, easier immigration rules, and plans to reform the agricultural and medical sectors.\n\nIn a commentary on Tuesday in the English-language newspaper The Japan Times, Mr Abe reiterated that these reforms were aimed at assuaging the region's worries about his nationalistic streak, seen in a visit to a controversial war shrine last month.\n\n\"Japan has pledged that it will never again wage war, and we have never stopped working for a world that is at peace. It is my fervent hope that Japan's economic revival, with its promise of increased global and regional prosperity, will help to bring such a world closer,\" he said.\n\nSociete-Generale said that while Mr Abe's reforms would take some time to materialise, \"a positive impact on business sentiment - and arguably the stock market - is likely to occur even in the shorter term, and help solidify Japan's restoration to economic growth\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He was speaking after announcing a plan to launch a real estate joint venture with Prudential Financial Inc which will target urban projects in China. The companies did not give a size for their investment, but said without elaborating that they also expect to work together on real estate projects outside of China.\n\nThe real estate venture is the latest move by Fosun which is aiming to become a Chinese version of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc by using insurance investments as a base to fund long-term investments in larger companies.\n\nFosun's chairman, Guo Guangchang, said the Prudential deal \"marks a solid step for Fosun to develop Warren Buffett's model\".\n\nCo-founded by Mr Guo, Mr Liang and two classmates from Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University in 1992 with capital of just US$4,000, Fosun initially set up as a market research firm. It then moved into the pharmaceutical business in 1997 before expanding further into areas like steel, retail, mining and insurance. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Property\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

What is wrong - or rather morally wrong - is if the developer marks units as 'sold' when they are not, to give the impression of good sales.\"\n\nHe said that it is quite usual for a builder to hold three to four pre-launches over two months before advertising the launch of the development, during which time 30 to 40 per cent of sales would have been achieved at discounted prices. \"Of course if he has achieved 80 to 90 per cent, he would be kicking himself because it means he has under-priced his products,\" said Mr Tang.\n\nHe added, however, that the way investor clubs operate is a cause for concern because they distort the market.\n\nIt would be different if these clubs buy the remaining units of a development, instead of purchasing them before the launch and getting 20 to 25 per cent discount, he said, because the developer would have to ensure that other homebuyers end up shouldering the discounts given.\n\nIn his view, investor clubs make excessive profits, since they often sell the units to members at a discount of about 8 per cent and pocket the rest.\n\nEven so, he does not see how such clubs can be regulated, though he agrees that their practice warrants a closer look. \"The club pays the deposit so it is a business arrangement, but because it acts as a middleman, prices do get bumped up.\"\n\nThe interest in properties in Iskandar Malaysia has attracted Singapore-based investor clubs into that market as well.\n\nConcerned about rocketing home prices, Malaysia has already introduced a number of measures to cool the market, such as more stringent lending guidelines, higher tax penalties and scrapping easy-financing schemes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Financial institutions that hold such a licence can offer yuan-denominated investment products and invest offshore yuan - the Chinese currency that is traded outside the country - in China's securities markets.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, MAS said that the applications are to be made to the China Securities Regulatory Commission through approved custodian banks. All financial institutions incorporated in Singapore and approved by the MAS to conduct fund management activities are eligible for the scheme.\n\nLast October, Singapore was roped in for China's RQFII programme, which effectively allows offshore yuan to be re-routed back into the Chinese market. Using offshore yuan, Singapore-based investors can buy up to 50 billion yuan (S$10.55 billion) worth of Chinese investment-products, which include stocks, bonds, warrants and funds, according to the allocated quota.\n\nThe programme was first made available to Hong Kong-based financial institutions in 2011. Three-quarters of all yuan-denominated payments, in value terms, are made in Hong Kong, a report released this month by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, showed.\n\nLast year, the RQFII programme was expanded to London and Singapore, as China warms to market liberalisation. London, the world's biggest foreign exchange and bond trading centre and a hub for Europe's offshore-yuan business, was allocated an 80 billion yuan quota.\n\nWhile Chinese equities have lost some favour among investors, there remains room for growth in demand as foreign investor ownership of China-A shares is less than one per cent, noted Lu Lan Fang, chief operating officer of APS Asset Management. \"Our concern is that we might not be able to get sufficient quotas for our clients,\" said Ms Lu, whose firm has applied for a quota of US$300 million and plans to apply for a second tranche by year-end.\n\nChinese sovereign bonds could attract investor interest this year since 10-year government bonds' yields of about 4 per cent are the third-highest in the region after Indonesia and India, Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed income at Schroders, told BT. The gradual appreciation of the Chinese currency, as well as low volatility, also makes it a good investment play, said Mr De Mello, who expects a 2 per cent appreciation of the yuan against the US dollar this year.\n\nThe yuan overtook the euro as the second most used currency in trade financing last October, Swift data showed. The proportion of all global trade finance - such as letters of credit and collections - that involved the yuan stood at 8.7 per cent. This compared with the euro's 6.6 per cent and the US dollar's 81 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China's capital Beijing has been worrying about water shortages.\n\nFactories that release untreated waste and chemicals into rivers exacerbate the problem, causing many people to fall ill from drinking contaminated water.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Those images will be used as a basis for looking for other problems that could have caused the 787 batteries to erupt. \"They'll now go back and examine those to see if there's anything they missed,\" Mr Goglia said.\n\nJAL took the 787 out of service on Tuesday after workers preparing the plane for flight spotted white smoke outside the aircraft. Warning lights indicated a fault with the battery and its charger, which engineers later found had leaked liquid from one cell.\n\nNo passengers were aboard, but the incident has reignited concerns over the state-of-the-art 787's safety and reliability, coming a year after two lithium-ion batteries overheated on Dreamliners, prompting regulators to ground the global fleet for more than three months while Boeing revamped the battery, charger and containment system to improve safety.\n\nBatteries on the 787 are now housed in a redesigned metal containment box, with insulated separators and special valves to vent hot gases directly outside the plane.\n\nThe Japan Civil Aviation Bureau (JCAB) is heading the search for what went wrong with the power pack in this week's incident. GS Yuasa, Boeing and JAL are also involved, as are investigators from the NTSB in the United States and the Japan Transport Safety Board (JTSB). Those two agencies have yet to figure out the cause of last year's battery issues.\n\nThe JTSB has no jurisdiction over Tuesday's battery incident, as it hasn't been logged as an accident, but the agency hopes to gather fresh data to help its investigation into last year's ANA incident, a JTSB official told Reuters.\n\nThe NTSB said it was sending aircraft systems investigator Mike Bauer to Japan to assist the JCAB.\n\nIn the past year, the global fleet of 787s has more than doubled to 115 planes operated by 16 carriers. ANA is the world's leading operator with 24 Dreamliners.\n\nMr Goglia said engineers, maintenance people and Boeing employees have told him the latest battery rupture appears so far to be a single event, rather than a problem that is likely to repeat itself. He noted Boeing has not issued a service bulletin to airlines recommending action. \"If they find something in the review process that's a concern, they would issue a bulletin, but so far there's no indication of what the root cause of the failure was,\" he said. \"If they don't know what's wrong, they don't know how to fix it.\"\n\nInvestigators also are likely to look for a voltage spike or other abnormality in the data that is gathered by sensors in the battery system, said Michel Merluzeau, managing partner at G2 Solutions, an aerospace and defence consulting firm in Kirkland, Washington.\n\nHe and Mr Goglia both noted the containment system had worked as planned, by stopping the problem from affecting other cells of the battery, and not damaging the plane. \"I think it's a vindication of the fix,\" Mr Merluzeau said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

GENEVIEVE CUA reports\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Jan 14, 2014 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nYEAR 2014 is for risk assets, says UBS group managing director Mark Haefele. But in order to benefit, Asian investors should diversify and seek to break out of their \"home bias\".\n\nHome bias refers to a tendency among investors to invest largely in domestic equities.\n\nMr Haefele, who is also UBS' global head of investments, says the bank's preferred regions for equities are the US and Europe. He is cautious about Asia. \"We don't think US equities are in a bubble. At about 16.5 times earnings, that's within the range of what is normal. Valuations aren't stretched and there is a supportive macro backdrop. We expect total returns of 6 to 7 per cent for the US, and we don't think you need to get a lot of valuation expansion. We think just an earnings growth of 8 per cent can help to achieve most of the target.\"\n\nUBS today hosts a pan-Asian investment conference, the UBS Wealth Insights, which is expected to be attended by close to 3,000 guests.\n\nMr Haefele says Europe is also benefiting from a supportive macro environment. In particular, cyclical export stocks are a \"little cheaper\" than those in the US, and have the potential for a 10 per cent earnings growth. \"If things go as planned, we think investors will continue to allocate incremental capital from the US towards Europe.\"\n\nAsia and the developing or emerging markets, however, face headwinds. \"There is about a 20 to 30 per cent discount on developing markets . . . We're not sure valuations will normalise this year because many investors globally are still very cautious about how (QE) tapering in the US and the withdrawal of liquidity will affect emerging markets as a whole and individual countries.\n\n\"We're not sure the valuation gap will close in the next six months; we're neutral the emerging markets. But the valuation gap is wide enough now that it doesn't make sense to underweight the developing markets.\"\n\nAmong the emerging markets, UBS has overweight China, thanks to \"relatively compelling\" valuations and confidence in reforms. The reforms announced last November included an initiative that will see the central government taking over responsibility of infrastructure projects from local governments. Also proposed was an \"early warning system\" to sound an alert when local debt levels approach excessive levels.\n\nMr Haefele said: \"From what we've seen, the reforms initiated are long term, but are headed in the right direction . . . They've also done a lot in the management of credit that convinced a lot of global investors that they have enough leverage to control the economy to the point where it is not going to upset the rest of the world.\"\n\nChina's growth is expected to moderate to 7.5 per cent. \"There are still issues, yes. But there has been a stabilisation of the growth rate. Inflation has been under control, giving policymakers more room to correct mistakes.\"\n\nOn clients' risk appetite, he says the \"great rotation\" out of bonds into equities has yet to materialise.\n\n\"What we've seen is some money coming out of cash into equity markets, but among clients it's relatively small . . . It's not like clients have fully embraced the risk appetite we think they should have at this point in the cycle. We continue to encourage clients to look at their portfolios to make sure they take appropriate risks because things have changed so much from the time they had just a bond portfolio.\"\n\nHe says the bank continues to persuade clients to diversify. \"It's the only free-lunch (way to invest). Why have a portfolio of only Asian equities, for example, when we see other dynamics around the world, where for the same or better reward, you can take lower risk.\"\n\nCommodities have been taken out of the bank's strategic asset allocation and are now part of the alternative assets bucket. Dominic Schnider, UBS executive director and head of commodity research, says more pain lies ahead for gold investors as the metal is repriced from its status as a currency towards a commodity. \"Maybe we don't need so much production any more. That means miners need to be disincentivised, and it means pain in the balance sheets. We're looking at gold at US$1,050 to US$1,150 over six to 12 months.\n\n\"If there is a spike in gold prices, investors should re-think their allocation, especially those who overdid it in the past.\"\n\nGold traded as high as US$1,692 a year ago. It has been weakening, and gold spot price yesterday was at US$1,249.\n\ngen@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(The SME declined to be named.)\n\nCraftech Printing Services was turned off setting up in Iskandar by the lack of available skills and talent there. Its general manager Paul Lim told The Business Times that the company has chosen to stay put in Singapore.\n\nBut it is not as if this was the easy option. Staying on here entails dealing with high business costs and a tight labour market, which is why some companies bite the bullet and consider going to the Malaysian economic zone - its challenges notwithstanding.\n\nMr Lim said: \"In Singapore, there is constraint of land and labour, and it is also too expensive to produce here.\"\n\nReferring to Iskandar's shortfalls in skilled manpower and security, Mr Lim said \"these are things you get used to\", because cost remains the prime factor.\n\nAmong the companies which have already moved to Iskandar is precision-engineering company Grand Team Technologies, which has a 1,000 sq ft facility in Ang Mo Kio; it is also awaiting the completion of its factory in an industrial park in Kempas, a suburb of Johor Baru, and is scouting for yet another site for possible expansion.\n\nJason Ng, the company's managing director, said the high costs and tight labour market in Singapore are eating into his company's profits. He acknowledged that Iskandar is beset with its own manpower issues, but said that, for operations needing fewer than 50 employees such as his, this is less of a challenge.\n\nBlue Bay Interactive, on the other hand, has put its Iskandar plans on the back-burner for now. It has decided to wait another year or two to see how things pan out across the Causeway, while carrying out an internal restructuring.\n\nManaging partner Rodney Ang told BT that the company still had some concerns about Iskandar, as it was \"used to the stability found in Singapore\"; in Iskandar, both national and state policies are less certain, raising the spectre of an \"unknown factor\", he said.\n\nFor his company, Iskandar's lack of manpower - skilled hands, in particular - is an issue.\n\nHe added, however, that the company's current restructuring would make its operations less labour-intensive, so the shortage of manpower there would be less of a concern eventually.\n\nRecognising that SMEs here may need to still move away from Singapore to survive, the Singapore Manufacturing Federation yesterday launched a website to help companies here expand into Iskandar and the Riau islands of Indonesia. The one-stop Business Expansion Programme portal features a self-assessment tool and provides information and case studies to help SMEs draw up their moving plans.\n\nThe portal is expected to help them reduce the initial cost in expanding - a factor that may help SMEs overcome the rising cost pressures in Iskandar.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

She had gone to a remote stone quarry in search of raw materials. On her way back to the city, she rode an overnight coach outfitted with makeshift beds.\n\nShe remembers: \"I couldn't sleep that night, so I laid in bed, admiring the landscape. At some point, the bus began speeding up on the dirt road. Suddenly, the bus veered out of control and toppled over. I was lying on the side that it had tipped to, so the luggage and other objects fell on me. Some people fell on me too - well, actually it was just one woman - but it felt like more.\n\n\"The roof of the bus tore off, so I was lying there amid the wreckage and staring at the sky. I had a clear view of the night sky, and I thought: What beautiful stars.\"\n\nShe was not hurt in the accident, nor was anyone else. And it didn't deter her from still gadding about to far-flung places, on her own, in search of marble and granite to carve her exquisite sculptures from.\n\nAll at the age of 70.\n\nShe says: \"I'm a sculptor. This is what I wake up in the morning to do. When I take a break for a while, I quickly fall sick and my whole body becomes stiff. I'm just so used to working.\"\n\nEarlier this week, the celebrated artist opened a new exhibition of 50 paper sculptures and paintings at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute (STPI). The elegant show of works inspired by tropical fruits and flora came on the heels of the acclaimed recently ended exhibition of 70 marble and granite sculptures and paintings at Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts. The Business Times ranked the latter as one of top 10 art shows of 2013.\n\nThe new sculpture series titled Tropical Fruits are priced from $2,500 to $5,500, while her paintings and wall reliefs are priced between $12,000 and $32,000.\n\nOver the years, the collector base of the Cultural Medallion recipient has grown, and so has her quirky wit. She deadpans: \"Yes, there are a few more collectors of my works than before. Some of them probably think: Oh, Sai Por is old now, so there's not much time left for her to create art. Better collect some before it's too late.\"\n\nHan, long used to working on granite and marble, had to contend with shaping sculptures out of paper pulp for the STPI show. She described the process as less physically strenuous but more frustrating: \"You exert less energy, but it's also harder to get the shapes right.\"\n\nShe worked from morning to past midnight at the STPI studios for a month to create the works, but she described the experience as \"luxurious\" compared to her usual habit of working alone: \"The studios are air-conditioned and I was given a team of assistants - wow... assistants!\"\n\nHan says the secret to her longevity is her logical mind. She says: \"When I make work, I don't get emotional about it. I work out what I want logically, then I set about doing it methodically. As an artist, everything is physical. You have to understand it, the mystery of it, how you draw or paint or sculpt in stone, the physicality of the material and how it shapes in your hands.\"\n\nHer words echo what painter Chuck Close once said: \"Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work.\"\n\nHan says what's lacking in the works of contemporary Singapore artists is depth: \"Most artworks stay on the surface and say little beyond the obvious. There's not enough thinking and life experience behind it.\n\n\"Or else they're too vague. Once I saw a performance artist using masking tape to tape the walls and floor. I couldn't understand what he was doing. Maybe he has his reasons, but it was hard for people to understand and be moved. Even the intelligent people around me didn't understand it.\"\n\nShe is not alone in her sentiments.\n\nHan says the one dream she still harbours is showing at the Venice Biennale. She says: \"I submitted my proposal once, but it was rejected by the selection committee, so I never submitted again. I still hope to get there someday. When was the last time Singapore picked a woman artist to show at the Biennale?\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nHan Sai Por is showing her works at the Singapore Tyler Print Institute from now till Feb 22. Admission is free. There will also be an artist talk tomorrow at 2.30pm. STPI also has a booth at Art Stage featuring her works. Art Stage runs from now till Sunday\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So we have been looking beyond the food and beverage sector,\" executive chairman Keith Chua, 60, told The Business Times in an interview.\n\n\"Finding alternative investments hasn't been an easy task. We have looked at several, both within and without the F&B industry. None have been successful or, where we've attempted to negotiate, have not been conclusive,\" he said.\n\n\"So efforts continue. We are also being careful. There are many opportunities but we have also seen many that are not as exciting.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the company has become more risk-averse about its existing operating businesses. Its main Swensen's business in Singapore and Season's confectionery in Malaysia are profitable, but minor brands Gloria Jean's Coffees, Oishi Japanese Pizza and Tip Top Curry Puffs are in the red. Caution is thus the word of the day, rather than \"being aggressive\", Mr Chua said.\n\nFor its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2013, ABR had a $12.6 million \"deposit for new project\" on its cashflow statement - indicative of a bid for a sizeable project. That did not work out, Mr Chua told BT, though he would not be drawn into providing more details of the failed bid.\n\n\"We haven't disclosed it, and don't know if the board would mention it (in the coming annual report). It would have been a significant investment,\" he said.\n\nABR Holdings has been around in Singapore since 1978, holding the franchise for Swensen's. In 1992, it listed on Sesdaq, the precursor to the Catalist board on Singapore Exchange (SGX). It entered the mainboard in 2008.\n\nIn the 1990s, two-thirds of ABR's revenue came from Swensen's and one-third from Europa Holdings, a chain of pubs and discos that was eventually closed by the early 2000s. Since then, ABR has tried its hand at other businesses.\n\nIts most notable success was Focus Network Agencies (FNA), known for its chocolate retail chain The Cocoa Trees. ABR and partners invested $5 million in FNA in 2003, and divested the firm for $196 million in 2012. This reaped ABR a bonanza of $100 million. In September 2012, shareholders enjoyed a payout of $60.3 million, or 30 cents a share, as a special dividend.\n\nShares in ABR have continued to climb steadily through the years. But other businesses that ABR entered into have not worked out as well, such as its coffee, curry puff and Japanese pizza sidelines here.\n\nExplaining why, Mr Chua said: \"The food market is a very competitive environment. If you want to establish a new concept, a new brand, there has to be some entrepreneurial dynamic. You have to put in the time, commitment, take a certain level of risks.\"\n\n\"But when you have a bigger part of ABR (Swensen's) that is steadily growing and profitable, you tend to be more risk averse, less entrepreneurial in your approach,\" Mr Chua said.\n\nABR thus decided early last year to park its minor brands in a separate vehicle, a joint venture called All Best Foods. \"Part of the hope is that it'll bring about better results,\" he said. It is also venturing into the steaks and grills business with its Hippopotamus Restaurant, a Parisian casual dining outfit.\n\nABR had also attempted to break into the China market without much success. Today, its core business remains its Swensen's chain in Singapore that has grown steadily through the years, with 22 restaurant outlets and two premium outlets under the Earle Swensen's name. Swensen's currently contributes about 80 per cent of ABR's revenue, Mr Chua said.\n\nThe company has recovered from a dip in 2012. Its nine-month revenue to Sept 30, 2013, is $71.3 million, up around 6 per cent from a year ago. Net profit from continuing operations for the period has soared to $5.4 million from just $97,000 a year ago.\n\nA number of reasons, including training for staff, productivity and efficiency initiatives, growing mall traffic and a growing F&B industry, contributed to the turnaround, Mr Chua said.\n\nThe part-timer pool here has also mitigated the effects of the manpower crunch. ABR employs 500 to 600 full-time staff, with a further 500 part-timers.\n\nA number are young adults, school leavers and people around the national service age.\n\n\"This is an area that food companies can look at developing,\" Mr Chua said.\n\nABR is also partnering Delta Senior School for those with special needs, developing a training cafe there and giving graduating students employment opportunities.\n\nWhile rentals, another significant component of costs, are unlikely to spike in the near future, Mr Chua said rentals are \"hitting the upper limit of what may be workable from operating business perspective\".\n\nMr Chua's family used to own the Garden Hotel here before divesting it in 2000 and reinvesting the proceeds in ABR, which remains a key business.\n\nIn the meantime, it remains to be seen if, after divesting FNA, ABR will continue its sterling track record - a 10-year return of more than 20 per cent a year on average, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSaid Mr Chua: \"Our intention is for continued involvement. ABR continues to have potential to grow. There are opportunities to look at additional investment and expansion. That will keep me occupied.\"\n\nABR shares last closed trading at 76 cents apiece.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Home prices this year may rise 35 per cent to 40 per cent, he said.\n\n\"Transactions on off-plan properties are a little dangerous,\" he said on Jan 6. \"We are now studying them and looking at ways to ensure that they don't hurt the market.\"\n\nAs Dubai's economy and property market revive, regulators and companies are trying to avoid a repeat of a real estate bubble that burst in 2008 and caused values to fall by as much as 65 per cent. The buying and selling of off-plan properties for a quick profit, known as flipping, was seen as a major cause of the crash.\n\nOff-plan sales made a comeback last year after drying up following the market's collapse. That's helping builders finance projects while sparking concern that speculation is returning. Emaar Properties PJSC, Dubai's biggest developer, banned the resale of incomplete properties before 40 per cent of the home's total value is paid. The move was made to minimise the effect of speculation the company said in an e-mail.\n\nThe Land Department is also planning regulations to limit rent hikes when tenants change, Mr Bin Mejren said. While there are caps on increases for existing occupiers, Dubai currently has no controls on increases for new tenants.\n\n\"We are studying laws for residential and commercial properties and each will have its own guidelines,\" he said. \"We expect to have them prepared in either June or the third quarter. There has to be some regulation for new contracts in order to have stable rental increases.\"\n\nThe Land Department last week said it is updating its rental price index, which determines caps on increases depending on the type and location of the property. The changes come as Dubai stands \"on the cusp of a new boom in real estate\" after it won the bid to host the World Expo 2020 exhibition in November, the department said.\n\nDubai's economy may have had the fastest expansion in six years in 2013 after output grew 4.9 per cent in the first half. Prices for mid-range apartments in the city rose 43 per cent in 2013 after climbing 18 per cent in 2012, according to Cluttons LLC data on Bloomberg.\n\nRegulators last year moved to cool the market after home prices rose at the fastest pace in the world in the second quarter. The Land Department raised the transaction fee to 4 per cent from 2 per cent and the United Arab Emirates Central Bank imposed restrictions on the value of mortgages made available to foreign buyers.\n\nDubai also established a centre to settle rent disputes that will more than double the number of cases that can be reviewed. Rents for mid-range two-bedroom apartments rose 38 per cent last year compared with a 10 per cent gain in 2012, according the Cluttons data.\n\n\"Don't look at buying property as though you're buying shares on the stock market,\" Mr Bin Mejren said. \"If you buy a property here, hold on to it, because by 2020 the city will be entirely different from what it's today.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nKelvin Fong appointed PropNex CEO; Ismail Gafoor remains as executive chairman\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:31 PM\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM", "images": []}

Exchange-rate swings cut more than 100 million Swiss francs from second-half sales, Swatch said.\n\n\"You see a clear deceleration in watch demand as the result of what's happening in China with the anti-gifting campaign,\" Mr Cox said. \"That period is slowly coming to an end and you will see a reacceleration.\"\n\nSales at Swatch's watch and jewellery business rose more than 10 per cent, while sales at its production division, which sells parts to other watchmakers, increased 8.6 per cent. That compares with gains of 16 and 10 per cent, respectively, in 2012.\n\n\"You cannot continue to grow a major brand's sales at 30 to 40 per cent over a four-year period,\" said John Guy, an analyst at Berenberg Bank in London. \"Normalisation of growth was always to be expected.\"\n\nChief executive officer Nick Hayek said in March last year that the company had the potential to reach nine billion Swiss francs in annual sales, though it wasn't a target. The CEO said in October that revenue would fall short of that level in 2013 because of unfavourable exchange rates. Sales growth would be closer to 10 per cent than 5 per cent, he also said at the time.\n\nMr Hayek said that he expects double-digit growth this year, barring an economic crisis and worse exchange rates, according to an interview published in Finanz & Wirtschaft in November.\n\nSwatch bought watch and diamond-jewellery maker Harry Winston for about US$1 billion in March, expanding a list of brands that includes Omega, Longines and Tissot.\n\nSwitzerland's watch exports to China and Hong Kong dropped 8.5 per cent in the first 11 months of last year, on track for the second yearly decline since 2008, the year those markets became the biggest source of revenue for the industry. Data for December hasn't yet been published.\n\nRichemont has said that operating profit fell 0.7 per cent in the six months through September as Asian sales growth slowed and currency fluctuations weighed on earnings.\n\nThis year, Swatch will be allowed to reduce shipments of mechanical movements to other Swiss watch producers to 75 per cent of the average of shipments between 2009 and 2011, Switzerland's competition regulator said in October. That will fall to 65 per cent in 2016 and 55 per cent in 2018.\n\nSwatch's ETA unit is estimated by analysts to make about two-thirds of the mechanical movements used in the timepieces made in the country. A Dec 29 fire at an ETA workshop in the Swiss town of Grenchen may cause delays of weeks or months in producing components for third parties, the company has said.

She also asks if the Manpower Ministry will conduct a review of these workers' recruitment and employment terms, living conditions and leisure issues to better anticipate potential problems.\n\nNominated MP Laurence Lien will ask Mr Teo if the Home Affairs Ministry will consider having a \"more transparent and objective\" process in deeming immigrants undesirable and cancelling their entry permits.\n\nApart from the riot, other issues set to get a hearing include the major traffic congestion that plagued the opening of the Marina Coastal Expressway late last month.\n\nAng Wei Neng (Jurong GRC) will ask Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew for an update on the peak-hour conditions along the $4.3 billion expressway, and what were some of the key lessons learned from the massive jams.\n\nSix MPs have queries about the Do Not Call Registry, which kicked in on Jan 2 this year.\n\nAljunied GRC MP Chen Show Mao of the opposition Workers' Party is curious to know the reasons for the reversal by the Personal Data Protection Commission to now allow businesses to send marketing messages to those with whom they have \"ongoing relationship\", without having to get their consent and even if their numbers are already in the registry.\n\nSeparately, the House will see the introduction of seven Bills, including ones on public order, environmental public health, air navigation and tourism.

They warn that in thin, low-volume markets, fund managers tend to push up prices of shares to window-dress results at the end of December. These tactics are generally followed by predictions of an optimistic flavour in January while stock tips boost share prices further. Caveat emptor thus becomes the order of the day and shrewd traders inevitably take profits to re-enter the market at lower prices in the weeks or months ahead.\n\nAs the accompanying table shows, developed markets outperformed Asian and other emerging markets by a substantial margin last year. Japan led the way, followed by the big surprise - notably, Greece, which was ahead of the US and Germany. Indeed, eight of the major markets rose by more than 20 per cent in local currency terms and 10 markets boomed in US-dollar terms. For global investors, the weakness of the yen cut gains from the 56.7 per cent earned by locals to 28.9 per cent.\n\nRecall the foreign enthusiasm for emerging markets a year ago and note that only Taiwan achieved a reasonable return of 9 per cent in US-dollar terms. In local currencies, South Africa, Malaysia and India did fairly well, but for foreign investors converting dollars, euros and sterling into those markets' currencies, results were dismal. Predictably, since emerging markets are currently relatively depressed, several fund managers and investment bank strategists are once again recommending investments in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nThe vast majority of predictions in the press were a further run of the bull market. The table shows, however, that after considerable appreciation since the 2009 low, most developed markets have become pricey at a time when bond yields have begun to rise. The most expensive markets with price-earnings ratios close to 20 are the US, Switzerland, Germany, France, Australia and Canada. High-risk markets such as Greece and Italy have lower PEs. The UK, Norway and Sweden offer better value than the US and other high PE markets, but are by no means cheap. Japan and the Netherlands have also reached heights which could deter new investors.\n\nThe best value among emerging markets is offered by Hong Kong and Singapore, but both countries have had property booms which are tailing off and are dependent on growth in China. Turkey is fraught with risks and this is reflected in a PE of only 8.3, and there are fears of inadequate corporate governance in both China and Russia.\n\nWall Street usually leads the way, so the market is watching the US Federal Reserve Board closely as quantitative easing has provided the liquidity to fuel the bull market. According to Ned Davis Research, a considerable amount of money has already been invested in stocks as the ratio of cash in money-market mutual funds has fallen to around 13 per cent of the stock market's value, compared with some 47 per cent during the 2009 market lows. Moreover, the firm estimates that the value of some 3,900 American stocks is now around US$21 trillion, equivalent to some 124 per cent of US gross domestic income - an indicator of a fully priced market.\n\nUS and other global markets are thus highly dependent on a sharp increase in earnings. Such an improvement is unlikely in Europe as the economic and business outlook there remains somewhat sluggish. Analysts with rose-tinted glasses predict that US profit increases will exceed 10 per cent this year so that the overall S&P 500 index will achieve estimated earnings of 120 per index unit. On Friday's close of 1,831 points, the forward PE of the S&P 500 index would be 15.3 - or an earnings yield of 6.5 per cent compared with the 10-year bond yield of 3 per cent. If earnings do not rise as much as expected, the market could disappoint.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The print that's showing on local screens features English-language subtitles, possibly in deference to viewers unable to fathom the intricacies of gangsta rap-style dialogue. Interestingly enough, the Spanish spoken by some of the characters is not subtitled at all, but then when it comes to the goosebump-inducing parts, no translation is necessary.\n\nViewers who are familiar with the Paranormal Activity series will relate readily to the format, but The Marked Ones, written and directed by Christopher B Landon, will also appeal to anyone who appreciates a good scare. The story of a trio of overly curious teens who ought to know better than to go into dark and creepy places should resonate with everyone, but there is also a hint of playfulness in this episode about a recent high school graduate who bites off slightly more than he can chew.\n\nMore accurately, Jesse (Andrew Jacobs), who has a habit on snooping on his weird downstairs neighbour, discovers a mysterious bite mark on his arm - the same type of mark that an acquaintance had before he got a crazed look in his eyes and jumps off a building. The neighbour, recently deceased under strange circumstances, is suspected of being involved. Jesse subsequently inherits superhuman powers, dark rings around his eyes and just for good measure, violent mood swings.\n\nTogether with his camera-toting buddy Hector (Jorge Diaz) and school friend Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh), Jesse tries to uncover the mystery, with inevitable results, of course. They encounter the usual assortment of creaky floorboards, doors that slam shut by themselves and - in one instance - a gravity-defying canine.\n\nThe trail inevitably leads to a spooky darkened house and there's even a time-warp sequence that's a nod to the original Paranormal Activity (2009). Anything goes when it comes to scaring the audience but it doesn't take an ouija board to predict that there will continue to be a lot more paranormal activity in the future. For fright fans, that's a good thing - I think.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The IPO shares consist of 1.5 million for public offer and 78.5 million for placement.\n\nThe group, whose market capitalisation on listing will be $74.2 million, intends to declare a one-time special dividend of between $6 million and $8 million, subject to the completion of the sale and leaseback arrangement of its Teban Gardens Crescent showroom and service centre. It is expected to be payable later this year. At 28 cents per share, the dividend yield will be between 8.1 and 10.8 per cent.\n\nThe IPO closes at noon next Wednesday and trading is expected to start two days later at 9am next Friday.\n\nEuroSports has been the Lamborghini dealer here since 2001. In 2004, it acquired the Alfa Romeo distributorship. Pagani was added in 2012, along with the deLaCour luxury watch brand.\n\nIn the past three years, EuroSports' annual revenue has ranged from $86 million to $113 million, with auto sales accounting for 80 per cent of this.\n\nExecutive chairman and CEO Melvin Goh said that Lamborghini has been \"the key driver of our business\". At the same time, luxury watches have higher gross profit margins than cars in percentage terms.\n\n\"If the economy is good, sales of our cars and luxury items will be good too,\" he added. \"Plus, a lot of people are making their first million earlier these days, and they are more willing to splurge. That gives us the opportunity to grow the lifestyle business.\"\n\nHe added that the long-term plan was to go into \"other things\" beyond cars and watches.\n\nFor now, though, constructing a new facility at 7 and 9 Chang Charn Road in the Leng Kee motor belt is one of his immediate priorities. Construction work at the property, purchased for about $40 million more than a year ago, is expected to begin in 2015 and take about two years to complete.\n\nWith his personal touch, Mr Goh is generally acknowledged by the industry as the company's best salesman; his customers enjoy anything from birthday treats to customised coffee table books.

It would be the first time the billionaire investor fell short of the goal since he took over the Omaha, Nebraska-based company in 1965.\n\nMr Buffett, 83, highlights the comparison as a way for shareholders to evaluate his performance against a low-cost fund that tracks the index. The S&P 500 returned 128 per cent including dividends since the end of 2008, fuelled by the US Federal Reserve's stimulus efforts and higher corporate profits. Berkshire's book value per Class A share, Mr Buffett's yardstick, rose 80 per cent to US$126,766 starting at the same point until Sept 30, 2013, the latest data available.\n\n\"He's been awfully honest\" by keeping the goal the same, said Tom Russo, a partner at Berkshire investor Gardner Russo & Gardner. \"He didn't pick it because it was an easy benchmark.\"\n\nAnalyst estimates show that Mr Buffett probably didn't narrow the gulf much in the final three months of 2013. Barclays Plc predicts Berkshire's book value rose to US$131,005 a share, or 86 per cent more than it was five years earlier. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimates an 83 per cent gain.\n\nBook value, a measure of assets minus liabilities, is often presented on a per- share basis to help investors compare a company's net worth to its trading price. Mr Buffett has said that if he's able to add value more quickly than the S&P 500 rises, Berkshire shares should outperform the benchmark over time.\n\nHis long-term track record is among the best in investing and responsible for making many of his early backers wealthy. Book value stood at just US$19 a share when he took over and had compounded at almost 20 per cent annually through 2012. That compares with 9.4 per cent for the benchmark.\n\nMr Buffett, Berkshire's chairman and chief executive officer, didn't respond to an e-mailed request for comment sent to an assistant. The company hasn't announced a date for reporting 2013 results.\n\nFor the last half-decade, the S&P 500 has posted double-digit returns every year except 2011, when the debt crisis in Europe overshadowed optimism about a rebound in the US. That was the only year from 2009 through 2012 that Berkshire's book value per share outperformed the index.\n\nThe fact wasn't lost on Mr Buffett, who said in a March letter to shareholders that he and Berkshire vice-chairman Charles Munger would probably fall short of their goal if the S&P 500 continued its rally.\n\n\"We do better when the wind is in our face,\" he wrote.\n\nOne of Mr Buffett's recent picks hasn't helped: a US$10.9 billion investment in International Business Machines Corp in 2011 has lagged behind the index.\n\nMr Buffett makes the benchmark harder to beat by comparing his performance to pretax returns for the S&P 500. Berkshire's book value per share is an after-tax number. Adjusting for that discrepancy would have caused a \"substantial\" lag in the index's performance during the last five decades, he has written in reports to shareholders.\n\nMissing the mark in the last five years would highlight how difficult the billionaire's task has gotten with his company's expansion. Takeovers and stock picks have built Berkshire into a business with dozens of operating units and equity investments valued at more than US$100 billion. That means future gains have to be bigger in absolute terms to increase book value by the percentage amounts of years past.\n\nIf the record is broken, investors are unlikely to abandon the stock because Mr Buffett has delivered such good results for shareholders over his career, said Meyer Shields, an analyst at KBW. Class A shares climbed 33 per cent last year, compared with 30 per cent for the S&P 500.\n\n\"There's been a gradual recognition that, as good as Berkshire is, it's going to get tougher,\" Mr Shields said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nEricsson's Q2 profit beats expectations, says North America growth was good\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:06 PM\n\nJapan's 30-year bond yield hits record high ahead of key election\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:40 PM\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nNvidia to resume H20 AI chip sales to China in US reversal\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM", "images": []}

Natural gas futures in New York have surged 24 per cent since Nov 1 as the coldest start to the US heating season in 13 years boosted fuel demand. Last week, as snow and cold gripped the nation, spot power for New York City jumped more than 11-fold in one hour, while wheat climbed the most since mid-October. This week, cities from Minneapolis to Pittsburgh may have record low temperatures.\n\n\"Cold temperatures and gusty winds associated with an arctic airmass will continue dangerously cold wind chills as far south as Brownsville, Texas and central Florida,\" the National Weather Service said yesterday on its website. \"This arctic airmass will affect the eastern two-thirds of the country on Monday as a sharp cold front moves towards the East Coast.\"\n\nHard-freeze warnings and watches, which are alerts for farmers, stretch from Texas to central Florida. Mike Musher, a meteorologist with the US Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said that 90 per cent of the contiguous US will be at or below the freezing mark today.\n\n\"It definitely looks like one heck of a 'polar pig' shot,\" Kyle Cooper, director of research with IAF Advisors in Houston, said in a Jan 3 interview. Polar pig is a term for a pool of cold, dense air known as a \"polar vortex\" of cold air out of Canada. \"Models show it as quite intense and dropping down pretty far south.\"\n\nFreezing temperatures spur energy demand as people turn up thermostats to heat homes and businesses. Power generation accounts for 32 per cent of US natural gas use, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). About 49 per cent of all homes use the fuel for heating.\n\n\"Everybody's energy bills will be going up,\" Mr Musher said. \"I am sure there are going to be multiple records broken across a large part of the country.\"\n\nAlong with the cold, snow, rain and ice will persist in many high-population areas.\n\nAcross the US, the natural gas-weighted heating degree days value for today is expected to be 47.65, above the 10-year normal of 29.9 and the 30-year mark of 31, said Bob Haas, manager of energy weather at MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nThe last time that such a high value was reached was in 1996, when it was 50.06, Mr Haas said. Heating degree values are calculated by subtracting the daily average temperature from a base of 65 degrees.\n\n\"As far as power and energy demand, we will see those really skyrocketing Sunday, Monday and Tuesday,\" Mr Haas said on Jan 3. \"This will be some of the coldest air in decades.\"\n\nChicago, Minneapolis and Pittsburgh may set records, Mr Haas said. The lowest temperature in Chicago was minus 11 deg C reached for the last time in 1994, while Pittsburgh's record is minus 3 in 1994 and Minneapolis was minus 20 in 1888, according to Mr Haas.\n\nThe daytime high in Chicago is expected to be minus 10 and the wind chill will be in the minus 35 to minus 50-range, said Richard Castro, a weather service meteorologist in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\n\"It's really dangerous stuff,\" he said.\n\nPJM Interconnection LLC expects power consumption on the largest US grid to jump this week to the highest level in almost four months. Demand on the 13-state grid, which serves more than 60 million people from Washington to Chicago, will peak at 134,473 MW today, the most since Sept 11, according to a Jan 3 posting on PJM's website and to grid data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nElectricity use in New York City will peak today at 7,682 MW, the most since Oct 7, New York Independent System Operator Inc said on Jan 3. Spot natural gas for New York City surged last week to the highest level in almost a year.\n\nTeri Viswanath, director of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas SA in New York, said that the cold wave has been priced into natural gas futures.\n\n\"As traders and investors return on Monday, our expectation is that prices will likely stay supported,\" she said in a interview on Jan 3. \"As far as power and energy demand, we will see those really skyrocketing.\"\n\nNatural gas for February delivery climbed as much as 1.7 per cent to US$4.379 in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and was at US$4.358 at 7am.\n\nThe frigid temperatures also pose a threat to winter wheat crops in areas that are not covered by a layer of snow to insulate the plants, said Paul Markert, a meteorologist with MDA Weather Services.\n\n\"There could be some widespread winter-kill damage in northern Kansas and Nebraska Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday,\" he added.\n\nWheat for delivery in March advanced as much as 0.8 per cent to US$6.105 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Its original mission was to clear a navigable shipping channel in McMurdo Sound to the National Science Foundation's Scientific Research Station. The channel is used by resupply ships to deliver food, fuel and other goods to the station. Australian officials said that the US icebreaker would continue with that mission after the rescue operation was over.\n\nLast Friday, Australian officials said that the Chinese ship, the Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, had notified the authorities that it might be trapped by ice, one day after the Chinese used a helicopter from the ship to rescue 52 passengers from the Russian ship, the Akademik Shokalskiy, which had become trapped on Dec 24. The passengers were scientists, tourists and journalists who made up the Australasian Antarctic Expedition.\n\nThose passengers were taken by the Chinese helicopter, the Snow Eagle, and a barge to an Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis. The 22 crew members of the Russian ship had said that they would remain on board their vessel and sail it from Antarctica once ice conditions improved.\n\nAfter the Chinese vessel said that it could become trapped in ice, Australian maritime officials told the Aurora Australis to remain in the area rather than set sail on a route that would eventually end in Tasmania. On Saturday, the Chinese sailors told the Australian authorities that the Snow Dragon's attempt to manoeuvre through the ice had failed. But the ship was in no immediate danger, and it had food supplies for several weeks, Australian officials said.\n\nThe senior crew members of the Chinese and Russian vessels said that they no longer needed assistance from the Australian ship, and the Aurora Australis, with the 52 rescued expedition members, set sail for Casey Station, an Australian base in Antarctica, to complete a resupply, and then on to Hobart, in Tasmania, Australian officials said.\n\nA reporter for Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, sent a report from the Snow Dragon on Saturday which said that all crew and passengers on board the Chinese vessel \"are safe and making efforts to get out of trouble\". The ship was surrounded by heavy ice floes and was 13 miles (21 km) from an ice-free area.\n\nWang Jianzhong, the ship's captain, said that the Snow Dragon had been surrounded by ice floes pushed by strong winds in the past few days, Xinhua reported. The thickest ice layer measured 10 feet to 13 feet.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has urged an \"all-out effort\" to ensure the safety of those aboard the Snow Dragon, Xinhua reported. Premier Li Keqiang has told the crew members and passengers to stay calm and wait for an opportunity to get out of trouble, the report said.\n\nXinhua also reported on Sunday that China planned to build a new icebreaker, one with blades at the bow and stern, and able to cut ice five feet thick. Qu Tanzhou, the director of the State Oceanic Administration's Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration, said that the ship would be a \"mobile research station\". The Snow Dragon was built by Ukraine and deployed by China in 1994. It was designed to transport supplies to Chinese research stations in Antarctica, Xinhua reported.\n\nAustralian officials said that they first made the request for assistance to the US Coast Guard last Friday. The Coast Guard officially accepted the request and released its vessel to the Australians for the search-and-rescue efforts at 8.30 am on Saturday. The Polar Star was scheduled to leave Sydney on Sunday after taking on supplies, and it would take about seven days to reach Commonwealth Bay in Antarctica, depending on weather and ice conditions.\n\nThe 122m Polar Star is one of the largest ships in the Coast Guard fleet and has 140 crew members. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nRTX launches new Collins Aerospace facility with flexible manufacturing system in Singapore\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:22 PM\n\nSome airlines checking Boeing fuel switches after Air India crash\n\nJul 15, 2025 02:11 PM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nTesla\u2019s long-awaited India debut bets on luxury vehicle buyers\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:29 AM\n\nGlobal EV sales jump 24% in June though North American market struggles: research firm\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:59 AM\n\nBoeing\u2019s triple China deliveries sign of easing trade tensions\n\nJul 15, 2025 08:15 AM\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM", "images": []}

Last month, Iskandar Waterfront Holdings sold 15 ha of seafront land in Danga Bay for RM1.6 billion to Hao Yuan Investment, which is planning a RM8 billion development featuring, among others, peninsula Malaysia's tallest tower.\n\nIn October 2013, Singapore billionaire and former remisier king Peter Lim unveiled plans for his RM5.5 billion Vantage Bay project that will include twin towers and is set to become one of the tallest condominiums in Malaysia.\n\nBut it is Iskandar's property market that is getting the most attention, especially from Singapore-based investors.\n\nAccording to developer UEM Sunrise, Singaporeans make up a hefty 74 per cent of foreigners who have snapped up its properties - a figure that surpasses all the other foreign buyers combined.\n\nMost of these Singaporeans are people who either travel to Johor often for business or those who want a weekend home, according to UEM Sunrise CEO Wan Abdullah Wan Ibrahim.\n\nUEM Sunrise is the master developer of Nusajaya, which is Iskandar Malaysia's administrative capital and billed as the region's crown jewel.\n\nOverall, the greater number of investors flocking to Iskandar Malaysia has helped push home prices up considerably. The cost of bungalows at UEM's East Ledang development, for instance, has surged 44 per cent on average in the resale market since 2011.\n\nBut Malaysia is taking steps to prevent its own real estate inflation from emerging as well as appeasing locals who complain that they can barely afford to own a home.\n\nIn his Budget speech last October, Mr Najib - who is also the co-chairman of IRDA - doubled the minimum amount foreigners must spend on property and raised the capital gains tax to 30 per cent on homes they sell within five years.\n\nJust how these latest rulings will impact the property market in Iskandar Malaysia remains to be seen, especially coupled with Johor's decision to impose a new tax of 4 to 5 per cent on foreigners who buy property - both commercial and residential - in the state to curb speculative fervour.\n\nThis is a big step up from the current rules which require foreigners to pay a one-off fee of RM10,000 regardless of the property's value.\n\nMedini, meanwhile, could be seeing more investment in the coming years, with the zone exempt from the higher 30 per cent property gains tax.\n\nIn fact, Medini - home to a new Legoland theme park and hotel, and Britain's famous Pinewood Studios - has been exempt from property gains taxes since day one as part of the plan by IRDA to drive more investments there.\n\nLooking ahead, the year 2014 could prove to be an even more monumental one for Iskandar Malaysia, should two major initial public offerings (IPO) be launched as planned.\n\nMedini is looking to raise some RM2.5 billion when it eventually goes public. Iskandar Waterfront Holdings, meanwhile, was on track for a US$300 million IPO in the first quarter of this year, but has since delayed it to the end of 2014 to gauge the impact of the numerous property cooling measures.\n\nFrom the government's perspective, it will do all it can to ensure Iskandar Malaysia remains vibrant and attractive to both local and foreign investors, Mr Najib said last month.\n\n\"The federal government is committed to ensuring the success of Iskandar Malaysia and we are working with the Johor government, the private and public sectors, and the people of Johor to ensure the economic region's growth,\" he said.\n\n\"It is vital to ensure that projects are successfully completed on time and within budget to build investor and public confidence in Iskandar Malaysia and attract more investments. This will generate a momentum that will bring about multiplier effects and sustainable economic activities,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, Fine Grain, an Irish private-equity firm arranged by Colin MacDonald, is said to have taken a 30 per cent stake in a new joint venture with Master Contract Services that is buying the property.\n\nAnalysts estimate the proposed 15-storey hotel's 300 rooms could have an average size of 200 sq ft each, assuming a higher plot ratio is granted.\n\nDTZ is understood to have brought in Master Contract as the majority joint-venture partner for Fine Grain for this redevelopment project.\n\nMaster Contract Services has diversified from its original construction business into property development projects. Recently, it partnered Keong Hong Construction to place the winning bid for the former Joo Chiat police station site along East Coast Road, which is designated for hotel use.\n\nFine Grain and Hirsch Bedner acquired 700 Beach - which was previously a small office-home office development known as In-City Lofts - in 2008 for $70 million and pumped in a further $3.5 million to reposition it as a boutique office block.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Marketing for the Reit will start next week.\n\nTo comprise an initial portfolio of OUE Bayfront in Singapore and the Lippo Plaza in Shanghai, OUE C-Reit is the second Reit in six months to be spun off from OUE Ltd, which listed OUE Hospitality Trust (OUE H-Trust) last July.\n\nAnalysts said the yield offered by OUE C-Reit compares favourably against that of its market peers.\n\nSingapore-focused commercial Reits have a dividend yield of between 5.5 and 6.8 per cent, Bloomberg data showed.\n\nThe relatively high yield for OUE C-Reit could have been \"a bit of a sweetener\" to attract investors, said Ng Kian Teck, deputy head of research at Voyage Research.\n\nHe added that there was still interest in dividend plays despite the recent subdued performance of Reits.\n\nSaid Goh Han Peng from DMG & Partners: \"It will be quite a positive thing for (OUE) in the sense that they have a vehicle for injecting more assets in future, a way to recycle their capital.\"\n\nOUE shareholders could stand to benefit too, analysts reckon, as OUE could return the gains made from disposing the assets to the Reit back to investors.\n\nIt may also be possible that OUE will repeat an in-specie distribution of units in OUE C-Reit to OUE shareholders as it did with OUE H-Trust.\n\nOUE shares closed unchanged at $2.49.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
