Higgs managed some US$250 million and invested in energy, metals and agriculture markets, Mr Shear said. \"Over the life of the fund, we made money,\" he said. \"Our closing is largely a factor of redemptions that are happening in the commodity market and lack of stability of our capital.\"\n\nThe fund could have continued to manage money into next year but would have had to cut expenses and restructure the fund, the pair said in the note. This would result in having to change the product that it had initially marketed to its clients as well as its \"strong risk management culture\". \"These changes would have handicapped our performance going forward which would have been detrimental to existing investors and employees.\"\n\nMr Shear and Mr Bourlot are long-time commodity traders. Mr Shear spent 25 years at Morgan Stanley where he helped build the firm's commodity trading business until his departure in 2008. He joined UBS in 2010 for a short time after working for more than a year at private equity fund Apollo Global Management.\n\nMr Bourlot headed agriculture trading at Morgan Stanley before he moved to UBS as global head of commodities. He departed at the end of 2011 after about 18 months.\n\nThe pair left UBS to start Higgs, which was based in London.\n\nIt has been a tough year for the commodity investment community as a whole.\n\nBanks faced unprecedented regulatory requirements and hedge fund investors sought to redeem capital from underperforming funds. Low volatility has plagued markets, adding to sluggish returns.\n\nHedge Fund Research Inc, which tracks funds' performance, said that losses in commodities have forced its HFRI Macro Index down 2 per cent through the third quarter.\n\nLondon-based commodity fund Clive Capital, which primarily traded oil, announced that it was closing in September, citing a lack of investment opportunities. That same month, commodity fund Arbalet Capital, run by 30-year-old Jennifer Fan, announced it was shutting, citing investor redemptions after slack returns.\n\nLarge banks, once active and profitable in the sector, announced this year they would sell off physical commodity businesses, pressured by the US Federal Reserve.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Morgan Stanley announced that it would sell its global physical oil trading business to Russian oil giant Rosneft, after much conjecture throughout the year of what the bank might do with the business in the face of declining returns.\n\nIn July, JPMorgan Chase & Co said that it would exit its physical commodities business, due to regulatory pressure.\n\nEarlier this month, Deutsche Bank said that it would close its global commodities trading business and cut some 200 jobs as it faced increased regulatory scrutiny and pressure to hold onto capital.

The October figure was itself an acceleration over the 1.1 per cent for that in September.\n\nOn a year-on-year basis, total bank lending grew 17.4 per cent, against the 15.6 per cent in October.\n\nOCBC economist Selena Ling said: \"Probably people are turning a bit more optimistic on the outlook for 2014, so we're starting to see loans growth pick up in both year-on-year and also month-on-month.\"\n\nIndustry observers were, in particular, surprised with the resilient growth in consumer loans.\n\nThe loans registered an increase of one per cent over October to $224.4 billion, up from the 0.6 per cent growth registered for the two previous months.\n\nIn year-on-year terms, however, growth continued to slow, from 10.4 per cent in October to 9.6 per cent in November.\n\nHousing and bridging loans, which make up 74 per cent of all loans to consumers, registered a smaller month-on-month growth of 0.6 per cent, from 0.7 per cent in October. Year-on-year, it slowed down to 10.4 per cent, from a 11.9 per cent growth the month before.\n\nEconomists expect this to plateau further.\n\nMizuho Corporate Bank economist Vishnu Varathan said: \"The regulatory tightening so far is not going to pass by without any impact at all.\n\n\"Some of the loans you see are perhaps a drawing down of facilities already agreed to . . . If property prices moderate to some extent, the total amount of loans needed will start to decline slightly.\"\n\nBusiness loans, meanwhile, are expected to pick up more steam in the coming months.\n\nThese grew 2.8 per cent over October to $341.4 billion - the fourth month of accelerating growth.\n\nYear-on-year, they rose 23.3 per cent, up from the 19.4 per cent growth for the month before.\n\nDBS economist Irvin Seah said: \"This reflects the fact that companies are becoming optimistic with regard to economic conditions going forward, and that has prompted this increase in lending to finance their expansion plans.\"\n\nThe momentum in loans growth was powered by the general commerce and business-services sectors.\n\nGeneral commerce grew 5.2 per cent month-on-month in November, up from a 2 per cent growth in October; in year-on-year terms, it grew 35.8 per cent, up from the 28.8 per cent the month before.\n\nLoans to the business-services sector rose 6.2 per cent, from a 0.4 per cent drop in October. These loans also registered a growth of 35.8 per cent over the year, compared with a 28.8 per cent year-on-year increase the previous month.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Without the exemption order, it's an all-or-nothing approach.\"\n\nThis would have meant that consumers could miss out on relevant marketing information from service providers with whom they have existing relationships, such as credit card issuers who offer promotional deals with certain retailers.\n\nMr Leong, addressing the storm of criticism about \"back pedalling\" from consumers and also the consumer body Case, said that without the exemption order, businesses would have \"too many lists\" to check. \"The exemption order is least disruptive to consumers and businesses,\" he said.\n\nWith the DNC Registry and the exemption becoming effective this Thursday, consumers who register their phone number signal that they do not want unsolicited calls, messages or faxes from telemarketers. Businesses must check with the registry - on pain of penalties for failing to do so - to ensure that they do not disturb consumers on the list.\n\nThe exemption introduced last week allows businesses with \"ongoing relationships\" with these consumers - say, as providers of credit cards, insurance or home loans - to send out text and fax messages on their products and services, even to individuals listed on the DNC Registry.\n\nThe exemption, however, does not apply to voice calls.\n\nThe PDPC said the exemption order was crafted from feedback from consumers, businesses and trade groups during the weekly roadshows and workshops held since September. It stressed that the exemption order was not aimed at opening a back door for indiscriminate marketing, as some upset consumers have charged.\n\nThe PDPC added that it was not in organisations' interest to take advantage of the exemption, and that it would not hesitate to \"take enforcement action\" against those who do so.\n\nThe PDPC stressed that companies must have an ongoing relationship with the individual, and that past relationships or encounters from one-off transactions are excluded.\n\nThe message sent out must also relate only to the service the company provides. For example, a credit card company cannot rely on this exemption to notify its customer of a launch of its property development, said the PDPC.\n\nAnother condition tied to the exemption is that businesses must provide an opt-out facility in their marketing message at no extra charge to the recipient.\n\nAs at yesterday, the DNC Registry had amassed 380,000 phone numbers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, while this year is being represented as Mr Annus Horribilis by The Business Times, it has in fact featured several people - Blowtorch Man, Plaid Shirt Man and Samurai Man. All three have more in common than you would have thought possible, for the first man used too much heat, the second urged rioters to cool down and the third lost his cool on the train. At the same time, the person behind the Guy Fawkes mask turned out to be several men, some of whom claim to be part of hacking collective Anonymous, whose cause is associated with the November celebration - a white-knuckled month for corporate Singapore. This culminated in the unsettling discovery of the statements of 647 Standard Chartered private bank customers on then laptop of alleged hacker James Raj Arokiasamy. For all the temptation to bemoan the state of 2013, the year really could have been worse, especially when the state of the rest of the world is considered. In a year that has contained the horror of Homs, the tragedy of typhoon Haiyan and the heartbreak of high school shootings, Singapore's troubles have been more farcical in nature than catastrophic. And as the year winds to a close, the conclusion that is reached is one that is not necessarily intuitive but no less comforting - as a country, we've done alright. Nonetheless, good riddance, 2013.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is timely as the facility's first customer, Jurong Aromatics Corporation (JAC), is set to start up its US$2.4 billion aromatics complex on Jurong Island in the second quarter of next year.\n\nThe name of the winning operator has not yet been disclosed, with JTC Corporation expected to release details of the operatorship deal shortly.\n\nThe award of the operatorship - which had been expected in June this year - comes after JTC called for a two-stage request for proposals (RFP) in December 2011. It subsequently launched the second stage of the RFP last December after shortlisting four potential groups, though it also opened \"prequalification\" to others who had missed the first-stage RFP.\n\nThe 2011 RFP exercise was the second time JTC had embarked on a search for an operator for the underground storage. It had called off an earlier exercise because of the 2008 global financial crisis which delayed petrochemical projects on Jurong Island.\n\nThe first two caverns will offer 480,000 cubic metres of JRC's first phase 1.47 million cu m of storage. They are ready and undergoing pre-commissioning, which will take a couple of months.\n\nThe caverns will be occupied by JAC, which is taking up about 450,000 cu m.\n\nThe entire JRC phase 1 project comprising five caverns - one of 150,000 cu m and four of 330,000 cu m storage each - is set to be completed next year.\n\nThe underground JRC facility - like the planned \"very large floating structures\" to store oil at Pulau Sebarok - is among the measures Singapore is taking to address the shortage of on-shore land to build oil/petrochemicals storage.\n\nLike the just-announced investment in an LPG terminal by Vopak to import alternative liquefied petroleum gas feedstock for Singapore's largely naphtha- fuelled petrochemical crackers, the Jurong 2.0 initiative projects are meant to boost the competitiveness of the oil/ petrochemicals industry in the face of new gas-advantaged petrochemical complexes coming up, such as those in the Gulf States and the US.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rupiah will limp into 2014 as the worst-performing currency in Asia, after ending its worst year since 2000, Bloomberg data showed.\n\nBut this sell-off presents possibilities for bargain hunters, and if 2009 is any guide, the sector to look out for is consumer staples - the products that we can't live without, such as pharmaceuticals and food.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

The counter was the most actively traded, with 780.7 million shares changing hands.\n\nIt closed the day at 10.8 cents apiece, up 2.8 cents or 35 per cent.\n\nYesterday was the first day of trading for HanKore's stock following news of the deal; the counter had been suspended from trade on Monday for the announcement.\n\nHanKore had said it planned to buy environmental water assets of China Everbright Water Investments in a deal that would turn HanKore into CEWI's subsidiary.\n\nCEWI is wholly owned by Hong Kong-listed China Everbright International. The group is involved in construction, environmental protection and alternative energy, property investments and investment holding.\n\nThe acquisition will be paid for through the issue of new HanKore shares to CEWI, priced at 7.03 cents each.\n\nWhile the value of the assets has yet to be determined, CEWI is expected to hold more than 50 per cent of HanKore's enlarged share capital after the acquisition. If not, it can also subscribe for more new HanKore shares in cash at the same price to achieve this holding.\n\nCEWI said it intended to seek a waiver of its obligation to make a mandatory general offer, should the deal be completed.\n\nCurrently, the largest single shareholder of HanKore is its executive chairman, Chen Dawei.\n\nHanKore and CEWI will each appoint an independent valuer to determine the valuation of the assets. The deal is also subject to mutual due diligence being conducted, among other things.\n\nHanKore said it will make more announcements on the acquisition in due course.\n\nThe company is mainly involved in municipal wastewater treatment in China with 11 water plants.\n\nHanKore has turned itself around after a spate of corporate governance and financial troubles between 2007 and 2009, when its former chairman accused the company of committing disclosure breaches and the firm defaulted on its convertible bonds.\n\nAfter a series of developments including debt restructuring (2008), the appointment of new management (2011) and liquidation of some non-performing assets (2011), HanKore successfully recovered from a net loss of 407 million yuan (S$85.1 million) in FY2011 to a profit of over 100 million yuan in FY2012.\n\nPrivate equity firm RRJ Capital, run by former Goldman Sachs partner Richard Ong, bought a 7.85 per cent stake in China Everbright International for US$350 million earlier this month.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A typical carton has 200 cigarettes.\n\nFedEx's activity violated various federal and state laws, including an anti-racketeering statute, the complaint said.\n\nThe city wants FedEx to pay a US$49.5 million fine, equal to US$5,000 per shipment, plus US$2.48 million representing triple the lost tax revenue. It also wants FedEx to hire an independent monitor to ensure future compliance and provide training.\n\nIn a statement, Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx said that it has stopped doing business with known shippers of untaxed cigarettes. \"Through its contracts with customers, FedEx prohibits the shipment of tobacco direct to consumers and believes the claims made by the city are overstated and not founded in law,\" it said. \"FedEx intends to defend this case while continuing to work with authorities to stop prohibited tobacco shipments.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Today's flight, part of celebrations marking the centennial of commercial aviation, will be piloted by Eddie Hoffman Jr, whose father built the aircraft.\n\nAircraft museum Fantasy of Flight's chief executive Kermit Weeks had originally planned to fly a replica of the Benoist airboat which he is building with his team. But unable to meet the New Year's Day deadline, the Benoist airboat will be on display at St Petersburg instead and will still fly sometime in 2014.\n\nMeanwhile, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) - one of the sponsors of Flight 2014, as it is dubbed - has launched a website (www.flying100years.com) which will be updated throughout the course of the year as part of the centennial celebrations.\n\nOn Jan 1, 1914, the first commercial flight was piloted by American Tony Jannus on Thomas Benoist's airboat in front of some 3,000 spectators. The plane was conceived by engineer Percival Fansler who roped in Mr Benoist, a manufacturer. Former St Petersburg mayor Abram Pheil won the right to be the only passenger onboard the historic flight after offering the highest bid of US$400 in an auction.\n\nAt an average speed of 60 miles per hour, the St Petersburg-Tampa Airboat Line - as it came to be known - went on to operate at least two round trips a day between St Petersburg and Tampa carrying both passengers and cargo before the airline shut down in May. Each passenger ticket was US$5 each way, the equivalent of US$115 in 2012 after adjusting for inflation.\n\nA hundred years on, more than eight million people on average travel by air each day while 140,000 tonnes of cargo is carried daily. Iata estimates that a record 3.1 billion people were carried by airlines in 2013, crossing the three billion threshold for the first time.\n\n\"The potential of commercial flight to keep changing the world for the better is almost unlimited,\" said Iata director-general Tony Tyler. \"Growing and sustainably spreading the benefits of connectivity will require the industry, governments, regulators and local communities to keep true to the 'all-in-it-together' ethos that was the bedrock of that pioneering first flight.\"\n\nThis year, Iata projects the industry will chalk up the highest net profit ever, US$19.7 billion, which comes on the back of revenues of US$743 billion.\n\nWill Michaels, president of Flight 2014 Inc, was quoted as saying: \"Kermit will fly sometime in 2014, and we will have another celebration for that. It's kind of like those Christmas presents that don't arrive on Christmas Day. They arrive a few days later, but they're still delightful when you open them.\"\n\nFlight 2014 will be streamed live at www.airlinecentennial.org.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Saying that higher pay means better jobs and new opportunities for workers, he added: \"It also means that we can do more to make ours a gracious city for all.\"\n\nThe official growth forecast for this year stays. Mr Lee said the economy is likely to grow by between 2 and 4 per cent - the range which the Ministry of Trade and Industry cited when it raised the 2013 growth forecast of between one and 3 per cent to between 3.5 and 4 per cent.\n\nThe 3.7 per cent economic growth has turned out to be largely in line with market expectations. Private-sector economists polled ahead of the New Year Message were pretty bullish and had predicted the growth to be at least close to the top end of the government's forecast.\n\nANZ's Asia-Pacific chief economist Glenn Maguire said on Monday: \"We are expecting the 2013 full year Gross Domestic Product growth to be 4 per cent, towards the upper end of the official target, given the ongoing strength in the services sector.\"\n\nStronger growth in the US, China, Japan and Europe should build up greater momentum for Singapore's economy this year, but ANZ has eased its expectations to a more modest 3.2 per cent growth for Singapore in 2014. In reference to the tighter foreign worker policy and global bank borrowings, the bank said: \"Though external demand will be improving, it will be difficult for the Singapore economy to grow at the same rate seen in 2013, as the supply side of the economy is squeezed.\"\n\nOthers point out that rising business costs on the home front could also dampen Singapore's growth prospects this year.\n\nMr Lee sounded more upbeat in his New Year message: \"Provided nothing untoward happens in Asia, I am confident that Singapore will do well. We are investing in our future and developing new capabilities for tomorrow's economy, like 3D printing, data analytics and consumer insights research.\"\n\nSingapore is taking a \"balanced approach\" in letting in foreign workers, he said; it is reducing - not cutting off - the inflow.\n\nHe conceded that companies - small- and medium-sized enterprises especially - are finding it hard to hire the workers they need, but he said the government is helping them to adapt by exploiting technology and becoming more productive.\n\nMr Lee reiterated that Singapore still needs foreign workers to keep its economy running and to build critical infrastructure.\n\nStill, he cautioned that while the US and European economies are stabilising and Asian prospects staying positive, there are problems and tensions, especially in North-east Asia where the disputes between China, Japan and South Korea over historical issues and ownership of various islands have sharpened - and where the stability of the Korean peninsula is a serious worry.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/year-amazing-developments", "site_title": "A year of amazing developments", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA year of amazing developments\n\nTesla electric car, Rosie the Robot, US$37.99 Datawind tablet, devices and apps to monitor health all point to a promising future\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Dec 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWASHINGTON\n\nIF you go by the headlines, the iPhone 5S and Google Glass were the big technology stories of 2013, and Twitter's IPO was the event of the year. The coverage of Glass focused mostly on its privacy implications - not its ability to change the world. And iPhone and Twitter were just more of the same. So we could end the year really disappointed because nothing dramatic seems to have happened on the technology front.\n\nBut look again, at the stories we missed. So much happened, in fact, that I believe we have set the stage for the transformation of entire industries.\n\nSmaller has become cooler in computers. Tablet sales continued to increase and have eclipsed PCs and desktops. The iPad mini, which at first seemed to be a disappointment, was a major success. Prices are continuing to plunge as computing power and functionality grow exponentially. With the US availability of the India-made US$37.99 Datawind tablet, there will be greater downward pressure. It won't be long before Amazon gives you a free tablet for signing up for Amazon Prime.\n\nThis will spell disaster for old-line computer companies such as Dell, Acer and Microsoft.\n\nElectric cars proved their mettle. Despite a disparaging review by The New York Times, which it later conceded had \"problems with precision and judgment\", and negative rumours about safely, range and reliability, Tesla achieved astonishing success. Its customers, who include me, lauded the car. Its stock rose to new heights. Consumer Reports gave Tesla's Model S its highest ranking ever. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reaffirmed its 5-star safety ratings. Tesla has proven the viability of electric cars and demonstrated their superiority. All major car manufacturers are now developing electric cars.\n\nTechnology is improving health care. Quantified Self devices such as Fitbit and Nike Fuelband are becoming widely available. You even see these on the shelves of Apple Stores. Companies are running contests using these devices to encourage employees to get more exercise. Smartphone add-ons such as the Alivecor heart monitor are being prescribed by doctors. Interestingly, Apple recently patented a heart monitor sensor for the iPhone.\n\nOur smartphones are destined to become our prime medical advisers. I expect they will one day chide us to get more exercise, drink less alcohol and watch our calorie intake. They will tell us when we are about to get sick and which medicines to take. We will only turn to doctors for refuge.\n\nRosie the Robot came one step closer to reality. We have long been waiting for robots such as the housekeeper in The Jetsons. These weren't practical to build because of the massive computing power required to understand human words and the sensors needed for the robots to \"see\" and move. Smartphones such as the iPhone 5S now have more computing power than the supercomputers of yesteryear, which fit into large buildings and required water cooling. With the shrinking of computers and sensors and their dramatic drops in price, we can now build the robots we dreamed of.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Google just purchased robotics developer Boston Dynamics as well as seven others. With its self-driving car and these acquisitions, it seems Google sees robots as big business. Amazon is also installing robots made by Kiva Systems to move boxes in its warehouses. Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos said Amazon plans to use robotic drones to deliver goods.\n\nWhether we realise it or not, the robotic revolution is underway. Robots have advanced to the point that for some types of goods, it is cheaper to manufacture in the United States than China. One such robot is Baxter from Rethink Robotics. It has two arms, a face that displays simulated emotion, and cameras and sensors that detect the motion of human beings who work next to it. It can perform assembly and move boxes - just as humans do. It will work 24 hours a day and not complain. It costs only US$22,000. I expect that what is a trickle of manufacturing returning to the United States from China will later in this decade become a flood. I also expect to place my order for Rosie sometime in 2020 and have it delivered by an Amazon drone.\n\nThe space race is on again. In 2013, India launched a spacecraft that is headed to Mars and China landed a six-wheel rover on the moon. China also announced that it is planning to land a man on the moon by 2025. Add to this the success that private companies SpaceX, Virgin Galactic and Moon Express have had and you realise that we are at the cusp of a new era in space travel.\n\nNasa once again has competition from governments abroad so there will be a new sense of urgency. Now it has the advantage of being able to collaborate with entrepreneurs and take advantage of the technology advances that they have created.\n\nNow let me give you the bad news: we still have a few more years of disappointment before we marvel at all these advances. The base of an exponential curve is flat. When it turns upwards, dramatic developments happen, but for the longest time nothing seems to change. This is where we are with robotics, sensors, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, 3D printing and medicine - all of which are exponential technologies.\n\nWe were disappointed, too, when cellphones first came out. They were big, expensive and clumsy. For many years, these were just for the rich - a symbol of wealth and power. Today, there are close to one billion cellphones in use in both India and China. Almost everyone has one.\n\nIn 1977, the president of Digital Equipment Corp, Ken Olsen, famously said \"there is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home\". The first PCs were just for geeks and nerds. Then they were for the rich. About two decades ago, we began to question their usefulness and productivity. Now they are transforming industries, and we can buy a tablet for US$37.99 plus shipping.\n\nMore recently, we became disappointed with solar energy and electric cars. The good news is that this disappointment will soon turn into amazement as well. I know because I live in a solar home and drive a Tesla electric car that I say is a spaceship that travels on land. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The purchase price translates into a hefty $1.5 million per room, possibly a new record for a hotel here.\n\nEarlier this year, Bright Ruby Resources, a company controlled by a family from China, was reported to have paid between $1.4 million-$1.5 million per room for the freehold Grand Park Orchard Hotel, smashing the previous $1.1 million per room record.\n\nBT understands that The Westin Singapore transaction was sealed just before Christmas. The seller is a fund managed under MGPA, a private-equity property investment advisory firm. MGPA's original asking price was $2 million per room, or about $610 million in total.\n\nMGPA is currently owned by asset manager BlackRock, which bought over the firm for an undisclosed sum in a deal that was completed in October.\n\nDaisho Development Singapore director Mamoru Kohda said that Daisho decided to acquire the hotel because of its location and the group's view on room demand in the area.\n\n\"We think that there are not enough hotel rooms here. Also, the Marina Bay area is developing very quickly and has a very strong pool of office tenants, so we will be strongly supported by a corporate clientele,\" he said.\n\n\"We've also worked with Starwood in Malaysia and our working relationship with them was strong, so these are the reasons why we decided to buy The Westin Singapore. Daisho is a long-time asset holder, therefore we will work with Westin for a long time.\"\n\nThe Westin Singapore is the first hotel property to be managed under the Westin brand after the latter left the country more than 10 years ago, in 2001. It occupies levels 32 to 46 of Asia Square Tower 2, with offices taking up the bulk of the remaining floors. It is the first hotel in Singapore to be located within an office building, and has the highest hotel lobby here, on the 32nd floor.\n\nLance Ourednik, general manager of The Westin Singapore, said: \"The sale and ownership change does not affect the daily operation and management of the hotel. The Westin Singapore continues to fly the Westin flag and be managed by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.\"\n\nDaisho's purchase at a record price on a per room basis comes as the Singapore hotel sector faces headwinds such as declining room rates and new completions coming onstream.\n\nHowever, market experts that BT spoke to say that the amount paid represents its expectations for strong future earnings, and a premium for a brand new hotel.\n\nTan Tiong Cheng, executive chairman of Knight Frank, said: \"The hotel is brand new and already fitted out, so that merits a premium. Fitting out a hotel can be very expensive.\"\n\nIts location on the top floors of Asia Square Tower 2 also merits a premium, he added.\n\nAnother market expert, who declined to be named, noted that much of the new and upcoming supply of hotel rooms is largely in the mid-tier section and not the high-end market.\n\n\"In the Marina Bay area, there aren't enough hotels, there is in fact a slight under-supply. And as the area develops and more corporations are located there, demand for hotel rooms could rise and this could, in turn, raise room rates.\n\n\"So Daisho is buying into the future,\" said the veteran industry player, adding that he believes room rates would have to average between $400 and $500 per night for the deal to be lucrative for Daisho.\n\nPublished room rates at The Westin Singapore start at $650 per night for a standard room, but actual rates vary depending on demand and supply, so a standard room can be booked at between $300 and $400 a night currently.\n\nThe Westin Singapore declined to provide occupancy rates so far. Mr Ourednik would only say that it has been \"enjoying good occupancy rates since we opened on 12 November and are optimistic about our business in 2014\".\n\nApart from upscale The Westin Singapore, hotel properties which came onstream this year include Parkroyal@Pickering, Ramada Hotel Singapore and Carlton City Hotel. In 2014, the Sofitel So, The Patina and another hotel under the Holiday Inn Express brand are slated to open.\n\nPreliminary statistics from the Singapore Tourism Board showed that hotel occupancies were at 87 per cent for January to October this year. Luxury hotels were the only category to post an increase in revenue per available room (RevPar), which was up 9 per cent.\n\nRevPar declines were seen in upscale (-12 per cent), mid-tier (-3 per cent) and economy (-8 per cent) hotels.\n\nDaisho currently owns a range of retail, office and hotel developments across Australia, Malaysia and Japan. The total value of its current property holdings exceeds US$1.5 billion.\n\nIts portfolio includes a 510-room hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which is managed by the Hilton Group, the AO retail complex in central Tokyo and Park Hyatt Sydney.\n\nIt is also in the middle of constructing 180 Brisbane, an office tower development in Brisbane, Australia, that is due for completion in 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SingTel, for example, rose 3 cents to $3.66 with 25 million shares traded, adding $91 million to the market's total value traded. In total, the value of trades in index stocks was $787 million - 66 per cent of the whole market.\n\nIn the penny segment, there was a flurry of interest in the shares of water treatment firm HanKore Environment, following the announcement of a deal with China Everbright Water Investments, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed China Everbright International. HanKore's shares, which traded at five cents in September, yesterday jumped 2.8 cents to 10.8 cents with 781 million shares done, contributing $77 million to turnover.\n\nShipbuilder Vard Holdings' shares ended one cent higher at 81.5 cents with 3.2 million shares changing hands after it announced it has secured a contract worth one billion Norwegian kroner. In its \"neutral\" recommendation on Vard, OSK DMG said it has raised Vard's forecast EPS for 2014 and 2015 by 1-2 per cent because the company's 2013 order wins were ahead of OSK's estimates.\n\n\"Over FY13/14F/15F, we forecast Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margins of 6.7/7.6/8.2 per cent,\" said the broker. \"Our earnings estimates for FY14F-15F are 17-23 per cent below consensus, as we have factored in lower margins. We keep our 'neutral' rating with an unchanged target of 85 cents based on 10x FY14F P/E (price/earnings)...\"\n\nPossibly of interest to readers is that Nomura's global strategy team is forecasting that Japanese equities will provide the greatest return of all global stocks in 2014.\n\n\"We think the driver of global equities in 2014 will be EPS growth rather than waning risk or higher stock valuations,\" said Nomura in its 2014 Japanese Equity Outlook.\n\n\"We forecast EPS growth of 19 per cent for Japanese equities in 2014, the highest of all, followed by European equities at 14 per cent.\n\n\"We expect the Topix to reach 1,500 and the Nikkei to reach 18,000 at end-2014 ... further yen depreciation would increase upside ... we estimate that every one yen weakening against the US dollar would push the Topix's EPS up by around 0.65 per cent and the Nikkei by 377 points.\"\n\nThe broker also said that if the government's policies - known as Abenomics - prove successful, the Nikkei could reach 25,000 by 2018.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The trusts will be incorporated as non-profit companies under Section 8 of the new Companies Act, 2013.\n\nThe new initiative, say analysts, will inject a measure of transparency in the country's political funding system. \"Elections are a hugely expensive affair in India, and political parties can't survive without donations,\" Vivek Bhambri, a political analyst, told BT. \"Hopefully by institutionalising company funding, the new measure will help cleanse the system through increased vigilance and transparency.\"\n\n\"Under the new regulations, the original company's contribution would not reflect the name of political parties who are beneficiaries of donations made by them,\" a government official told BT. Those contributing to such trusts, added the official, will be entitled to 100 per cent tax deduction but only when the electoral trusts distribute 95 per cent of their annual contribution to eligible political parties.\n\nThese electoral trust companies would operate only for funding political outfits for their election-related expenses and are not allowed to receive any contribution in cash. They will also have to take the Permanent Account Number of all contributors who are resident Indians, and passport number of non-resident Indian citizens at the time of receiving the contribution. Contributions from foreign citizens or companies will not be allowed for the trusts.\n\nIt is estimated that election expenditure for political parties in India hovers around US$3 billion. The issue of electoral funding by businesses has always been a fraught one in India. Key policy decisions are occasionally seen to be influenced in favour of certain business groups, thereby impacting democratic norms. Recently, the Aditya Birla Group was caught in one such crossfire, although the business house has denied any violations in its donation of funds to political outfits through a trust.\n\nThe cozy relationship between business houses and political parties is of great significance in the current politically-charged milieu. However, it can be traced back to the pre-independence era (before 1947), when India's oldest political party - the 127-year-old Congress (currently at the helm) - started receiving funding from the industrial group of the Birlas. Following this, the Tata group too contributed to the Congress coffers. Consequently, the Companies Act was put in place in 1956 to bring business houses' financial largesse to political outfits under the ambit of law.\n\nHowever, in 1960, the Companies Act was amended by the government to allow companies to donate to political parties only up to a certain limit. The ability of big businesses to influence governments through money power - and their use of \"black money\" (income on which income tax hasn't been paid) to fund such donations - came under attack.\n\nSo in 1969, the Companies Act underwent another amendment to not only prohibit corporate funding but also make it punishable. The Act was re-introduced in 1985 with amendments but this legislation too, suffered from a deficit of clarity on mechanisms available to corporates to contribute to political parties.\n\nDue to the continued general disenchantment with the Companies Act, the industry lobby group - the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India - advocated earlier this year that corporate funding of elections be made more \"transparent and legal\".\n\nFollowing this, it was made mandatory for corporates - under the latest Companies Act, 2013 - to disclose in their profit and loss account contributions made to political parties. The companies also have to furnish particulars of the total amount contributed as well as name of the party to which they are donating.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Japanese retail sales rose by 4 per cent in November from a year earlier while wage earners' total cash earnings rose by 0.5 per cent and factory output edged further upwards.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The solution will be globally launched in January 2014.\n\nUsing a webcam to film a viewer as he or she watches an advertisement, Millward Brown's Link with Facial Coding system tracks points on the face and groups them together according to features such as the mouth, eyebrow and bridge of the nose. The movements of these points are combined to determine the gesture of each feature. The system then provides moment-by-moment analysis of a viewer's spontaneous responses to an advertisement. These can range from like and dislike to confusion and disgust, and are next cross-analysed with results from a traditional survey. For meaningful results, at least 50 persons are needed in a facial coding test. The test can be conducted in person or in the home of the viewer, with his or her consent.\n\n\"This is particularly helpful when it comes to sensitive subjects, or in cultures where it's less customary to give any criticism,\" said Nichola Rastrick, managing director of Millward Brown Singapore.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Technology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

The gauge, which is finance professionals' favourite measure of the US market, has not had a year that strong since 1997, when it rose 31 per cent. If the S&P 500 can match that performance and rise a further 2 per cent today and on Tuesday, 2013 would be one of the five best years for stock investors since World War II.\n\nThe main driver of those gains has been the acceleration of the US economic recovery, with the latest boost coming in the form of the Dec 20 upward revision to third-quarter gross domestic product growth. This week's Standard & Poor's Case Shiller home price index, a manufacturing survey and weekly jobless claims will likely emulate positive surprises in home sales, durable goods orders and jobs data last week.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member in 2 minutes to keep reading.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\nS$9.90\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nsave 50%\n\nYearly recurring\n\nS$4.95\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nBilled yearly\n\n118.8\n\nS$59.40\n\nContinue reading\n\nCancel anytime\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

At the end of the half-day trading session yesterday, the total value of 770 companies listed on Singapore Exchange (SGX) tracked by The Business Times was $899 billion, up from $887 billion at the end of\n\n2012 but down substantially from the close to $1 trillion reached in April and May 2013.\n\nThe benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) closed at 3,167.43 points at end-2013, almost unchanged from 3,167.08 points a year earlier. Singapore was left out in 2013's developed markets rally, with the STI 8 per cent lower than its peak of 3,450 points in May. The bulls sought greener pastures in the United States and Japan, with the S&P 500 up 32 per cent and the Nikkei 225 up 60 per cent for the year.\n\nOn the local bourse, a full-fledged gallop is not expected in the Year of the Horse, with analysts' expectations ranging from a complete standstill to a tiny trot.\n\nSumming up 2013, CIMB head of research Kenneth Ng said: \"It was a tale of two halves. The Singapore market started brightly for the first five months and then weakened as US tapering talk came on.\"\n\nFears of rising rates from the US Federal Reserve slowing down or \"tapering\" its bond purchases since May had hit property counters and conglomerates operating regional businesses. Worries over emerging-market debt added to general market woes, though banks, telcos and some offshore and marine counters such as Ezion Holdings and Mermaid Maritime did well.\n\nFund managers such as Schroders and Baring Asset Management are steering clear of Singapore stocks this year, predicting a real estate slump hitting a number of companies.\n\nUBS Wealth Management regional chief investment officer Kelvin Tay expects home prices to dip by 3 to 6 per cent this year. He told BT that the STI might be \"range-bound\" between 3,000 and 3,300 points this year. In an environment of tapering and global economic growth, exports look to have bottomed out but a recovery is likely to come only after its North Asian counterparts. Domestically, companies are grappling with slower growth, wage inflation and a labour shortage, he said.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, cyclical stocks with revenues leveraged to the global economic growth are likely to perform well,\" he said. \"In contrast, pure yield plays with no growth prospects as well as domestically oriented companies are likely to underperform.\"\n\nCarmen Lee, head of OCBC Investment Research, expects the STI to trade between 3,000 and 3,400 points, \"supported on the low side by undemanding valuations and capped on the upper end by uncertainty on the global front\".\n\nBanks, oil and gas might outperform while property stocks might ease in the first half, she said.\n\nComeback prediction\n\nOthers are predicting a comeback for the local bourse, driven by better earnings, improved global economic growth and a flight to safety amid political and currency turmoil in the region.\n\nPatrick Yau, Citi Singapore's head of research, said he expected 5 to 10 per cent returns this year, from companies finally making more profits as a result of stronger exports especially to Europe. This is compared to tepid growth in the past three years.\n\n\"In 2013, there was hardly any earnings growth, it was -2 per cent among the 60 companies we cover. Next year, there could be 9 per cent due to the base effect. It's the first time in three years where I'm thinking there's some upside,\" Mr Yau noted.\n\nCiti Research has a 3,278-point target price for the STI in 2014, translating to a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.6 times. It prefers oil and gas play Keppel Corp, China-exposed Wilmar International and CapitaMalls Asia, DBS Bank, Keppel Land, as well as industrial plays ST Engineering and Venture Corp, which he reckons can benefit from a strengthening US dollar.\n\nCIMB's Mr Ng is overweight on banks, capital goods and commodities.\n\nSmall-cap specialist DMG & Securities is among the most bullish, with a 3,480-point STI target for 2014. Referring to the penny-stock crash a few months ago, DMG said that \"while some counters got their 'just desserts', many others were punished unjustifiably\". DMG added that the small caps it covers are trading at nine times forecast 2014 earnings while growing more than 20 per cent.\n\nIn the small-cap space, construction sector stocks and S-chips should see investor interest, DMG said. Its top picks for the local market include Eu Yan Sang, King Wan, Lian Beng, Midas, MTQ, Nam Cheong and OSIM.\n\nFor Mr Yau, three sectors now look cheap: commodities, transport and real estate developers. Commodity firms such as Olam International, Wilmar International and Noble Group have been reducing their capital expenditure and cutting costs, so their financial situation might improve even though their outlook is not great, he said.\n\nOil prices are still high and affecting airlines and shipping companies. As for developers which have been hit by higher consumer debt and potentially rising rates, potential upside can come if property prices and volumes do not fall as much as feared.\n\n\"Stocks that are cheap can surprise on the upside if operating factors are better than expected,\" Mr Yau said. \"With the market at an average level, if you want to outperform the market, you have to look at stocks growing much faster, or trading much cheaper than the market.\"\n\nIn terms of valuations, consumer stocks stand out as expensive, DBS Group Research said. They have corrected from valuations at two standard deviations above average after May and are now at one standard deviation above, and could correct further if earnings miss expectations.\n\nOne example is instant beverage maker Super Group, which took a tumble in November after unveiling disappointing Q3 results. Super fell from around $4.50 earlier in the year to a low of about $3. It traded at $3.80 yesterday.\n\nValue fluctuations\n\nSGX attracted a number of new listings in 2013, with notable players in property, energy and resources. The five biggest - SPH Reit, Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust, KrisEnergy, OUE Hospitality Trust and Asian Pay TV Trust - added $8.2 billion to the local bourse.\n\nWhile STI stalwarts SingTel, DBS, Thai Beverage and UOB were among the top five in the most value gained, it was secondary-listed insurance giant Prudential plc that stole the show, adding $13.4 billion to its market value, up 35 per cent from a year ago. The company had recently raised expectations for higher dividends by announcing ambitious growth and cash targets.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum were stocks which suffered the greatest losses in value. All three Jardine conglomerate stocks languished in the bottom 10, along with property counters CapitaLand, City Development, Hongkong Land and Keppel Land. Other property plays - Yanlord, CapitaMall Trust, CapitaCommercial Trust - were not far behind. These companies lost a total of about $25 billion in value last year.\n\nThen there were Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold, the penny-stocks trio which collectively lost $8 billion of market value last October just as suddenly after adding billions of dollars to their values months before.\n\nFraser & Neave, meanwhile, lost $9 billion of market value. This was because of a property business spin-off as well as capital distributions from a business segment review and from proceeds of its Asia Pacific Breweries sale.\n\nSmall, mid-cap plays\n\nIn the small to mid-cap segment, industrial waste gas treatment firm China Environment was an outperformer, rising more than seven times in value. Investors flocked to the firm amid rising profits and China's massive drive to clean up its air pollution problem.\n\nRowsley, Oxley Holdings and SIIC Environment were three notable mid-caps which vaulted over the $1 billion market value mark, with investors seeing these companies double, treble, even quadruple in price.\n\nRowsley is transforming itself into an Iskandar property play, while Oxley has pursued a string of overseas property acquisitions. SIIC Environment has reported significantly better earnings and is pursuing an expansion plan that includes a share placement and additional investments.\n\nAside from the three penny stocks, a prominent crash was bedlinen retailer Aussino, whose shops, until recently, could be sighted at local shopping malls. An unprofitable company over the past three years and on SGX's watchlist, Aussino made the news in mid-2012 when it seized on a hyped-up lifeline. It eyed a Myanmar petrol venture through a controversial reverse takeover deal with US-blacklisted Myanmar tycoon Zaw Zaw. Investor speculation reached fever pitch last Jan 31 when the stock traded at 29 cents.\n\nBut the deal ran into regulatory hurdles last April when SGX did not give the green light. Last July, the Myanmar deal was terminated. SGX subsequently rejected the company's bid for a time extension to meet listing requirements and the company was suspended after Dec 20 pending delisting.\n\nA number of Aussino outlets, such as in Causeway Point and Junction 8, have closed. Its shares last traded at 0.6 cent - down 98 per cent from its peak, and down 96 per cent for the year. Something sobering to remember 2013 by, as you wake up to a new 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That is the reason they are always looking for the next posting, next transfer. I never looked at the next posting or transfer. Come what may, we will deal with it. That's why I say I am self-reliant.\"\n\nFor her, essential to getting the job done is going to the ground - or, as she puts it, to the periphery or grassroots - to get feedback on issues and problems so that they can be corrected at the core.\n\n\"I go to the periphery, whether the home, school or barracks. I don't take reports. It is inherent in women. Man stays at the core, but a woman goes behind the kitchen to find what is wrong,\" she says.\n\nA leader determined to seek solutions will find the time. \"You can be satisfied with 70 per cent . . . but if I want 100 per cent, then I will go to the periphery every day.\"\n\nTime management for her is simple. \"I manage it in a way that I will only do what I can do. For me, time is of essence and of value. I would not do minor things which others can do for me.\"\n\nThe 63-year-old grandmother is unapologetic about social or traditional expectations. \"I've never cooked and cleaned for my husband. It's like being friends, as equals, without any expectations. So he never expected me to do things that a normal housewife does but it was a very organised home because I go for a lot of support systems. I would rather spend on those investments that recover me my time, and with that time I do what I like to do.\n\n\"I would be a misfit if I were a homemaker, like being a round peg in a square hole. But if you put me in an office and make me work 18 hours a day, I would love it because that is the way I am. So without being judgmental, choose your inclination, then be happy in what you do.\"\n\nGreatly influenced by her parents, Prakash Lal and Prem Lata Peshawaria, Ms Bedi and her three sisters attended a convent school in Amritsar in the Indian state of Punjab and were given the best education her parents could afford.\n\n\"Home was an oasis of values, discipline, character building, peace, knowledge, harmony, love - a charging station,\" says the former Indian tennis champion.\n\n\"Children born to wonderful parents have an unequal start in life\" - she offered this profound insight to participants at the recent Iclif Leadership Energy Summit Asia conference in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nHer advice to those who do not get it by birth is to get it through education \"and write their own script\".\n\n\"Absorb and imbibe education in the right spirit. After all, education is a sense of freedom; an education that liberates you helps you to grow in your mind. My education was not exam-oriented but knowledge giving.\"\n\nWhether tackling crime, prison reform, traffic or corruption - she and anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare are now at the forefront of an anti-corruption movement in India - she maintains she would do it all over again. \"There was never any compulsion for me to do anything (I did not want to).\"\n\nHowever, despite offers to run for office, politics holds little interest. \"Politics is divisive. I am nationally accepted today. But the moment I go into politics, I will be partially accepted because I am competing. There have been interesting opportunities, but I didn't take them because it's not my nature.\"\n\nTurning point\n\nBelieving she can achieve more as a social activist, her non-governmental organisations Navjyoti and India Vision Foundation help underserved children, women and men, in education, vocational skills and healthcare.\n\nA turning point in her life occurred when a milkmaid pleaded with Ms Bedi's father to obtain the release of a relative she said was wrongly imprisoned.\n\nMr Bedi managed to procure the help of the police commissioner and the man was subsequently released.\n\n\"The power to undo injustice\" left an indelible imprint on her, and inspired her to apply for the IPS.\n\nOf tremendous satisfaction to her is \"to be in a position of power where you can drive the change\".\n\nMore than anything, she says a leader must be trustworthy. \"Any leader, even if very educated, brilliant, speaks well and is skilled and knowledgeable, without trust he is not reliable.\"\n\nSecondly, he must empower people, as it means he is leading future leaders, creating leadership. \"When you empower people, you are transparent, value- based. Otherwise you would not do it, as you would feel threatened.\"\n\nLastly, a leader's vision must be aligned with his or her organisation's mission.\n\nAsked about her failures, she retorts: \"What is that?\"\n\n\"Failure would be if I had not made the effort. Effort may not give you whatever you want, but that is inherent in the effort. But that's okay so long as I have not failed in not making the effort.\"\n\nContent to lead a simple life alone, she maintains she is not burdened by regrets or anxieties that she ought to have more.\n\n\"As long as I am alive and have good health and am self-reliant physically, I will continue to give. Every day is for giving. Otherwise it will be a waste.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Today, it was massively jammed.\n\n\" I had to compete with the heavy vehicles going to Marina South, the cargo vehicles going to the PSA area, in a two-lane exit,\" he said.\n\n\"Many Shenton Way workers are still on vacation (yesterday). Heaven forbid when they get back to work on Jan 2.\"\n\nAnother lawyer, Peter Madhavan said there was a lack of signage that clearly spelt out where or what landmark buildings new roads such as the Marina Coastal Drive will lead to.\n\n\"There should be signs saying where those new roads lead, which buildings they go to. What's Marina Coastal Drive? Where does it go?\"\n\nOne motorist, who declined to be named, said there were already bad jams when he exited the MCE at 8.15 am yesterday to get to the Marina Bay Financial Centre (MBFC), and that it took him half an hour to get there.\n\n\"Normally, it only takes five minutes to get to MBFC from the old exit,\" he said. \"By 10.30 am I could see from my office at MBFC that traffic at the Central Boulevard exit was really bad.\"\n\nHe noted that there were \"multiple choke points after exiting the MCE into the MBFC area, all within a short distance of each other. MCE traffic into CBD from both east and west is ending up at these multiple choke points. The situation calls for urgent resolution. No serious financial centre can countenance such major traffic congestion.\"\n\nThe $4.3 billion, 5km MCE, which opened on Sunday, will serve as the main expressway connecting traffic travelling between the east and the west. It connects the Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) and the East Coast Parkway (ECP) to the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE).\n\nCommon reasons cited for slow traffic include motorists' lack of familiarity with how the MCE connects with other roads and expressways, as well as road signs that were confusing or unclear.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said that traffic in the MCE tunnel has generally been smooth flowing. But it acknowledged there had been \"traffic congestion and tail-backs at certain locations as motorists adjust to the new expressway and road network configuration\".\n\nLTA said that some westbound motorists on the ECP did not enter the MCE directly from the ECP near Fort Road, but instead proceeded along Sheares Bridge into the city area before heading out to the MCE, thereby adding to the traffic in the city.\n\nThere was also congestion along some key roads at the Marina South area as many motorists chose to enter the CBD using the MCE exits that lead to Central Boulevard, LTA said.\n\nIt said that it will be making road and traffic flow adjustments to ease congestion. For instance, a short stretch of Central Boulevard will be immediately converted from two lanes to four lanes, to facilitate better traffic flow into and along Central Boulevard toward Shenton Way.\n\nMore temporary signs at key approaches will be put up to alert motorists of the road network changes and the best way to get to their destination. It will also put out travel advisories at more locations, and on radio, to guide motorists.\n\nLTA said that traffic wardens will continue to be deployed to help direct motorists, even though some said this slowed traffic more as motorists stopped to ask for directions.\n\nBut one motorist, Fanny Leong, who commutes from Dover to her workplace at Changi, said it was a \"smooth ride\" when she got on the MCE at 6am yesterday as there was very little traffic.\n\nWhen announcing the MCE's scheduled opening on Dec 29, the LTA had said that with traffic currently using the ECP channelled to the MCE, these changes \"will free up valuable land space in the city centre currently occupied by the ECP and allow for future development of the downtown at Marina South\".\n\nLTA said that the MCE will link motorists directly to the heart of downtown Marina South through new connections with Central Boulevard, Marina Boulevard and Maxwell Road. \"This will also enhance the overall quality of the downtown at Marina South as a live-work-play precinct,\" LTA said on Nov 13.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But as the global economy turned on its head, it dragged the asset class down further.\n\nAfter five years of commodity prices being driven mainly by macroeconomic factors such as quantitative easing (QE), industry observers noticed that correlations between commodities and equities started falling this year.\n\nAccording to research by Societe Generale, supply and demand fundamentals accounted for about 80 per cent of commodity price movements on average before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, however, macroeconomic factors gained an upper hand, accounting for about 60 per cent of price movements, and fundamentals only 30-40 per cent.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

The six-week festival will debut in August with Facing Goya, an opera by British composer Michael Nyman that will be directed by Ong himself, and close with the New York experimental theatre company The Wooster Group's version of Shakespeare's Troilus And Cressida.\n\n\"WHAT I see in the arts scene right now is that there is quite a lot of fear among companies of trying to break even. Previously, there was a fear of politics and censorship, but now the fear has turned into a financial one. (I must add, though, that censorship is still practised through the granting or withdrawing of government funding.)\n\nBecause of this fear, arts companies are trying not to overspend. They're making edgy, smaller-scale shows that deal with topical issues. I also see a lot of youth-oriented works.\n\nNow with the Singapore International Festival of Arts, we want to go a different direction. We want to bring shows of a certain scale. We won't shy away from putting a large cast of 50 people on stage, or bringing something like Warhorse to the stage.\n\nAs a given statement, it's not possible for us to break even with shows of that scale, but we're a festival that receives public funding even though we are independent, so we want to do it.\n\nThis year's Three Titans of Theatre series created such excitement among arts lovers. To have Ninagawa, Peter Brook and Simon McBurney present these plays was a big thing. But I say, why can't we have shows like these every year?\n\nI've been doing theatre since the 1980s with plays like Army Daze and Beauty World, and the audiences numbers have stayed the same over the decades. Audience come and go; the scene has expanded, but the audience numbers have stayed pretty much the same.\n\nI want to bring back the people who have stopped coming to the theatre. I used to watch theatre with people I knew in law school. But most of them got married, had kids and stopped going to the theatre. Where are they? Why have they stopped coming?\n\nIf we staged classic plays by theatre greats the likes of Brecht or Pinter - as one finds in places like West End and Broadway - would these adult audiences return to watch sophisticated grown-up theatre? If we staged Waiting for Godot, would they come?\n\nOne issue that worries me still is the lack of suitable theatre venues. When I was looking for shows to come to Singapore for the arts festival, I was quite shocked by the number of arts companies that rejected us on the grounds that our theatre venues are too small.\n\nThe newly renovated Victoria Theatre has a proscenium opening of 10 metres when most theatre companies require a minimum of 12 to 14m. When the Esplanade Theatre goes under renovation from May to October next year, there's no longer a large theatre in Singapore. So finding suitable venues will be a problem we'll face for some time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while the light at the end of the tunnel remains unclear for mid-stream traders, plantation stocks are set to ride on rising crude palm oil prices.\n\nEven as the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) climbed upwards in the first half of 2013, shares for the largest commodity trading firms in Asia - Noble Group, Olam International and Wilmar International - slumped.\n\nOnly in September did more upbeat market sentiments and a recovery in the prices of some commodities such as sugar, together with positive third-quarter results at Noble and Wilmar, give a boost to their share prices.\n\nStill, Noble will end the year as one of the worst performers on the STI for the third year running, its price having fallen 8.23 per cent this year compared to the STI which dropped by a smaller 0.55 per cent.\n\n\"The mid-stream trading companies have performed poorly for most of this year as they had to deal with challenges related to past diversification investments. Noble's and Olam's results have been especially volatile,\" said Macquarie analyst Conrad Werner.\n\nNoble had invested in Brazilian sugar mills in 2010, which returned to the black only in the latest quarter.\n\nOlam has trimmed its capital expenditure and is looking to sell stakes in some of its assets to release cash from its balance sheet.\n\nThe muted economic outlook in the first half of the year also kept investors away from them, said OCBC Investment Research analyst Carey Wong.\n\nBut with a US economy on stronger footing, investors could adopt a more \"risk on\" approach, he opined, upgrading his call on the sector to \"neutral\" from \"underweight\".\n\n\"With the valuations of some of the commodity plays still looking relatively inexpensive, we could see potential upgrades for some of them if there is an over-correction in the market,\" he said.\n\nOf the three stocks, Wilmar is by analysts' consensus the top pick.\n\nSoybean crushing margins in China, which dragged down the group's performance in the past two years, are stabilising, and the current low crude palm oil prices will also benefit Wilmar, said Maybank Kim Eng analyst Wei Bin.\n\nPhillip Securities analyst Nicholas Ong also chose Wilmar for its exposure to emerging markets, such as China, India and South- east Asia, and resilient vertically integrated business model. The stock is a good proxy for the growing food demand in Asia, he said.\n\nBut Macquarie's Mr Werner cautioned that next year is likely to be a tough year again for the three traders.\n\n\"We will have an over- capacity issue in agricultural products. Because they're more exposed to the processing and upstream side than in the past, lower prices affect them more,\" he said.\n\nIt will also be \"a slow arduous process\" for the firms to demonstrate that they can consistently manage their assets better, and bring up their returns to equity, he added. \"For Noble and Olam, they should be getting mid-teens returns. They're around the 10 per cent mark right now.\"\n\nIn the palm oil sector, Golden Agri-Resources also joined Noble in the ranks of the worst performing stocks on the STI this year, with its price down 16.9 per cent.\n\nShare prices for palm plantation firms such as Golden Agri, First Resources and IndoFood Agri had similarly fallen before picking up in the second half, following the trajectory of crude palm oil prices.\n\nAnalysts are positive on the sector, on expectations that higher biodiesel mandates in Indonesia and lower palm oil inventories will lift crude palm oil prices next year. CIMB and Citi Research forecast that crude palm oil will hit RM2,700 (S$1,040) per tonne next year, up 12.5 per cent from the average this year.\n\nBut this will be capped by rising supplies of oilseeds such as sunflower and soy oil, and lower demand for biodiesel in the US and Europe, said CIMB.\n\nRabobank also warned that the implementation of biodiesel programmes in Indonesia and Malaysia remains uncertain.\n\n\"Undoubtedly, biodiesel programmes are among the strongest bullish driver for palm prices in 2014, but delays in implementing these mandates and a decline in crude oil prices could dampen the impact of these programmes and reduce bullishness,\" it said in its outlook for agri-commodity markets in 2014. The bank is neutral on palm oil prices.\n\nFirst Resources and Wilmar are analysts' favourites in the palm oil sector, for their young estates and strong business model respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Thursday, Wall Street hit yet another all-time high, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average finishing at its 50th all-time high for 2013 and the S&P 500 ending at its 43rd record close.\n\nEqually likely, however, is that prior to the Dec 18 announcement, the STI was in danger of sinking to its worst close for the year and that since then, funds have seized the chance to prop the index up in order to pad their own performance.\n\nWhatever the case, volume has been depressed for more than three months now and so it was again this week. In yesterday's session some 3.1 billion units worth $793.3 million were traded, of which $358 million or 45 per cent was done in the 30 index components.\n\nMeanwhile, the penny stock segment which has been in the doldrums for about two months has started to show signs of life. It also has a new leader - Charisma Energy, which has topped the actives list for several days now. In yesterday's session, the counter fell 0.4 cent to 7.8 cents with 622 million shares traded. Others in heavy play included Otto Marine, Albedo and HanKore.\n\nIn its Dec 23 Economics & Strategy Viewpoint, Schroders said investor concerns next year will shift from growth and \"tail risks\" to rising bond yields as the US economy reaches take-off velocity and the Fed reduces monetary stimulus.\n\n\"Whilst the growth picture should continue to improve in the US and the UK, the eurozone and Japan are expected to struggle to reach a self-sustaining growth path,\" said Schroders. \"The emerging markets picture is more mixed, but overall a firm US dollar and weaker commodity prices will weigh on the region.\"\n\nIt added that growth in China is likely to be subdued as reforms are introduced to bring more market discipline into the banking sector and that higher bond yields will squeeze the equity risk premium.\n\n\"If US Treasury yields were to rise to 4 per cent, the equity risk premium would go back to the 2007 level and would challenge equity markets as global growth was considerably stronger before the crisis,\" said Schroders. On Thursday, the 10-year US Treasury yield stood at 3 per cent.\n\nIn its Dec 23 \"Back to the Economy\" report, Rabobank said it is optimistic for the US economy because substantial progress has been made in the recovery process after the Great Recession.\n\n\"The excess supply in the housing market has largely disappeared and house prices have been rising since February 2012,\" said Rabobank.\n\n\"Residential investment has rebounded and is actually contributing to economic growth. The US has also been very aggressive in recapitalising the banking system. Consumers have been deleveraging significantly and have benefited from rising house and stock prices. What's more, employment growth has picked up in recent months and that should ultimately lead to income gains.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Our strength is in integration (of the components).\"\n\nMr Wong said that even though Japan would provide Keppel with a high-quality option, it would not be costly. \"They (the Japanese yards) are pretty hungry right now and they are prepared to work on a long-term basis with us.\"\n\nHe also appeared unfazed by the prospect that collaborating with Japanese partners would allow them to build their own capabilities and they may consequently become Keppel's direct competitors over time. Mr Wong said he was not concerned by that possibility for now, even though he noted that the Japanese rigbuilders have been expanding their presence in Brazil, as it would be difficult for them to gain much ground in an already competitive sector.\n\nThe topside of the drillship, which is due to be completed in 2016, will be built in Singapore, with its hull to be built by a Japanese sub-contractor.\n\nSingapore's two rigbuilders - Keppel and Sembcorp Marine - have had to deal with increased competition with Chinese yards offering cheaper and more attractive financing options. To address this price competition, Keppel has had to focus on quality, while remaining competitive.\n\nMr Wong illustrated that the general price of jackup rigs has increased marginally from about US$180 million in 2010 to about US$215 million in 2013 and that it has managed to keep price increases in check because Keppel has good and efficient methods of building, in addition to the large volumes it builds which allow it to reap the benefits of economies of scale.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 27, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGET ready to do the Samba. It's no secret that Singaporeans love to travel, and not even thoughts of a 30-hour flight crammed into economy class will dampen their enthusiasm.\n\nNo surprises for guessing the next hot destination for 2014 then - travel agents are already betting on South America as the top destination for adventure seekers this year.\n\n\"South America is definitely a big one for 2014 especially in the run-up and aftermath of the World Cup,\" says Nikki Pang, regional marketing manager at Lightfoot Travel, a luxury tour operator.\n\nShe adds that while people may not travel specifically for the tournament which takes place from June 12 to July 13, \"it's definitely on people's radar a lot more due to all the hype, and we've seen our enquiries to South America increase significantly in the past six months.\" Peru and the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador are the two most popular destinations, with Brazil a close third.\n\nHotels.com's managing director Abhiram Chowdhry notes that the recent World Cup match draw has prompted an increase in accommodation searches for many of the host cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Brasilia. \"As we draw closer to the event, we can expect an even bigger booking boom,\" he adds.\n\nBut South America isn't the only hot destination for next year. Kathmandu, Sapporo, Hanoi and Siem Reap top the list of TripAdvisor's 2013 Travellers' Choice Awards for Destinations on the Rise in Asia.\n\nTripAdvisor's spokesman Jean Ow-Yeong explains that these travel spots have seen the greatest increase in positive traveller feedback and interest in the past year. \"They provide inspiration for travellers planning their 2014 trips,\" says Ms Ow-Yeong.\n\nCurrency and travel patterns\n\nTravel experts also say that countries which have always been a favourite with Singaporeans will still continue to be popular.\n\nAustralia is one such example, especially with the Aussie dollar at an all-time low since 2010. Japan is another hot spot, again because of the weakening yen. But rather than the usual Tokyo, Kyoto or Hokkaido, travellers are heading out to lesser-known islands such as Shikoku and Okinawa. Mr Chowdhry says, \"In 2014, we can expect currency fluctuations to continue to have an impact on travel patterns.\"\n\nTravel insiders also expect film locations such as New Zealand to be popular again, now that The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug is in theatres.\n\nMr Rufus Tan, director of product development at Quotient Travelplanner has been getting enquiries about travel to Iceland. He admits he isn't completely sure why Iceland is gaining in popularity, but \"I think that exposure in recent films could have played a part.\" The more prominent movies featuring Iceland include Thor: The Dark World, the Game of Thrones series, which was partially filmed in Iceland and also the upcoming movie Noah, starring Russell Crowe. \"Even though Noah has not been released, shots of the filming have already been tweeted by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky, which would have generated interest in the country,\" says Mr Tan.\n\nGoing around in a country on a coach bus may be the easiest way to get around, but Buck Low, chief executive of Prime Touch and Feel, the online arm of Prime Travel & Tour, believes self-drive tours will be even more popular next year.\n\n\"With cars being so expensive in Singapore, the urge to get behind the wheel takes on a more entertaining form with self-drive holidays. For first-time holiday drivers, it is good to start with a drive in Japan, and move on to Australia, the US and Europe where the transport networks, courteous drivers and relatively shorter distance between towns will make anyone feel it is even easier driving there than in Singapore,\" says Mr Low.\n\nSelf-drive tours allow you to pick the stops and more importantly have control of your time. There's no need to wake up at 6am to hop onto the coach - you can even sleep in till 10am if you wish. Perhaps this desire for leisurely travel is also what's fuelling the new-found popularity of train travel and cruises.\n\nHajar Ali, founder of luxury travel company Urbane Nomads says train travel is becoming more fashionable as it represents the golden age of travel when it was a glamourous affair. \"There is a greater interest in slow travel, which includes cruises,\" she adds. \"Luxury trains, steamships and traditional ships offer the romance of the old style of travel with contemporary luxury.\"\n\nChan Brothers' marketing communications manager Jane Chang notes that rail holidays are \"definitely up and coming with an average 20 per cent year-on-year increase in demand\". The agency's rail holidays in Europe feature high-speed trains conveniently operating from one city centre to another, allowing travellers to make the most of their trip with the flexibility of extension in each city.\n\nRegional appeal\n\nOn the cruise front, fly/cruise travel to Alaska, as well as river cruising along European rivers, such as the Danube, Seine and Rhine will continue to be popular next year, says Kelly Toh, marketing manager at CTC Travel.\n\nCloser to home, \"regional cruises will take off even more now that the new Marina Bay Cruise Centre can berth larger ships,\" says Alicia Seah, marketing communications director for Dynasty Travel.\n\nFor some travellers it is not the destination that matters but the experiences and, naturally, the more exotic the greater the bragging rights.\n\nNext year, Urbane Nomads' Ms Hajar will launch heli-skiing trips in Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Russia, Greenland and Iceland. Heli-skiing is off-trail, downhill skiing that is accessed by a helicopter, versus a ski lift. \"For those new to heli-skiing, there will be lessons and their first heli-ski runs in Canada,\" says Ms Hajar.\n\nShe is also planning for gourmet-skiing trips to Japan, Italy and Switzerland. \"These trips will combine skiing with meals at some of the best restaurants and private ski chalets,\" she says.\n\nWhile hotels remain the main accommodation choice for most travellers, others are picking more unusual ones.\n\nAlan Chang, managing director for Airbnb Northeast Asia says, in 2014, he expects travellers not just to be making their holiday choices by destination, but by accommodation type, too. \"At Airbnb, we've been seeing a growing trend of travellers opting for more unusual spaces, like castles, boats and igloos,\" he says. Airbnb's most popular property is a treehouse in California, and the site now has about 300 treehouses listed globally.\n\n\"This shift is ultimately changing the way that people travel. As people get more adventurous, they search out an authentic local experience where they can really immerse themselves in a culture and feel the soul of a place,\" says Mr Chang.\n\nWith hot destinations and new travel experiences lined up, all that is left is to decide what to pack.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some 60 per cent of all corn, soya beans and wheat exports exit the country via the Gulf.\n\nThe Mississippi River is already closed for the season north of the Iowa-Missouri border.\n\nA major lock repair project will close lock 22 near Saverton, Missouri, for about two months beginning in early January so barge operators have moved most of their fleets south of that point already.\n\nThe Illinois River typically remains open through the winter, but low water on the Mississippi River has created a river navigation bottleneck near St Louis.\n\nDespite shippers loading less grain on each barge so vessels ride higher in the water, several tows have grounded in the area over the past two weeks, prompting sporadic river closures for emergency dredging by the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThe Mississippi River gauge at St Louis was at minus-1.47 feet (-44.8cm) at midmorning on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe river was forecast to rise slightly by Friday before steadily falling to minus-3.6 feet over the next two weeks, just a foot above the 24-year low hit January.\n\nIce was also likely to build more quickly on the lower-than-normal rivers. \"I haven't heard of any new problems today, but if it stays this cold for three or four days it's going to be a challenge getting in and out of the Illinois River come next week,\" a barge broker said.\n\n\"Fortunately we had some warm weather last week and some moisture which allowed that river ice to get cleared up before this cold snap.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Many in the industry are bemoaning it, but it did result in two positive outcomes.\n\nFirst, the advent of creative tech solutions for productivity: 2013 is the year that online reservations became mainstream along with app-based ordering and payment. There are even wait-list and automated payment solutions on the way.\n\nThe second positive outcome is a renewed focus on attracting and retaining talent. Our group has approached this by adopting a staff-first strategy and focusing our efforts on building a culture of hospitality, training plans and career development. Many companies stop at defining a customer experience, but we also work to define our ideal employee experience. Happy staff are key to creating the great customer experiences that have helped us stand out from the crowd.\n\nBut the biggest impediment to the industry is real estate-related, and it is a challenge that is very structurally ingrained. The average lease term in Singapore is three years, which is insufficient to allow an entrepreneur to plan and build a long-term business. Compare this to the 10 to 15-year leases in New York and London. Even entrepreneurs attracted by government grants or a good initial rental offer in Singapore can run into continuity issues once the initial lease term is up.\n\nAn emerging trend I've noticed this year is the quest for authenticity. We're seeing more concepts that draw heavily from the heritage of a location. We were one of the first to do this when we opened The White Rabbit in a restored 1940s chapel and we did it again this year with The Black Swan, bringing a beautiful old Art Deco space back to life. It's something I hope to continue seeing in Singapore even as we become more cosmopolitan.\n\nInterestingly, the Central Business District is evolving into something more than a pure work environment. It's quickly becoming an area for lifestyle and the success of The Black Swan is testament to that. I'd love to see our CBD achieve the vibrancy of those in cities like Sydney and London and I really hope we can be a catalyst for that.\n\nFood-wise, \"fusion\" is still a dirty word but, ironically, it has returned as a dominant style of cooking. Melding East and West flavours has produced some truly remarkable cuisine in the past year and I think it's high time the concept is fully re-embraced.\n\nIn terms of drinks, we've found that the Singapore consumer has become as adventurous as he is discriminating. Cocktails are now more spirit forward, with geographically distinctive spirits such as pisco, mezcal, sake and bourbon starting to take the spotlight.\n\nAs for the group, The Black Swan will continue to be our focus for the first half of 2014. The concept has been successful for lunch and dinner but our vision for it remains as an iconic all-day destination. To that end we'll be launching high tea and late night supper offerings soon.\n\nLater in the year we'll be working on adding a charming new dimension to The White Rabbit by shaping The Rabbit Hole into a beautiful, colonial-style garden bar with lush landscaping.\n\nLastly, Tanjong Beach Club will be launching a new seafood barbecue programme created in collaboration with The Naked Finn. Its focus will be on sourcing and serving the freshest and very best seafood. Tanjong Beach Club sits on Singapore's most picturesque stretch of beach and a seafront dining option will complete that amazing experience.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

South Korea's three biggest shipping companies all face a cash crunch as three trillion won of bonds are due for repayment in the next two years amid mounting losses from a global slump in rates to carry cargo.\n\nHahn & Co, which will also invest 100 billion won into the venture, will control a company that has 36 vessels that Hanjin Shipping operates under long-term contracts.\n\nHanjin Shipping's debt-to-equity ratio will fall to 673 per cent from 987 per cent at the end of September, once the venture starts operations as early as in April, according to the statement. The 1.4 trillion won debt associated with the 36 vessels will be transferred to the venture, it said.\n\nKorean Air Lines, an affiliate of the shipping company, said last week it will provide 100 billion won in loans, on top of the 150 billion won it gave to Hanjin Shipping in October. KAL will also buy 400 billion won of new shares the shipping company plans to sell next year.\n\nHanjin Shipping has about 1.56 trillion won of debt, including bonds and loans, coming due next year and 1.08 trillion won in 2015, according to the company. At the end of September, it had cash and near-cash items of 382 billion won.\n\nHahn & Co currently manages about 850 billion won in assets in cement, auto parts and electronics components. The fund dropped a bid in February to buy Korea Line Corp, the country's second-biggest operator of bulk ships that was then under court receivership. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The \"tsunami of price hikes\" is expected to place a significant strain on consumers and businesses, although the Malaysian government maintains that short-term pain is necessary for the longer-term good.\n\nCritics, however, see Putrajaya as the profligate consumer that has maxed out on its credit card and overdraft facilities and now expects the public to shoulder the burden.\n\nHow the price increases will impact consumer demand, which has helped boost growth in years past, remains to be seen. But consumers and businesses are undoubtedly approaching 2014 with a great deal of trepidation, the official projections of 5-5.5 per cent GDP growth notwithstanding.\n\nAfter putting off the tough decisions in the past 2-3 years to win public support ahead of the 13th General Election in May this year, the incumbent Barisan Nasional (BN) federal government has had to introduce a slew of price increases to ward off a sovereign ratings downgrade and higher borrowing costs.\n\nGiven the scheduled implementation of a 6 per cent goods & services tax (GST) in April 2015, Putrajaya does not have much time to push increases through as they will be even more unpopular after the tax kicks in.\n\nTo add to the recent extension of the early retirement age and the implementation of a minimum wage, fuel prices were raised by 20 sen a litre in September, but another hike or two cannot be discounted in 2014.\n\nPower tariffs will jump by an average 15 per cent in January and most toll roads are also due for scheduled increases. Logistics players and school and public transport operators are demanding higher fares as well.\n\nPutrajaya has argued that the measures are essential to whittle down the enormous fuel subsidies that put a great strain on the budget deficit (expected at 3.5 per cent of GDP in 2014) and soaring public debt (just under 55 per cent of GDP). To be sure, fuel and power tariffs continue to be heavily subsidised even after the latest round of increases.\n\nSince 1997, Malaysia's national oil company Petronas has foregone an astounding RM200 billion (S$77 billion) as a result of oil and gas subsidies, underscoring the great misallocation of resources as well as how long such populist policies have been in place even though the economic costs had been growing.\n\nThe Kuala Lumpur municipal council has also been guilty of foot dragging. Saying property assessment charges had not been reviewed in 21 years, it has proposed an increase - which in some cases is as much as 600 per cent - earning the ire of residents.\n\nComing all at once, Malaysia's lower and middle-income earners will have to bite the bullet especially hard even though the government has assured them of targeted aid. The consumer price index (CPI), slightly over 2 per cent in 2013, is forecast to climb to 3.8 per cent in 2014.\n\nWith household debt already at 83 per cent of GDP - one of the highest in emerging economies - a hike of 25-50 basis points in the key overnight policy rate of 3 per cent could be detrimental if borrowers are already stretched.\n\nAnd businesses, long dependent on subsidies, may strain to weather the challenges. A weaker ringgit - currently at about 3.22 to the US dollar but projected to slide towards 3.3 next year - will worsen the anticipated chain reaction although it should benefit exporters.\n\nEquity investors have already shied away from sectors perceived to be hurt most by the price hikes, including steel manufacturers, retail, real estate investment trusts (Reits) and building materials.\n\nEven so, the benchmark FBMKLCI is expected to see gains in the low teens in 2014, having gained about a tenth year to date. Year-end targets next year range from 1,910 to 1,970 points. The KLCI is trading at the 1,840 level.\n\nInitial public offerings performed reasonably well in 2013, albeit after a slow first half owing to political uncertainties over the general election.\n\nThe public share sale of long-haul budget airline AirAsia X was one of the biggest for the year, raising US$310 million. But despite waiting out the GE, it still fared miserably and is one of the worst-performing IPOs, about a fifth below its offer price. Founder Tony Fernandes put it eloquently recently, when he said: \"The shares are in the toilet.\"\n\nThe largest IPO, Westports Holdings, raised about US$680 million, but has also been lacklustre. It remains little changed from its RM2.50 offer price.\n\nSmaller IPOs proved far more rewarding, yielding generous double-digit percentage gains. They include developer Matrix Concept, oil & gas player UMW Oil & Gas, and condom maker Karex.\n\nThe IPO pipeline in 2014 is expected to be reasonably interesting with two large property companies - both \"Iskandar plays\" - looking to raise funds for future expansion.\n\nBut how soon government-owned Iskandar Investment Bhd (IIB) and Iskandar Waterfront Holdings (IWH) go public remains to be seen. IWH's corporate restructuring exercise has been time- consuming and, in the interim, new property measures have been introduced to cool the market.\n\nGrowth in the property sector after 8-9 solid years - particularly in more recent years - is anticipated to be more pedestrian in 2014 following the introduction of higher property taxes, more stringent financing and limits to easy financing schemes.\n\nHow much property speculation or flipping contributed to the robust demand will be better known in the coming months. Prices in the secondary market could slip if these buyers lack holding power but in the primary market, prices are not expected to slip given the sharp escalation in power tariffs, raw materials, land, labour and nearly everything else that goes into building a house.\n\nThe most popular real estate hubs - Klang Valley, Penang and Iskandar Malaysia in Johor - will be closely watched. Foreign interest in Johor has never been as keen, and as the property hotspot in the past two years, Iskandar will take the bulk of the spotlight when a flood of residential units are delivered in the coming 12-24 months.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Under extreme circumstances, reserves can be used to provide finance.\n\nThis makes the four countries \"very exposed in the event of a sudden stop (in foreign financing)\", said Mr Wade.\n\nIn contrast, the \"thrifty three\" comprising South Korea, Taiwan and the Philippines have improved their deficit position and will also stand to benefit from export recoveries to the US and Europe, he added.\n\nA reduction in the US monetary stimulus would also affect emerging market equities, as a stronger US dollar leads to lower commodity price and therefore the performance of equities in these markets.\n\nThis could delay the recovery in emerging market equities, said Mr Wade.\n\nBut he added: \"It should be said though that the current underperformance by the EM equity market is either building in a future appreciation of the USD already, or is getting overdone.\"\n\nGlobally, higher US treasury yields would reduce the equity risk premium as the gap narrows between equity and bond yields.\n\nTo counter the more challenging equity markets, Schroders expects companies to step up share buy-backs next year to reduce their equity base and boost earnings per share.\n\nInvestors will also move away from bond-proxies in the equity market next year, as higher treasury yields cause them to reconsider the merits of utilities and Reits, said Schroders.\n\n\"Economic recovery should bring increased focus on cyclical stocks such as industrials and materials.\n\n\"Against this backdrop, the search for yield will continue, but will be less of a driver of markets as investors buy into the upswing and focus more on rising activity,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One's drinking habits (both from preferences and from actual consumption patterns) will influence choices, but it would be fairly general practice to fill up the spaces emptied by the year's consumption, and also to provide a reasonable estimation of increase in drinking volumes.\n\nThe investment angle combines pleasure and business, killing two birds with one stone! Right now, it has taken a bit of a hit - a downturn amounting almost to a crash. But then, we forgot Newton's law of gravity. What goes up must come down!\n\nChampagnes\n\nBuying ahead and laying down my favourite non-vintage Champagne aperitif, Laurent Perrier NV, allows me to serve (and drink) non-vintage champagnes which taste like its vintage brother. Many guests have mistaken it for vintage, giving me great pleasure to reveal that it is only a simple NV. Vintage champagnes when laid down undergo development and maturation in the same way as vintage wines. What is not as well realised is that this also applies to non-vintage champagne when laid down. A non-vintage champagne drunk soon after it is released is youthful, and fresh, sometimes on the sharp side.\n\nLay it down for at least a year to develop and the result is astonishingly good. It takes on the character of vintage champagne - less sharp, more rounded and fuller, and riper on the palate. It will not taste the same as a vintage champagne laid down the same period, but it will certainly taste better than a freshly released non-vintage champagne.\n\nAvailable cellar space is needed however, but that is a small price to pay for years of more pleasurable drinking ahead. It is also more than made up by the money saved at time of purchase - NV is cheaper than Vintage!\n\nRed wines\n\nThis is the time to stock up on Bordeaux. Prices are well down, in some instances up to 40 per cent. It amounts to a stock market crash in wine! Most affected are the First Growths, especially Lafite which in the dizzy days of the boom reached stratospheric heights. Still expensive but within striking range for wine lovers.\n\nFor the less ambitious, all the lower Growths are also more affordably priced and that is where good opportunities lie, for example, the top Seconds such as Pichon Lalande, Cos d'Estournel, Ducru Beaucaillou, and Leoville Lascases. Leoville Barton has always been sensibly priced even in the halcyon days of the Bordeaux boom. Owner Anthony Barton's reply to my congratulating him on his very affordable pricing was \"that is what my wine is worth\".\n\nOn the right bank, similar price drops have occurred except that the recent promotion of Angelus and Pavie from the rank of Premier Grand Cru Classe 'B' to Premier Grand Cru Classe 'A' has seen significant price increases, keeping them in line with those of Cheval Blanc.\n\nUnfortunately for burgundy lovers, Burgundies have gone the other way. They have followed the current trend in computer storage, using \"iCloud\" storage! Up in the clouds. DRC being in a class by itself, top favourites such as Comtes de Vogue, JF Mugnier, Christophe Roumier, Armand Rousseau, Dujac, Ponsot, Leroy, etc, are now where Lafite was. Top burgundies have always commanded their own market - productions are small, minute in comparison to those of First Growth Lafite, for instance, and demand is insatiably high. \"You have to wait until someone in my current list of customers dies\" is the answer I once got from a top Burgundian grower. The other unwelcome development is that mainlanders have discovered Burgundy. And they are not only after the wines, they are after the vineyards!\n\nThere are some less well known Burgundian producers well worth looking at, such as Folin Arbelet, Fourrier, Robert Groffier, as well as newer ones such as Domaine Roche de Bellene and Philippe Pacalet. They are making good to excellent wines at affordable prices. It would be tantamount to wine snobbery to ignore the excellent wines from the big Burgundian houses of Drouhin, Faiveley, and Jadot. These may be called Maisons but in reality they are more Domaines than Maisons. Their vineyard holdings are very extensive, and include all the Premiers and Grand Crus they produce. I cannot commend them too highly - indeed they are firm fixtures on my annual vineyard-crawl list.\n\nRhone wines constitute another group which is much neglected, to our loss. Apart from a small group of stratospheric-priced wines, eg \"La-Las\" of Guigal and the Reserve de Celestins of Henry Bonneau, both Northern and Southern Rhone wines are reasonably priced. Furthermore, Rhone wines, both North and South, full-bodied, lush and fruity are admirably suited to our spicy cuisines. Hermitage La Chapelle and Jaboulet were made famous worldwide by the annual visits of the late peripatetic Gerard Jaboulet. Jaboulet is now owned by the Frere family but not withstanding the inevitable change in wine style, their wines still command attention. Guigal and Chave in Northern Rhone, Beaucastel, Domaine Pegau and Ch\u00e2teau Rayas in Southern Rhone. Rayas proper is scarce and very expensive. Highly recommended is their second wine, Pignan, and their Southern Rhone, La Pialade.\n\nFinally, it is time to discover the excellent and well-priced wines of Italy and Spain.\n\nThe advent of Sassicaia heralded the \"Super-Tuscan\" fashion. Sassicaia was rapidly followed by Solaia, and the rest is history. It brought home to the wine consumer that some excellent wines were also to be found in Italy. This also gave impetus to the rest of Tuscany, Montalcino in particular, and to the other main wine region, Piedmont. Tuscany's Chianti Classico DOCG, and Piedmont's Barbera and Dolcetto are for daily drinking and at excellent prices. Worthy of long-term cellaring are the top Chianti Classicos - eg Castello di Ama, Isole e Olena and the rest. In Piedmont, names such as Giacomo Conterno, Gaja, Altare, Paolo Scavino, Sandrone, Voerzio, Clerico, and Guido Fantino command attention. Barolos are not cheap but the Barberas and Dolcettos are, and delicious too.\n\nSpain is still somewhat of well-kept secret. Vega Sicilia still stands out but has been joined by Pingus also from the Ribera, and Alvaro Palacios, who now manages three properties spread throughout the breadth of Spain - the family winery Palacios Remondo in the Rioja, his own Alvaro Palacios in Priorato, and his trail-breaking Descendientes de Palacios in Bierzo.\n\nVega's other Bodegas, Alion in the Ribera, Pintia in Toro, and now the newest member of the Vega family, Macan in the Rioja, are producing lovely fruity-soft and reasonably priced wines which are delicious and highly recommended. As indeed are all the wines of Palacios and Pingus, but be advised that their top wines are Spain's most expensive wines!\n\nWe are well spoilt for choice, and perhaps more knowledgeable about selection than in most other Asian cities. In the words of a famous English wine critic and wine writer, Singapore wine consumers are more educated than in other Asian cities.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Eurekahedge Japan Hedge Fund Index, which tracks about 80 funds, returned 24 per cent in the 11 months through November, heading for the best year since the Singapore-based researcher began compiling data in 2000.\n\nJapanese hedge funds swung from the world's worst performers in 2012 to the best as the central bank's reflation efforts put the benchmark Topix index on course for the biggest increase in 14 years and weakened the yen by 17 per cent versus the dollar. Assets at the Japan-focused funds tracked by Eurekahedge increased US$451 million in the second half of 2013 - the most since the six months ended August 2011.\n\n\"Japan has come full circle for a lot of investors,\" said David Baran, co-chief executive officer of Tokyo-based Symphony Financial Partners. \"Many investors felt that all Japanese companies were bad investments, which was patently inaccurate. Those investors who have dismissed Japan have been motivated to come back to the market by Abenomics.\" Mr Baran's US$300 million SFP Value Realization Fund returned 73 per cent this year through November, net of fees, according to a letter to investors.\n\nThe Eurekahedge Japan Index returned 6 per cent in 2012 - the worst performer among five geographical region indexes tracked by the data provider. This year's 24 per cent return through November compares with a 7 per cent advance in the global index, an 8.5 per cent return by the measure tracking North American funds, and a 12 per cent increase in the Asian index excluding Japan.\n\nMr Abe took office in December 2012 pledging a three- pronged strategy of aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and deregulation that investors have welcomed. The Topix has surged 49 per cent this year, heading for the best year since 1999, when it gained 58 per cent.\n\nBank of Japan (BOJ) governor Haruhiko Kuroda, whom Mr Abe picked for the job, began a monetary easing campaign of unprecedented size in April, pledging to double Japan's monetary base by boosting purchases of bonds and other financial assets to generate 2 per cent inflation in about two years.\n\nThe slide in the yen's value helped bolster sentiment among large Japanese manufacturers to the highest level since 2007, a quarterly BOJ report on Dec 16 showed.\n\n\"Abenomics has played a major role in the comeback of Japanese hedge funds but, equally important, is the gradual return of risk appetite among investors in the US and Asia,\" said Ed Rogers, CEO of Tokyo-based Rogers Investment Advisors. \"The best-performing Japanese hedge funds have been a significant source of alpha for many years, and 2013 will hopefully serve as a catalyst for growth in the industry in 2014.\" (Alpha refers to returns in excess of those of the benchmarks.)\n\nAmong the best performers were warrant funds, which benefited from an increase in convertible-bond sales. Japanese companies raised a combined 631 billion yen (S$7.6 billion) through convertible-bond offerings this year, the most since 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStratton Street's Japan Synthetic Warrant Fund returned 359 per cent this year through November. The fund, which is offered in yen, benefited from a pick-up in the convertible bond market, according to the company.\n\nThe fund seeks to create geared exposure to the Japanese equity market through investments in asset-swapped convertible bonds and listed and over- the-counter warrants in companies that are quoted on Japanese stock exchanges, according to the UK manager.\n\nThe US$33.3 million Northwest Warrant Fund Ltd also benefited from the revival in Japan's convertible-bond market. It returned 208 per cent this year through November, according to the firm.

Globally, 28 per cent of Internet users accessed unauthorised sites on a monthly basis. This proves that piracy is a local and global concern.

It's important to note that we are not ending Mosaic - while Mosaic Music Festival will see its final edition in its current format (where a series of gigs are spread over 10 days), the Esplanade will continually look into presenting music experiences in a different way. (We are) a mission-driven organisation that aims to bring the arts to diverse segments of audiences; evolving Mosaic is part of our mission.\n\nWhen the Festival began in 2005, it presented a diverse range of music in one festival, something which was not available in Singapore at the time. (Back then) Singapore's music scene was vastly different - it was focused on the mainstream and nowhere near as vibrant. Mosaic was the first to bring such a large and diverse range of performers and genres to Singapore, and we have helped to develop music audiences here. Now that there is a growing number of commercial concerts and festivals, it is a good time for the Esplanade to look at how we can contribute to the music scene in ways that others are not or cannot.\n\nThe vibrancy of the music scene today is not about one major festival or the individual concerts; (it's) the collective result of these various efforts.\n\nSingapore's music scene has been growing - with many new concerts and festivals being announced just this year alone. It is good that artists are beginning to see Singapore as an important audience for their music. They will continue to perform here as long as they are presented in a way that best brings out their music and talent, and if their shows here continue to do well.\n\nFor us, Mosaic has always been about the music. The concert experience that we offer has always put the music at the forefront, putting the music in the best possible setting. Ten years on, Singapore's music scene is now vastly different and we can now think about how to push the boundaries even further, to offer audiences an experience with music at a much deeper level. Mosaic has allowed audiences to experience a wide range of concerts over the years. We have contributed to the diversity of music available in the Singapore calendar, and this World of Music can be seen in our 2014 line-up.\n\nThe highlights of Mosaic will be captured in 10 years of Mosaic Moments - an exhibition that we are putting up to celebrate the festival's 10th year. Mosaic highlights come alive again in the form of videos, audio clips and photographs.

This means that when Asia-Pacific stocks increase one per cent, Singapore stocks increase 0.81 per cent. Unlike correlation, beta not just takes into account the strength of the direction of the relationship between two variables but also the magnitude.\n\nSingapore's stock market is the most sensitive to movements in Asia-Pacific markets, followed by world markets (beta 0.8) and Europe (0.65). This is followed by the US (about 0.64), Malaysia (about 0.61) and Hong Kong (about 0.59). It is least sensitive to Japan (about 0.31), Indonesia (about 0.32) and Thailand (about 0.36).\n\nIllustrating SIMSCI futures as a good hedging tool for Singapore and other Asia-Pacific indices, SGX said that selling one SIMSCI futures contract while staying invested in 25,000 units of the Nikko AM Singapore Straits Times Index exchange-traded fund (STI ETF) from Nov 29 to Dec 13 resulted in a net gain of $170, compared with a loss of $3,250 without the futures hedge. Futures allow investors to lock in a price today for an asset to be delivered at a future date.\n\nIn that time period, the Nikko STI ETF declined from 3.22 to 3.09. The SIMSCI index futures price fell from 368.11 to 351.01. Going short (selling) on one futures contract on Nov 29 and covering (buying it back) on Dec 13 would mean a gain of 17.1 index points at the contract multiplier of $200 per index point, or $3,420.\n\nSIMSCI futures are also highly correlated with other Asia contracts such as MSCI India Index futures, MSCI Thailand Index futures and SGX CNX Nifty Index futures, SGX added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition, Takenaka will also carry out road improvement works and build a 68-metre Ramp Control Tower to facilitate air traffic control.\n\nWith a passenger handling capacity of 16 million per year, T4 will boost Changi's existing passenger handling capacity which now stands at 66 million passengers each year.\n\nAside from T1, the Japan-based firm was also involved in upgrading works at T2 in 2006 and at T1 last year. Beyond Singapore, Takenaka has played a part in constructing various airports in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, including Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi and Narita International.\n\n\"There were very competitive bids from local and international companies with vast experience in the construction of major infrastructure projects,\" said CAG chief executive Lee Seow Hiang. \"The past few months have seen an intensive process for the CAG team, as it went through several rounds of evaluation. Takenaka Corporation delivered the best overall proposal, which included an innovative construction methodology.\"\n\nFour other firms took part in the tender, said CAG, without divulging names.\n\nTakenaka will work with the consortium that is drawing up design plans for the terminal, a team that includes SAA Architects, Benoy, AECOM Singapore and Beca Carter Hollings & Ferner (SEA).\n\n\"Being fully aware that Changi Airport shall continue to stay ahead as the air hub of the region, we are committed to deliver T4 of excellent quality, on time and with optimum safety,\" said Shoichiro Shibuta, general manager of Takenaka Corp (Singapore).\n\nFaced with increasing competition from other airports in the region, Changi is beefing up capacity and working at improving the passenger travel experience to remain the air hub of choice.\n\nThe new terminal will roll out more automated initiatives such as self-service check-in, bag drop, immigration clearance and boarding gate services, partly in a bid to better utilise manpower resources in a tight labour market.\n\nTo cut boarding time, CAG has already started to introduce self boarding gates in T2, as part of a trial run, which will be extended to more gates and terminals from April next year.\n\nMeanwhile, planning for a fifth terminal has already begun, with an eye on having Terminal 5 operational by the mid-2020s. In addition, a $1.47 billion mixed-use development, dubbed Project Jewel, will offer airport operations, retail and leisure offerings as well as hotel space when it opens in 2018.\n\nAnd a third runway will be introduced by 2020 to help tackle runway congestion as passenger traffic continues to grow on an annual basis, underpinned by robust travel demand in Asia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/new-exemption-do-not-call-guidelines", "site_title": "New exemption to Do Not Call guidelines", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNew exemption to Do Not Call guidelines\n\nFirms may SMS/fax existing clients on related products, with opt-out option\n\nAngela Tan\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 26, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] A week before the Do Not Call (DNC) provisions come into force on Jan 2, the authorities yesterday released a set of advisory guidelines and a new exemption in a 44- page report carrying different scenarios, in a bid to clear any confusion and ambiguity.\n\nThe Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), which aims to safeguard individuals' personal data against misuse, said the new exemption order will also kick in next Thursday. It will enable organisations to send text or fax messages on related products and services to customers and members with whom they have an ongoing relationship, without the need to check the DNC Registry.\n\n\"Ongoing relationships\" between the individual and the sender could be in the form of commercial or non-commercial relationships, the commission said.\n\n\"These may include, for example, a subscription, membership, account, loan or comparable relationships involving the ongoing purchase or use of goods and services supplied by the sender to the individual. Relationships which may arise from regular participation in the activities of an organisation, such as students of a school or a donor with a standing order to regularly donate to a charity, may also be considered to be an ongoing relationship between the individual and the sender.\"\n\nThis means that a bank or a credit card company, for example, will be able to send its existing credit card holders telemarketing messages about related services like a rewards programme for credit card holders. Banks will be allowed to alert their existing home loan customers on a new refinancing package.\n\nTelcos will be able to message their existing home fixed-line broadband service subscribers new promotional packages with text messages like \"Enjoy faster speeds with fibre broadband at only $X a month\".\n\nBut as the new exemption order does not apply to voice calls, organisations are still required to check against the DNC Registry before making telemarketing calls to promote related products and services.\n\n\"In that regard, the Commission considers there to be a distinction between receiving this information in the form of a voice call, text message and fax message. As a voice call requires the immediate attention of an individual receiving it, it is arguably the most intrusive medium. On the other hand, text and fax messages do not require immediate attention, and individuals may choose to access them at a convenient time,\" the commission said.\n\nOn the exemption, the PDPC said it recognised that consumers may wish to continue receiving information in a minimally intrusive manner, via text or fax messages. It has also received feedback from organisations on their customers' expectation for such messages to be sent.\n\n\"Without this exemption, individuals may miss such messages if they are registered with the DNC Registry, and if the organisation, which they have an ongoing relationship with, did not obtain clear consent to send telemarketing messages to their telephone numbers,\" the PDPC said.\n\nTo rely on the exemption, organisations are required to provide information in their messages on how consumers can opt out of such messages, and allow consumers to opt out using the same medium by which the message is received. Upon receiving an individual's opt-out request, organisations must stop sending such messages to that individual within a specified time frame.\n\n\"The exemption order provides greater flexibility for organisations to serve their customers in a minimally intrusive manner, and the DNC Registry advisory guidelines aim to help them along with respect to telemarketing,\" said PDPC chairman Leong Keng Thai.\n\nThe new exemption and guidelines will complement those that were issued in September on key concepts and selected topics on the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA).\n\nCome Jan 2, provisions under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the PDPA) requiring companies to check the Do Not Call Registry before sending telemarketing messages to consumers with Singapore telephone numbers via voice call, text message or fax will become effective. The Data Protection Provisions will kick in only on July 2, 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tycoon, 77, bought the firm in 2002 from its former owner businessman Wan Azmi Wan Hamzah and took it private the following year.\n\nAt the time, it was making RM50 million on sales of RM250 million a year. Between 2008 and 2010, however, the firm grew its earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation at a whopping compounded annual growth rate of 54 per cent. At the time of its relisting in 2011, Bumi Armada was making RM350 million on sales of RM1.24 billion a year.\n\nFor the nine months to end-October 2013, Bumi Armada made RM452 million on sales of almost RM2 billion. The firm is valued at close to RM9 billion today. More to the point, it has become a global player with operations spanning five continents.\n\nIt is the third largest operator of offshore support vessels in South-east Asia with the most modern fleet in the region. Bumi Armada is also the eighth ranked FPSO operator by fleet size globally.\n\nIn Monday's announcement, the firm said that it signed both contracts with British independent oil producer EnQuest plc and other partners to work on the Kraken field in the North Sea.\n\nThe contracts are for eight years, each with options for 17 annual extensions with the FSPO to be delivered to the Kraken field by 2016.\n\nSome 140 million barrels of heavy oil are expected to be extracted from the Kraken oil field over 25 years, Bumi Armada said.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Enquest specialises in extending the life of old oil fields and focuses on the North Sea. It is expected to spend about US$6.4 billion on developing Kraken.\n\nWith earnings at 25 times current prices, it isn't clear if Bumi Armada's shares are fairly valued. Analysts think not, however. A review of 11 analyst reports showed an average \"price target\" of RM4.59. For the record, its offer price upon listing was RM3.15.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Straits Times Index was the worst-performing developed market in 2013, dropping 9.5 per cent since Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said in May that bond purchases may be reduced on signs of sustainable US recovery.\n\nCapital has been fleeing South-east Asia as investors seek higher returns in North America. The market value of Singapore shares fell 5.6 per cent to US$567 billion this year as at Monday as 10-year US bond yields climbed to a two-year high in September, making dividends from the city-state's real-estate investment trusts less attractive.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose to a record after the Fed announced last Wednesday it was cutting stimulus, citing optimism about the labour market.\n\n\"Property companies will do badly, particularly in Singapore where there's a perceived housing bubble,\" said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-based fund manager at Schroders, which oversees about US$420 billion.\n\n\"If higher bond yields cause property prices to fall, there's an immediate impact on earnings. Cost pressure on banks will also increase as bond yields rise.\"\n\nThe Singapore's STI traded at 1.38 times book value as at Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 2.49 for the Philippine's PSEi Index, 2.37 for Indonesia's Jakarta Composite Index, 2.34 for the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index, and 2.07 for the Stock Exchange of Thailand, the data showed.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee said after its Dec 17-18 meeting that it will cut its US$85 billion in monthly purchases of Treasuries and mortgage-backed bonds, also known as quantitative easing, to US$75 billion in January.\n\nThe central bank will reduce asset buying in US$10 billion increments over the next seven policy meetings before ending the programme in December 2014, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists last Thursday.\n\nThe STI surged 94 per cent from when the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate in December 2008 to this year's peak in May.\n\nReal estate and financial companies account for 47 per cent of the STI, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSingapore's biggest property companies were among the worst performers in 2013, with City Developments Ltd plunging 25 per cent and CapitaLand Ltd falling 18 per cent. Jardine Cycle & Carriage Ltd, an automotive distributor that gets about 89 per cent of sales from Indonesia, fell 27 per cent to lead declines on the benchmark equity gauge.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund lowered its growth target for Indonesia, South-east Asia's biggest economy, to between 5 per cent and 5.5 per cent this year and next after 6.2 per cent expansion in 2012.\n\nSingapore's GDP is expected to grow 3.9 per cent in 2014 after an estimated 3.8 per cent rise this year, according to a quarterly survey released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore this month.\n\n\"Singapore's neighbours have not been doing so well, particularly Indonesia, where many of the property buyers in the city come from,\" said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of Asian multi-asset strategy at Baring Asset Management Ltd, which oversees about US$60 billion.\n\n\"The Singapore government has also been implementing tough property measures because they don't want housing prices to go through the roof.\"\n\nSingapore home prices increased at the slowest pace in six quarters in the three months ended Sept 30 after the government introduced new curbs to cool prices in Asia's second-most expensive property market.\n\n\"There's no driver to spur investor interest in Singapore,\" Baring's Mr Do said. \"The recent penny stock crash isn't really helping the case for investing in Singapore.\"\n\nAbout US$6.9 billion was wiped from the market value of three commodity companies over three days in October, prompting an investigation by the monetary authority and Singapore Exchange Ltd.\n\nThe average value of shares traded daily on SGX in the three months through December fell to S$1 billion, compared with S$1.24 billion a year ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBlumont Group Ltd, which invests in minerals and energy, soared more than 1,000 per cent this year through the end of September to lead gains on the FTSE Straits Times All-Share Index. The stock plunged from an all-time closing high of S$2.45 on Sept 30 to 7.8 Singapore cents on Dec 24.\n\nAsiasons Capital Ltd, the second-best performer, slumped 96 per cent from its record close of S$2.83 on Oct 1 through Dec 24. LionGold Corp tumbled 91 per cent from its S$1.725 peak on Aug 29 after deals to acquire gold assets fell through.\n\nThe plunge in shares prompted the bourse to seek approval to establish circuit breakers to minimise market volatility.- Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

So this year did not need to be excellent to seem much better than the last. In any case, 2013 didn't turn out to be outstanding. But was it better?\n\nThe sinking of the Costa Concordia in January gave 2012 a melancholy start. With 32 deaths, the incident put the cruise industry on the defensive and under intense political scrutiny. Then in July last year, the MSC Flaminia episode claimed three lives and showed several northern European coastal countries in their worst light as they refused to provide a place of refuge until the ship was eventually towed to a German port.\n\nUnfortunately, 2013 has also not been a good year where accidents are concerned. The Philippine domestic ferry St Thomas Aquinas sank after colliding with a cargo ship, the Sulpicio Express 7, in July. At least 116 people died.\n\nIn June, there was a stark reminder that large containerships can still have structural problems. The 8,110 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) post-panamax containership MOL Comfort suffered a crack amidships in bad weather about 200 nautical miles off the coast of Yemen and finally broke into two. The crew of 26 abandoned ship safely but the two sections of the ship eventually sank.\n\nThere have been, as in every year, numerous other accidents. As the year closes, we have had a nasty accident involving a barge, the Bolivian-flag barge Heng Hong 168, which capsized in Singapore waters about three nautical miles west of Horsburgh Lighthouse. At the time of writing, four of the 11 crew are still missing. The others have been rescued, with one making a near-miraculous escape from the upturned hull of the barge after being trapped inside for four days.\n\nThis incident underlined the fact that seafarers still face dangers on an everyday basis. This is something the rest of us should bear in mind, especially at festive times like Christmas.\n\nThis has been an especially difficult year for the Filipinos, who account for about a quarter of all seafarers on the international trading fleet. The devastation caused by November's Typhoon Haiyan was a big blow for some and gave cause for worry for many more. On the positive side, it does appear that the shipping industry responded well and provided effective support.\n\nThe shipping business also seems to be in a slightly better state than a year ago. Overall confidence levels in the industry rose to their highest in more than three years in the three months ended November, according to the latest Shipping Confidence Survey from international accountant and shipping adviser Moore Stephens.\n\nThe firm also noted encouraging news on freight rates, and evidence of an increased willingness to invest. But the good news was tempered by concerns over overtonnaging, operating costs and the cost of regulation.\n\nOne respondent to Moore Stephens' survey said: \"We clearly see an upswing in the markets when talking to various people at various locations in the last couple of months. There is, for the first time in a long while, a general feeling of optimism. Furthermore, the economic indicators, both small and large, all over the world, are pointing in the direction of recovery. We cannot expect it to reach the same levels as in 2007/2008, but a sustainable level of confidence is much better than skyrocketing markets - because the higher you climb, the lower you might fall.\"\n\nSaid Moore Stephens' shipping partner Richard Greiner: \"The findings of this latest survey provide more good news for the shipping industry. It is now 15 months since we recorded a decline in shipping confidence. There is an old adage which says that confidence is contagious. If that is true, shipping certainly seems to have caught the bug.\"\n\nMr Greiner added that there were still too many ships for the cargoes available on many trades. There was not the ready access to bank finance \"that many would like\". Operating costs were expected to rise over the next two years, following their decline last year. Crew wages were \"only moving in one direction\". The cost of keeping up with regulatory compliance had become a big-ticket item while liability insurance premiums were on the increase.\n\nHe concluded: \"These problems will not go away. But the prospect of being able to fund them properly is brighter now than for some time. Expectations of improved rates in the dry bulk sector are now higher than at any time in the last five years, while in the tanker market, the mood is at its most bullish for two-and-a- half years. In the container trades, things are meanwhile holding up well. In short, there should be more money about next year, although no shortage of things to spend it on.\"\n\nSo perhaps it is fair to say that the industry bids farewell to 2013 in better shape than it welcomed it. But it is an industry that is relearning the cyclical nature of its trade.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/jpmorgan-tops-muni-funds-despite-outflows", "site_title": "JPMorgan tops in muni funds despite outflows", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nJPMorgan tops in muni funds despite outflows\n\nIts Intermediate Tax Free Bond Fund outperforms most of its rivals\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Dec 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nNew York\n\nIN a record year for US municipal mutual fund withdrawals, the JPMorgan Intermediate Tax Free Bond Fund shrank more than 25 per cent. Yet it has still outpaced almost two-thirds of its peers.\n\nInvestors yanked US$1.4 billion as at Nov 30, after it started the year with about US$5.3 billion, the second-biggest outflow as a percentage of assets among muni funds larger than US$1 billion, according to Morningstar Inc. The fund's 1.4 per cent loss in 2013 up to Dec 20 compares with an average drop of 1.9 per cent for its peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nThe fund weathered the withdrawals by choosing higher-quality, frequently traded debt, said Rick Taormina, head of muni strategies in New York. Half the fund's top 12 holdings as at Sept 30, including North Carolina general obligations, either had AAA ratings or were refunded, Bloomberg data show. Top-rated bonds are beating the US$3.7 trillion local market this year for the first time since 2008, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.\n\n\"Anytime we see markets really in turmoil, we tend to have better years,\" said Mr Taormina, who oversees about US$30 billion of local debt at J P Morgan Asset Management. \"The funds are built and managed to handle these kinds of flows because we know advisers and clients are looking at multiple asset classes. We're very conscious of having enough liquidity within the portfolios.\"\n\nMutual funds control about 17 per cent of the market for city and state debt. Individuals haven't discriminated in pulling US$59.2 billion from the investments this year, the most since at least 1992, when Lipper US Fund Flows data begin. The five vehicles with the most withdrawals as a percentage of assets include a long-term fund, an ultra-short option, as well as choices focusing on high-yield and investment-grade bonds, Morningstar data show.\n\nThe current streak of 30 straight weekly outflows began in May as investors bet that a stronger economy would lead the Federal Reserve to curb its bond buying, a decision it announced last week. Bondholders are betting the move will cause interest rates to rise, especially on securities with weaker ratings.\n\nDetroit's record bankruptcy in July and mounting concern that Puerto Rico's shrinking economy will crimp its ability to repay its debt propelled withdrawals. Munis are set to fall this year for the first time since 2008, Bank of America data show.\n\nOne segment of the market that has benefited is short-term debt, which tends to be penalised less than longer-maturity securities when investors bet on rising interest rates.\n\nAlpine Woods Capital Investors' Ultra Short Tax Optimized Income Fund has earned 0.5 per cent this year as at Dec 20, beating 69 per cent of its peers, Bloomberg data show.\n\nYet the fund, which started the year with US$1.7 billion in assets, faced US$467 million in outflows, the biggest proportion among the open-end funds tracked by Morningstar.\n\nSteven Shachat, who manages the fund from Purchase, New York, declined to comment.\n\nOther funds experiencing similar outflows trailed competitors. OppenheimerFunds' AMT-Free Municipals Fund and Eaton Vance Management's National Municipal Income Fund have lagged behind 94 per cent and 99 per cent of similar funds this year, respectively, Bloomberg data show. They experienced the fourth-largest and fifth-largest outflows relative to their size, Morningstar data show.\n\nDuring the past five years on average, OppenheimerFunds' holdings beat 99 per cent of comparable funds, while Eaton Vance's long-term investments outpaced 95 per cent.\n\n\"I'm holding onto the bonds that hurt me the most, because If I sell them now, I never have the chance to get back\" the price declines, said Tom Metzold, co-director of munis in Boston at Eaton Vance, which oversees about US$28 billion in local debt. \"I'm willing to experience greater volatility in the short term for five-year type of numbers.\"\n\nOppenheimerFunds managers weren't available to comment, said Kristen Prestano, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company at Prosek Partners.\n\nTom Weyl, director of muni research at Barclays plc, and Michael Zezas, chief muni strategist at Morgan Stanley, predict another year of negative returns for local debt in 2014. The securities have dropped 2.9 per cent this year, Bank of America data show.\n\nBonds in the lowest investment-grade tier have plunged 8.2 per cent, according to a Bank of America index.\n\nNext year will be another \"very volatile year\", Mr Taormina said. Bonds rated A to AA will probably fare best as their extra yield cushions against rising interest rates while, at the same time, the ratings aren't so low that any worsening of situations in places such as Puerto Rico will hurt the debt, he said.\n\nThe JPMorgan Intermediate fund has historically defeated its competition during volatile periods. It outperformed 75 per cent of peers in 2007 and 82 per cent in 2008, the first full year of the recession, Bloomberg data show.\n\nTop holdings as at Sept 30 included zero-coupon bonds issued by Adams County, Colorado, that have been refunded, and North Carolina general obligations maturing in March 2017. The state has top credit ratings.\n\nThe market closes today for Christmas and again on Jan 1. Issuers have set US$3.1 billion of long-term bond sales in the next 30 days, the least in about a year.\n\nThe interest rate on AAA 10-year munis is 2.95 per cent, compared with 2.93 per cent on similar-maturity Treasuries.\n\nThe ratio of the yields, a measure of relative value, is about 101 per cent, less than its five-year average of 102 per cent. The smaller the number, the costlier munis are in comparison.

By Lee Meixian\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Dec 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN one fell swoop, Tigerair has struck strategic alliances with three airlines, a move aimed at accelerating the budget airline group's business growth in key Asian markets without overstretching its resources.\n\nAnalysts by and large see the development as financially prudent. Saddled with receivables from its poorly performing Singapore, Australia, Indonesia and Philippines carriers, Tigerair's minimal equity investment in its tie-ups is its way of expanding its footprint without putting pressure on its balance sheet, they say.\n\nThe question uppermost in investors' minds is how effective this strategy will be in helping the struggling group to turn around. Or are the tie-ups more \"meow\" than \"roar\" as one analyst suggested?\n\nTwo of Tigerair's three partnerships - its interline agreement with India's SpiceJet and joint marketing deal with Singapore Airline's (SIA) Scoot - are non-equity strategic alliances, meaning they do not involve any financial investment, at least for now. Rather, they are more focused on sharing resources and capabilities to create a competitive advantage.\n\nThis less formal, lower commitment partnership works to Tigerair's favour because it does not require hefty fund and infrastructure investment, and mitigates the risk of entering a new market like India.\n\nAs UOBKayHian analyst K Ajith puts it, there is \"little to lose and a lot more to gain\".\n\nTigerair's most substantive partnership of the three - its joint venture with China Airlines to set up budget carrier Tigerair Taiwan - is the only one involving an equity investment, albeit a slight one of NT$200 million (S$8.4 million), for an initial one-tenth stake in the JV.\n\nThis stake pales in comparison to Tigerair's much larger stakes in its other affiliates, but group CEO Koay Peng Yen said during a conference call on Dec 16 that Tigerair could discuss increasing its commitment later. Meanwhile, it remains an \"asset-light\", \"win-win proposition\" to expand its \"paw print\" into the North Asian market.\n\nIn terms of infrastructure, Tigerair Taiwan is expected to operate 12 aircraft in two to three years, starting with three A320s from Tigerair Group's 10 A320s slated for delivery during the fiscal year beginning April 2014.\n\nThere is also talk that Tigerair eventually plans to acquire up to another 39 per cent of the JV to reach the maximum stake allowed for a foreign shareholder, possibly by converting aircraft to equity.\n\nWhile UOB's Mr Ajith sees the initial stake as too small to make a meaningful contribution to Tigerair's bottom line, he believes the airline could benefit from leasing aircraft to the JV. \"Twelve aircraft by the end of 2016 is substantial, although it remains to be seen if the full number will be leased from Tigerair,\" he said.\n\nThis income is on top of the branding, licensing and marketing fees which Tigerair will receive from the JV that will operate under the Tigerair brand.\n\nCAPA, or the Centre for Aviation, reckons Tigerair's entry into Taiwanese skies will help to better distribute its fleet all round. Tigerair Singapore has taken most of the group's aircraft deliveries in 2013, leading to a rapid increase in capacity that has hurt load factor, yields and profitability, CAPA said. \"Having the option of placing some aircraft with a new affiliate will alleviate the pressure in Singapore and should improve the overall outlook for the group,\" it added.\n\nBut Credit Suisse analyst Timothy Ross, in jest, called the move \"really only a paw in the water\" and \"more meow than roar\". \"While we applaud China Airline's involvement in what we view as a growth element of Asian aviation . . . we do not perceive it as 'moving the needle'.\" He noted that while the North Asian market is under-penetrated by low-cost carriers, Tigerair Taiwan would still only account for 4 per cent of Taiwan's short-haul market and 1 per cent of the total market, even with five flights a day per aircraft.\n\nStill, if it's any comfort, China Airlines chairman Sun Hung-hsiang has given Tigerair Taiwan one year of operation to break even and told media that it will \"absolutely\" turn in a profit after three years of operation.\n\nMeanwhile, in India, while market observers welcome the greater connectivity that accompanies Tigerair's interline deal with SpiceJet, some were disappointed for the latter since it puts to rest speculation that Tigerair might be injecting equity investment into the debt-laden Indian carrier.\n\nSpiceJet, India's second-largest LCC, has been on a frantic hunt for a suitable foreign investor to acquire a minority stake to help it pay off its debts and expand its fleet, against a background of escalating costs, currency weakness and passenger slowdown.\n\nSL Narayanan, group CFO of Sun Group, which owns SpiceJet, told CNBC that the agreement would \"feed the travellers into each other's aircraft and in the process improve load factors. That is about it at this point in time.\"\n\nThe hope is that higher loads will translate into more income for Tigerair, but even if it doesn't, there are other benefits to the deal.\n\nFor one, with Tigerair passengers' access to India on SpiceJet's network, Tigerair is able to worry less about bilateral seat restrictions which currently allow Indian and Singaporean airlines to fly only 29,400 seats weekly between the two countries. These are mostly used up by SIA and its regional arm SilkAir.\n\nSecondly, this interline agreement gives Tigerair a first-mover advantage over its rival, AirAsia, in the India-South-east Asia market.\n\nThe agreement comes just months before AirAsia is set to launch a low-cost domestic airline in India, with a base in Chennai. The interline deal will be crucial in pre-empting AirAsia from ambitiously adding more cities from where it can connect passengers to destinations through its Chennai hub, India's Business Standard reported.\n\nThere is also the possibility that the partnership could later be extended to Tigerair's five other existing India routes and support the launch of new routes to India from Singapore or Indonesia, where Tigerair Mandala is based, CAPA said.\n\nOf course, the possibility that the interline agreement could be a precursor to an eventual equity stake acquisition cannot be ruled out, it added.\n\nThe potential synergies from the joint marketing deal with Scoot is harder to determine, but again, the obvious aim is to boost its top and bottom lines.\n\nCo-marketing with Scoot on parallel routes could remove excess capacity and subsequently improve passenger loads and yields. A better branding alongside Scoot could also enable it to raise fares and thus sales, market observers say.\n\nJoint ticket sales would also increase from the $740,000 collected in the quarter ending Sept 30, 2013 under their interline agreement.\n\nTo sum up, the partnerships - to help Tigerair expand its network, achieve greater cost-savings and build a stronger regional brand presence - appear to be a shrewd move.\n\nBut investors will need to be patient. As Credit Suisse analyst Annuar Aziz put it: While these initiatives are potentially positive for Tigerair, they have a long gestation period.\n\nleemx@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And it is, exceptfor one minor detail - it's made of human hair.\n\nAfter the initial jolt of surprise, curiosity takes over as you take a close look at what ink made from pulverised human hair looks like, as well as the texture of the green tea paper it's painted on.\n\nUS-based Chinese contemporary artist Gu Wenda's 27-metre long work for the upcoming Art Stage Singapore in January has a blockbuster air that befits international art fairs but as he shares, his aim is really to show how classical Chinese traditional art can be made contemporary and relevant to the art world today.\n\n\"Chinese ink has a long history and it's really the equivalent of oil painting in the Western art world. There's no other format in Chinese art with its unique aesthetics and cultural identity,\" explains the 58-year-old artist who was one of the leaders of the '85 avant garde art movement in China - an artistic response to the decades-long Cultural Revolution which purged China of its traditions.\n\nGu has been trying to widen the application of Chinese ink and calligraphy as much as possible since then.\n\n\"It's crucial to bring ink out of its traditional context so that it continues to be relevant to current society,\" he says, adding that he's also tried to do that with calligraphy and landscape paintings.\n\nFor the period between 1999 to 2001, Gu has been experimenting with ink and other materials. It's this \"ink alchemy\" period that provided the backdrop to his current practice - of using ink made from hair, he explains.\n\nThe idea behind this was derived from the concept of powdered hair in Chinese medicine. The Shanghai Medical Factory produces hair powder to treat anxiety. Gu re-appropriated that to symbolise how human hair-made ink can conceptually cure cultural anxiety. He also got a rice paper factory to use green tea to make paper, giving these national treasures a new meaning and life. From that period on, Gu became known for his works using genetic material.\n\n\"Since 2001, I've been thinking about how to use that human hair ink and green tea again, before deciding on the idea of the landscape,\" he says in a telephone interview from New York.\n\nHis Yanhuang DNA Landscape series will be one of the monumental pieces confronting visitors to Art Stage Singapore when they first enter the hall.\n\nThe last time Gu had a major art work in Singapore was just over a decade ago - at the 2002 opening of the Esplanade-Theatres by the Bay. His then United Nations - Man and Space installation was the talk of the town, with its 188 flags made of human hair, symbolising the DNA of people all over the world.\n\nThis time at Art Stage Singapore, where he is represented by Gajah Gallery, Gu's works aren't so controversial or eye-popping, but more symbolically intriguing, featuring also his calligraphic works.\n\nGu's experimentation with \"fake\" calligraphy in the 1980s in China, is what got him into hot water with the Chinese authorities and subsequently famous in the international art world.\n\n\"The officials who couldn't read the calligraphy that I invented felt that I could have been criticising the government. At that time though, as a young artist, I was just trying to create a new identity for Chinese art,\" recalls the China Academy of Art graduate, who was a student of classical landscape painting master Lu Yanshao.\n\nWith both feet entrenched in the Western and the Asian contemporary art worlds today, Gu is one of the leading Chinese artists to attain international status, with works that are culturally-rich and yet resonate globally.\n\nHe has been pushing for Chinese and Asian artists to know their classical traditions deeper but also better understand contemporary western art. \"It's a chance to create our own contemporary culture.'\n\nGu Wenda will be represented by Gajah Gallery at Art Stage Singapore, Jan 15-19, 2014, at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In Finland, they're trying to do something about this.\n\nPetri Paarnio, director of Santa Claus Licensing, the firm that holds the rights to market the Santa Claus name in Finland, wants to see him bring joy to children's hearts but also to generate business - all year round and all around the world, starting with China.\n\n\"Santa Claus is an icon. He stands for symbols like good health, solidarity, and values like giving without always expecting something in return,\" he said.\n\nSanta Claus Licensing and Finnish tourist authorities both feel the iconic brand could spawn a multi-million euro industry including computer games, international events, theme parks and merchandising.\n\nAs it is, thousands of tourists flock each Christmas to the Arctic city of Rovaniemi, the capital of Finland's northernmost Lapland region, in search of the \"authentic\" Santa Claus experience.\n\nBut the sparsely populated area, which claims the North Pole's most famous resident as their own, is not content with only filling hotels, activity centres, stores and restaurants over the holiday period.\n\n\"Father Christmas is Finland's best known brand but we've not made the most of his image as Finnish,\" Mr Paarnio said. \"Maybe because Christmas just takes place over a short period.\"\n\nAlthough the country is in the grip of recession and budgetary austerity, the Finnish parliament in December gave the green light for 300,000 euros (S$520,130) in funding to promote Finnish Santa Claus in China.\n\n\"In Europe Christmas is traditionally seen as a short period. But in Asia Father Christmas could be promoted as a completely separate character,\" said Mr Paarnio.\n\nSelling Santa has been made easier by national airline Finnair's increased links between Helsinki and Asia.\n\n\"We've always had very large numbers of Japanese visitors but China, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore are growing in importance. And Russians fill the hotels after Christmas until early January.\"\n\nAnd the traffic has not just been one way.\n\nFor the past two years the white-bearded man of the north has made the trip from Rovaniemi to Fukushima in Japan to raise the spirits of children affected by the 2011 tsunami.\n\nIn contrast to the roly-poly American Santa, the Finnish variety has no black boots or belt but wears light brown boots made in Lapland, said Mr Paarnio.\n\nHe also wears a long red cloak - not the red suit of the well-known American character - and sports a much longer white beard. \"The length of his beard is strictly regulated and he's in much better health - he is slimmer - and moreover he doesn't say 'ho, ho, ho!' like his US counterpart,\" Mr Paarnio added.\n\nThe challenge, however, will be to convince consumers that the Finnish Santa is the real thing. But putting a price tag on his worth may be going a step too far - even for those who do it for a living.\n\n\"The concept of Santa Claus is not protected by copyright so its market value is next to zero,\" said Mika Maliranta, head of research at the economic think-tank ETLA.\n\nAnd trying to put a market value on Father Christmas may be seen as offensive in a country that takes the festive season very seriously.\n\n\"It might go against the values he stands for,\" said Finnish stock market analyst Mikael Rautanen at Inderes. \"And maybe the Christmas period is commercial enough already.\" AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Disney anticipates getting about half of its yearly subscribers for the virtual-world game during the week of Christmas - and especially on the holiday itself. \"It's definitely our prime time,\" he said.\n\nDisney's strategy illustrates how Christmas has become the most lucrative day of the year for makers of mobile applications, in what is now the equivalent of a Black Friday for US retailers or a Cyber Monday for e-commerce companies. That's because Dec 25 is the day that people take the wraps off gifts of smartphones and tablets - immediately spurring many to download games, productivity tools and other apps from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.\n\nThis Christmas is projected to set another record for app downloads, following 328 million downloads last Dec 25 - the busiest day ever - and 36 per cent above 2011, according to analytics firm Flurry. According to a Harris survey commissioned by mobile-app and website-testing company Soasta, 30 per cent of Americans plan to download an app on Dec 25.\n\n\"One of the first things you do when you get a shiny new present is you want to take it for a test run,\" said Marcos Sanchez, vice-president at App Annie, a company that measures app downloads. \"It's the magical trifecta of something new, time to waste and wanting to fill your time with fun stuff.\"\n\nWhile many developers like Disney plan all year for a Christmas rush, a final blitz comes in the last few weeks. Apple's offices close between Dec 21 and Dec 27, leading app makers to rush to get their updates submitted and approved before the deadline. A plug from Apple on the front page of the App Store guarantees a flood of downloads.\n\nApple said earlier this year that two billion apps were downloaded last December, a monthly record. Tom Neumayr, a spokesman for the Cupertino, California-based company, declined to comment further. Christopher Katsaros, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-based Google, didn't return requests for comment.\n\nThe holiday surge has created a dogfight among developers to get noticed in an increasingly crowded market. Apple's App Store and Google Play each have more than a million apps available.\n\nSome developers use straightforward tactics to grab attention, such as introducing new titles, cutting prices and hunting for press. Others use digital-advertising campaigns to manipulate Apple's rankings by guaranteeing a certain number of downloads and better visibility in the App Store. While Apple has attempted to clamp down on that strategy, the practice persists.\n\n\"There's competition to make sure your app is ranked and app developers go to every distribution platform they can get their hands on,\" said Siqi Chen, co-founder of Heyday, which released its journal-taking app this month to capitalise on the Christmas spike. He said his company doesn't pay for downloads.\n\nMaking it harder for smaller outfits to stand out is the fact that deep-pocketed bigger companies like Disney and video-game publisher Electronic Arts are prioritising mobile entertainment as an important revenue source, said Fernando Pizarro, general manager for PapayaMobile, an advertising platform.\n\nSteve Stamstad, vice-president of marketing for EA Mobile, said the game publisher made changes to all its phone and tablet titles ahead of Christmas. The publisher of \"FIFA Soccer\" will get five billion different \"marketing impressions\" in front of consumers for the Christmas rush, be it ads on Facebook and phones, or promotions done by partners like Twenty-First Century Fox for its app themed after The Simpsons.\n\nSpending heavily on advertising creates financial risks. The cost of acquiring an iPhone user through an ad network is about US$2.30 in December, more than double the cost in June, according to a report by SuperData, an analysis firm for mobile-game publishers. For that spending to be worthwhile, a game publisher needs to keep a new user playing for at least two months before a profit can be made, a period that's an \"eon in mobile game time\", the report said.\n\nSome app makers give away their apps to lure consumers. Tomek Sarnowski, co-founder of Byss Mobile, said his company is offering its InstaWeather app - which usually costs 99 cents - for free around Christmas so that the company can use it to cross-promote other paid apps it publishes.\n\nMike Maser, the co-founder of fitness application FitStar, isn't using advertising or free downloads. Instead, he is counting on appealing to people anxious to exercise after a calorie-rich holiday. His San Francisco-based company recently released an iPhone app in time for Christmas that features Atlanta Falcons football star Tony Gonzalez walking users through different workouts tailored to their fitness level. The company also cut prices by 40 per cent to US$29.99 through January for a year of access to its workouts.\n\n\"It's not unlike a gym membership,\" he said. \"We marked this time of year to be ready for the Christmas rush and the New Year's resolution time frame.\"\n\nSome companies go to great lengths to ensure their app is prepared for a flood of users. Mikael Berner, creator of the personal assistant app EasilyDo, last year paid to have his servers experience a burst of 10,000 downloads in an hour to be sure it could withstand the rush of consumers. The test went through without a hitch, and the company celebrated with Mr Berner donning a Christmas vest and serving homemade eggnog.\n\nThis Christmas, Mr Berner said he will have people in the office to monitor downloads, especially at around 9am in each time zone when gift unwrapping is in full swing. \"If you disappoint somebody during that euphoric moment when they are downloading the app on Christmas, they are going to remember,\" he said.

Not only has MND chopped supply on both the confirmed and reserve lists but it will be pushing out mostly not-so-hot sites on the confirmed list to prevent benchmark bids from being set and hence pushing up prices of other sites.\n\nThe industry is bracing itself for record numbers of private housing completions. And with the introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework in late June, developers' private housing sales have, on the whole, slowed. CBRE estimates that 2013 will end with around 15,000 units (excluding executive condominiums) sold - down from last year's record of 22,197. Next year, the figure is likely to shrink further to 10,000-12,000.\n\nWith sales down, some developers have started trimming prices. The goal is to launch projects as soon as possible - on fears of worsening sentiment as a housing glut builds up. In the public housing market too, prices of HDB resale flats have begun to soften. If the trend continues, that will clip HDB flat owners' capacity to upgrade to a mass-market private condo.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

That volatility, and doubts about the US Federal Reserve's US$85 billion a month bond-buying programme, prolonged the deal execution cycle as windows of opportunity opened and shut rapidly.\n\nThe volatility, however, did not prevent issuance hitting a new high with issuers determined to take advantage of rock bottom interest rates and investors hungry for rising yields on investments.\n\nDeal volumes rose to a peak of US$143.8 billion this year, eclipsing the previous high of US$133.8 billion last year, with HSBC and Deutsche Bank leading the league tables. Asia's debt demand is expected to moderate, with the US central bank's plan to trim its monthly purchases among the key factors behind the likely pullback.\n\n\"It will be difficult for 2014 to register another record year for new issuance,\" said Thomas Kwan, Hong Kong-based head of fixed income at Harvest Global Investments, who expects outflows in retail funds to continue next year, reversing a trend from early last year.\n\nIn the debt capital markets league table standings, HSBC retained the top spot this year. Among the key deals was helping the Asian Development Bank raise US$2.5 billion through a three-year bond. Deutsche Bank jumped from fourth to second place, helped by deals such as Indonesia's US$1.5 billion sukuk. Coming in third was Citigroup.\n\nOne factor that Asia's debt bankers hope will override the US taper is the need for Asian corporates to repay bonds issued five years ago when bumper volumes of debt were raised. The five-year tenor is the most-preferred debt maturity among Asian issuers.\n\nAccording to Societe Generale, Asian issuers are faced with a record US$43 billion in redemptions next year, compared with less than US$25 billion this year. The sustained yield gap between dollar and domestic currency assets would also provide the impetus to new borrowers.\n\nBut waning volumes of liquidity and the availability of other funding options lead most in the Asian debt markets to predict a slowdown. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

Through this, China Mobile has been a notable hold-out. In a market where Apple is only ranked fifth with a 6 per cent share, the world' largest wireless player could afford to continue the stand-off.\n\nNow, though, the balance of power has shifted. In October, China Mobile's nine-month net profit slipped 1.9 per cent as its market share shrank, which some have blamed on the absence of an iPhone offering. In the tug-of-war between margin protection and market share retention, the latter finally won out.\n\nChina Mobile, it turns out, needs Apple after all. Very little has been said about China Mobile's iPhone pricing, but a few days before the Apple announcement, the telco said it was bracing itself for a greater subsidy expenditure next year, as it tries to get subscribers on its new 4G network.\n\nThis reversion to the subsidy mean is an interesting development, because for the past year, subsidy cutbacks and eliminations have caught on elsewhere. Spain's Telefonica cut subsidies last year, as did Vodafone Spain.\n\nThe results have been mixed - Telefonica had to slash prices on its smartphone in March, which it insists does not herald a return to handset subsidies. Vodafone, however, had to re-introduce handset subsidies on a promotional basis over the summer last year.\n\nAt the same time, Apple is not the company it once was. It faces stiff competition from cheaper handsets in a world where the poor greatly outnumber the rich and relies on subsidies to stay popular. In the ebb and flow of the subsidy wars, the victor will be determined by whether Apple needs the carriers more than the other way around.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bullion lost favour with institutional and retail investors as they braced for the US Federal Reserve to reduce its monthly US$85 billion bond buying programme, moving funds to equities and other riskier assets.\n\nRenewed consumer appetite for gold is unlikely to counteract the lack of investment dollars and reverse the downward trend for prices. But US demand is a bright spot in a global gold market where import restrictions in India have slowed buying in that country, one of the world's biggest consumers.\n\nWith the US economy growing at its fastest pace in nearly two years and the unemployment rate hitting a five-year low in November, shoppers are more willing to fork out for \"bigger-ticket items\" during this year's critical holiday season, Dennis Marlow, who owns Solitaire Creations, told Reuters last week. \"People are saying 'Wow, gold is down. I can finally get the ring or piece of jewellery I want',\" he said.\n\nHe estimated sales in his store in Manhattan's Diamond District will rise by 15 to 20 per cent this holiday from 2012.\n\nLow prices have given big retailers more wiggle room to offer discounts to attract customers this year, jewellers said.\n\nJewellery sales from Thanksgiving until the new year account for as much as half of the annual total, according to estimates.\n\nUS gold jewellery demand in the final three months of the year will increase 15 to 20 per cent to between 44 and 48 tonnes, Thomson Reuters GFMS expects. The country's consumption is only one-tenth the size of China and India combined, but analysts expect US demand will outpace other Western developed markets in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis year's buying spree will likely help gold jewellery win back some market share lost after Americans shunned gold as prices soared over the past 10 years. Jewellery accounts for about half of total gold demand.\n\nEven so, fourth-quarter sales this year will be a fraction of the more than 150 tonnes seen in the same period of 2004.\n\nInvestors have pulled over US$36 billion from gold exchange-traded funds, sending holdings to their lowest since the 2008 financial crisis. Institutional selling accelerated after the Fed outlined last week the first concrete details of its plans to reduce the bond buying, or quantitative easing, programme, that has bolstered prices.\n\nOn Friday, spot gold sank as low as US$1,185 per ounce, close to a 31/2-year lows and down 40 per cent from all-time highs of US$1,920 in September 2011. On Monday, prices had recovered some, but remained below US$1,200 per ounce, and the market is expected to remain under pressure into the new year.\n\nProspects for jewellery demand appear more promising if prices remain weak and jewellers continue to slash prices. \"If that's the case, I'm more likely to buy more gold jewellery,\" said Tara Higgins, 48, a lawyer from New Jersey who bought a US$5,000 gold bracelet with diamonds on Thursday.

Electronics - that's a bit of a challenge.\"\n\nSure, children still want and receive trains and dolls and Legos and other playthings of the type that Santa might make in his North Pole workshop.\n\nBut their passion for playing with toys seems to be diminishing at earlier and earlier ages; after all, this is a generation that has learned to amuse itself practically from babyhood with the smartphone and tablet swiped from their parents' hands.\n\nFor Hanukkah this year, Maddon Segall asked for iTunes gift cards and the new iPad Mini. He is three years old.\n\n\"I hate to tell you, but we got it for him,\" said his mother, Elyse Bender-Segall, of Livingston, New Jersey.\n\nShe added: \"He doesn't like the toys. I buy him every toy. He's just not interested in them the way he is with the tech.\"\n\nA recent survey of 1,000 parents in the US with children between the ages of two and 10 found that more than half planned to buy a tech item for their children this holiday season. About two-thirds of those planned to give a tablet or smartphone, according to the survey, which was taken for PBS Kids, the brand of the public broadcasting network aimed at young children.\n\n\"Smarter Giving With Apps!\" shouted the December cover of Manhattan Family, a monthly publication geared to families with young children. The article, written by a kindergarten teacher, noted that \"traditional gifts, like clothes and toys\" can be costly \"and not always what children are wishing for\".\n\nApps, on the other hand, she wrote, are cost-effective, educational and fun: the perfect gift.\n\nIt is a confounding situation for toymakers, which - according to the Toy Industry Association and statistics compiled by NPD Group - have barely managed to eke out any gains in the past few years. Contributing to the doldrums is the fact that there is no super-hot, must-have toy this holiday season - no 2013 equivalent of the Cabbage Patch doll or the Tickle Me Elmo or even the Zhu Zhu Pet.\n\nInstead, some in the industry are trying to get a piece of the tech action. While electronic games have long been a staple of toy stores, this year, for the first time, Toys 'R' Us introduced hands-on tablet displays in many of its stores, including iPads and Samsung tablets.\n\nThe company has also designed and developed its own tablet for young children, the Tabeo e2, which, a spokeswoman said, \"comes right out the box with 30 premium apps\".\n\nOn a recent snowy morning, the first thing holiday shoppers saw after entering the Toys 'R' Us flagship store in Times Square (after being welcomed by a man in a giraffe costume) was a sign advertising the iPad.\n\n\"Increasingly, tablets are a key growth category for the company,\" said Adrienne O'Hara, the company's director of consumer public relations.\n\nBut as the holiday shopping season is wrapping up, some parents have resisted.\n\nThe Easy Bake Oven, which celebrated its 50th birthday this year, has been a strong seller at Wal-Mart in recent weeks. Hot Wheels are having a good season, industry experts say, as are the Barbie Dream House and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Even Mr Potato Head is still around.\n\n\"In many ways, retro is being fuelled by the virtualization of toys,\" said M Eric Johnson, dean of the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University, who has studied the toy industry.\n\n\"I think there's a mindset in a lot of young moms that a physical toy is a good thing. It's almost a backlash to the popularity of the app,\" he said. \"So they head down the toy aisle, and they find something they remember.\"\n\nIndeed, nostalgia can be a powerful tool for retailers. Part of that is brand recognition, because just like finding a familiar box of Cheerios in the grocery store, Barbie and GI Joe need no introduction. But there is also something more emotional at play.\n\n\"When you look at things like Cabbage Patch, to Hot Wheels, to Elmo, parents see these things they had and they loved,\" said Jim Silver, editor in chief of TimetoPlayMag.com. \"If it was one of their favourites, they want to share that experience with their child.\"\n\nA parent's experience as an adult is also relevant. Plenty of people love a good game of Angry Birds, but less pleasant associations also attach to tablets and phones, like late-night emails from the boss.\n\n\"I think for parents, these kind of adult toys symbolise work and other things that don't necessarily symbolise childhood,\" Owen's Mr Johnson said of apps and tablets. \"But Mr. Potato Head is childhood and carefree.\"\n\nSome newer toys popular this year are decidedly low-tech, like Rainbow Looms. \"You use looming sticks to create bracelets,\" said Gerrick Johnson, a toy industry analyst at BMO Capital Markets. \"It is the most basic, the most low-tech item in the world, and it's the hottest toy out there.\"\n\nBut even retro toys must be constantly updated.\n\nThere have been 12 Easy Bake Oven models, according to Hasbro, available in colours including silver, yellow, purple and teal. Baby Alive has new features every year - in the spring, a version was introduced that cuddles, and also kicks. And this year's Elmo, Big Hugs Elmo, will hug, dance and offer game suggestions by saying things like, \"Let's pretend we are horses!\" In many ways, he is a very different toy from the Tickle Me Elmo who set off a craze in the mid-1990s, but he is still Elmo.\n\n\"Elmo is all about his personality,\" Mr Silver of TimetoPlayMag.com said. \"You don't want to lose that. You can't lose the brand's core.\"\n\nWhile such evergreen toys generally do better in a season that does not have a new blockbuster, their popularity this year may also be related to economics. BMO's Mr Johnson said more classic toys appealed to parents during tough economic times.\n\nThe downside is that so much of what is available is already familiar.\n\n\"There's not a lot of innovation out there, not a lot of newness,\" he said. \"Not a lot to pull kids away from digital entertainment.\"\n\nBut even the nostalgic toy is going digital: the Easy Bake Oven has an app. NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

It will have the capacity to produce up to 49 megawatts of gross power or 190 tonnes per hour of steam using municipal and commercial waste.\n\nThe Singapore-listed conglomerate will hold a 40 per cent stake in the project while joint venture partners SITA UK (a unit of Suez Environment) and I-Environment Investments Ltd (a unit of Itochu Corporation) will hold 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.\n\nThe joint venture will also develop a separate waste transfer station in Knowsley, Merseyside, to transport waste by rail from Merseyside to the energy-from-waste plant in Teesside. Both facilities are expected to begin operations in 2016.\n\nThe facility will use up to 430,000 tonnes per year of municipal waste, which would otherwise have gone to landfill, to produce sustainable power and steam. It will reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 130,000 tonnes per year.\n\n\"This energy-from-waste pro-ject is in line with Sembcorp's strategy to focus on green businesses and transform the Wilton International site into a green hub,\" the group stated. Its first project, the Sembcorp Biomass Power Station, completed its first full year of operations in 2012, and is the UK's largest biomass renewable energy project.\n\nWhile SCI's UK utilities operations posted a 55 per cent increase in net profit to $18.6 million for the 9M FY13 period, it also suffered a hefty $48.5 million impairment loss. As a whole, the SCI group posted an 8.8 per cent increase in net profit to $596.7 million for the 9M FY13.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Short holdings climbed 1.2 per cent to 75,199, within 6 per cent of the record reached in July. Net-bullish holdings across 18 US-traded commodities rose 8.5 per cent to a seven-week high, led by soybeans, natural gas and cotton.\n\nInvestors pulled US$38.8 billion from gold funds this year, the most in data going back through 2000, according to EPFR Global, a research company. Futures settled at a three-year low last Thursday in New York, a day after the Federal Reserve cut the pace of its monthly bond purchases. Prices plunged 37 per cent since reaching a record in September 2011, US equities climbed to an all-time high and the dollar is poised for its strongest annual performance since 2008.\n\n\"Gold was probably one of the easiest shorts of all time,\" said Uri Landesman, the president of New York-based hedge fund Platinum Partners who helps manage about US$1.3 billion of assets. \"It has fallen out of favour because people felt its general security wasn't needed in this market. People wanted to take on risk this year.\"\n\nBullion reached US$1,186 an ounce on Thursday, within US$6.60 of this year's low reached in June. Thirteen analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect gold to fall this week, 10 are bullish and four neutral. That's the fourth bearish outlook in five weeks.\n\nFutures for February delivery slumped 28 per cent this year, poised for the first loss since 2000. The Standard & Poor's GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities slid 1.5 per cent, while the MSCI All-Country World index of equities jumped 18 per cent. The Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, rose 3.5 per cent. The Bloomberg Treasury Bond Index fell 2.9 per cent.\n\nGold \"is now likely to grind lower throughout 2014\", Jeffrey Currie, the head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc in New York, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. Prices will reach US$1,050 by the end of 2014, the bank said in a Nov 20 report. Societe Generale SA and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are also forecasting more declines.\n\nThe Fed said last Wednesday that it will cut monthly asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, to US$75 billion from US$85 billion. Policymakers raised their assessment of the employment outlook, predicting the jobless rate will fall as low as 6.3 per cent by the end of next year, compared with a September forecast of 6.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent.\n\nGold rose 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the US central bank pumped more than US$2 trillion into the financial system by purchasing debt, increasing concern that inflation would accelerate.\n\nAccelerating economic growth may eventually bring higher consumer prices and revive demand for gold as a hedge against inflation, said Tom Winmill, who helps manage about US$250 million of assets in Walpole, New Hampshire, for Midas Funds.\n\nPolicymakers may hold interest rates near zero per cent even if unemployment falls below the 6.5 per cent rate the central bank previously cited as a likely catalyst for an increase, \"especially if projected inflation continues to run below\" the 2 per cent goal, the Fed said in its statement.\n\n\"We expect that as the economy recovers, which is the reason they're tapering, inflation will come back,\" Mr Winmill said. \"The long-term outlook is exceedingly bullish for gold.\"\n\nPrices fell after some investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value. Bullion held in exchange-traded products plunged 32 percent in 2013, heading for the first decrease since the funds started trading in 2003. The slump wiped US$72.7 billion from the value of the assets.\n\nGlobal equities have advanced to the highest in almost six years, and US inflation is running at 1.2 per cent, almost half the rate of the past decade. US gross domestic product climbed at a 4.1 per cent annualised rate in the third quarter, the strongest since the final three months of 2011, Commerce Department data showed last Friday.\n\nWithdrawals from gold ETPs are driving record outflows of US$36.3 billion from commodity investments, according to Barclays plc. Assets under management declined US$88 billion since the start of the year through last month, the bank said in a report last Tuesday. Excluding withdrawals from precious-metal ETPs, commodities had an inflow of US$4 billion.\n\nBullish bets on crude oil climbed 0.3 per cent to 252,910 contracts, the highest since mid-October, the CFTC data shows. US fuel consumption surged 13 per cent to 21 million barrels a day as of Dec 13, the highest since April 2008, an Energy Information Administration report on Thursday showed.\n\nSpeculators are holding a net-long position in copper of 20,688 contracts. That compares with a net- short holding of 1,223 a week earlier. Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange have fallen to the lowest since February.

Last year, average daily turnover was 20,542 and average daily value was NZ$12,079.\n\nIn contrast, the average daily turnover of GLL ordinary shares traded on the Singapore Exchange so far this year was 2,295,866, for an average daily value of NZ$1,755,909. Last year, average daily turnover was 846,375 and average daily value was NZ$516,201.\n\n\"The board considers that the costs of remaining listed on the NZSX outweigh the benefits of maintaining that listing,\" said GLL.\n\nThe last day shareholders will be able to trade GLL shares on the NZX is June 24, 2014.\n\n\"At the close of trading on the NZSX on the delisting date, the New Zealand branch of GLL's share register will be closed. If you hold GLL shares on the New Zealand branch register on the delisting date, your shares will be transferred to the Singapore branch register,\" said GLL. \"Following the delisting date, GLL shares may be traded on only the SGX (Singapore Exchange), where GLL maintains its primary listing.\"\n\nGLL is an investment holding company with principal investments in hotel management & operations, gaming, oil & gas, property development and other areas in the leisure industry. It is majority owned by Guoco Group, which is controlled by billionaire Malaysian businessman Quek Leng Chan of the Hong Leong Group.\n\nFormerly BIL International Ltd, GuocoLeisure was established in New Zealand in 1961 by Ronald Brierley. Its initial focus was to acquire substantial shareholdings in public companies in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBy the 1980s, the company acquired numerous global investments with shareholdings in more than 300 companies.\n\nBIL hit problems in the late 1990s when firms it had invested in, such as Air New Zealand, got into trouble. There were extensive management changes and BIL moved its headquarters to Singapore, though it retained a New Zealand market listing.\n\nGuocoLeisure shares closed 1.5 cents lower at 86.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Hyundai Merchant plans to raise about 1.5 trillion won selling stakes in container terminals and restructuring its bulk-cargo operations, the group said.\n\nShares of Hyundai Merchant jumped the most in more than six months in Seoul trading as Hyundai Group followed Hanjin Group, which owns Korean Air Lines Co, in announcing plans to sell assets to boost cash. South Korea's three biggest shipping companies face a cash crunch as three trillion won of bonds are due for repayment in the next two years amid mounting losses from a global slump in rates to carry sea cargo.\n\n\"The announcement has helped ease shareholders' concerns,\" Kim Min Ji, an analyst at E*Trade Securities Co, said from Seoul. \"The sale of financial units seems realistic and will help Hyundai Group raise cash it needs.\"\n\nHyundai Merchant advanced by the daily 15 per cent limit, the most since June 10, to close at 11,600 won. That helped trim the declines this year to 50 per cent. Hyundai Elevator Co, the biggest shareholder of the shipping company, rose 15 per cent, and Hyundai Securities climbed 3.1 per cent. The Kospi index gained 0.7 per cent.\n\nThe group plans to seek foreign investment for Hyundai Merchant, and sell additional Hyundai Elevator shares and carry out an initial public offering of Hyundai Logistics Co.\n\n\"While the company has sufficient funds to last until the first half of next year, we've decided to come up with a restructuring plan to calm investors' concerns,\" Hyundai Group said in the statement. \"We plan to continue restructuring the group next year.\"\n\nHyundai Merchant has one trillion won of bonds to pay in the next two years, compared with 678 billion won in cash at the end of September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nHyundai Group's plan comes after Korean Air said last week that it aims to raise 3.5 trillion won by selling assets, including shares in refiner S-Oil Corp and airplanes. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

A plan to tax overseas buyers' capital gains may also crimp demand.\n\nPrices of houses and apartments in the UK capital's most expensive neighbourhoods will climb 4 per cent next year after a 7.5 per cent jump this year, the London-based broker said in a Dec 21 report. Prices in Chelsea, Mayfair and Knightsbridge in 2013 underperformed the rest of London's best areas for the first time in a decade.\n\n\"There are limits to pricing growth in London,\" Liam Bailey, Knight Frank's global head of research, said by phone.\n\n\"Central London prices have recovered from the crash and there is resistance from buyers.\"\n\nOverseas buyers helped London's luxury homes outperform other UK real estate for the last four years as investors sought safe assets. An investor-friendly tax system and the pound's depreciation after the financial crisis sparked a 62 per cent surge in prime London prices since a low point in March 2009.\n\nPrices have exceeded the previous peak in 2008 by 26 per cent, according to Knight Frank.\n\nA capital-gains tax on home sales by people living abroad may dim London's allure to property buyers from abroad, Bailey said.\n\n\"A few buyers have had second thoughts about London, particularly if they were thinking of being based outside the UK,\" he said. New Tax Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced the tax on Dec 5.\n\nIt will apply to \"future gains\" after the tax takes effect in April 2015, he said, without specifying the levy's size. Capital-gains tax rates for second homes of UK residents currently range from 18 per cent to 28 per cent.\n\nLondon luxury-home prices climbed 0.8 per cent in December from the previous month, the most since March, according to the report. Prices in the City of London financial district and its fringes rose the most this year, gaining 16 per cent. Prices in Marylebone and Islington climbed 12 per cent.\n\nRents for prime London homes have either fallen or stagnated for the past 20 months. In December, they dropped 2.3 per cent from a year earlier, the smallest decline since September 2012.\n\nThe only neighbourhoods that didn't have a decline in rents were Marylebone with a 1.4 per cent increase and the City of London, where there was little change. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

The emergence of \"Abenomics\" has attracted far more attention internationally than has Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's rather reactionary and nationalistic brand of politics.\n\nAbenomics, a set of policy prescriptions involving huge fiscal and monetary stimulus to the Japanese economy followed (in theory at least) by fundamental structural reforms, are not the invention of Mr Abe himself. He is first and last a politician and idealogue, not an economist.\n\nA team of academic and other advisers are the true architects of Abenomics. But in this as in other areas, the prime minister has encouraged a kind of personality cult that makes him appear as a strong leader able to give direction to a nation in need of salvation.\n\nSome see Abenomics as a means to an end - a means to gain and retain political popularity while Mr Abe begins to implement a far more radical agenda. But the notion of a Japan that regains its erstwhile economic vigour and vitality is also very appealing for Mr Abe.\n\nTo understand the reactionary mood that has swept through Japan this year, it is necessary to see things in the context of the loss of economic and political confidence that has overtaken the country in the past 20 or so years.\n\nThe trauma of the bubble economy's collapse two decades ago lingered long and even though the bad debt mountain it left behind has long been cleared, an overly tight monetary policy by a once timid central bank choked off any sign of recovery and plunged the economy into deflation.\n\nA rising China pushed Japan into third place behind the US (and China) in world economic league tables, and then came the triple disaster of a mega earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in March 2011 - all capped by a stream of ineffective \"revolving door\" prime ministers.\n\nDespite his own short-lived and rather ineffective tenure as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and prime minister in 2006, Mr Abe somehow managed to become a lightning rod for conducting energy and anger (especially from the right wing of the LDP) into political action.\n\nThe LDP did not so much \"sweep to power\" in Lower House election late last year as ride upon the failure of voters to turn out for what they saw as ineffective and short-term Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)-led administrations. Apathy was rife among voters at large.\n\nFormer DPJ voters again stayed away in droves from the Upper House election in mid-year 2013 and the LDP was able to consolidate its hold on power to what political commentators saw as an alarming extent. History may show that such alarm was well founded, judging from recent developments.\n\nOn the Abenomics front, things have gone quite well since the appointment of former Asian Development Bank president Haruhiko Kuroda as governor of the Bank of Japan. He has pledged to turn deflation into 2 per cent annual inflation within two years and is making progress towards that goal.\n\nThe yen has plunged with Mr Kuroda's willingness to throw money at the deflation problem while corporate profits - in the export sector at least - have soared and Tokyo stocks along with them. Property prices are rising and there are signs of returning business confidence.\n\nEconomic growth, meanwhile, has improved to the point where the Asian Development Bank is predicting 1.7 per cent real GDP growth for this year, slowing to around one per cent in 2014 in the light of a proposed hike in the national consumption tax.\n\nGrowth is being boosted by not only monetary but also fiscal stimulus, a risky strategy for Japan where government debt is already double the size of the nation's economy and where Tokyo is under strong external pressure to put its fiscal house in order to avoid a possible fiscal crisis.\n\nBut the big question mark hanging over Abenomics is whether Mr Abe can deliver on his pledge to implement sweeping structural reforms that would change employment practices, de-regulate the economy and open up its more protected sectors.\n\nSo far, there is little apparent progress on this front and Mr Abe seems to be relying on experimenting with reforms within the narrow and politically safe confines of special deregulation zones, while also exposing Japan to competition via Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) membership.\n\nWhile economists may differ over the merits or demerits of Abenomics, the subject is relatively uncontroversial compared with the considerable ruckus that Mr Abe has created by his decisions to take Japan down new paths in terms of its security and diplomatic policies.\n\nIn pursuit of what he claims is a process of turning Japan into a \"normal\" nation, he has created a new National Security Council, ordered a beefing up of military spending and rammed through a new State Secrets Act which is seen as a threat to democratic freedom in Japan.\n\nAll this is taking place against the background of a proposed revision in the country's \"pacifist\" postwar constitution which could see the nation abandon its self-imposed ban on collective self-defence and also see Japan projecting military power well beyond its own shores in time.\n\nMeanwhile, territorial disputes have flared with China and South Korea to the point where observers fear a possible confrontation between Japanese and Chinese maritime vessels or aircraft engaged in a dangerous daily cat-and-mouse game of shadowing each other's movements.\n\nMr Abe's high popularity with voters during most of this year has taken a knock with the controversy that has erupted over the Secrets Act and and some voters have begun to question their own wisdom in awarding the LDP an almost absolute hold on power for the next few years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Such reports were being distributed by courier to the doctors who were not stationed in the facility, and some got lost on the way.\n\nFinding point-to-point encryption solutions too expensive then, he turned to his Singaporean friend Kwok-Yan Lam, who has been teaching security in universities since 1990, for help. His request was that the solution had to be robust for the enterprise, yet simple enough for the consumer to use.\n\nThe result was a Singapore-developed application that allows users to encrypt information easily on the fly by saving it in a password-protected folder.\n\nCalled Soda, which stands for Safe of Data App, it acts as a \"digital safe\" in which encrypted files are organised into folders that can only be read by their intended users.\n\nSoda comes with a cross-platform capability, which means that data such as photos, videos and documents can be encrypted using an Android phone, saved to the cloud, then downloaded and decrypted even in an iPhone, iPad or PC. The file is automatically decrypted when opened in the Soda folder.\n\n\"Encryption is quite easy to do nowadays - there is a lot of freeware. The difficult part is how to do it in such a way that people use it easily without having to deal with technical interfaces,\" said Professor Lam, who is an exco member of the Singapore Association of Information Security Professionals and an Adjunct Professor at the National University of Singapore. He has served as chief security consultant and architect for many local and regional projects on e-commerce and border control systems.\n\nProf Lam noted that most users try to avoid encryption as it is too difficult to use. Yet mobile devices, which are goldmines of information due to the myriad personal and work-related activities that they are used for, can be easy targets for cyber criminals.\n\nTo ensure a high level of security even for enterprise users, Soda was built on the same proven cryptography platform (certified to The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Federal Information Processing Standards) used by banks and governments.\n\nThe application is free for download in the iOS App Store and Android Google Play Store.\n\n\"People are not aware, or even if they are aware, they have no easy tool to protect their data. That is why the basic version is free of charge - we wanted to start something to educate people about personal privacy protection,\" said Prof Lam.\n\nA premium version, which allows individual users or small-sized businesses to enjoy unlimited sending of encrypted data, costs just US$4.99 per user a year.\n\nThere is also a corporate version - Soda Enterprise - that is designed to work seamlessly with existing corporate IT infrastructure and offers more advanced features such as secure P2P sharing of confidential files, as well as secure file exchange and group messaging.\n\n\"To enterprises, Soda is not only an app but a software platform that supports mobile and cloud applications requiring strong privacy and confidentiality protection,\" said Mr Tse.\n\nPiloted among 300 users in Asia a year ago, the security application has been downloaded almost 1,000 times by users not just in Asia but also in the US and Europe. Mr Tse expects 500,000 downloads by the end of 2014.\n\nSoda has been used by the Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Centre to encrypt and send screening results to doctors since January.\n\nTo promote the software, the duo set up Soda Pte Ltd in Singapore in January 2012.\n\nThe start-up, which employs 12 people, also has sales and marketing offices in Hong Kong and Malaysia, and plans to expand its presence in South-east Asia in the near term.\n\nIt is targeting telecommunications service providers offering cloud storage, banks that need to issue electronic statements and government agencies, among others.\n\nIn all, over $1 million have been injected into the company, and Mr Tse, who serves as its chairman, hopes to achieve 50-100 corporate sign-ups and break even by the end of 2014. Customers currently include organisations in the telecommunications and public sectors.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The concept was coined more than a decade ago, but is now starting to gather momentum because of the wireless connectivity built into more and more devices today.\n\nSpeaking at an event hosted by the Singapore Chapter of the Internet Society, CK Lim, CEO of Ascent Solutions, said that the local electronics manufacturer is currently researching a self-tuning, self-sensing RFID (radio frequency identification) chip.\n\nThe project is underway in a collaboration with US RFID sensor maker RF Micron with the objective of developing a chip that can sense properties in its surroundings, and deliver data to connected devices.\n\nThe chip can be embedded in everyday devices. Mr Lim said that, for example, the chip can be placed in adult diapers, to alert caretakers if it is soiled, without the need and hassle of manually checking.\n\nThis is possible today, because RFID prices have come down so dramatically in the past decade, he said. \"We're getting accurate devices in the couple-of-hundred- dollars range today, where it would have cost thousands before,\" Mr Lim said.\n\nNCS strategic business development director Ching Yin Sing said that the SingTel-owned IT firm has begun work with an international retailer to implement smart video sensors in its stores in four Asian cities: Singapore, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Shanghai.\n\nThe client carries garments, and NCS has placed video cameras on its clothes racks. The cameras feed the image information to a central server which crunches that data, and is able to reach 96 per cent accuracy in counting the number of people moving to the rack, said Mr Ching. The camera data will also be able to tell the store which racks are popular, based on how long people hover in that area.\n\nHe also cited the example of Tesco in the UK, where the company has placed video cameras behind its point-of-sale counters at petrol stations. The cameras are able to detect the gender and approximate age of the patron, and that influences the ads shown to the customer behind the cashier based on their demographic slice.\n\n\"Cameras can do intrusion detection by detecting motion, and make up crowd-density heat maps, profile audiences and chart human traffic footfall patterns, to name some uses,\" Mr Ching said.\n\nAccording to ABI Research, more than 30 billion devices will be wirelessly connected to the Internet of Things patchwork by 2020.\n\nFellow research agency Gartner has a similar estimate - 26 billion connected devices in that year, representing an almost 30-fold increase from 2009's 900 million devices.\n\nLack of standardisation\n\nGartner also estimates that product and service suppliers to this network will make up a US$300 billion market in 2020. It expects that the leading verticals pushing the development of the Internet of Things will be manufacturing, healthcare and insurance.\n\nBut while the applications continue to grow as companies discover new uses for sensors, the industry suffers from a lack of standardisation, said Mr Ching.\n\n\"There's very little work being done to get sensors connected easily,\" he said.\n\nTan Geok Leng, executive director of the Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R) at A*Star (the Agency for Science, Technology and Research), echoed this point. He said that the research institution is currently focused on helping to establish a standard communication platform between different sensors.\n\n\"Imagine if you could get traffic readings from the ERP (Electronic Road Pricing) gantries, and feed that to traffic reports. That would be a valuable source of data, but that information isn't easily obtainable right now,\" he said.\n\nHe noted that most applications are written and deployed in silos, in part because that allows them to deliver business objectives more quickly, since they don't need to work well with other applications.\n\n\"But in the long run, that's not efficient,\" he said. Data sharing could lead to powerful analytics being done across siloed applications, greatly lifting the IT industry's contribution as a whole.\n\n\"Still, it will take time to work well with others. Nobody wants to be the first,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even so, this gain comes after previous writedowns on the asset's book value as CSL battled a brutal and competitive market over the last decade.\n\n\"Telstra invested in this business in early-2000s for gross investment of around A$4 billion and then gradually wrote it down,\" a Nomura Equity Research report noted yesterday.\n\nHKT, which will buy all of CSL for a total of US$2.425 billion - 76.4 per cent from Telstra and the remaining 23.6 per cent from New World Development - is a part of the PCCW group, which is chaired by Richard Li, the son of Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing.\n\nWhen the deal is completed, CSL will have come full circle. Before the turn of the millennium, PCCW had owned CSL. Over 2001 and 2002, Telstra progressively bought stakes in CSL from PCCW, eventually owning all of the former. In 2006, however, CSL and New World PCS Limited were merged in a deal that reduced Telstra's stake in CSL to 76.4 per cent.\n\nExplaining the decision to exit the business yesterday, Telstra chief executive David Thodey said that \"there are a number of dynamics in the Hong Kong mobiles market that means this is the right opportunity for Telstra to maximise our return on this successful asset\".\n\nHe noted that CSL's compounded annual growth rate over the last three years stood at 9.4 per cent, calling it a \"strongly performing business\".\n\nIn its last financial year ended June 30, 2013, CSL took in A$1.01 billion in revenue - 17.6 per cent more than in the previous year - which accounted for about 4 per cent of total revenue. In Hong Kong dollar terms, Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) grew by 14.9 per cent to HK$2.06 billion (S$336.6 million).\n\nAccording to the Nomura report, the sale might be for the best as \"the market is competitive (five players) and becoming saturated, too, so this is a good outcome, we think\".\n\nThe market also welcomed the move yesterday, with Telstra's counter gaining nine Australian cents or 1.76 per cent to A$5.20 in trading.\n\nTelstra kept mum on how it would use the proceeds from the sale, saying only: \"Following completion, Telstra will address the net proceeds from the transaction consistent with its capital management framework.\"\n\nThe Nomura report said: \"More dividends is one possibility, but we understand there is no additional tax paid on this sale due to accumulated losses, hence the franking balance may not change. The preference of Telstra management and board is to pay fully franked dividends.\n\n\"Telstra is still open to pursuing other opportunities, too - so the proceeds may be deployed/ preserved for other investments as well.\"\n\nTelstra's involvement elsewhere in the region continues. Recently, it upped its stake in Autohome Inc, an online portal for automobile buyers in China, and listed it on the New York Stock Exchange. Its investment in Autohome Inc is now valued at US$1.9 billion.\n\nOver the last 18 months, the telco also entered into two new submarine cable investments and opened a new data centre in Singapore, among other things.\n\nYesterday, Telstra's Mr Thodey said that his team will focus on \"refining and enhancing our strategy across Asia\".\n\nRegulatory approval of the sale is expected to take around 90 days and the deal is estimated to be finalised by the first quarter of 2014, according to media reports.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The region's economy, however, has experienced only a gingerly revival so far, with Germany the leader, but France a growing problem.\n\nThe only major scare in 2013 came from events on the small island of Cyprus, but predictions that the crisis would envelop Greece and other weak nations in the eurozone proved to be wrong.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the outlook was dire. Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, reported that the eurozone economy had plunged in the final quarter of 2012. Gross domestic product of the region had fallen 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with the third, and it was the fifth quarter in which the currency bloc had failed to expand. For 2012 as a whole, GDP of the eurozone contracted 0.5 per cent.\n\nAs 2013 began, GDP in Germany, Europe's largest economy, was down 0.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with the previous quarter, and there were worries about declining exports and investment.\n\nFrance contracted 0.3 per cent and other sizeable economies - notably Italy, Spain and the Netherlands - also shrank. Italy's GDP plummeted 0.9 per cent, Spain's downturn also deepened, and Portugal's GDP slid 1.8 per cent.\n\nThe dismal performance - which was accompanied by a further rise in already high unemployment of 10.7 per cent or some 26 million - led to protests and government changes, notably in Italy and Greece. Economists predicted that at best there would be a gingerly revival in 2013.\n\nIn March, a botched Cyprus bailout deal precipitated sharp European and global stockmarket declines as investors feared a run on the island's banks and Greek and other financial institutions that were exposed to a possible default.\n\nIn an adjusted agreement, international lenders were forced to accept the closure of a major Cypriot bank, Laiki, and the seizure of savings from large depositors to recapitalise a second troubled lender, Bank of Cyprus.\n\nBoth banks had suffered huge losses from a write-down in the value of Greek government bonds, an arrangement brokered by EU leaders in late 2011 to make Greece's debts more manageable.\n\nAt the time, Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, the world's largest bond investor, commented that the Cyprus bailout could \"well undermine the recent tranquil behaviour of depositors and creditors in other vulnerable European economies - in particular Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain\". Indeed, as markets tumbled, the euro sank to around 1.28 against the US dollar.\n\nThe euro and European stock and bond markets rallied after the last-minute rescue averted a potential Cypriot exit from the eurozone, a financial meltdown, massive devaluation and rampant inflation. Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades accepted the new terms from the \"Troika\" comprising the European Union, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) for a loan of 10 billion euros, and that eventually reduced tensions.\n\nCyprus proved to be a hiccup as once again markets took the lead from ECB president Mario Draghi who in the late summer of 2012 had promised to do \"whatever it takes\" within the central bank's mandate to preserve the euro.\n\nThe market assumed the ECB would be buying dud bonds of zombie banks and indebted Southern European nations. Instead, Mr Draghi's \"jawboning\" improved sentiment and the euro recovered, and bond and equity markets began to take off, baffling even the most bullish forecasters.\n\nSince its mid-year low point, the euro has risen by 7 per cent, and sterling - boosted by rising UK property prices and higher consumption and growth - by 10 per cent. Greece and Ireland have been the best performing European stock markets, beating Germany and the UK - both the best performing economies, by a wide margin.\n\nAlso, bond yields of the so-called \"Club Med\" nations have fallen sharply as banks rather than the ECB have purchased the bonds.\n\nThis improvement helped lift growth of the average of the 28 European Union economies to 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, but sadly the eurozone still contracted 0.4 per cent. The UK has been the star economy growing 1.5 per cent in the September quarter compared with the same period in 2012, after a rise of 1.3 per cent in Q2. Germany's growth was 0.6 per cent, but France's was only 0.2 per cent. Italy, Spain and Portugal contracted, and Greece and Cyprus remained in deep recession.\n\nRuth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, contends that the eurozone will \"muddle through for the foreseeable future\" without any cataclysmic policy change.\n\nOn Dec 15, Ireland formally exited its rescue plan, after three years of austerity. Spain has announced that, following Ireland's lead, it intends to exit its bank bailout plan in January without seeking a precautionary credit line.\n\nThe \"Grand Coalition\" government, under Chancellor Angela Merkel, has agreed that Germany should still be \"tough on austerity\". But that is at a severe price. The eurozone's GDP is still 3 per cent below pre-financial crisis 2008 levels, and a recent study of the International Institute for Strategic Studies maintains that it faces a lost decade.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ms Yingluck, now caretaker premier, is not in Bangkok and has been visiting the north-east, her party's stronghold.\n\nThe protest movement's main leader, Suthep Thaugsuban, a former Democrat heavyweight, wants a suspension of democracy and the installation of an appointed \"people's council\". \"I don't know what Yingluck is thinking. But, what I know for sure now is that all civil servants, the army, the police have realised all Thai people are rising up against the government,\" Mr Suthep told Blue Sky, an anti-government cable television station.\n\nMr Suthep has earned a reputation for overstated rhetoric during fiery nightly speeches, where he has told police and civil servants to report to him, promised to retire to the beach and issued deadlines to army leaders to meet him to discuss ousting Ms Yingluck.\n\nMs Yingluck and Thaksin remain hugely popular in the north and north-east, but Mr Suthep's movement is backed by a powerful minority - Bangkok's middle class, bureaucrats, conservative elites and top army generals.\n\nThaksin's mainly rural-based supporters see him as a benevolent billionaire committed to raising their living standards, but his enemies call him an authoritarian crony capitalist who exploited the poor and abused his power by helping wealthy business friends and family.\n\nThe protests enjoy big support from Bangkok and though the size of the crowd often dwindles, Mr Suthep has managed to mobilise more than 100,000 on some marches.\n\nThe Election Commission on Friday ruled out postponing the vote, having earlier said that it was concerned the polls could be marred by violence.\n\nSeparately, more than 20 people were wounded when a car bomb went off near a hotel in the Sadao district of Songkhla province.\n\nNational Security Council chief Paradorn Pattanatabut told AFP the culprits may have been linked to the Thai rebellion in the south, as peace talks faltered.\n\n\"A second theory is it was related to the domestic political situation - to discredit the government,\" he added. - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Many of these sites make money by charging a referral fee for bookings directed from their sites.\n\nIn an interview with BizIT, Expedia's technical director for Southeast Asia, Lorin Kobashigawa-Bates, said the company's flight- booking application is much more flexible today than it was three years ago.\n\n\"Expedia is a 15-year- old company, and so we have code that is just as old. Back then, the code wasn't designed to be flexible, and a lot of it is written from scratch. So when you hire someone off the street, there is a long learning curve for them,\" he explained.\n\nOver the past three years, Expedia has invested heavily in its tech team and in modernising its Web code. This has helped accelerate the time-to-market for new features and services on the website, in order to stay fresh in light of growing competition.\n\n\"Almost our entire app has been rewritten over the past few years. We emphasised speed-to-market, and now huge chunks of our development process are automated,\" the technical director said. This speed-to-market is important because the company wants to tap customer feedback as soon as possible, so that it can refine its app faster, he added.\n\n\"The process of overhauling was a bit rough at first, and these investments were a huge spend in the IT department,\" he said.\n\nBut crossing that initial hump has paid off, because the Expedia team is able to much more quickly build mobile products and reuse large components of its Web kit for mobile platforms, he said.\n\nThis has been timely, because the mobile space has taken off in a big way in the past few years. \"The mobile space is a whole new market that wasn't there before, such as last-minute hotel bookings which are made on the go,\" he said.\n\nAs a result, the volume of deals targeted at mobile users continues to grow, he said.\n\nAnd in Southeast Asia, where credit card penetration and desktop online penetration remains low, the mobile provides a gateway to a new market of mobile- first users, he noted.\n\nMr Kobashigawa-Bates heads software development for Expedia.com Asia-Pacific, as well as Air- AsiaGo.com. AirAsiaGo is the portal that was formed through a partnership with Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia. The two companies also have an exclusive third-party arrangement to distribute AirAsia's flights only through Expedia.\n\nSuch arrangements are possible because of Expedia's size and clout in the market, which help it stay ahead of the smaller competition, he said.\n\n\"While there has been an explosion in the number of meta-searchers out there, it's harder to re-create an Expedia because we have so many tight supplier relationships,\" he said.\n\nBut one of the challenges facing the tech team in trying to be aggressive in Asia is that all of Expedia's data centres are in the US. The team decided to launch on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has a data centre in Singapore, in order for its site to load faster because it's being served out of a geographically nearer data centre to customers.\n\n\"Speed of loading really matters. We deal with live, on-the-minute price fluctuations,\" and the company relies on regional hosting partners to keep its website performance snappy, Mr Kobashigawa-Bates said.\n\nHis team for Southeast Asia is spread out over the region, with 12 developers in Singapore, eight in Gurgaon, India, and 18 in Shenzhen, China. The team's main function is to customise the company's products for the Asian market.\n\nThe team is now working on bringing the company's Scratchpad product to Asia, scheduled for next year.\n\nScratchpad is a feature on Expedia that it launched just late this year. It allows users to save hotels and flights onto one page, so that they can come back and review their research done on prices.\n\n\"It sounds simple, but a lot of work on the backend needs to be done, because the Scratchpad remembers your searches, and live-updates prices. We need to present that data in a rapid and interactive manner, which requires a lot of muscle on backend servers,\" he said, noting again the company's reliance on the AWS cloud for that performance boost.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMAYBE people who say money can't buy happiness never got what they paid for? You'd be unhappy too, if you spent hundreds or even thousands on beauty products and regimes promising to return your ageing skin to its 20-something collagen-enriched self, only to be reminded once again that this is how the beauty industry makes its money - by selling hope in a jar with minimal results.\n\nBut what if someone came up to you and said that they could not only give you youthful skin but skin that continues to get younger with regular treatments? Do you dismiss him as just another snake oil salesman, or would you be vain enough to at least hear him out?\n\nIn this case, the person in question - Patrick Bitter - does make a rather convincing case. For one, the California-based dermatologist made his name as the founder of the IPL (intense pulsed light) photo-facial which uses the light-based therapy to remove scars and rejuvenate the skin. The popular method was first introduced in Singapore in 2000 but of late, Dr Bitter has progressed beyond IPL to a newer technology called BroadBand Light, for which he was recently in town for.\n\nThe technology comes from a machine built by the Palo Alto company Sciton, which approached Dr Bitter seven years ago to develop a technique for anti-ageing treatments. Essentially a more powerful IPL machine, it uses a broader spectrum of both infrared and visible light to penetrate the skin layers, which is supposed to be more effective than IPL's single wavelength. The real kicker, though, is that this new therapy, aptly named BBL Forever Young, goes beyond the skin surface, stimulating changes at the molecular level and literally making old skin cells young again.\n\n\"I did a study with the dermatology department at Stanford University which was designed to look at ageing cells and the expression of the genes,\" explains Dr Bitter, who published the results of the study in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology. \"We know there's a difference between old and young skin cells in terms of how the genes are read. Essentially, this technology can, with no downtime, change old skin cells and make them look like young skin cells. Regular treatment helps to keep these old skin cells young, and the results we have had of patients over the years is that they look like they have hardly aged at all.\"\n\nNew discovery\n\nIn fact, this is a relatively new discovery that people aren't really aware of, says Dr Bitter. BBL technology has been around for around seven years but while they knew about its effectiveness in rejuvenating the skin, \"we didn't know that if you did it regularly, it could slow down and even stop ageing\".\n\nBut put any Benjamin Button fantasies out of your head, because a 50-year-old is not going to look 25 after a few years of BBL treatments. Essentially, it makes your skin look brighter and clearer \"and you will look better than other people your age\", says Dr Bitter, 58, a regular user who boasts the tight skin of a 40-something.\n\nOn whether BBL can replace other non-invasive therapies such as, say, Ulthera or Thermage which purports to tighten skin and lift sagging jowls, Dr Bitter says: \"If you start at middle age when you've got some sagginess in the skin, BBL can help a little bit but you might still want to consider other treatments designed to tighten skin, or consider a (surgical) facelift. But if you start younger in your 30s or even early 40s and do regular treatments, your skin will stay tighter than other people your age who don't do it.\"\n\nWhere BBL differs from other treatments is that they use different technologies such as radio frequency or ultrasound and \"they are all designed to stimulate collagen and tighten skin, but they don't take old skin cells and make them young again,\" says Dr Bitter.\n\nIn Singapore, BBL Forever Young has been available for almost a year, with plastic surgeon Lee Shu Jin being one of the early converts. Dr Lee, who runs her own practice in Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre, says that she does a combination of BBL and another modality called Skin Tight - which uses the same machine - to tighten sagging skin as well as brighten it. \"For issues like brown spots, redness, fine lines and wrinkles, most people will see their skin looking better within a week,\" she says.\n\nLooking brighter\n\nWhile repeat treatments are required, she reckons that one session that combines BBL and Skin Tight still works out to about a quarter of the price of say, Thermage. One session of BBL alone is priced around $350 to $400 and it takes roughly three to four monthly sessions to see any real effects. The treatment itself is a breeze, as topical anaesthetic cream is applied so you don't feel anything while the probes are run across your face. There's a bit of heat when the probes approach more sensitive areas around the eyes, but there's no painful rubber band snapping hits that you get with regular IPL. Your face looks a little brighter immediately and it feels tighter for a few days but it's largely a temporary effect.\n\nIt will take time to see the difference - at least four monthly treatments and then two to three a year for maintenance. But Dr Lee has seen clients coming in every month, so if money is no issue, then happiness - \"and the closest we've come to a fountain of youth\" - is just a credit card signature away.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Little was known of his political views or agenda.\n\nOne year on, Xi Jinping, who comes across as much more affable than his stern predecessor, has given few clues about his personality, but we have a much clearer picture of where he is taking China.\n\nBarely after stepping into his new shoes, he launched a vast anti-corruption campaign to officially purge the party of dishonest elements and committed to deliver the \"China dream\", later changed to \"Chinese dream\", a vague slogan that holds the promise of a rejuvenated nation. He has also never missed an occasion at home or abroad to declare the need for economic reform - but any political change is clearly not on the agenda.\n\nWhen he came to power, the Communist Party seemed torn by internal wars, a pending Bo Xilai trial and rumours about a potential coup. Since then, Mr Xi has consolidated his power and left little doubt as to who is in charge. Analysts call him the most powerful leader since Deng Xiaoping. His main achievement is to have reaffirmed the supremacy of the Communist Party with him at the helm.\n\nHe is the head of state and the military. At the Party Plenum in mid-November, two new bodies - the National Security Council and a special group to oversee reform - were created. Both are likely to fall into his hands or go to a close ally. For the moment, his premier, Li Keqiang, who was, going by tradition, to run daily operations and frame economic policies, has taken a back seat.\n\nMany say the reason Mr Xi has accumulated so much power is to keep the upper hand and to be able to pass reforms, many of which will delve into the vested interests of party officials and state-owned enterprises. But what he has also made clear is that he will not tolerate dissent, whether from inside or outside the party ranks. He has been cracking down on free speech online, removing liberal academics from their college teaching posts and arresting outspoken social activists. And much of his anti-corruption campaign, all the while appealing to the public, has enabled him to place his men in key areas.\n\nIn other words, Mr Xi is seen as an authoritarian with a strong nationalist twist; a political conservative and economic reformist. Indeed, on the economic front, he has done more to shift the economic model than his predecessors in the past decade.\n\nHe is determined to reform a system that inherently creates unproductive debt, imbalances and has reached its limits. The third plenum document was implicit in granting the market a bigger role. It also tackled issues that the last team lacked courage to address: reform of the hukou or household registration, and the one child policy, among others.\n\nThe effects of Mr Xi's determination to advance on economic and social reform are already being felt. Barely one month on, new IPO rules have been drafted, a set of capital account liberalisation policy measures for the Shanghai free trade zone have been announced.\n\nAlso, an evaluation system for local governments was revamped - with energy consumption, environmental protection and food safety to be taken into account alongside GDP (gross domestic product).\n\nThe Economic Work Conference, held at the beginning of December, specifically addressed implementation of the hukou reform.\n\nMr Xi's bet is that by better satisfying the material needs of the Chinese people and continuing to pull out of poverty the millions still in under-urbanised poor areas, he can pass on any political change.\n\nThe word \"democracy\" barely comes up in the Plenum document. His anti-model is Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the USSR, whom he had reportedly accused during a private Party meeting earlier this year of bringing the former communist bloc to the brink of collapse.\n\nOn the contrary, his rhetoric has a neo-Maoist nationalist slant. He has revived practices such as \"self-criticism sessions\" while invoking the Maoist \"mass line\" concept of getting the Party closer to the people. He has also flexed China's muscles on the international scene with the unilateral creation of a defence zone on part of the South China Sea as a sign of a more aggressive and assertive China, much to the displeasure of its neighbours.\n\nMany Chinese scholars and intellectuals who call for more political opening raise the question of whether the current model of a one-party system is sustainable. Analysts say that he is unlikely to touch the foundations of the regime that has nurtured him and bought him to power.\n\n\"We must incessantly consolidate and perfect the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese socialist system, we must incessantly satisfy the people's daily increasing materials and cultural needs,\" he told the National Propaganda and Ideology Work Conference last August in a speech on how to perpetuate communist ideology.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The banks are among about 130 European lenders whose balance sheets and assets are being tested by the European Central Bank (ECB) before it assumes the role of financial regulator at the end of next year.\n\nThe hiatus in lending has left many shipowners struggling to cover operating costs after their fleets expanded while demand slowed, sending charter rates plunging.\n\n\"Commerzbank is exiting the market, and I don't see an urge among other banks to fill that gap,\" said Mr Behrendt, who is also the chief executive officer of Hapag-Lloyd AG, Germany's largest container shipping line. \"Companies need to find new, creative ways of financing - and we are seeing hedge funds, private equity firms and also Chinese banks surveying the market, but hesitance prevails.\"\n\nFinancing for German companies will only improve when the market recovers from the shipping industry slump triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc in 2008, Mr Behrendt said. The glut in vessels will not ease until the end of 2014 at the earliest, he said.\n\n\"Nobody could have foreseen the cave-in that has ripped the shipping industry apart at the seams as a result of Lehman's collapse,\" Mr Behrendt said. \"The banks haven't acted negligently, it was a viable business model until 2008.\"\n\nThe ECB will take over supervision of all euro-area banks next year, after a transition period in which regulators will assess the quality of banks' assets and their resilience to shocks.\n\nBundesbank listed shipping loans as one of three areas in German banking that are particularly vulnerable to default risk in its Financial Stability Review, published on Nov 14.\n\nGermany's shipping industry, which operates the world's third largest merchant fleet, has so far largely been spared from insolvencies of whole shipping companies, said Mr Behrendt.\n\n\"But there were 119 insolvencies of closed-end ship funds this year, which is a dramatic increase,\" he said.\n\nIn the last three years, Germany has seen a total of about 400 insolvencies of KG-ships, an asset financing model specific to Germany in which individuals invest in single vessels, Mr Behrendt said.\n\nThe industry's decline is also prompting consolidation as companies seek shelter through mergers.\n\nHapag-Lloyd is discussing a possible combination with Cia Sud Americana de Vapores SA, Latin America's biggest container shipping line, after talks to merge with local competitor Hamburg Sued failed in March because shareholders of the companies could not agree on terms.\n\nOne example of the few alternative financing models that are emerging is a joint venture formed in September by Rickmers Group, a Hamburg-based shipping company, with funds of New York-based Apollo Global Management LLC to buy container ships with a total investment of as much as US$500 million.\n\nFinancing partnerships between shipowners are also emerging as a way to sidestep the lending squeeze.\n\nPartners, a joint venture announced in August between Hamburg-based ER Capital Holding and Schulte Group, is seeking to buy vessels at current low prices with the aim of selling later at a profit. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHETHER you are an architect, industrial designer, home furnishings retailer or just a design buff, 2013 has been a busy year.\n\n\"This has been a good year. Our architects continue to produce high-quality work evident in the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) Architectural Design Awards and President's Design Awards,\" says Theodore Chan, president of SIA. \"Internationally, they also continue to make their mark.\"\n\nFor a start, faculty housing Kent Vale at Clementi Road won MKPL Architects an award from the Royal Institute of British Architects. Local firms W Architects and CSYA won Arcasia Awards for Architecture.\n\nOn the international front, five projects by Singaporean architects won the vote of judges at the World Architecture Festival.\n\nJeffrey Ho, DesignSingapore Council's executive director, is excited with the bumper crop of 15 designers and designs from the various disciplines that have won big at this year's President's Design Awards. For the first time since its inception in 2006, a floral designer was named Designer of the Year. \"We are also heartened to see that these design leaders are investing time and effort to groom the next generation of designers,\" says Mr Ho.\n\nSingapore's industrial designers also had a good showing at the Milan Salone del Mobile, the world's largest furniture fair. Designer Melvin Ong received a confidence boost when a customer bought his side tables within five minutes of seeing them.\n\nThis year, local design studio Supermama launched Singapore Icons, a range of ceramic ware designed by Singaporeans that bear distinct Singapore icons. In particular, the plates with HDB flats painted on them are so pretty that you would be proud to be seen using them. Safe to say that it is time to banish those Merlion keychains and \"Singapore is a fine city\" T-shirts.\n\nShopping for the home got more exciting too. Department stores Tangs and Robinsons recently unveiled their new homeware sections. Brands exclusive to Tangs include PiP Studio, Jia Inc and Schlossberg. Over at Robinsons Orchard, you can pick up items from Loveramics, Citta Design and Kenzo Maison.\n\nFurniture retailers also brought in new brands, such as Sika Design, a rattan range all the way from Denmark, Roche Bobois from France, and MoreLess, a Shanghainese brand that makes Chinese furniture hip for modern homes.\n\nBT Weekend talks to three designers who impressed us this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I think there is a case for diversification. As and when it happens, it will have to be meaningful. I don't think it makes sense for us to just buy one hospital in five different geographies. We are working on that,\" said Mr Dhillon, adding that its plan to grow its footprint overseas could happen within the next year.\n\nExpanding overseas\n\nIn this respect, its preference would be to invest in more stable markets, such as Australia or Japan, to help offset the risks in emerging markets such as India.\n\nBut even as RHT is ready to look beyond India to fuel growth, it remains cognisant of the opportunities within the populous country, especially as private healthcare continues to gain traction in a nation of over one billion people.\n\nIn India, RHT's portfolio includes 13 operating assets - which typically focus on either single specialities or multiple specialities - as well as four upcoming greenfield sites in Ludhiana, Chennai, Hyderabad and Greater Noida in the coming years. As at March 31, its portfolio was valued at approximately $772 million.\n\nIndia's Fortis Healthcare, probably best remembered for taking on Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional in a takeover battle for then Parkway Holdings, holds 28 per cent of the units in RHT. It also operates RHT's healthcare assets, paying RHT a combination of a base fee, as well as a variable fee which is set at 7.5 per cent of the operating revenue of a hospital. But RHT runs other services which are typically outsourced, such as outpatient services, radiology and food & beverages.\n\nSince its listing in October last year, the business trust has added some 550 beds to its then-portfolio of about 1,700 beds. On Friday, RHT closed at 77 cents per unit, under its IPO price of 90 cents.\n\n\"What we've been working (on) with Fortis is to start with organic growth. That's low-hanging fruit for us. There's limited capital expenditure required,\" he points out, adding that the variable fee serves as a \"huge kicker\" for the trust.\n\nExcluding the four greenfield sites, RHT could add some 1,700 hospital beds by expanding its existing assets. Including them, it could be looking at ramping the portfolio up to a total of 4,600 beds, roughly double what it is today.\n\nFortis, which is backed by Indian billionaires Malvinder and Shivinder Singh, has also been scaling back its international presence through divestments, which could work in RHT's favour.\n\n\"They've re-evaluated the strategy and the focus is now to grow in India,\" Mr Dhillon said. \"That's a huge plus for RHT because future capex is going to come in India, where all our assets are today. We can actually work with Fortis to grow because we can step in on the asset heavy side, while they come in on the operations side. Together, we can work and act as a consolidator in this hugely fragmented industry.\"\n\nHe remains positive where the Indian healthcare market is concerned, citing a \"huge demand-supply gap\", an increasingly affluent middle class, as well as a growing incidence of lifestyle diseases such as heart disease or stroke.\n\n\"In a city like Delhi, there's a shortage of 6,000 beds. In Mumbai, it's as much as 10,000 beds,\" he pointed out.\n\nIndia market\n\nMr Dhillon is also particularly bullish about its new hospital in Gurgaon, which was launched this year and will start contributing revenue from April next year. The multi-speciality hospital, which accounts for nearly a quarter of its portfolio valuation, is already churning out a higher revenue per operating bed of $330,000 vis-a-vis the average revenue per operating bed of $200,000 for the other beds across its portfolio.\n\nIn addition, RHT is eyeing five to six assets where Fortis acts as an operator, but doesn't own the asset. Last month, the trust announced it was in talks with regard to acquiring a clinical establishment in Mohali, Punjab, which is operated by Fortis.\n\nMeanwhile, challenges facing the trust include the depreciation of the Indian Rupee, although RHT has tackled this by hedging its exposures.\n\n\"The policy is to continue to hedge 100 per cent of our distributable income, so on a six-month rolling basis, we hedge 100 per cent of our one year forward,\" he added.\n\nJust last week, it announced that it had entered into forward currency hedging contracts for the year ending Dec 31, 2014.\n\nnishar@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A few hundred feet away, buildings controlled by the Dubai International Financial Centre are almost full.\n\nThe difference is ownership. The office space in the Index on Sheikh Zayed Road was sold in pieces to nine different investors under a system known as strata title, according to developer Union Properties, meaning potential tenants face the prospect of having multiple landlords. The DIFC buildings have one owner, making it easier to lease large amounts of space to individual companies.\n\nOffices that were divided into smaller parts to speed up sales and fund development have vacancy rates stuck at levels seen at the height of Dubai's real estate crisis even as homes, malls, hotels rebound.

The site has a lease term of 60 years, expiring in 2073, with CAG as the lessor.\n\nThe project, which CAG describes as game-changing, is part of efforts to cement Changi's status as the region's preferred air hub as other airports strive to carve out a bigger slice of the pie.\n\nCAG chief executive Lee Seow Hiang said: \"In today's highly competitive landscape where airports around the world are actively competing for passengers' mindshare, we cannot stop innovating. Project Jewel will give us this additional edge.\"\n\nConstruction on Project Jewel will kick-start in the second half of next year, with completion slated for 2018 - not long after the upcoming Terminal 4 is set to open its doors in 2017.\n\nA team of design consultants have been tasked with creating Changi Airport's latest landmark, which will be encased in a distinctive glass and steel dome. The consortium consists of Safdie Architects, which designed another local icon, the Marina Bay Sands integrated resort, Benoy, as well as local architect RSP, which was behind ION Orchard.\n\nThe multi-storey complex will span a total gross floor area of about 134,000 square metres, of which 17,000 sq m will go towards airport operations, 5,000 sq m towards hotel space, 90,000 sq m towards retail space as well as 22,000 sq m towards attractions such as a large indoor garden and 40-metre waterfall. However, the net lettable area of the retail space will total 53,500 sq m.\n\n\"The site presents an ideal opportunity for global and local retailers and F&B operators to create one-of-a-kind stores and dining concepts, to cater to a ready cosmopolitan catchment with more than 50 million passenger movements from 270 cities every year,\" said Lim Beng Chee, chief executive officer of CMA, which has interests in and manages 105 shopping malls across Asia. \"This will provide an ideal platform both for American and European retailers to introduce and promote their offerings in Asia, as well as Asian retailers to do likewise with a global audience.\"\n\nFrom an operational standpoint, Project Jewel will add a passenger handling capacity of three million to Changi's current tally of 66 million per year, in addition to allowing T1 to expand to accommodate greater space for areas such as taxi bays and baggage claim.\n\nAside from connecting passengers to the three existing terminals by foot, the development will also feature facilities dedicated to the fly-cruise and fly-coach passenger segments to make travel experiences smoother. Meanwhile, the basement carpark will nearly treble T1's existing parking facilities to 2,500 parking spots.\n\nBut Changi's transformation will not stop with T4 and the upcoming mixed-use development. Earlier this year, plans for the mega Terminal 5 were unveiled, which will bump up Changi's handling capacity to a total of 135 million passengers per year in the mid-2020s.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, CMA shares closed at $1.905, up half a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ikram Mahawangsa is a Malaysian investment holding company 58 per cent owned by Mr Su and 29 per cent owned by Mr Wong.\n\nHisaka will pay Regal $20 million in cash, and issue 195 million new shares (after a two-into-one consolidation) at $0.55 apiece, as set out in its memorandum of understanding signed in July.\n\nOn completion, the vendors will own about 65 per cent of Hisaka's enlarged share capital.\n\nHisaka said: \"The proposed acquisition represents a good opportunity for the group to expand and diversify its businesses and operations, which will allow it to achieve more consistent and sustainable financial growth.\"\n\nIts balance sheet remains healthy and it stayed in the black in FY2012 and 2013 but net profits were \"slim\" at just $400,000 each fiscal year.\n\nOn a pro-forma basis, it sees its annual net profit being boosted to $575,000 after the acquisition, although earnings per share will dip slightly due to the diluted share count.\n\nRegal's property development business will also improve Hisaka's business potential and prospects, it said.\n\n\"The future plans of the target group companies involve the expansion of its current property development business in Kuching, Sarawak, and expansion of its property development business to other areas outside Kuching, Sarawak.\"\n\nRegal has multiple projects at various stages of development, including residential, commercial, shophouses, hotels and mixed developments.\n\nHisaka will appoint an independent professional valuer to conduct a valuation of Regal's business.\n\nBesides shareholders and Singapore Exchange approvals, the agreement is also subject to Regal's obtaining a waiver to make a mandatory offer for Hisaka, as well as a condition that Regal achieves net earnings of at least $7 million for its fiscal year ending Dec 31, 2013.\n\nHisaka shares rose 7.7 per cent to end at 21 cents yesterday on the news.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This happy state of affairs is defined by not having to work for a living, so one is freed to do whatever one deems important in life. This can be spending more time with the kids, travelling around the world, or taking time off to pursue a cause. With growing income inequality, ordinary people slogging in middle-class jobs might think they can never retire in their lives, and have to keep working till they are over 70. We beg to differ. For a start, those earning the median salary of $3,000 upon starting work stand a good chance of being able to attain financial freedom before they turn 60, or even 40 or 50.\n\nThis is because of two reasons: the mathematical effect of compounding, and the good financial habits one can build up over time. But you have to plan ahead, and above all, start young.\n\n2\n\nOne question: Is one million dollars enough to retire on? Singapore is well-known for having one of the highest proportion of millionaire households in the world. Based on recorded spending patterns and a conservative rate of return of 4 per cent a year, along with inflation of 2 per cent a year, we calculated that $1 million would last a typical HDB family spending $3,600 a month today for 30 years. This means that a million dollars should theoretically be enough for a 50-something breadwinner to retire comfortably with. Of course, families spend more than $3,600 a month on both necessities like healthcare and more extravagant things like overseas holidays and overseas education. And the statistics show that a typical family living in a private flat or landed property could spend anywhere from $7,000 to $9,000 a month.

The reason is simple enough: Plastic - or polymer, as it is called - holds up better than paper. It is also a lot harder to counterfeit.\n\nGovernments worry about such things, with good reason. But that is not what people who must now use polymer bills are concerned about. When Canada began introducing polymer notes in 2011, people grumbled about their slipperiness and their foldability. They thought the plastic bills would melt on hot radiators or car dashboards.\n\nSome people convinced themselves that the notes were infused with a maple syrup scent, a notion that the Bank of Canada dismisses.\n\n\"One of the more improbable urban myths was that the intense heat in Canada caused the notes to melt,\" Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England and previously governor of the Bank of Canada, said at a news conference on Wednesday announcing the notes. \"I can assure you that wasn't the case. Neither has the intense cold in Canada caused them to malfunction.\"\n\nIf a car interior got hot enough to melt a bill - that would be 284 degrees Fahrenheit, or 140 degrees Celsius - the car's interior plastics would begin to sag like a Salvador Dal\u00ed watch. Polymer bills can withstand temperatures as low as minus 103\u00b0F (minus 75\u00b0C), said Richard Wall, the director of currency at the Bank of Canada.\n\nIn an unscientific test using a household oven set to 280\u00b0F, a new C$5 note did not melt. But after eight minutes, it started to smell bad, shrink substantially and curl markedly. Its translucent security features also became opaque blobs.\n\nNow that Canada has completed the transition, the complaints are fewer. But not everyone already using the new money is enthusiastic. In Ottawa, about 2 km south of the future new home of Canadian Bank Note Co, which prints the country's bills, is Di Rienzo Grocery and Deli, where about 300 sandwiches are snapped up each day by a steady stream of customers for C$5 apiece - cash only.\n\nIn the two years since the Bank of Canada first introduced polymer bills, Paolo Di Rienzo, the owner of the impossibly crowded and chaotic deli, has developed a long list of grievances. He says the bills stick to one another. Yet, he also says their slippery surface allows them to slip easily, unnoticed, out of pockets. The light, springy bills sometimes leap out of the cash register, according to Mr Di Rienzo. And, he says, polymer does not really fold.\n\n\"You have to really watch when they give you the money and when you give the money back,\" Mr Di Rienzo said. \"The other ones were much better, the regular ones.\"\n\nOverhearing Mr Di Rienzo while waiting for a sandwich, Domenico Nicolo, a taxi driver, pulled out a C$100 polymer note and began rubbing what he said was its excessively slippery surface. \"A lot of people complain about them,\" Mr Nicolo said of his customers. He now checks much more carefully for bills that have stuck together.\n\nThe only good thing Mr Nicolo could say about polymer bills was that they survived accidental trips through washing machines.\n\nOne factor trumped everything when it came to Canada's decision to use polymer. \"It was all about improving the security of bank notes,\" Bank of Canada's Mr Wall said. \"We had a fairly substantial level of counterfeiting in 2004.\"\n\nWhile Canada had already incorporated various holographic security devices in its paper bills, polymer enabled more complex protection.\n\nThe new Canadian bills have a transparent window that contains large, colour-shifting images of Parliament buildings and a portrait of Queen Elizabeth, Canada's formal head of state, or famous Canadian politicians. Small metallic details, including the note's denomination, also swirl around in the window. A circle of numbers appears in a second tiny window shaped like a maple leaf, the national symbol.\n\nIt was the success that Canada and other countries have had in warding off counterfeiters that prompted the Bank of England to consider plastic currency, according to Victoria Cleland, the head of the bank's notes division. \"With bank notes, you want to understand how things have worked in true-life testing,\" Ms Cleland said.\n\nThe Bank of England made its decision on polymer notes after a long process in which the public was able to view and feel the bills during events at several malls and universities. The bank said 87 per cent of the people it talked to supported the move.\n\nThe first polymer note in Britain, a \"fiver\", will be released in 2016 and will feature Winston Churchill. A year later, Jane Austen will appear on a \u00a310 note.\n\nMr Carney reassured the British public that the queen's visage would also appear on both notes. \"Our polymer notes will combine the best of progress and tradition.\"\n\nHe also said it would make the British pound decidedly more presentable. \"We have a bit of an issue in this country with the tattiness of notes over time. You think about the \u00a35 note: Quite often you get one you want to get rid of as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Which is a good thing from an economic perspective, to some extent,\" he said with a laugh.

Designer Melvin Ong experienced that when he took part at the Tortona Design Week in Milan earlier this year.\n\n\"An Italian lady bought all three of my Monolith side tables on the spot and carried them home by hand,\" says Mr Ong, founder of Desinere design studio. \"I think that was the most sales I had ever made in five minutes. For a young startup, it was very encouraging and a huge affirmation for me.\"\n\nDesinere is slightly more than a year old, and is slowly but surely going places.\n\nMr Ong says his studio's first year has been \"rather interesting with trips to Germany and Milan with the Singapore Furniture Industries Council as well as exhibitions at Designtide Tokyo and at Tortona Design week\".\n\nHe confesses that there have been trying moments too, as this is his first time running a studio/business. \"It has not been great financially but very rewarding now that things are slowly taking shape.\"\n\nDesinere launched several products this year, such as the Monolith side tables, Rok concrete paperweights, and the Tembusu plates as part of the Singapore icons projects.\n\nThe Tembusu plates were named Design of the Year at the President's Design Awards.\n\nMr Ong was part of a team that was tasked to create a new Singapore souvenir. He picked the Tembusu tree for his design, as \"it is such a unique historical icon of Singapore that existed way before our independence\".\n\nHe was quite surprised to learn that the plates would be put up for nomination. \"It was almost surreal when I heard about the nomination. I never expected to go so far as to win Design of the Year.\"\n\nThe Rok concrete paperweights could be Mr Ong's next big hit.\n\nMr Ong says that when he creates a product, \"I am very conscious that each project would feature a different material or medium\".\n\nThe Rok paperweights were a totally unfamiliar ground for him and it was a product that he struggled for almost a year to refine, to a stage where he feels comfortable enough to retail it.\n\n\"It was about a transformation of a mundane material to something unexpected, changing the perception of a monotonous construction material to one that features intricate facets,\" explains Mr Ong.\n\nHe will be doing more collaborations with other designers next year, such as designing jewellery pieces and table objects meant to complement terrariums.\n\n\"I'll be showing at the 100% Design exhibition in London in September. So I have plenty of time to plan and prepare for that next year,\" he says. \"I'm quite keen to do some products in marble and stone, so that's definitely in the books for 2014.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The economy grew at a 2.5 per cent pace in the April-June quarter.\n\nBusiness spending increased at a 4.8 per cent rate instead of the 3.5 per cent pace reported early this month. That reflected stronger growth in intellectual property products than previously reported.\n\nThere were also revisions to consumption. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of US economic activity, was revised up 0.6 per centage point to a 2 per cent rate. The revisions reflected higher spending on both goods and services than previously estimated.\n\nRevisions to spending on gasoline and other energy goods accounted for part of the upward revision to spending on goods, while spending on healthcare and other services also was higher than previously estimated.\n\nConsumer spending grew at a 1.8 per cent rate in the second quarter.\n\nBusiness spending on equipment was revised up to a 0.2 per cent pace. It had previously been reported as being flat.\n\nThat left domestic demand rising at a 2.3 per cent rate, instead of the 1.8 per cent pace the government reported earlier this month.\n\nExport growth was also raised by two-tenths of a percentage point to a 3.9 per cent pace.\n\nSpending on residential construction was lowered by 2.7 percentage points to a 10.3 per cent rate in the third quarter.\n\nA large build-up of stocks still accounted for much of the increase in GDP growth in the July- September quarter. That has left economists anticipating a sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation, which would hurt fourth-quarter growth.\n\nBusinesses accumulated US$115.7 billion worth of inventory. That compared to prior estimates of US$116.5 billion.\n\nSo far there is little sign that businesses are pulling back, with stocks at retailers, auto dealerships and wholesalers increasing solidly in October.\n\nSome economists say the inventory drag on GDP could be delayed until the first quarter of 2014, while others believe the third-quarter stock pile-up was probably planned.\n\nAn inventory drag in the first three months of 2014 is likely to be offset by some loosening of fiscal policy.

By Jaime Ee\n\nListen to this article\n\nPublished Fri, Dec 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBAGAN has everything going for it when you're smitten with the idea of going back in time and experiencing a life when kings ruled and the main mode of transportation was a horse and carriage. But when you're a novice temple tourist from the 21st century, history is best enjoyed when it's served with a cold welcome drink, butler service and free wi-fi.\n\nSuch is the thought that crosses your mind as you land at Bagan's tiny little Nyaung U airport after a rather nerve-jangling two-hour flight from Yangon's domestic airport in an airplane that would look more at home in an aviation museum. It lands right in front of the terminal building - so compact that there is no baggage belt and you pick out your bags as handlers carry them in and set them on the floor. You pass through a haphazard crowd that mills around a desk where military-like staff collect the entrance fee to enter the Bagan archaeological zone, but it looks so disorganised no one seems to care if you walk out without paying. But our law-abiding Singaporean DNA doesn't allow us to do that. Which is just as well because a motley group of cheapskate American tourists is nabbed for trying to sneak out and forced to stump up the US$15 a head - a small price to pay to immerse oneself in this ancient land known for its 3000 plus temples and stupas dating back to the 9th century.\n\nWe are rescued from the confusion by our pickup from Bagan Lodge, one of the newest properties that are a testament of Burma's new found interest in the tourism business. On the way, we pass by a good string of faded, crumbling temples looking like a photo essay come to life. The ancient structures pop up like mushrooms amidst lush green landscape that's been kept refreshingly free of any other structures, modern or otherwise. Even when we turn into the newly-built Bagan Lodge, it's a discreet, low-lying property that moulds seamlessly into the surroundings.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

In five years, the goal is to have a presence in every luxury and fashion capital of the world.\n\n\"We're determined to create the No 1 luxury tea (brand) in Asia for the world,\" says Taha Bouqdib, TWG president and co-founder.\n\nTWG, in which Singapore Exchange-listed OSIM International has a 53.7 per cent stake, is taking on Asia first because it's a harder market to crack than Europe - not because it's the original home of tea.\n\n\"After this (building its presence in Asia), the world would be easy (to conquer),\" explains Mr Bouqdib, a tea master blender who is French of Moroccan descent.\n\nWhile Asians have been drinking tea for a long time, paying high prices for high quality tea is still new to many.\n\nAlready, they are complaining about paying $1 for a glass of \"teh-o\" in coffeeshops, where it used to cost five to 10 cents. Many eyes will widen when they see the price list on the TWG menu - even when the boutique's luxury decor is a hint enough that it's not going to be cheap.\n\nA pot of tea starts at $12.50, while a \"first flush\" Darjeeling, the Rolls Royce of tea, costs up to $27. A kilogramme of premium yellow tea retails for as much as $3,000.\n\nIn Europe, where tea boutiques are common in key cities such as London and Paris, such prices won't raise any eyebrows.\n\nWhile opening more outlets, TWG will also be making a big marketing push to \"educate\" consumers to embrace tea-drinking as a \"unique\" lifestyle - and to accept its high prices.\n\nIt has started a tea school for TWG's nearly 600 employees to learn all about tea, but this will also be open to the public.\n\nTWG outlets are already drawing long queues, and Mr Bouqdip says that they are making money. The big expansion ahead also reflects TWG's success so far.\n\nMany of the markets where it is aiming are predictable targets: China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai. These are fast-rising and rich markets with money to splurge.\n\nThere are also surprises: South Korea, the Philippines and Cambodia.\n\nCambodia is the least developed market on the target list, but TWG is not eyeing so much the locals; it hopes to \"catch\" the many Cambodian refugees who got rich overseas but are now returning home to help rebuild the country. Many of them have lived in Europe and have adopted its high-tea culture, says Mr Bouqdib.\n\nTWG plans to open two tea boutiques in Cambodia.\n\nAs for the Philippines, there are already enough rich and famous customers to keep four TWG outlets in Manila busy - and crying out for another to open, which Mr Bouqdib says will be in the first three months of next year.\n\nSouth Korea is a surprise because, while affluent, the rugged Koreans are known to be hard drinkers rather than tea lovers.\n\nApparently, that's not all true; Koreans also love tea. South Korea is actually one of TWG's 10 biggest markets. And it has room for two more boutiques in the coming year.\n\n\"They have a tea culture, they have tea ceremonies,\" Mr Bouqdib points out.\n\nTea ceremonies are more reminiscent of Japan, where TWG now has three outlets, including a shop in the banking district of Marunouchi. The company has earmarked a tea boutique in Ginza and has struck an agreement with shopping giant Takashimaya to open outlets in all its shopping malls in Japan.\n\nIn China, TWG has budgeted for three outlets in Shanghai, one in Beijing and 12 in Shenzhen next year. TWG teas are already served in 300 five-star hotels in the country.\n\nTWG is targeting up to three new boutiques in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. In Singapore, it's adding two outlets to take the totalto 11.\n\nIn the Middle East, TWG continues to expand in Dubai - it already has two boutiques there - and will open its first boutique in Qatar.\n\nMr Bouqdib says that the Middle East is a fast-growing market for TWG. In just three months recently, it signed up 25 five-star hotels to serve TWG teas.\n\nTWG is also pushing to build its tea distribution by tying up with upscale hotels, global airlines and speciality gourmet stores.\n\nAnd this will not be confined to Asia and the Middle East. TWG also has its eye on Europe and North America.\n\nTWG teas are already sold in Harrods in London, Dean & Deluca in New York and gourmet delicatessens in other parts of the world.\n\nTWG recently scored an important breakthrough when it became the only tea brand, apart from Harrod's own, to have a store-in-store in Harrod's celebrated Tea & Coffee Hall. This is likely to pave the way for a bigger presence in Britain, a long-time tea-drinking nation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After a round of layoffs and bonus cuts, when some banks even exited the region, the IPO revival would give a much-needed boost to bank revenue.\n\nUBS, which has come out on top of Asia-Pacific equity capital market league tables for eight of the past nine years, raked in US$220.9 million in estimated fees, buoyed by its strong presence in South-east Asia. \"This year's ECM activity was healthier in part because of product breadth and specifically because market appetite for IPOs came back for longer and in a more consistent fashion than it has in years,\" said Damien Brosnan, head of the Asia ex-Japan equity syndicate at UBS.\n\nThe Swiss bank worked on US$18.4 billion worth of deals, ahead of Goldman Sachs, which managed US$16.2 billion, and Credit Suisse with US$7.4 billion.\n\nGoldman Sachs ranked second in ECM fees, earning US$173.8 million, followed by JPMorgan with $150.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting Co estimates.\n\nEquity issuance in the region fell 5 per cent to US$163.9 billion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data through Dec 17.\n\nProceeds from initial public offerings, however, rose 2.3 per cent to US$40.6 billion as a surge in new listings in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong helped offset weaker markets in Malaysia and South Korea and the absence of deals in mainland China.\n\nBankers and analysts expect a bumper year in 2014, with large offerings in Hong Kong putting the city at centre stage for IPOs again.

Helmed by chef Kenjiro 'Hatch' Hashida, the Mandarin Gallery eatery is the first overseas outpost of Hashida Tokyo - run by Hatch's father Tokio for the past 40 years. Thanks to a partnership with a Singapore investor, the Singapore Hashida offers a winning package of quality sushi, good value for money and an impressive designer setup that makes you feel like you're in Tokyo.\n\nSeafood Supreme\n\nThe Naked Finn's fashionably ramshackle plastic shack in the art enclave of Gillman Barracks well deserves its indie reputation for serving pristine seafood from around the world as simply as possible, so all you get is the clean, unadorned flavours of the sea. One of the year's best dishes is also to be found here: owner Ken Loon's take on local prawn mee is a potent brew of amaebi and dried sakura ebi fried in olive oil and simmered in pork stock for seven hours, eaten with rice noodles and lightly grilled Spanish gambas (prawns) carabinero.\n\nTim's The One\n\nThree branches on and the crowds still haven't lightened - complain all you will but there's no denying that when it comes to bo lo buns, pan-fried radish cake and fluffy ma lai ko (steamed sponge cake), it is hard to top Tim Ho Wan. In fact, it's even better now that it's invested in equipment to standardise the consistency of the Hong Kong Michelin-starred dim sum eatery's specialties. Yes, it's a pain to get in but those buns are well worth it.\n\nNight light\n\nWe thought it would be a pretentious concept, but NOX - Dining in the Dark changed our minds with its heartfelt concept of showing empathy to the visually-impaired. Save for loudmouthed fellow diners, the experience of being served by blind waiters in pitch black surroundings is novel and almost inspiring. And the food is pretty good too.\n\nComeback kid\n\nPoster boy for Peranakan cuisine Malcolm Lee brings back his earnest approach to heritage cooking at his new digs in Dorsett Residences. While not a super-stickler for tradition, Lee's youthful spin breathes life into classics without straying too far. He may bend the rules a little with the likes of chendol panna cotta and buah keluak ice cream, but so long as he keeps the faith and maintains the standards, he's a talent worth supporting.\n\nPastry chef to watch\n\nLes Amis's Cheryl Koh may not be a household name but the low-profile pastry chef has been creating memorable desserts since September when she and French chef Sebastien Lepinoy took over the kitchen of the French dining stalwart.\n\nOne has yet to come across another dessert that can beat her candied whole mikan (Japanese orange) filled with panna cotta, sorbet and Earl Grey jelly. Unless, of course, she comes up with something else.\n\nHedonistic charms\n\nOstentatious decor and clubbiness aside, Fat Duck alumnus Ivan Brehm and his team have pulled together the right combination of forward-thinking originality and comforting familiarity in Bacchanalia, with highlights like raw hamachi lightly cured in starfruit and citrus juice for a refreshing take on ceviche.\n\nHappy endings\n\nWhat a lovely lot of good a humble bundle of wood can do as chef David Pynt proves at Burnt Ends - part of the Unlisted Collection's little empire of restaurants in the Keong Saik neighbourhood. With two wood-fired kilns that heat up to 200 and 800 degrees Celsius, Pynt's must-try quail eggs have a delicate smokey aftertaste and runny yolks deliciously snuggled within, while the grilled leeks with hazelnuts unleash a glorious buttery fragrance in the mouth.\n\nThe only down-side is the restaurant's annoyingly strict no-reservations policy during peak dining hours - an instant no-go for corporate dining.\n\nLOWS\n\nJamie's Not Italian\n\nMany a home cook will swear by Jamie Oliver's easy-peasy recipes so it's a mystery why the chefs at the much-hyped but totally underwhelming Jamie's Italian can't seem to follow the same methods. Despite its vibrant, kitschy-cute decor, the 210-seater in Vivocity is strictly for die-hard Oliver fans.\n\nFishy concept\n\nThe political correctness of eating fish while a school of its live relatives swims beside you in a large glass-encased aquarium is just one of the reasons keeping us from going back to Ocean restaurant in Resorts World Singapore. But mostly, it's the lacklustre food supposedly designed by ex-Iron Chef Cat Cora. Maybe it's gotten better since, but when your last meal there left you more shell-shocked than an oyster which didn't expect to be shucked, you can understand our misgivings.\n\nWeird Food #1\n\nWe're all for thinking or cooking out of the box, but when a chef goes so far left field as to add thickener to bak kut teh and call it cream of bak kut teh, you're not sure whether to ask for yu tiao to dip into it or just turn green at the thought. This floury soup at LE Restaurant and Asian Tapas Bar is just one of the few failed fusion creations that detract from what is otherwise a decent Chinese restaurant. Makes us wish that restaurants would be wary of following trends for trends' sake and just stick to what they know best.\n\nWeird Food #2\n\nEven the most skilful chef can set himself up for disaster when taking on well-loved local hawker fare. Which was the case when locavore Adrian Ling rebranded his modern European bistro Pamplemousse into local fusion restaurant, Pidgin.\n\nHis bak kwa ham and cheese is a rubbery testament of the \"truffle oil makes everything better\" fallacy, while a bowl of tau suan comprising razor clams and mung beans in a too-salty, dill-scented starchy soup has us wondering exactly what he had in mind. Props are due, however, for working plenty of local produce such as Pulau Ubin oysters and locally bred quail and frogs into his recipes.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The STI is still 73 points or 2.3 per cent down for the year to date.\n\nThe only other feature worth mentioning about the week was a spirited attempt by house traders and other punters to try and stir interest in penny stocks via rotational plays.\n\nIn yesterday's session, for example, activity focused on Charisma Energy, HanKore and SIIC Environment (formerly Asia Water Technology), all priced below 10 cents. As one trader said: \"I don't know what any of these stocks are or what the companies do and I'm sure most of those playing it don't either, but who cares.\"\n\nOverall, volume continued to be subdued - in yesterday's session when punting of penny stocks pushed the unit volume to three billion units, dollar value was only $1.2 billion, of which $563 million or 47 per cent was done in STI components. The average unit value traded was 40 cents, roughly in line with the sub-50-cent daily averages of the previous few weeks.\n\nTapering, though, was the main talking point because markets have been wondering if it might start for about seven months now. When it did finally arrive on Wednesday, relief swept through the US market which propelled stocks just over 2 per cent higher.\n\nThere was also an element of \"sell in anticipation, buy on news\" about the way Wall St reacted. The actual quantum of the taper, US$10 billion out of US$85 billion per month, was small and possibly seen as not significantly affecting liquidity conditions.\n\nIn its outlook for next year titled \"Asia 2014 - Inclement weather ahead\" issued last week, Commerzbank said that although investors are now better prepared for tapering, volatility is still expected to rise in the coming year.\n\n\"We don't see a repeat of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis on liquidity outflows due to reduced leverage and improved fundamentals,\" the bank said. \"The negatives of Fed tapering will be felt immediately via higher yields while the positives of stronger exports may come with a lag.\"\n\nIn his analysis of the Fed's latest actions, Schroders' chief economist Keith Wade noted the Fed's concerns about low inflation - the central bank mentioned inflation three times in its statement - but said that although inflation certainly is troublingly low, it is a lagging indicator.\n\n\"There are already signs that wages are responding to the fall in unemployment and as the labour market tightens further, which leading indicators suggest it will, price pressures will pick up,\" said Mr Wade.\n\n\"Compared to the Fed's projections we also see more upside risks to growth in 2014 as there is scope for a stronger consumer as employment and incomes rise and wealth effects continue to improve balance sheets and confidence...\n\n\"Ben Bernanke has every right to be cautious after the experience of the past few years, but there was an opportunity here to herald a turn in the economy and a new phase of growth. Instead of dispensing seasonal cheer he seems stuck in crisis mode.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I hope for more social consciousness in our future work.\"\n\nThe accolades have come fast and furious since last year, culminating with the Designer of the Year award this year.\n\nIn October, 118 Killiney and 36 Victoria Park won Mr Yip awards in the Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA) Architectural Design Awards.\n\nLast year, 19 Sunset Place received a Design of the Year award. The same project, together with 3 Lermit Road and 9 Leedon Park, bagged design awards at the SIA Architectural Design Awards. 19 Sunset Place and 3 Lermit Road also snagged the prize in the top categories of Building Of The Year and Best Project Under $1.5 Million, respectively.\n\nNo surprise then to hear that \"2013 has been another good year\", he says. \"Winning is a great honour and it comes with responsibility - a duty to push further and do more.\"\n\nThe architect says he does not have a design philosophy but rather has a specific approach. \"Architecture is part science and part art. It must satisfy constraints of time and money but also satisfy the spirit. Practising in Singapore is my personal journey of finding what it is like to design and get things built in Singapore.\"\n\nHe is working on several houses, an apartment block, and a factory building for an aeronautical company.\n\nSome clients are aware that they have hired an award winning architect, but some don't.

The partnerships will be set up in each territory next year, Hong Kong-based AIA said.\n\nThe deal gives AIA access to holders of more than 34 million individual accounts as New York-based Citigroup replaces about 150 separate agreements across the region. While no financial details were disclosed, a person familiar with the sale told Bloomberg this month the agreement could generate as much as US$20 billion in revenue, including commissions and upfront fees.\n\n\"For Citigroup, it's revenues without expense - basically they're getting a new product,\" said Jim Antos, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. \"They just need the salespeople, and they already have plenty of salespeople.\"\n\nThe accord lets the companies tap a region that has a lower rate of insurance penetration than others. Some 2.6 per cent of people in the Asia-Pacific region have life insurance, compared with 3.65 per cent in the US and 8.44 per cent in the UK, according to Swiss Re research cited in the Citigroup statement.\n\nThe 11 markets covered by the partnership are China, Hong Kong, India, Australia, Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam, the companies said.\n\nCitigroup's individual customer accounts in the Asia-Pacific region held US$218 billion of assets, according to the bank's statement. Asia accounted for 21 per cent of the lender's revenue in the three months ended September, making it Citigroup's largest market outside North America, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAIA, established in Shanghai more than 90 years ago, operates in 17 markets in the region and had US$147 billion of assets at the end of May, according to its statement.\n\nThailand and Hong Kong are the company's biggest markets, accounting for at least 20 per cent of revenue in the six months to May 31, data compiled by Bloomberg show. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

No cash is actually changing hands.\n\nArtivision shares closed at 9 cents per share on Tuesday, before the announcement was made.\n\nArtivision chairman Philip Soh said 212 DB is currently loss-making, and the valuation for the initial investment was based on fund-raising that 212 DB did to launch the game and sign up artists as partners.\n\nThe subsequent investment to raise the stake to 10 per cent, if it occurs, will have to be valued at a minimum of US$9 million, or a total valuation of US$180 million for all of 212 DB.\n\nArtivision's market capitalisation was $55.4 million at the close of yesterday.\n\n212 DB's main business is running the Play Gig-It game, which was launched in July 2013 and currently has 4,400 players and a 3.5-star rating, according to information by Artivision and on Facebook. The top-rated, most-used simulation game on Facebook, Hay Day, has five million players and a 4.5-star rating.\n\nPlay Gig-It allows players to design and share virtual music concerts using avatars styled after real artists such as Lil' Wayne and Flo Rida.\n\nThe investment will allow Artivision to put its video advertising and facial recognition technology in the game, and both companies will seek to expand the game into China, Korea and South-east Asia, including seeking Asian artists to add to the platform.\n\nThe deal is the latest attempt by Artivision, which listed on Catalist in 2008 and has been lossmaking since 2006, to find profitability.\n\nThe company recently bought Colibri Assembly Thailand Co, a hard disk drive technology products contract manufacturer.\n\nMr Soh said Colibri is a strategic investment \"because it will provide cash flow for the company\" as it tries to be profitable in its other businesses.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But they were mixed on the strength of the Singapore dollar in the second half of 2014.\n\nThe volatility in currencies will last until next quarter as \"people start repositioning where to earn the highest returns with lowest risk\", said Leslie Tang, Maybank Singapore senior foreign exchange analyst.\n\nThere was more of a consensus on interest rates, as they take the Fed's cue.\n\n\"Based on Fed economic forecasts, this implies a rate hike in late 2015 or early 2016, so we still have another two years of the zero interest rate environment,\" said Richard Jerram, Bank of Singapore chief economist.\n\nThe Singapore dollar (SGD) fell about 0.2 per cent to 1.26347 against the US unit in the morning while the biggest loser among Asian currencies was the ringgit, by 0.7 per cent to 3.2791.\n\n\"The ringgit's hit reflects the foreign interest in their bond markets,\" said Tim Riddell, ANZ head of global markets research, Asia. Foreign interest in ringgit government bonds is the highest in the region, he noted.\n\n\"Fed's announcement to start tapering in January came earlier than market expectations . . . it signals the start of US monetary policy normalisation, which is supportive of the US dollar (USD),\" said Tan Teck Leng, UBS Wealth Management foreign exchange strategist.\n\nThe greenback strengthened broadly against G-10 and Asian currencies, by around 0.5 per cent on average, he added.\n\nCurrencies which are more vulnerable would be the Indonesian rupiah (IDR) and Indian rupee (INR), given these countries' relatively weaker current account balances within Asia, he said.\n\n\"We expect the IDR and INR to weaken towards 12,500 and 63, respectively, versus the USD in the short term\", Mr Tan said. The SGD is likely to be fairly resilient to the Fed taper, given Singapore's robust current account surplus of 17.6 per cent of GDP, he said.\n\nSome analysts think the SGD will weaken throughout next year as USD strength will continue to pressure Asia.\n\nAlvin Liew, United Overseas Bank senior economist, forecasts that the SGD would fall further to 1.33 by end-2014.\n\nBut others say that as the US economy gathers momentum, it will fuel growth of export-centric Asian countries and their currencies would then recover, including that of Singapore.\n\n\"On a longer-term basis, we can still expect a modest appreciation in Asian currencies,\" said Mr Tan. \"The underlying fundamental drivers of the Fed taper - strengthening US economic data and declining fiscal policy risks - are supportive of Asia exports growth recovery. We look for the SGD to recover towards 1.23 by end-2014, given its current account surplus and the MAS policy of currency appreciation.\"\n\nDavid Carbon, DBS Bank chief economist, is sticking to his guns for the moment and remains sceptical of the strength of the US economy. There is no change to his forecast for the SGD to rally to 1.20 by end-2014, he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, he had expected tapering to begin next year and the Fed to even make a U-turn if housing prices start to fall. \"For me, the question remains: will the Fed be able to stick it out? The same worries here as discussed a couple days ago - consumption growth is at a 3.5-year low, business investment is running at 1.6 per cent quarter on quarter for the past three quarters and core capital expenditure shipments showing zero growth for 18 months.\"\n\nHousing will be key. \"Starts were 'strong' in November but September, October and November (numbers) were all released the same day, suggesting they don't know what they've got. Building permits have slowed markedly, without the volatility in starts per se,\" he said.\n\nAnd mortgage applications fell by 5 per cent in a single week last week and are now down by 20 per cent from May, he noted.\n\n\"This isn't slower growth, it's falling levels - a whole other kettle of fish,\" he said.\n\nBut there is more agreement on interest rates which is that even if they begin to rise, the movement will be very small.\n\n\"The Fed is bending over backwards to make the point that short rates will stay low for a long time . . . markets believe short-term rates in the US will be at zero for another 21 months,\" said Mr Carbon.\n\nAnd with the European Central Bank still cutting rates and Japan only 35 per cent of the way towards doubling its monetary base, Singapore interest rates (which are basically a basket of US, EU and JP rates) are going to be near zero for quite some time to come, he said.\n\nSaid Mr Liew: \"Although the US Federal Reserve is keeping the Fed funds target rate at the current ultra-low rate, the quantitative easing taper may start to put pressure on short-end rates in Singapore.\"\n\nHowever, this would be a modest increase compared with historical levels, he said. \"Our revised forecast is for the key 3-month Singapore interbank offered rate to reach 0.46 per cent by Q1 2014 from 0.40 per cent and rise to 0.58 per cent by the end of 2014.\"\n\nOn interest rates, the taper is also unlikely to have much effect, said Sanjay Mathur, Royal Bank of Scotland's chief Asia economist. \"Overall this is a good development.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The latter accounts for about three-quarters of all public buses.\n\nLosses at SBST's bus and rail businesses caused its net profit to dive 43.8 per cent to $3.54 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2013.\n\nLast month, Maybank Kim Eng Research said it expects \"significant fare hikes of 5 per cent per annum in the next three years, before reverting to a more normalised annual rise of 2.7 per cent\", because an estimated 8 per cent of accumulated fare revision was not implemented in 2012/13. A rollover of the fare adjustment quantum is now allowed for future hikes.\n\nWith the submission of SBST's proposal, the PTC is expected to assess it and unveil its decision in the first quarter of 2014. Any fare adjustment is likely to be implemented by the second quarter.\n\nBut this year's process could be a bit more complicated than the past because of a new fare formula and the introduction of new and enhanced concession schemes.\n\nThe new formula will be more responsive, with fare adjustments equal to the price index minus a revised productivity extraction, where the price index features a new energy index component to track energy costs, in addition to a revised core CPI and an unchanged wage index. The new fare formula will apply from 2013 to 2017.\n\nTwo new concession schemes - one for low income workers and another for people with disabilities - will be funded by the government, but the enhancements to existing concession schemes will be borne by commuters.\n\nThese include free travel for children below seven (currently, only children below 0.9 metre travel for free); cheaper monthly passes for polytechnic students (polytechnic and university students pay the same amount now); cheaper hybrid monthly passes for all; concessions for all full-time students; enhanced senior citizen concessions; and adult monthly travel passes which cap the monthly expenditure for frequent users.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/higher-rate-world-still-coming", "site_title": "A higher-rate world is still coming", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA higher-rate world is still coming\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 19, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE post-global financial crisis stock market rally in developed economies continued yesterday with the announcement by the US Federal Reserve to begin tapering its massive monetary stimulus programme. After five years of uncertainty, sentiment is finally turning positive. The Fed endorsement of positive views on the economy, along with an indication that interest rates might be kept low for longer, quelled the doubts of those who feared that higher interest rates will stifle a recovery.\n\nBut investors who have yet to jump into the five-year rally are justified in asking whether it is too late to enter. After all, stock market indices have more than doubled in the US and just about doubled in Singapore, all on relatively low liquidity. Meanwhile, the global economic recovery remains slow. Companies have not performed to earnings expectations. China is slowing down as it tries to shift its economy into one that is led by domestic consumption, rather than foreign investment. Current account deficit problems in Indonesia and India can also derail growth. Small businesses in Singapore are struggling to expand amid labour curbs and higher wage costs. Valuation metrics indicate that bubbles already exist in some areas like US technology or some property markets. Bad economic news or a macroeconomic shock can easily bring about a correction.\n\nOn the whole, equities are not in overwhelmingly frothy territory yet. The US might be looking expensive, but there are still cheap buys in China, Russia and Europe. In defensive, stable Singapore, the stock market is slightly down for the year, and trading just about or slightly below long-term price-to-earnings ratios. Meanwhile, loose monetary conditions look set to prevail for a while longer, and this is good news for investors. Short-term interest rates are projected to stay near zero through 2014, rising to less than one per cent by end-2015.\n\nBut investors have to recognise that a low-rate world will not last forever. A sharper rise is still possible once inflation hits amid a heating US economy and low unemployment, or if economic uncertainties strike and the risks of borrowers not repaying their debts rise. Furthermore, it is in the interest of the Fed not to lull market participants into thinking it is always there to bail them out or inflate prices while excessive risk-taking goes on.\n\nInvestors will thus be well-served by preparing themselves for a world where short-term interest rates return to the Fed's own long-term projections of 3 to 4 per cent. In this environment, mortgages will cost more, higher discount rates mean lower asset prices, and savers will once more have an edge over borrowers. Time-tested characteristics of companies that do well in this environment include having a strong cash flow, low debt and prudent management. While a higher-rate world might not come so soon, long-term investors have to be prepared for the bubbles that inevitably form along the way. Low rates do not last forever. Throughout history, fortunes have been lost as irrationally exuberant investors persisted with the belief that \"this time is different\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/all-calm-asian-front-fed-ends-2013-taper", "site_title": "All calm on Asian front as Fed ends 2013 on a taper", "publish_date": null, "content": "All calm on Asian front as Fed ends 2013 on a taper\n\nAssurance of prolonged low interest rates soothed markets: observers\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 19, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Almost seven months after speculation of the move first roiled Asian markets, the US Federal Reserve finally made a widely watched decision to reduce next month an unprecedented, massive, open-ended and disruptive bond-buying stimulus programme.\n\nAt the same time, the Fed assuaged market fears of tightened monetary conditions by indicating that short-term interest rates will be near-zero for longer. Low interest rates boost stock and property prices and ensure that businesses who want to invest amid a global economic recovery can do so with minimal borrowing costs.\n\nThe fine balance struck between what would seem a tightening stance and assurances that loose monetary conditions would remain for a while more caused US stock markets to surge to all-time highs and stock markets in Asia to stay relatively calm. Markets in Japan, Taiwan, Australia and Indonesia rose, while Malaysia and Korea were flat. Stocks in China, Hong Kong, India, Thailand and the Philippines fell. Meanwhile, European equities rallied.\n\nThe Singapore market was up slightly, closing at 3,070.23 points, up 0.28 per cent or 8.45 points. Observers pointed out that Singapore's safe haven characteristics should withstand taper-inspired capital outflows.\n\nBut Joanne Goh, regional equity strategist at DBS Bank, noted that low interest rates and strong inflows had driven up Singapore's currency and property market, leading to higher risks of liquidity outflows upon tapering. This is mitigated somewhat by its exposure to global growth. \"Singapore stocks are likely to be trapped in a range going forward until we have more growth confirmation,\" she said.\n\nInterest rate-sensitive companies include real estate developers with debt burdens, real estate investment trusts (Reits) and banks. Asked about the impact of tapering, Jason Ho, head of asset liability management at OCBC Bank, said the bank does not anticipate interest rates rising in the near term, but \"will look to manage its assets and liabilities portfolios given the longer-term outlook on interest rates\".\n\nA City Developments spokesperson told The Business Times that the property and hotel player \"does not expect any significant impact in the short term\" from tapering. Other factors like property cooling measures and general economic and geopolitical developments will also affect the company and industry, she said.\n\nOn the whole, Asian equities are not expected to do too well, with fundamentals a concern. Andrew Swan, head of Asian equities at asset manager BlackRock, said volatility will increase for countries more dependent on foreign financing as tapering continues throughout 2014.\n\nHowever, the bigger picture is that after taking tapering into account, most fund houses remain positive on equities as an asset class. Stocks are looking pricey in the US, but there are opportunities in Europe, where companies still trade at below-average valuations. After recent sell-offs, emerging markets are trading at an increasingly wider discount to developed markets.\n\nHow well companies perform next year will also be more important in determining equity performance, compared with the past few years when easy liquidity buoyed all companies. \"Following two years of strong performance, equities are entering the mature stage of a bull market, with returns likely to be limited to single digits in 2014,\" said HSBC Global Research. \"The next leg-up has to come from earnings growth.\"\n\nThe US began its third round of quantitative easing last September, purchasing US$85 billion of bonds a month in a move known as QE3. It was also dubbed QE Infinity as the Fed did not have a fixed deadline to end its purchases. The move came as short-term interest rates, near zero since the financial crisis struck in 2008-9, could not be lowered directly by the Fed any more. Purchasing longer-dated bonds to push down interest rates to stimulate the economy was an experiment in monetary policy.\n\nBut it was far from clear if the move had a direct impact on the US recovery. Financial institutions that sold long-term debt to the Fed did not lend out the money they got, but deposited it back at the Fed. Criticism also mounted on the potential consequences of adding US$1 trillion to the Fed's balance sheet in the past year, and asset bubbles appeared around the world.\n\nMarkets were distorted in other ways. They started hanging on the Fed's every word, trading based on whether it signalled liquidity injections would continue. Paradoxically, markets traded up on bad economic news as they assumed easy money would continue.\n\nThen came May, when Fed chairman Ben Bernanke said the Fed could \"in the next few meetings\" slow down asset purchases if the US economy improves. It was a relatively measured remark, but markets took fright. Asset prices in emerging markets took a hit amid a currency selldown. India and Indonesia, with large current account deficits, were identified as among the most vulnerable. In Singapore, the Straits Times Index had never recovered from its tumble from a high of 3,454.37 points on May 22. It is still 11 per cent off its May peak. Reits were especially hard hit.\n\nBy September, a recovering US economy had caused tapering expectations to build up. Defying consensus, the Fed decided not to slow down its asset purchases. Asian markets recovered - before improving US data in the past two months caused selldowns again.\n\nYesterday, the Fed was at pains to stress that tapering will be gradual, does not mean monetary tightening and interest rates will remain low.\n\nIn his final scheduled press conference before his term expires next month, Mr Bernanke emphasised that even though the Fed is reducing its monthly purchases of US$45 billion of longer-term Treasuries and US$40 billion of mortgage-backed securities by US$5 billion each, it is \"not doing less\" and \"certainly not giving up\" on attempts to stimulate the economy.\n\n\"Asset purchases are a supplementary tool. Our main tool is interest-rate policy . . . I do want to reiterate that this is not intended to be a tightening,\" he said.\n\nSignificantly, he added that interest rates will be kept near-zero \"well past\" the 6.5 per cent unemployment rate, especially if inflation continues to remain below 2 per cent. This was a marked departure from a year ago, when the Fed first introduced the 6.5 per cent target as one above which rates would remain exceptionally low.\n\nMr Bernanke also said that, despite the taper, the Fed still holds a substantial amount of assets and is still adding on to them, thus supporting mortgage markets and keeping long-term interest rates low. Moreover, nothing is cast in stone. Tapering will stop if the economy disappoints, or pick up in pace if the economy grows stronger, he added.\n\nFed members also projected low interest rates in the years to come, with median interest rates staying near-zero through next year, rising to 0.75 per cent at end-2015 and 1.75 per cent at end-2016, down by 0.25 percentage point from September.\n\nCiti's currency analyst Steven Englander was quoted by Business Insider calling the Fed's move \"very dovish\". \"This is as gentle a tapering as anyone could have expected,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With the group's unique understanding of the newbuild process, we have been able to manage overall expenses well and keep acquisitions costs low for the entire fleet expansion programme,\" Mr Pang added.\n\nMr Pang expects this to benefit the group's bottomline and profitability.\n\nPacific Radiance has an existing fleet of more than 130 offshore support vessels.\n\nAfter its November listing, Pacific Radiance market capitalisation now stands at $617 million.\n\nThe stock closed at 85 cents yesterday, down from its IPO price of 90 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/artivision-share-swap-deal-numbers-look-odd", "site_title": "Artivision share swap deal: numbers look odd", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nArtivision share swap deal: numbers look odd\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 19, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE numbers behind Artivision Technologies' latest deal can be a bit of a head scratcher.\n\nThe perennial loss-making online video technology specialist has announced a proposed investment in a young loss-making online gaming company in an all-share deal.\n\nHere's how the deal works: Artivision and 212 DB Corp, which runs the Play Gig-It game on Facebook, will swap shares such that they hold an almost 5 per cent stake in each other. No cash will actually change hands.\n\nEither party may also subsequently agree to pursue a further investment that will raise their respective stake in each other to 10 per cent.\n\nArtivision will integrate its online video ad technology into Play Gig-It, among other synergies, while both companies will seek to expand the game and its platform in Asia.\n\nThe odd part comes when Artivision places a number on the all-share deal. The initial subscription, the company said, is valued at S$6.2 million, or about 20.7 cents per Artivision share. Artivision's shares last traded at 9 cents before the deal was announced.\n\nIf either party goes ahead with the subsequent investment, that additional stake will have to be valued at a minimum of approximately US$9 million. That would value each company at US$180 million, a hefty premium to Artivision's S$55.4 million market capitalisation as at yesterday. Overnight, Artivision's shareholders would see their implied net worth up by a few multiples.\n\nQuestions\n\nA couple of questions immediately come to mind: (1) What is the basis for those premium valuations; and (2) what do those valuation numbers actually mean?\n\nRemember that no cash has actually changed hands, nothing has been monetised and no debt has been added, and yet we are suddenly faced with a sudden doubling in the value of Artivision's shares.\n\nInvestors, therefore, have to ask: did Artivision's assets really grow by so much? Did the deal double the value of Artivision's shares? Are those valuations backed by fundamentals?\n\nUnfortunately 212 DB is a private company, so there is no publicly known market for its shares, and answering those questions can be difficult.\n\nBut what clues can be gathered suggest that those valuations reflect an extremely bullish view of both 212 DB and Artivision that are not necessarily backed by current profitability (keep in mind that the deal valuations imply almost similar worth to both parties in the deal).\n\nTo begin with, 212 DB is still loss-making, according to 212 DB founder John Acunto. Artivision has been in the red since 2006, two years before it listed on Catalist.\n\nPhilip Soh, chairman of Artivision, said the valuations reflect the value of having more than 70 major recording artists signed up as part of the Play Gig-It game. Those artists lend their likenesses and their music to the game, which allows players to create and share virtual music concerts. Artivision boasts of the artists and the Facebook platform allowing them to reach about 350 million fans, but that reflects an absolute best-case scenario where almost every fan uses Facebook and plays the game.\n\nThe actual reach at the moment is far more modest.\n\nIn almost five months since its launch, the Play Gig-It has garnered just 4,400 players, according to Facebook.\n\nIn order to have a chance to reach the numbers that Artivision is putting forth, it is likely that significant resources will have to be dedicated to marketing and product development.\n\nAre those deal valuations actually meaningful, then? Or will they just inflate the balance sheets of the companies?\n\nTry to look at the deal from the point of view of 212 DB. Even if cash or liquidity limitations require a share swap, surely it must seem rich to pay 20.7 cents per share for a minority stake in Artivision, which does not appear to have any other known bidders in the market and has a long history of losses.\n\nAsked why he accepted a valuation of 20.7 cents per Artivision share when the stock last traded at 9 cents on Tuesday, Mr Acunto said that Artivision shares were \"as high as 36 cents at one point\".\n\nArtivision shares last traded at 36 cents almost two years ago - in February 2012.\n\n\"With our synergies for the US and Asian markets, I believe we have a winning combination,\" Mr Acunto said.\n\nActually, the valuation could make sense if 212 DB felt that the stake that it was handing over to Artivision was also significantly below S$6.2 million, implying that 212 DB was selling its own shares at a sizeable enough premium to justify accepting Artivision stock at a premium as well. And both companies get to increase their book values, so it is win-win, in a way.\n\nNTA increase\n\nBut of course, this scenario would not bode well for Artivision investors.\n\nThe issues are not purely academic because Artivision gets to book S$6.2 million to its balance sheet as a result of the deal valuation.\n\nTo illustrate the financial effects of the proposed subscription of shares in 212 DB, Artivision said in its announcement\n\nthat net tangible asset (NTA) per share will increase to 1.57 cents per share compared with 0.54 cent based on March 31, 2013 results and share capital after the deal.\n\nBut working with more recent numbers show the jump to be even more spectacular. In its second-quarter results for the period ended Sept 31, Artivision's NTA per share was just 0.07 cent. After the deal, NTA per share will balloon to 1.13 cents, a 16-times expansion.\n\nWill an almost 5 per cent stake in 212 DB really multiply Artivision's net assets overnight? It is difficult to see, based on disclosed information, where that additional value comes from.\n\nPerhaps the partnership between Artivision and 212 DB will be hugely successful eventually. But given available information, the current valuations seem to have jumped the gun.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We could never, and will never, consider it ordinary. For us, there is no way to describe this compromise with inapt words like ordinary, fair or reasonable. All we can say is that the legal formality of this matter is over.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines, in a statement last week after it was first disclosed that an agreement had been reached, said that it had \"vigorously defended itself in litigation brought against it by property owners and their insurers who allege that American should have done what the government could not do - prevent the terrorist attacks\".\n\n\"Although this settlement ends these particular legal disputes,\" the statement added, \"American will forever honour the memory of the true victims and selfless heroes of 9/11.\"\n\nCantor had sought compensation for the loss of property, such as furniture and artwork, and for the interruption of its business, derived from its \"exceptionally talented and liberally compensated\" brokers, as one Cantor expert put it, whose \"deaths severely impacted the dominance enjoyed by the firm\". At one point, Cantor demanded more than US$1 billion, after insurance recoveries, of which about 80 per cent was for so-called business interruption.\n\nAmerican argued that Cantor could not legally seek such damages arising from the deaths of its employees. \"As tragic as those deaths were, Cantor simply cannot recover such damages.\"\n\nJudge Alvin Hellerstein of US District Court in Manhattan ultimately agreed, finding that New York law does not allow an employer to sue for the wrongful deaths of its employees. Such suits may be brought only by the heirs or estates.\n\n\"It sometimes seems unfair because the loss to Cantor is so much more than bricks and mortar,\" said Donald Migliori, a lawyer whose firm represented several Cantor families who, like most victims of 9/11, obtained compensation from a special fund Congress created for 9/11 survivors and victims' families.\n\nJudge Hellerstein, who must still approve the agreement, has already overseen the settlements of lawsuits brought by more than 90 victims and families who opted to sue rather than recover from the victim compensation fund; a US$1.2 billion settlement of property and business lawsuits; and claims by more than 10,000 rescue and cleanup workers who alleged illnesses from their work at ground zero.\n\nThe judge also dismissed a 9/11 suit by World Trade Center Properties, which had leased and operated the centre, on grounds that the firm's insurance recoveries had exceeded its losses. The ruling is under appeal.\n\nIn court on Tuesday, Judge Hellerstein said that the settlement to the lawsuit, originally filed in 2004, was \"a significant conclusion to many years of effort\". He observed that none of the lawsuits had been tried, leaving questions even after so much had been written and analysed about what happened on 9/11 and how the terrorists had gotten onto the planes.\n\n\"Was there really some wrongdoing in terms of negligence that allowed this to happen?\" he asked. \"All this will remain a mystery. Maybe that's proper.\"\n\nCantor had argued in court papers that American \"owed a duty of 'the highest possible degree of care' to prevent a hijacking\". Instead, Cantor said, the airline \"cut costs and corners\". Cantor had said that it would \"establish at trial\" that American only sought to avoid government fines, \"and did not strive to achieve the best possible domestic security program\". American, which denied liability from the outset of the case, argued that it \"had no reasonable basis on which to foresee that a gang of suicidal terrorists, armed only with small knives, would take over a plane, pilot it themselves and transform it into a weapon of mass destruction\". American said that it had adhered to federal aviation security regulations and those adopted by the carrier.\n\nAfter Judge Hellerstein limited Cantor's damages, the firm reduced its claim to about US$475 million; and then again, to about US$415 million, according to a person who was briefed on the amount. In a 2002 document submitted to the victim fund, Cantor said that the firm and its families had \"suffered unspeakable losses\" on 9/11.\n\nAs the document noted, over half of Cantor's 658 victims had children, most of whom were younger than 12. More than three dozen Cantor widows were pregnant at the time of the attack. More than 750 Cantor children lost at least one parent. At least 20 families lost two members, including many pairs of brothers, a pair of sisters, a father and a daughter; and in some cases, three family members were lost.\n\nJudge Hellerstein said on Tuesday that hopefully some measure of justice, reparation and closure had been achieved.\n\n\"There's been no final accounting,\" he said, adding, \"The lives that were lost are irreparable.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Since then, some form of the legislation has remained on the books despite repeated attempts to repeal it.\n\nBut a lobby of contractors, property owners and insurers has in recent months renewed a campaign against the law, arguing that no less than the future of the state's construction industry is at stake.\n\nThey argue that the law is antiquated and prejudicial against contractors and property owners, and essentially absolves employees of responsibility for their own accidents, leading to huge settlements.\n\nThe payouts, they contend, have in turn led to skyrocketing insurance premiums that are hampering construction and the state's economic growth.\n\nOn Tuesday, a coalition of contractors, including a newly formed alliance of firms owned by women and minorities, announced the start of an advertising and lobbying blitz in Albany and New York City.\n\nBut a counter-lobby of unions, workers' advocates and trial lawyers is pushing back just as fiercely. The law, they argue, is essential to ensuring the safety of workers in some of the world's most dangerous jobs, particularly those employed by shoddy contracting firms that cut corners to save money.\n\nThe law, they say, holds developers and contractors accountable for keeping job sites safe.\n\nGovernor. Andrew M Cuomo this week acknowledged the politically loaded atmosphere surrounding the Scaffold Law, but suggested that he was open to the possibility of modifying the law.\n\nThe law states that contractors and property owners are responsible for ensuring that scaffolds, hoists and other devices that enable aboveground building construction and repair \"shall be constructed, placed and operated as to give proper protection to a person so employed.\"\n\nWhen injuries result from a violation of those terms, the law says, contractors and owners are liable. There is no mention of worker responsibility.\n\nUnder the law, however, the plaintiff still must show that a violation of the law's standards occurred and that the violation caused the injury.\n\nThose seeking to change the law want to incorporate a standard of \"comparative negligence\".\n\nThis amendment - described in a state bill submitted earlier this year - would require a jury or arbiter to consider whether the liability of the defendants, and thus the amount of damages, should be reduced for cases in which the worker's negligence or failure to follow safety procedures contributed to the accident.\n\nOpponents argue that the amendment would reduce the incentive for the property owner and contractors to take necessary safety precautions.\n\n\"This law protects both union and non-union workers and creates a sense of accountability on these job sites,\" said Gary LaBarbera, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an umbrella group for unionised construction workers.\n\n\"If the law was modified, the workers would lose their voice.\"\n\nBut those seeking to alter the law say the amendment would not eliminate the owners' and contractors' motivation to keep their workplaces safe because they would still face the possibility of shouldering large payouts, even if they were found only partly responsible for an accident.\n\n\"The notion that a contractor or owner would want to do anything to undermine the safety of the worker on the job doesn't make sense,\" said Pamela Young, associate general counsel of the American Insurance Association.\n\nWorkers' advocates argue that erosion of the Scaffold Law would have a disproportionate impact on minority and immigrant labourers, who, the advocates say, are more likely to work for non-union companies that may not provide proper safety training and equipment.\n\nImmigrants, the advocates said, are less likely to speak the same language as their bosses on a job site and more likely to fear being fired if they demand a safer workplace.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2011, federal safety regulators investigated 136 falls \"from elevation\" that killed workers on construction sites in New York, according to a recent report by Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group. Of those workers, about 60 per cent were Latino, foreign-born or both. That rate rose to 88 per cent among fatal falls in New York City.\n\nSome trial lawyers have been effective at using the law to secure large settlements.\n\nOf the 30 largest settlements in 2012, at least 14 were in cases brought under state labour laws and most of those involved falls from ladders or scaffolding, according to The New York Law Journal. The awards ranged from US$3 million to US$15 million.\n\nWeislaw, a Polish immigrant, was the plaintiff in a liability case that was settled last month. (He spoke on the condition that his surname not be used in this article, out of concern for his privacy.) He had been part of a crew repairing the roof of a one-story public school building in Long Beach, on Long Island.\n\nWhile he was working on the roof one spring day in 2010, he was concentrating so hard on his task that he lost track of the edge of the roof and fell, he said, suffering multiple fractures.\n\n\"I will most likely never be able to return to work,\" he said.\n\nWeislaw filed a lawsuit under the Scaffold Law arguing that he had not been provided with proper protection, such as a safety line or a spotter.\n\nThe case settled for US$2.7 million, said David Scher, a lawyer from the firm that represented him.\n\nCritics of the Scaffold Law say the way it is written makes these sorts of cases easy to win.\n\n\"It's a gold mine for the plaintiffs' bar,\" said Mike Elmendorf, president and chief executive of Associated General Contractors of New York State. \"When you get one of these cases, it's largely about how much it's going to cost.\"\n\nThese high payouts, he and others contend, have driven up insurance rates, knocking smaller contractors, particularly those run by minorities and women, out of business and forcing others to suspend work, costing thousands of jobs.\n\nThey argue that the impact is as high on government projects as it is on private ones, and that the soaring cost of liability insurance is forestalling the repair and construction of public works projects, such as schools, bridges and roads.\n\nThe New York City School Construction Authority said in a statement on Monday that its liability insurance costs for 2014 would be nearly as much as those for the three-year period from 2011 to 2013.\n\nBut in recent weeks, the law's defenders have employed a new gambit, demanding that the insurance companies open their accounting ledgers to prove whether the Scaffold Law is, in fact, responsible for the rate increases.\n\nInsurance executives have vowed to fight any demands to disclose proprietary information that might somehow undermine their competitive advantages.\n\nState Assemblyman Francisco P Moya, a Democrat who represents a heavily immigrant and Latino area of Queens, said he planned to submit a bill that would expand reporting requirements for insurance companies and help lawmakers assess whether the Scaffold Law needed to be changed.\n\n\"Show us how much the payouts are,\" Mr Moya said. \"Once we see that, we'll have a better understanding.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

This contrary movement begs the question: since the Fed signalled a strengthening economy, will it now be \"good economic news is good for stocks\"?\n\nIt could well be that market and economy are finally realigning, in which case investing will be according to fundamentals and not based on when the money printing will stop. If so, then the shift is to be welcomed.\n\nBut although news reports suggest this is the case, it's equally likely that US10 billion out of US$85 billion (to be exact, it's only 11.7 per cent) is small enough not to make an appreciable difference (at least not yet), and not when the Fed's guidance on inflation and unemployment suggests the first interest rate hike could be two years away.\n\nMoreover, having laboured under \"will they, won't they?\" tapering uncertainty since May, removal of that uncertainty was bound to trigger a \"relief rally\", which is very likely what Wall Street experienced on Wednesday.\n\nCall us cynical, but it's difficult to categorically conclude that a market weaned on easy money for more than five years might suddenly embrace any news that confirms a reduction of that easy money, even if the market has had six months to prepare itself for the news.\n\nJust a drip right now\n\nTo coin a phrase used by a Fed chairman from a bygone era when unlimited money printing was unheard of, the punch bowl may be draining, but it's only a drip at the moment and what remains is still sizeable enough to ensure a decent enough party.\n\nAs for the local market, unlike May and June there was no violent reaction registered here, although yesterday's drop into the red for the STI before a firm Europe opening helped it to an 8.45-point rise to 3,070.23 does indicate that Wednesday's Wall Street rally will probably prove to be short-lived.\n\nRightly or wrongly, Singapore is seen as an \"emerging market\" (EM) subject to the same concerns that surfaced in May when capital first started fleeing the region - namely that like other EMs, it is thought to be vulnerable to rising bond yields and a stronger US dollar that tapering entails.\n\nHowever, even if there's no near-term rally to look forward to, the absence of any violent movement either way does suggest that the local market is now severely underowned and that the selling that started in May may have been largely completed. A bottom is therefore likely to be not far off.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The region is home to a number of competing territorial claims, many of them involving China given its central location as the 'Middle Kingdom',\" it said.\n\nMaking the headlines currently is the conflict between Japan and China over the latter's new air defence identification zone in the East China Sea. The zone encompasses islands claimed by both China and Japan.\n\n\"We expect cooler heads to prevail, and, so far, we have not seen a surge in nationalistic sentiment in China or elsewhere that could reduce politicians' flexibility.\n\n\"Consequently, we see little prospect of disturbances to trade or other economic flows,\" said S&P. \"Nevertheless, the situation increases the risk of policy missteps and unintended consequences that could hurt regional sovereign creditworthiness.\"\n\nS&P does not see economic conditions as a strong support for Asia-Pacific sovereign ratings over the next few years, mainly because China is likely to see slower growth than before as it embarks on rebalancing.\n\n\"This would have implications for many economies around the region, particularly those more tightly linked to investment growth in China.\n\n\"In addition, we foresee more of an impact from the US Federal Reserve's tapering of economic stimulus than the Asia-Pacific is currently feeling. Financing costs should rise further, dissipating what has been the region's strong, credit-fuelled growth.\n\n\"The region's heavier debt burden, compared to just five years ago, would limit the options of policy makers if inflation spikes.\"\n\nFor China, it's not just growth but the structure of growth that is of key importance, noted S&P.\n\nClose to one-half of GDP comes from investment, partly fuelled by credit. The massive investment activities raise the risk of an unproductive allocation of scarce resources, if continued unabated.\n\n\"On the other hand, if this source of demand growth diminishes and consumption does not pick up the slack, it could stunt China's growth potential.\"\n\nAlso weighing on the region is that the sovereign ratings in the next two largest Asian economies, Japan and India, both carry negative outlooks.\n\nA key question for sovereign creditworthiness in Japan is whether the government's current economic policies can lift the economy out of deflation, S&P said. \"Negative price trends in the country have depressed government revenue in recent years. On the other hand, government spending has continued to grow despite falling prices. This has created a large structural fiscal deficit that could widen as Japan's population ages further.\"\n\nInflation and stronger revenue could help to ease the fiscal pressures that the government faces, it added.\n\nIn India, a key consideration in deciding whether the sovereign rating remains in investment grade in the next one to two years is whether the country can reverse the recent slowdown in economic growth, explained S&P.\n\nEconomic prospects might brighten if the 2014 post-election government introduces reforms that promote investment to alleviate the bottlenecks in infrastructure.\n\nStrong economic growth had been a key credit strength for the government until recently, it said. \"It helped to offset weaknesses associated with low average income, weak fiscal performance, and high government debt. Without this offsetting factor, we are likely to lower the sovereign rating.\"\n\nElsewhere in the region, domestic political developments in Thailand and Indonesia could have implications for longer-term trends of sovereign ratings, S&P said.\n\nYet another government has been removed as a result of street protests in Thailand while Indonesia faces elections next year.\n\nThe rest of the world is faring better, not that much but still improving.\n\nCredit trends for the sovereigns rated by S&P are slightly less negative going into 2014.\n\n\"But our ratings outlooks indicate that downgrades are likely to outnumber upgrades, as they did in 2013.\n\n\"The less-negative outlook balance today, compared to a year ago, does not suggest an overall improvement in creditworthiness, but rather a gradual stabilisation at a somewhat lower level,\" it said.\n\nEurope, again, is looking vulnerable, despite most ratings in the eurozone now having a stable outlook, S&P pointed out.\n\n\"Year to date, we lowered the ratings on 24 sovereigns, and in many cases assigned a stable outlook thereafter, but upgraded only eight.\n\n\"Generally speaking, sovereigns globally are still working their way out of the financial crisis and recessionary conditions that began in 2008, and will continue to do so in 2014,\" it said.\n\nIn a straw poll with 264 analysts on the biggest risk to sovereign outlook, the Fed's tapering was seen as the biggest risk to sovereign ratings.\n\nAlmost one-half of respondents pointed to the Fed's announced tapering programme as the largest risk to sovereign credit ratings in 2014, with global imbalances coming in second.\n\nRespondents were asked to choose from monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, slowdown of the Chinese economy, renewed US debt ceiling discussions, intensification of the eurozone crisis, growing economic imbalances and protectionism, geopolitical risks, other, or no major downside risks.\n\nAnalysts were most optimistic about the UK.\n\nAsked for their views about which countries' creditworthiness would improve or deteriorate in 2014, they were optimistic about the UK, Ireland, Colombia, Mexico, Spain, and Japan, and pessimistic about the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

DYLAN TAN reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 19, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE casino punters in Macau must be envying Anthony Chen as his debut feature, Ilo Ilo, continued its winning streak at the 56th Asia Pacific Film Festival (APFF) with Yeo Yann Yann taking home the Best Supporting Actress prize.\n\nHeld at the sprawling Venetian Macau Resort Hotel last Sunday, the awards ceremony capped the three-day boutique film festival organised by the Federation of Motion Picture Producers in the Asia-Pacific. The star-studded event - hosted by the former Portuguese colony for the second consecutive year - featured celebrities like Andy Lau, whose latest action blockbuster Firestorm was the opening film, and the likes of Nick Cheung, Anita Yuen, Fiona Sit and Zhang Ziyi, who scooped the Best Actress prize for her role in The Grandmaster.\n\nThe awards show was televised \"live\" to about 30 countries and had a surprisingly strong Singapore presence. Comedian Mark Lee co-hosted the event while Chen, Jack Neo and Christopher Lee all came on to present awards during the course of the evening.\n\nFresh from his Golden Horse wins last month, as well as nods for Best Director in Brisbane and Dubai (where Ilo Ilo also won Best Picture and Yeo was crowned Best Actress) earlier in the same week, Chen proved to be a hit with the mainland Chinese and Hong Kong press which took up every available interview slot with him. Such enthusiasm is rare and usually reserved for the more popular homegrown Chinese stars rather than a foreign newcomer.\n\nIlo Ilo was also part of APFF's eight-film line-up and was in the running for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Actress as well.\n\nHong Kong movie mogul and executive chairman of the 56th APFF organising committee, Eric Tsang, said Macau can take heart from the success of Ilo Ilo. Like Singapore, it has a very small movie industry and its population of just over half a million is barely enough to support it.\n\n\"It's difficult to even find a production crew here but even if you're not making your own films, it doesn't mean you can't help others to make theirs,\" noted Tsang. \"Macau actually has plenty of history and stories behind it to inspire filmmakers.\"\n\nFilms that were shot on location there this year include Hong Kong action director Dante Lam's mixed martial arts drama Unbeatable and Korean director Choi Dong-Hoon's ensemble-cast heist thriller The Thieves. Both movies have broken their respective domestic box offices and exposed Macau to a wider audience.\n\nMore importantly, the films also showed different sides of the world's richest gambling mecca. Choi's The Thieves used the often-seen glitzy neon lights of its casinos as a backdrop while Lam steered clear of that, preferring to set Unbeatable in the older but historically richer part of town.\n\nTsang added that hosting the APFF, which started in Tokyo in 1954 and was originally named South-east Asia Film Festival, for the second year running meant he had more time to make the event a bigger one.\n\nThis included commissioning a special closing film, Streets of Macau. The omnibus movie features seven short stories directed by popular Hong Kong filmmakers including his son, Derek Tsang, and Wong Ching Po. It stars a host of Hong Kong household names like Charlene Choi, Edison Chen and Miu Kiu Wai, all of whom graced the screening's red carpet.\n\nThe elder Tsang said the success he has enjoyed in the film industry is not something he expected because he does not boast the typical good looks of his peers.\n\n\"Look at me; I've never thought I could be an actor,\" he admitted. \"But when I was just starting, I would often take the initiative to interact with the crew including the directors and producers whom I worked with.\"\n\nHe now wants to pay the deed forward by boosting Macau's profile through APFF, especially since this is the last year the event is held there before moving to Thailand next year.\n\n\"I hope to bring the filmmaking scene to a different level and help them develop it as much as I can so people see Macau as more than just a backdrop; it actually also has its own unique identity and characteristics,\" he said. Citing Las Vegas as an example of a city that no longer relies only on gaming to power its economy, Tsang added: \"People used to go to Vegas to gamble only but that in turn has boosted the entertainment scene (with long-running stage shows and big- name music acts that become resident acts); Macau definitely has the potential to do the same.\"\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Other members include: Chua Sock Koong, group CEO and board director of SingTel; Olivia Lum, executive chairwoman and group CEO of Hyflux Ltd; and Euleen Goh, chairwoman of the Singapore International Foundation and non-executive director of DBS Group Holdings, CapitaLand Ltd and SATS Ltd.\n\nThe panel said: \"Boards in Singapore may have a good mix of skill sets and experience, but gender diversity is clearly lacking. Decisions made in boardrooms should reflect the realities of the marketplace if they hope to keep their competitive edge. We hope that when the DTF report is launched, boards will have a greater awareness of the benefits of gender diversity and take necessary actions to change the status quo.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

Because if you do, you might mistake 47 Ronin for just another post-summer CGI-fuelled blockbuster released to cash in on the lucrative festive movie-going season.\n\nWhile that's what the film is, to some extent, beneath its formulaic Hollywood treatment, 47 Ronin also reveals a surprisingly engaging and heartfelt plot that shows that there's a lot more to samurais than their ability to brandish a sword.\n\nAction aficionados need not worry, though, there's still plenty of chop-socky hijinks to satisfy any action junkie. Barely 10 minutes into the film, there's already a breathtaking set piece where an army of samurais are hot on the heels of a large supernatural bull-like creature charging across an open field.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": []}

DYLAN TAN kicks off with the best movies of the year, in no particular order\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 19, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGravity\n\nDirector: Alfonso Cuaron\n\nNEXT time you think you're having a bad day at the office, imagine what the two astronauts played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney had to go through in Alfonso Cuaron's claustrophobic thriller Gravity. The Mexican director keeps the pacing tight with the film clocking in at a brief 90 minutes and the action even tighter as the free floating camera work puts the audience in the centre of things. Visually, the film is a spectacle and for best effect, watch it in the giant Imax format to get the most out of the 3D. Like James Cameron's Avatar, Gravity is a groundbreaking film on the technical front but it also has a plot that hooks you from the first frame and doesn't let go until the breathtaking last.\n\nSo Young\n\nDirector: Vicky Zhao Wei\n\nWHO would have thought one of China's most sought-after actresses had such a fine filmmaking bone in her. This movie is based on Xin Yiwu's bestselling novel, To Our Youth That is Fading Away, and the author initially wanted Zhao in the lead role but the latter, who recently graduated from film school, opted to go behind the camera instead. And what an accomplished debut it turned out to be. The adaptation takes its title from an old hit by Britpop band Suede (the song is featured prominently in the film and a scene revolves around the English quartet's historic concert in China) and Zhao not only nails the job but manages to coax fine performances from the fresh-faced cast, including lead actress Yang Zishan who's making her big screen debut here. In China, So Young is the year's second-highest grossing film, finishing behind Stephen Chow's slapstick comedy Journey to the West. Not just a commercial hit, the film is also critically acclaimed and has scooped numerous awards for Zhao and her cast.\n\nBlue Jasmine\n\nDirector: Woody Allen\n\nAFTER making his last few films in Europe, Woody Allen returns home to the US for Blue Jasmine. Set in New York and San Francisco, this bittersweet comedy's jewel in the crown isn't really the 78-year-old's energetic script but Cate Blanchett's excellent performance. She plays a Manhattan socialite who moves to San Francisco and into the apartment of her poorer adopted sister. Unable to move on and adapt to her new surroundings, she makes life a living hell for everybody around her. Comedians Andrew Dice Clay and Louis C K make memorable cameos in a film that critics have unanimously called Allen's best in years.\n\nThe Grandmaster\n\nDirector: Wong Kar Wai\n\nEVERYBODY was kung fu fighting but they certainly weren't fast as lightning in king of slo-mo Wong Kar Wai's Ip Man biopic. The film has been in the making for years and it was rumoured that the Hong Kong arthouse auteur was still editing it hours before the premiere. Even then, no definitive version of The Grandmaster exists because there are three versions of the movie - a 130-minute domestic Chinese theatrical cut, a 123-minute Berlin International Film Festival cut, and a 108-minute international cut. Each has exclusive scenes and the storytelling is re-ordered to make them all look like different films. Why? Because a perfectionist's work is never done.\n\nIlo Ilo\n\nDirector: Anthony Chen\n\nTHE Golden Horse hype could kill it a little for those who have yet to watch Anthony Chen's impressive debut but that shouldn't stop anybody from catching Ilo Ilo. It's a small film with a big heart and plenty of cinematic soul - the sort of things that would restore the faith of anyone who might have given up on local movies because they think the commercial success of Jack Neo's films means Singapore cinema is only about lowest-common denominator slapstick comedies. The film might have ended its second cinematic run here but the impending home video release around Chinese New Year sounds like the right time to gather the family for a (repeat) viewing.\n\nLike Father Like Son\n\nDirector: Hirokazu Koreeda\n\nLIKE Ilo Ilo, Hirokazu Koreeda's Like Father Like Son is a family drama that has been wowing critics and audiences alike at festivals around the world. Just last weekend, it was a big winner at the 56th Asia Pacific Film Festival, picking up two major prizes - Best Picture and Best Director. The heartwarming plot revolves around a pair of boys who are mistakenly switched at birth. The quiet drama caught Steven Spielberg's eye at Cannes and he has acquired it for a Hollywood remake.\n\nOnly God Forgives\n\nDirector: Nicolas Winding Refn\n\nBOOED by some at Cannes while receiving a standing ovation from others, Nicolas Winding Refn's hypnotic thriller, Only God Forgives, is like an accident scene - rubbernecking is not an option even if your conscience tells you otherwise. Hollywood hunk Ryan Gosling, a frequent Refn collaborator, slices and dices his way through the Bangkok underworld in search of the men who killed the brother of his character. The violence is stomach-churning but it's all done so beautifully you'll be missing plenty if you shut your eyes even for a second. Don't watch it after dinner though.\n\nSpring Breakers\n\nDirector: Harmony Korine\n\nGOOD girls go really bad in Spring Breakers, writer-director Harmony Korine's pseudo-arthouse drama about four girls who go on a robbery spree to pay for their spring-break trip. Barely legal ex-Disney girls Vanessa Hudgens and Selena Gomez appear in their most grown-up roles to date (read: they wore the smallest of bikinis for most of the film), playing with guns and cavorting with James Franco's spaced-out drug dealer character. As always, Korine's work courts controversy and critics are divided over whether Spring Breakers empowers women by portraying the girls as anti-heroes or is just one big sexist film with the director exploiting the sexuality of his young actresses. Watch it and decide for yourself.\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On the other hand, another plant, plant B, may have an excess of this during its operations, and has to either cool it down, or waste it, to get rid of it.\n\n\"So why can't plant B pass or sell the excess steam or process heat to plant A, so there will be cost savings and also revenue... it will be a win-win.\"\n\nHowever, there are practical considerations, like possible resistance by some corporations to share steam or heat across fences. Mr Leong said this is when the government can play the role of an \"honest broker\".\n\n\"Yes, there are proprietary concerns, but there are also cost savings. So how do we allay fears or concerns of technical leakage and find a technical solution? That's where the JI 2.0 initiative, which the latest plan comes under, plays a crucial role,\" he added.\n\nThis latest plan to improve energy efficiency on Jurong Island follows the red flag raised over rising energy costs here by various investors including Lanxess, Shell and Neste Oil.\n\nSingapore has been working to address this by promoting new, more-efficient utility plants fuelled by recently-available LNG, as well as other plants using alternative feedstocks like coal/biomass or woodchips and waste materials.\n\nThe EDB has started sounding out industry players on the latest heat integration project, Mr Leong said.\n\nIt has also conducted a study with the Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore cluster of companies - including the upstream cracker company and over 10 downstream companies there - \"to identify opportunities, and have a feel of what is possible.\"\n\nInvestors in the multi-billion dollar PCS complex include a group of Japanese corporations led by Sumitomo Chemical, as well as others like Shell, Phillips Petroleum and Qatar Petroleum International.\n\n\"The next step is to do this on a more expansive basis, and get the whole industry here involved. We will look at the agenda seriously, identify all opportunities, prioritise them and work out how to make it happen. That's where Jurong Island 2.0 provides the platform,\" said Mr Leong.\n\nHe added that operationally, \"we don't need a (expensive or large) cogeneration plant. We can just have process heat itself to make it work\".\n\n\"The technology is there. Chemical plants do it all the time within their own site... they have hot streams and also cold streams that need to be heated up, so we need heat exchangers. Across plants we need pipelines and also a (government) facilitator.\"\n\nHe conceded however, that \"it's not a simple project. It's not just the investment dollars\".\n\n\"We need people to come together and to identify opportunities, and also get the technical folks to work out solutions before we have an investment case. So it's an area in which we will spend efforts on over the next few years.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A reading above 50 indicates an overall positive outlook.\n\nSentiment in South-east Asia's US$1.5 trillion economy was undermined by political turbulence in Thailand and a typhoon in the Philippines, causing dismal readings of 40 and 58 respectively, which were the lowest for both countries since the poll was first compiled in 2009.\n\nAlthough China and India's bullish scores of 75 and 82 respectively supported the index, export-driven North Asian economies such as South Korea as well as regional trading hub Singapore also showed weaker readings, underscoring still-anaemic global business conditions.\n\n\"The global economic recovery is still very fragile,\" Zhang Shiyuan, an economist at Shanghai-based Southwest Securities Co said. \"There is a fundamental problem that there's still too much debt. It's a time bomb that may be detonated if monetary and fiscal policies don't coordinate well.\"\n\nThe survey showed that the auto sector was the most negative with a reading of 33, a sharp drop from 63 in the previous quarter, followed by the food and resources sectors with fourth-quarter scores of 50.\n\nThe index surveyed more than 100 of the Asia-Pacific region's top companies including Hyundai Heavy Industries, Fast Retailing and International Container Terminal Services Inc (ICTSI) in 11 economies, across sectors including property, financials and tech.\n\nThe poll, conducted by ThomsonReuters in association with Insead, a global management and business school, was compiled between Dec 2 and 13.\n\nOf the 128 companies that responded, two-thirds reported a neutral outlook while less than 30 per cent were positive in their prospects.\n\nAmong Asean countries that had remained comparatively upbeat earlier this year, Malaysia remained the only bright spot with a score of 75, up from 69 in the last quarter.\n\nIn contrast, companies in Thailand were the most negative in Asia with a 40-index reading, plunging from 71 in the previous quarter as signs of prolonged political uncertainty due to anti-government protests against Yingluck Shinawatra's ruling party hit business sentiment.\n\nCorporate sentiment in the Philippines tumbled to 58 from the maximum score of 100 in the previous quarter due to the devastating effects of Typhoon Hai-yan in early November that killed more than 5,200 people and destroyed an estimated 24 billion pesos (S$682 million) in crops and infrastructure.\n\nAmong North Asian economies, Japan retreated to a fourth-quarter score of 55 from 63 in the previous quarter as the buzz around Abenomics deflated. The outlook in South Korea remained steady at a neutral 50.\n\nA glimmer of hope came from China, the world's second-largest economy, which showed an uptick in fourth-quarter sentiment to 75 after holding steady at 50 earlier this year.\n\n\"The companies appear to be upbeat on the expectation that overseas demand for Chinese exports will improve. Hopes stemming from the government's reform measures announced in Q3, and rising income levels that could drive spending, are also causes for positive sentiment,\" said Cui Hongmei, a China market analyst at Seoul-based Daewoo Securities Co.\n\nIndia's bullish outlook also supported the index, with a fourth-quarter score of 82 compared to 67 in the previous quarter as improving manufacturing conditions in the 1.3 billion-strong country shrunk the trade deficit by 23 per cent between April and November 2013.\n\nBroken down by sector, builders in Asia were the most bullish with a maximum reading of 100 for the second consecutive quarter, followed by pharmaceuticals and property sectors with readings of 75.\n\nDefensive sectors such as food and retail were both down from the previous quarter to readings of 50, as companies cited rising costs as their biggest risk. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

A third Indian national, 22-year-old Rajendran Ranjan - who was initially charged with them for the same offence - was, however, discharged by the court on Tuesday, as the police withdrew charges against him.\n\nWhether the police will also proceed with a similar action against Mr Kabildev and Mr Sivaraman has still not been decided. Deputy Public Prosecutor John Lu said that the police are still reviewing evidence extensively \"to determine whether to maintain the current charge, tender additional charges, or even withdraw the current charges if necessary\".\n\nDistrict Judge Lim Tse Haw agreed to the prosecution's request to keep the two accused for a week more in remand, and cited the scale and large body of evidence involved in the case as a basis for his decision. However, he asked the police to \"expedite investigations\".\n\nTheir cases will be mentioned again on Dec 23 together with the other accused who appeared in court on Tuesday.\n\nThe two accused raised a concern in court yesterday through an interpreter that they were unsure if legal representation will be offered to them. Lawyer Amarick Gill, a member of the Law Society's Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS), informed the court that both the accused have met the CLAS criteria and that CLAS member lawyers will be assigned to them \"in due course\" on a pro bono basis.\n\nThe Law Society also issued a statement yesterday to confirm that it \"will assign individual pro bono defence counsel to 26 of the 28 persons currently charged in relation to the Little India riot\", and that the remaining two have engaged their own counsel.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The move is seen as an attempt to engineer a soft landing.\n\nFor H1 2014, MND will be launching through the confirmed list eight sites that can generate a total of 4,630 private homes (including 2,165 executive condominiums) against 5,960 units (including 2,785 ECs) in the current slate. In all, there will be seven pure residential sites on the confirmed list in the first half next year, down from 10 currently.\n\nMND noted the confirmed list supply will be \"added to the existing large pipeline supply of about 97,400 private housing units (including ECs)\".\n\nSupply on the reserve list will also be trimmed 15.1 per cent to 6,955 units (including 605 ECs) in H1 next year from 8,195 units (inclusive of 535 ECs).\n\n\"The government is indirectly acquiescing to the fact that if they continue the previous torrid pace of supply for housing, the market will swing from deficit to glut for completed housing stock come 2017,\" observed Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong.\n\nDTZ's head of Singapore research, Lee Lay Keng, noted that transaction volume in the private residential market has fallen significantly since the total debt servicing ratio framework took effect in late-June.\n\nSLP International executive director Nicholas Mak said the four EC sites in the confirmed list outnumber the three private condo sites, which is unprecedented. Tan Tiong Cheng, chairman of Knight Frank, said the \"government probably thinks that bids for EC sites have been too aggressive lately\". This, along with an expected drop in EC demand arising from the recently introduced 30 per cent mortgage servicing ratio cap for EC buyers, should help to moderate prices, he added.\n\nFor commercial space, the combined confirmed and reserve list supply of 193,340 sq metres (2.08 million sq ft) gross floor area (GFA) for H1 2014 reflects a big drop from 268,050 sq m under the current slate. It is also the lowest since H1 2006, when the total supply was at 125,505 sq m.\n\nSavills' Mr Cheong said: \"They are holding back supply of new office sites because come 2016-2017, a massive spike in supply from Marina Bay and Tanjong Pagar/Cecil Street is expected.\"\n\nMND said two reserve-list sites - a white site in Marina View and a commercial land parcel in Sims Avenue - will \"provide opportunities for the market to initiate the development of more commercial space, over and above the 1.1 million sq m GFA of office space in the pipeline, if there is demand\".\n\nNo hotel site will be available via the GLS Programme in the next half-year for the first time since the reserve list system was minted in H2 2001. MND pointed to \"a healthy pipeline supply of 12,700 hotel rooms\".\n\nNonetheless, a spokesperson for the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) highlighted that developers may choose to develop some hotel rooms for the Sims Avenue commercial site and Marina View white site, after setting aside the minimum quantum of space that has to be developed for other uses (for example, offices). The current slate has three hotel sites, all on the reserve list. Two have been triggered for launch - at Havelock Road and East Coast Road. The third plot, at Race Course Road, will be removed from the reserve list to \"facilitate a review of the land use intention\" for the site.\n\nSumming up its strategy, the Ministry said: \"Supply from the GLS Programme, together with the large supply from projects in the pipeline, is expected to be adequate to meet the demand for private housing and commercial space over the next few years.\"\n\nIn all, seven new sites have been introduced for the next half, five of them through the confirmed list. These comprise two adjacent EC sites in Yishun St 51 near the Orchid Country Club Golf Course with tender closings at the same time under the \"batched tender\" system, and another pair of adjoining sites for private housing development along Fernvale Road near Jalan Kayu, also with simultaneous tender closing, plus an EC site in Sembawang Avenue.\n\nThe two new sites on the reserve list are a private housing site in Margaret Drive and an EC site in Sembawang Road/Canberra Link.\n\nMost of the new sites are not \"super hot\", as SLP's Mr Mak put it. Industry players have been urging the authorities to head in this direction to put a lid on rising land prices. \"If you put up prime sites when developers are hungry for land, you'll see bullish bids,\" said Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International. She noted that the sites that have been carried over from the H2 2013 GLS Programme are more attractive than the new sites.\n\nWhile market watchers agreed with the government's strategy of clipping land sales to avoid a glut building up, the soft-launching plan could go awry.\n\n\"One scenario is that with fewer sites on offer, if new entrants continue to bid, they may pit themselves against local players who will also need to replenish landbanks to continue their business. This heightened competition could start driving up land bids again, which could portend further hikes in private home prices,\" suggested Colliers' Ms Chia.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

MND noted this is to \"encourage more prudent bidding by developers\".\n\nThe first pair of sites, in Yishun St 51, are for EC development and will be launched in March.\n\nIn June, the second pair of adjacent sites, along Fernvale Road in Sengkang West, will be launched. These are for private housing development.\n\nChia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International, noted that the sites are in a fairly-new locale and offer \"early-mover advantage\".\n\nResidents in the new projects on these two sites will be served by the Seletar Mall.\n\nThe site is next to an LRT station that is linked to Sengkang MRT station.\n\nOn the reserve list, Ms Chia highlighted the new private housing site in Margaret Drive for its good locational attributes that will be popular with home buyers.\n\n\"The site is in the mature estate of Queenstown with existing amenities, including the Commonwealth and Queenstown MRT stations.\n\n\"Moreover, there should be a sizeable pool of potential HDB flat upgraders from the Commonwealth, Queenstown and Redhill estates - given that HDB resale flat prices in these centrally-located areas tend to be higher than the general price levels of most public flats.\"\n\nExisting reserve list sites carried over to the H1 2014 reserve list also include some private housing sites in choice locations that could be triggered for launch by developers, noted Ms Chia.\n\nThese include Alexandra View (Parcel A), next to Redhill MRT station; a land parcel in Siglap Road near the East Coast Park and its amenities; and a plot at Boon Lay Way near Lakeside MRT.\n\nOthers include a site in Lorong Lew Lian near Serangoon MRT station and nex shopping mall; as well as a land parcel in Toa Payoh Lorong 6/Lorong 4, a stone's throw from Braddell MRT station, she added.\n\nCBRE's Mr Sim expects the white site in Marina View to be triggered from the reserve list within the next six to 12 months, against the recovery of the Grade A office rental market.\n\nGiving its take on MND's H1 2014 GLS Programme, the Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore said it \"supports the Government's calibrated approach . . . to ensure a sustainable and stable real estate market going forward\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yesterday, however, things were back to \"normal\". Cat A (for cars below 1,600cc) rose $842 to $74,002, while Cat B (for cars above 1,600cc) climbed $2,690 to $75,700.\n\nCat E - the open category which usually tracks Cat B - was $600 higher at $77,501.\n\nMeanwhile, Cat D - for motorcycles - inched up $30 to $1,812. Only Cat C - for goods vehicles - softened; it shed $3,111 to $48,001.\n\nMr Lee said both dealers and customers are in a hurry to register cars this month.\n\n\"Dealers have to meet year-end targets, while some customers want a new car for Christmas or the new year,\" he explained.\n\nRon Lim agreed that there is a rush. The general manager of authorised Nissan distributor Tan Chong Motor Sales said demand has been stable over the past couple of months.\n\n\"You don't see the strong year-end buying like before, partly because of the cooling measures, and partly because of the weakness in the stock and property markets,\" he added.\n\nTo back up his assessment, Mr Lim pointed to the slightly lower number of bids for Cat A and Cat B compared with the preceding tender.\n\nOther dealers have expressed similar sentiments.\n\n\"Order taking hasn't been strong lately,\" said the managing director of a luxury brand.\n\nAs for the dip in the goods vehicle premium, Mr Lim said it is not due to a tapering of demand. In fact, demand is expected to pick up next month, when more Euro 5 diesel models are purchased and registered. This stricter emission standard takes effect on Jan 1, 2014.\n\nMr Lim explained that the fall in the Cat C premium is because many owners of small and medium-sized enterprises - the main buyers of light commercial vehicles - are away during this holiday season. So, any decision to buy a new van or lorry will probably be made only next year when these SME owners return.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But your headcount has been trimmed over the years as your company tightens its belt and, in any case, the talent that you seek is not readily available.\n\nYou can't skimp on resources to throw at the project. So, you body shop.\n\nThis flexible staffing practice could really take off if the constraints on manpower stay.\n\nWhat it means, simply, is this: Instead of maintaining a high headcount or working existing staff to the bone, investment banks and IT companies simply \"shop for bodies\" for short periods of time. They could, for example, turn to a management-consulting firm and pay it a fixed rate to borrow some of its staff for the project.\n\nOne industry expert, who wanted to be known only as P, said: \"This makes more economic sense for the (sourcing) companies, since they hire only as and when they need to. It's very difficult to train or retain talent these days, especially those with specific knowledge-based skills.\"\n\nThe trend of hiring contract workers has picked up over the past three years, said recruiting companies.\n\nMichael Smith, country director of Randstad Singapore, said: \"In some cases, it may be because the company is operating under leaner conditions, and sees hiring contractors per project as a more economical solution.\n\n\"For others, it may be a case of needing a swift solution in plugging gaps with a high level of expertise, as a result of talent shortages in their industry.\"\n\nHiring contract workers can benefit employers as it \"provides the flexibility to hire per project\" and allows them to \"remain agile to meet changing workforce demands and business requirements\", he added.\n\nJoel Hides, associate director of Robert Walters Singapore, pointed out that \"firms also get to 'road-test' potential employees with temporary positions\", before cherry-picking the best candidates for permanent hire.\n\nContracted workers, on their part, get the chance to upskill themselves quickly and expand their networks, he said.\n\n\"They can get their foot in the door of a new industry and, perhaps, even secure a permanent position in the event of a good performance.\"\n\nFor all its merits, body shopping may come with a downside for those on the receiving end. Mr P pointed out that clients of companies that body-shop may be kept in the dark.\n\nHe said: \"They're paying a premium for work they believe is being done by the employees of the company they've hired.\"\n\nHe added that some companies have gone so far as to build teams that are about 70 per cent filled with contract workers.\n\nAnother industry expert, who wanted to be known only as Pillai, said that the practice could have profound implications for management consultancies.\n\nShe said: \"With body shopping, the traditional role of management consulting has shifted from short-term diagnostic interactions to cover a wider scope for execution.

However, ordinary Chinese in most cities still face home prices that are well beyond their reach, adding the threat of social unrest to that of a bubble, and Mr Lau noted that the government may impose more curbs if prices continued to rise.\n\nThe hot housing market has provided a tricky challenge for policy makers who are trying to steer the world's second-largest economy towards more sustainable growth after three decades of breakneck expansion.\n\nAnalysts say Beijing won't want to see a sudden and sharp downturn in property because of its importance to growth. The economy is set to grow this year at about 7.5 per cent, the weakest pace since the Asia financial crisis in the late 1990s.\n\nAverage new home prices in China's 70 major cities in November rose 9.9 per cent from a year earlier, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics data published yesterday, the fastest pace since records began in 2011.\n\nBut prices rose 0.5 per cent in November in month-on-month terms, the data showed, slowing from October's rise of 0.6 per cent and the third straight slowdown since August's 0.8 per cent gain.\n\nMonthly gains had topped 1 per cent earlier in the year. Official data on Dec 10 showed total land area bought by developers rose 9.9 per cent in the first 11 months of 2013 from a year earlier, reversing from a drop of 3.6 per cent in the first 10 months.\n\nDevelopers see increased land as contributing to easing home prices gains next year.\n\nThe government has promised more of the same for the property market next year.\n\nBeijing recently said that it would expand a tax on property as well as make more land available, increasing its reliance on market forces rather than administrative measures to rein in the property market. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

A further minimum 5,382 sq ft must be set aside for childcare centre use. The rest of the GFA can be for additional office or other complementary commercial uses such as retail, food and beverage and/or entertainment. Residential use is not allowed.\n\nFor the office component, strata subdivision is allowed which should increase the site's attraction to potential bidders keen on selling strata office units. All the non-office uses (including the childcare centre) have to be held under a single strata lot and owned by a single entity. The tender will close on April 8.\n\nProperty consultants generally expect five to eight bids for the site, with bidders drawn by the \"first-mover advantage\" the site offers in the area. However, they differed widely on their expectations of the winning bid for the site - from $500 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr) to $1,100 psf ppr.\n\nUrban Redevelopment Authority (URA), which launched the tender for the site yesterday, said that the minimum 90 per cent office component is in line with the plan for Woodlands Regional Centre to be developed as a major employment centre in Singapore's northern area. An extensive pedestrian network has been planned to connect the sale site seamlessly to Causeway Point, the Woodlands Civic Centre, the existing Woodlands MRT Station and bus interchange, and the future Thomson Line MRT station in the vicinity.\n\nThe sale site, along Woodlands Square, comprises two larger land parcels of 85,729 sq ft (Plot 1) and 114,144 sq ft (Plot 2) and three smaller plots. One is for airspace to provide an elevated pedestrian link-bridge between the two bigger plots, while the other two are underground plots. Of these, one will provide an underground vehicular connection and carpark between Plots 1 and 2, while the other will provide an underground pedestrian link between Plot 1 and Causeway Point.\n\nURA's spokeswoman said that the planning intention for the sale site is for a \"quality and relatively more affordable office development which can meet the needs of SMEs and businesses that may not require prime office spaces in the city centre, but which would still benefit from proximity to a transport node\". There are more than 500,000 residents in Woodlands and the neighbouring Yishun and Sembawang towns.\n\nKnight Frank's head of investment and capital markets, Ian Loh, said: \"When you're trying to encourage a regional centre to take off, rents have to be kept affordable. However, when you allow strata subdivision, rents tend to be higher as investors who have paid relatively high prices for their units will have a higher rent expectation to achieve a target yield.\"\n\nHe estimated the sale site's land price at possibly $700-780 psf ppr, translating to a breakeven cost of around $1,400-1,500 psf and potential selling price of $1,600-1,800 psf for the strata office units.\n\nDTZ head of Singapore research Lee Lay Keng notes that although the Woodlands Square site's GFA is quite similar to that of the Venture Avenue site in Jurong Gateway sold to Sim Lian earlier this year at nearly $1,009 psf ppr, \"the development of Woodlands as a regional commercial centre is still in its infancy and it is now still (better) known as an industrial location, rather than an office location\". \"Therefore, we expect a lower number of bids - about five to eight - compared with nine for the Venture Avenue site, and a top bid of about $800-1,000 psf ppr for the Woodlands site,\" said Ms Lee.\n\nShe reckoned that end users keen on buying strata units in the Woodlands Square project could include firms with operations in Malaysia, as Woodlands will be linked to Johor via MRT in future.\n\nElaine Chow, head of research at Chesterton Singapore, observed: \"Currently, green field sites are aplenty in this northern town, but the pace of development is set to accelerate within the next five to 10 years.\"\n\nThe transport network in Woodlands Regional Centre will be boosted significantly and will have five MRT stations eventually.\n\nMs Chow expects the winning bid for the Woodlands Square sale site to range from $500 to $600 psf ppr, with the completed strata office units potentially selling at an average price of $1,300-1,500 psf.\n\nCBRE Research associate director Desmond Sim expects the top bid to be around $1,100 psf ppr.\n\n\"Given that Woodlands Regional Centre will be the closest link to our northern neighbours via the Causeway and the future cross-border rail link, a commercial node will be well received by firms that may benefit from the cross-border proximity. In line with (Singapore's) concept of decentralisation, future commercial occupiers can also tap on the growing residential workforce close by, as well as the pool of qualifying workers across the Causeway,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Imports into China climbed to a record in October, the first month of the 2013-14 season, customs data showed.\n\nChina brought in 3.8 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2012-13, estimates Kingsman SA, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc's Platts. That's almost four times the amount a US Department of Agriculture unit forecast at the start of last season. Purchases beat estimates as a government stockpiling programme attracted more shipments. Imports will probably fall 29 per cent this marketing year to 2.7 million tonnes, according to Kingsman. \"Our forecast is based on the assumption that the Chinese government won't restart state purchases,\" Xiaoxiao Du, an analyst at Kingsman in Lausanne, Switzerland, said on Tuesday by e-mail. \"The number of imports may surprise us on the upside if government implements the stockpiling programme once again.\"\n\nWhile sugar futures fell 17 per cent in London and 18 per cent in New York this year as supplies outpaced demand, a government stockpiling programme meant that Chinese futures slid at a slower pace, dropping 12 per cent. Futures in the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange were US$367 a tonne more expensive on Tuesday than on NYSE Liffe. The price gap widened about 4 per cent in the past two months, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.\n\nChina may phase out its stockpiling programme and partially replace it with direct subsidies to cane and beet farmers as early as the crop starting October 2014, Zhao Lihua, a director at the economy and trade division of the National Development and Reform Commission, said last month. That fuelled speculation that imports would fall. The International Sugar Organization in London forecasts Chinese purchases to decline 36 per cent to 2.35 million tonnes this season, it said in a Dec 9 report.\n\n\"The rebuilding of stocks in China, particularly in government reserves, will diminish the need for imports in 2014,\" Paul Deane, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, said in a report on Dec 4, forecasting that imports could decline to two million tonnes. \"We see this as placing a natural cap on global sugar prices in 2014.\"\n\nChina brought in 709,873 tonnes of sugar in October, customs data showed. Vessels carrying 132,500 million tonnes of raw sugar left Brazil's main ports to China in November, according to SA Commodities and Unimar Agenciamentos Maritimos Ltda in Santos, Brazil. That compares with 100,000 tonnes in the same month a year earlier. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The long-awaited recovery has yet to emerge despite the cautious optimism read earlier into October's growth in non-oil domestic exports (NODX).\n\nIn November, NODX slipped back into the negative territory it has been mired in for most of this year. It slid 8.8 per cent year-on-year after a 2.8 per cent expansion in the previous month, latest trade figures released yesterday by trade promotion agency International Enterprise Singapore showed.\n\nThis surprised private-sector economists who were expecting a 4.3 per cent jump in November's NODX.\n\nOn a month-on-month basis, exports fell 9.3 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms after expanding 3.2 per cent in October. Economists had forecast a 2.8 per cent month-on-month rise.\n\nEven non-oil re-exports, perhaps the only bright spot in a year of export underperformance, saw their year-on-year increase slashed to 11.2 per cent last month from 26.7 per cent in October.\n\nIE Singapore blamed NODX's dismal showing on a decline in shipments of both electronic and non-electronic goods. Electronic shipments extended their 1.4 per cent decline in October to 8.9 per cent in November.\n\nNon-electronic domestic exports slipped 8.8 per cent - a reversal from the previous month's 4.9 per cent growth - dragged down by pharmaceuticals (-46.9 per cent) and structures of ships and boats (-82.5 per cent).\n\nNot surprisingly, the latest drop in NODX has raised some concerns.\n\n\"We all know how volatile Singapore's export numbers are, so we won't read too much into one single month's data,\" said Glenn Maguire, ANZ Bank's chief economist for Asia Pacific. \"But the broad trend is one where NODX exports, in seasonally adjusted level terms, have been broadly flat for almost a year now.\"\n\nLast month's year-on-year decline in NODX was the ninth over the past 11 months. This comes barely three weeks after IE Singapore slashed its full-year NODX growth forecast to between -5 and -4 per cent, from 2-4 per cent.\n\nIn the first nine months of the year, NODX fell 7.1 per cent.\n\nNODX's persistent decline, even as other Asian exporters are making improvements, prompted Chua Hak Bin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch to ask: \"Is Singapore losing its competitive edge?\"\n\n\"Disparity between Singapore versus other Asian exporters is wide,\" he said in a brief report.\n\nExports improved in November for China (+12.7 per cent) and and stayed positive for South Korea (+0.2 per cent) and Taiwan (+0.04 per cent).\n\nYear-to-date, Dr Chua estimates that Singapore's NODX has dropped 6.3 per cent, compared with a growth of 0.9 per cent for Taiwan, 1.7 per cent for Korea and 8.2 per cent for China.\n\n\"Asian trade activity is gaining strength, but Singapore exports, particularly tech, are losing market share,\" he warned.\n\nBut sounding a more optimistic note, Citigroup's Kit Wei Zheng said the sequential declines in the NODX numbers came on the heels of two straight months of expansion. \"Volatility notwithstanding, broad export trends actually appear broadly stable.\"\n\nAverage October-November headline and electronics levels are still only slightly below their third-quarter averages, while the \"core\" NODX (stripping out lumpy pharmaceuticals and ship exports) is, in fact, above, he noted.\n\nPhilip McNicholas of BNP Paribas is hopeful that increased demand in Europe and the United States will give the NODX a fillip in 2014.\n\nExcept for China, the US and Taiwan, Singapore's domestic exports to its top 10 markets fell in November. The European Union, Hong Kong and South Korea were the top three contributors to the decline.\n\nShipments to the EU, Singapore's biggest market, tumbled 26.6 per cent in November, after a 12.3 per cent decline the previous month.\n\nThose to the US jumped 10.3 per cent, compared with a 15.5 per cent decrease in October.\n\nEven exports to China, the biggest consumer of Singapore-made goods, grew 16.2 per cent - slower than the previous month's 21.8 per cent increase.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Almost immediately after the May general election, Mr Najib raised the price of fuel by 10 per cent. Since then, there have been several more hikes. Mr Najib abolished sugar subsidies in his 2014 Budget and promised to introduce a 6 per cent goods and services tax (GST) by April 2015. In his speech, however, he said he would cut subsidies by 17 per cent. That's nowhere near what has been announced, so economists are expecting more fuel price hikes later in 2014.\n\nIn early December, the government announced a 15 per cent rise in electricity tariffs that will take effect on Jan 1. Then, last week, the Works Ministry said that tolls on major expressways would be raised between RM0.50 and RM2. That last measure was greeted with such indignation that the ministry has since denied the announcement. It is also worth noting that one of the ruling Barisan Nasional's pledges before the election was a promise to reduce highway toll rates.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

Other options include expansion of Gatwick, south of the capital.\n\n\"The capacity challenge is not yet critical but it will become so if no action is taken soon, and our analysis clearly supports the provision of one net additional runway by 2030,\" Commission chairman Howard Davies said.\n\nA second new runway may also be needed by 2050, according to the panel, which didn't endorse calls for a new hub in the Thames estuary.\n\nMr Davies was appointed by Prime Minister David Cameron to help depoliticise UK aviation policy, and isn't due to make final recommendations until after the next general election in 2015.\n\nStill, his early findings may reopen political wounds, with many of Mr Cameron's parliamentary colleagues opposed to growth at Heathrow because of the extra noise and London Mayor Boris Johnson, also a Conservative, pledged to block expansion.\n\nThe commission said it will take forward proposals for a new runway at Gatwick, plus options at Heathrow for a 3.5 kilometre strip to the northwest or the extension of the existing northern runway to at least six kilometres.\n\nThe commission's preferences were drawn from a pool of over 50 proposals, ranging from runway extensions to the development of greenfield sites. Thames estuary options haven't been shortlisted because there are \"too many uncertainties and challenges\", it said, adding that a study of a new base on the Isle of Grain, Kent, will be undertaken in early 2014.\n\nHeathrow Airport Ltd submitted three plans to the commission, each capable of delivering extra flights by 2025-29 at a cost of \u00a314 billion (S$29 billion) to \u00a318 billion. The proposals would allow the hub to handle up to 130 million people a year, from 80 million today.\n\nMr Davies also said capacity could be given an interim boost through improved operational efficiencies, surface-transport improvements and smoothing of early morning schedules at Heathrow.\n\nIt added that an Independent Noise Authority should be established to advise on the impact of projects. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

And 2014 will definitely be no better, especially as new refineries emerge and markets stay weak. The dynamics have changed,\" he said.\n\n\"As for upgradings and new plant investments, companies here are likely to adopt a wait-and-see (approach) before splashing out any more money.\"\n\nSuch gloomy remarks echo reports of how new rival refineries in China and India will further flood global capacity, raising the spectre of thin margins in coming years.\n\nEugene Leong, the Economic Development Board's (EDB) head of Energy & Chemicals, agreed that \"if we are talking about just refining, I would be worried\".\n\nThat said, over the last few years, Singapore has steadily integrated oil refining with chemicals in a big way, resulting in naphtha cracking capacity here doubling to 4 million tonnes per annum (tpa) in a short time, making the industry here more robust, Mr Leong added.\n\n\"Having these two legs helps us even if the macro- environment is going to be tough. And Singapore now wants to add a third leg through lubricants,\" he said.\n\n\"We see opportunity for refineries here to further upgrade, especially with the consolidation of refineries in Europe over the last few years, and also in Asia, like in Australia and Japan. All this points to increased focus on Singapore being the refining hub for this region.\"\n\nHowever, \"it is important for our refineries to become more complex\", Mr Leong stressed.\n\nThe push to add a lubricants leg has started, with companies such as Sinopec, Shell and Total building blending facilities at the upcoming Singapore Lube Park. And then there are the lubricant additive investments by leading players, such as Infineum, Oronite, Afton and Evonik.\n\nEDB also sees opportunities for the manufacture of lubricant base oils here, Mr Leong said. At this stage, the only known potential investor for this is Chevron, which is reportedly considering a plant at its joint-venture Singapore Refining Company (SRC) refinery.\n\nGiven the fast-paced investment flow here over the past 3-4 years, including new multi-billion-dollar petrochemical complexes, Mr Leong reckons the refining/ petrochemicals industry is \"in the digestion phase\" now.\n\nThis is the time for the industry to build up flexibility and resilience to global competition, including through new technology, he said. ExxonMobil, for instance, has built feedstock flexibility into its new Singapore cracker, enabling it to even process crude oil into finished chemicals - a world first.\n\nSimilarly, it must build flexibility in markets by moving from producing just \"plain vanilla\" base chemicals to producing higher-value specialty ones like those at its two new chemical \"corridors\" on Jurong Island for synthetic rubber and also high-purity ethylene oxide (HPEO).\n\nMr Leong said that while rivals like South Korea and Taiwan are also moving into this space, Singapore's advantage is that it has drawn in the global leaders which possess the technology to continually innovate and find new products and applications to ride out market cycles.\n\n\"We have consciously grown Singapore by anchoring the market leaders here,\" he said. This is not just for the big upstream crackers, but also for the secondary plants like in the HPEO corridor, where it has attracted leaders like surfactants maker Solvay and another leading oilfield chemicals maker, whose name has not been disclosed yet.\n\nIn this \"digestion phase\", the industry has started looking at opportunity costs and savings, including ways to make plants more efficient and competitive. \"We are working closely with the players on some JI 2.0 initiative projects for this,\" Mr Leong said.\n\nFor instance, Royal Vopak's building of an LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) terminal here will help bring in an alternative feedstock, which is cheaper at certain times of the year, for the largely naphtha- fuelled petrochemical crackers here. The Republic is also rolling out a new energy efficiency measure, namely a heat integration plan, to enable plants on the petrochemicals island to share their excess heat or steam generated during operations.\n\nNoting that \"while global market conditions will have an impact on the industry here, we can't control markets\", Mr Leong said the measures are aimed at ensuring that \"the Singapore industry has the resilience, robustness and flexibility\" to ride out volatility.\n\nHe added: \"For instance, the big story today is shale gas, but we don't know the conclusion to this yet, including its impact on Singapore. Many companies here are also building projects there (in the US) to capitalise on availability of the advantaged feedstock. So the question is: will attention be diverted from Singapore in the short term?\n\n\"The real conundrum today is that while the market is here (in Asia), the feedstock is there.\"\n\nWhile Singapore has succeeded in securing global leaders like ExxonMobil and Shell - which have built their largest manufacturing sites here, including plants producing higher olefin specialties that the shale gas crackers cannot produce - industry development has to go beyond this, Mr Leong emphasised.\n\nAn example is new German investor Lanxess - which, beyond its big synthetic rubber plant investments, has anchored its global butyl rubber HQ here. Similarly, Evonik, on top of its manufacturing operations, has added an R&D laboratory and regional HQ here.\n\nTheir R&D activities will allow players to adjust to new market conditions and enable them to find new applications and products, Mr Leong said, adding that this is another factor that differentiates the Singapore industry from others.\n\nHe concluded: \"So it's a whole clustering of activities beyond manufacturing which makes the Singapore industry robust and able to withstand global volatilities - like competition from Middle East gas 10 years ago, and shale gas today, and perhaps something else tomorrow.\n\n\"As we grow the Singapore economy and different industry clusters, we are also finding synergies across industries here. For instance, consumer care makers Unilever and P&G have grown here, and we are now finding synergies in that they also need consumer care chemicals - and a lot of suppliers for these, like Croda, are already on Jurong Island.\"\n\nFurthermore, EDB hopes to harness such synergies in other industries, like in upstream oil/gas where oil rig makers and oilfield service providers will also need oilfield chemicals.\n\nThe bottom line, Mr Leong reckons, is a continued slate of projects - like higher olefins, specialty chemicals and other activities beyond manufacturing - in which the Singapore industry can be a player despite the advent of shale gas. \"This will shape the industry here in the future,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The other six men were previously accused of throwing concrete pieces at police officers.\n\nOf the seven, four will be warned in lieu of prosecution; no further action will be taken against the remaining three persons.\n\nThe cases against 21 others were also heard in court yesterday, with the prosecution applying for them to be remanded for another week for further police investigations. DPP Lu cited the copious amount of work to be done, such as going through the statements of all accused involved, the evidence of more than 300 police officers at the scene, video clips and surveillance camera recordings.\n\nJudge Lim agreed to the request but requested that the prosecution ask the police to \"expedite\" matters.\n\nWhen he asked if the defendants had anything to say, some suspects took the opportunity to speak up through a court interpreter. Some alleged assault by police officers while under lock-up in a \"place where there was no camera\", while others denied involvement in the riot, saying that they were in Little India to remit money, or claimed that the charges were \"fabrications\" as they were not even at the scene at the time.\n\nMeanwhile, two more men were charged in court for their involvement in the riot, taking the total number brought to the docks since the incident to 35. They are Samiyappan Sellathurai, 41, and Sarangan Kumaran, 35. The two are accused of being part of an unlawful assembly and throwing pieces of concrete at other people in the vicinity of Race Course Road and Kerbau Road.\n\nBoth face one charge of rioting each and if convicted, they could be jailed up to seven years and be liable to caning.\n\nThe cases of the 23 suspects who were further remanded from yesterday's hearing will be mentioned again in court on Dec 23.

The 53 were employed by 48 different companies in Singapore and half of them worked in the building and construction sector. The majority have been here for less than five years and were on Work Permits; only one was on an employment pass.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean said that the 53 - who were rounded up in a police operation early on Tuesday morning - had \"knowingly joined or continued to participate in the riot after being ordered to disperse, impeding the riot control and emergency rescue operations\".\n\n\"Their actions and conduct had threatened public order, thus making their continued presence in Singapore undesirable,\" said Mr Teo, who added that the men would be issued \"a stern warning\" before being repatriated.\n\nRevised measures to manage public order are expected to be announced by the police in the coming days. Said Mr Teo: \"These revised measures are likely to remain in place, for the time being, with adjustments at the margins as necessary.\"\n\nDuring a visit last evening to a foreign workers' dormitory in Jurong, Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade and Industry S Iswaran said that the previous weekend's ban on alcohol consumption in public places in Little India will continue this weekend.\n\nIn response to a BT query, Commissioner of Police Ng Joo Hee said that \"as long as the companies are cooperative with the police and with our investigative efforts, they will not be held culpable\" for their foreign workers' misdeeds, and that their security bond with the government will not be forfeited.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) website, all employers of non-Malaysian work permit holders are required to deposit a $5,000 security bond with MOM.\n\nEmployers risk forfeiting the security bond if they or their worker violate conditions of their work permit. Typical violations include failing to pay salaries on time, or failing to repatriate the foreign worker after cancelling his work permit.\n\nThe 53 are being held at Admiralty West Prison - which serves as an immigration depot - while their travel arrangements, salary payments, and other administrative procedures are finalised.\n\nSome will also be interviewed by the Committee of Inquiry (COI) before being sent home.\n\nThe four-member COI had its first meeting on Monday, three days after being appointed on Dec 13.\n\n\"With the repatriation of these 53, police action against suspected rioters has largely come to an end. Moving forward, we do not expect to be arresting, charging, or repatriating many more persons,\" said Mr Ng.\n\nSeparate from those charged and those to be repatriated, another group of about 200 South Asians have been identified as having been present at the riot two Sundays ago, but their involvement has been assessed to be \"relatively passive\" based on the available evidence.\n\nWhile they will be issued a formal police advisory, no further action will be taken against them and they will be allowed to remain and work in Singapore \"on condition of continued good behaviour\".\n\nThe fatal traffic accident which police say sparked the riot is still being actively investigated.\n\nThe police are in the process of securing the services of an independent expert on accident reconstruction, to analyse the information gathered and to provide an additional opinion.\n\nFollowing the riot, more than 500 police investigators were deployed; almost 4,000 people were interviewed, of whom 420 were called up for investigations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net outflows reached US$36.3 billion, also set for a record decline, it said. Investments in precious metals have slid 40 per cent since 2012 to US$119 billion.\n\n\"If precious metals ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) are excluded, the picture is a lot more positive,\" Barclays analysts led by Kevin Norrish wrote in the report. \"Nevertheless we view 2014 as likely to be another difficult year for commodity investors as any clear and sustainable trends in prices will likely be few and far between.\"\n\nThe Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials dropped 3.2 per cent since the start of this year, headed for the worst year since the 43 per cent drop in 2008. Some 52 out of 67 commodity indices tracked by Bloomberg are down this year as copper to corn tumbled into bear markets as supply surged.\n\nGold and silver are headed for the worst year since 1981 as the US Federal Reserve prepared to trim its stimulus programme and investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value. Goldman Sachs Group Inc called bullion a \"slam-dunk\" sell in October and said that it was among the bank's most bearish commodity forecasts for next year.\n\nETP holdings backed by bullion slumped 31 per cent this year to 1,802.46 tonnes, poised for the first outflow since the funds started trading in 2003. A further 311 tonnes will be withdrawn next year, a Bloomberg survey of 11 analyst estimates showed.\n\nExcluding precious metals ETPs, commodity index swaps and ETPs had almost US$4 billion of net inflows this year through November, setting index-linked investments on track for the first positive year in three, Barclays said.\n\nChina's economic growth will slow for a fourth year in 2014, the International Monetary Fund estimates.

Of those surveyed here, 59 per cent predicted an expansion of the global economy, up from 32 per cent a year ago.\n\nHowever, these same professionals also cited some concerns over global market integrity, with those in Singapore and Switzerland being the two most critical groups on the issue of a lack of ethical culture within firms.\n\nThese were among key findings of the online survey conducted between Oct 2 and 17, which drew responses from 6,561 members in over 110 countries.\n\nOverall, 63 per cent of the respondents said they expect the global economy to expand in 2014 - a significant shift from last year, when only 40 per cent of members expressed optimism about the worldwide economy.\n\nMost optimistic this year were members in the United Kingdom (78 per cent) and Brazil (74 per cent). Most cautious were two Asian nations: Hong Kong with 54 per cent, and China with 48 per cent.\n\nAt the same time, investment professionals did not rate the integrity of global markets this past year (2013) highly.\n\nRespondents in Singapore and Switzerland were the most critical about the lack of ethical culture within financial firms, with 63 per cent in Singapore and 71 per cent in Switzerland naming it as the top factor contributing to the current lack of trust in the finance industry. Globally, just over half (54 per cent) of respondents indicated so.\n\n\"The survey reflects that investor trust has been eroded and in order for the financial industry to be an extraordinary force for good, we must embrace ethical behaviour at all levels,\" said John Rogers, CFA, president and CEO of CFA Institute.\n\n\"As markets rebound, we are working to ensure that attention does not shift away from meaningful reforms that might restore investor trust and strengthen the financial system's ability to resist shocks in the future.\"\n\nSingapore also leads the world's major markets in calling for top management and executives to establish and encourage better culture within the firm. Just under half (49 per cent) the respondents here said this is the most needed action to help improve investor trust and confidence - compared to 40 per cent globally.\n\nInvestment professionals in Singapore were also among the most concerned about market fraud, and feel that this issue will worsen going ahead. Thirty per cent said they see market fraud as the most serious ethical issue facing both local and global markets in the coming year. This is almost three times higher than last year, when only 11 per cent cited this as the most serious ethical issue locally, while 15 per cent felt it was the dominant problem for global markets.\n\nWorldwide, mis-selling (25 per cent) ranked as the top ethical issue locally, with market fraud a close second (24 per cent).\n\nGlobally, 29 per cent said the most needed action to improve investor trust and market integrity is improved regulation and oversight of systemic risk. This sentiment is stronger in the Asia-Pacific (40 per cent) than in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (33 per cent) and the Americas (24 per cent).\n\nA majority of members also said that increased global coordination of monitoring systemic risks is the most likely way to prevent future financial crises. One fifth (21 per cent) said there is a need for improved transparency in financial reporting and other corporate disclosures.\n\nDaryl Liew, chair of the advocacy committee and board member of CFA Society Singapore, said: \"The strong call for greater ethical culture within firms suggests that the investment community here recognises a need for, and also demands, higher standards in ethical behaviour and integrity, as Singapore emerges rapidly as a top investment and wealth management centre in the world.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But, while less disclosure is not necessarily the answer, better - ie, more relevant - disclosure is.\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) has released a report calling for vital reform of four areas of financial statement disclosure.\n\nIt says that problems over disclosure are the result of the current regulatory system, and the system must change or disclosures will deteriorate.\n\nIts report, \"Financial Reporting Disclosures: Market and Regulatory Failures\", says that because the current system is set up to meet users' potentially limitless information requirements, all the incentives are to over-disclose and not to limit disclosure to relevant and material information.\n\nIt also notes a conflict between regulation and standardisation of financial reporting disclosures and the diversity of firms and user needs.\n\nRobert Hodgkinson, ICAEW executive director, said: \"Companies are diverse and so are users' information needs. But regulation tends to impose a one-size-fits-all approach on to both what companies disclose and users receive.\"\n\nThe report notes that regulation requires firms to disclose the same information to all users, with the result that ordinary users are faced with reports designed for users who benefit from long and complex disclosures. Uniform disclosure requirements imposed on diverse firms can also result in a proportion of disclosures being immaterial.\n\nICAEW feels that if the situation is left unchecked, the volume of irrelevant disclosures is set to grow.\n\n\"We need a major culture shift, where everyone is working to ensure that relevant and material information is disclosed, and immaterial disclosures are omitted. Regulators, standard setters, companies and auditors should all face the challenge of explaining what they are doing to ensure that disclosures are clear and focused, rather than complex and overwhelming,\" Mr Hodgkinson said.\n\nSuch a coordinated approach by key stakeholders should address the following areas:\n\nICAEW acknowledges that there is no solution to the current issues that will guarantee that everyone gets what they want, and that there are no improvements that will come without costs and risks attached.\n\n\"The question for those involved in the financial reporting process is therefore whether they are willing to bear the costs and increased risks of changes that could improve the system of financial reporting disclosures as a whole or whether they prefer on balance to leave things as they are. If they prefer to leave things as they are, then the present feelings of disenchantment and alienation from the financial reporting process can only be expected to grow as mandatory disclosures continue to increase,\" its report said.\n\nICAEW is a professional membership organisation, supporting over 138,000 chartered accountants around the world.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was a surprise to see a wave of IPO listings in this third quarter following a muted performance in the first two quarters,\" said Ernest Kan, chief of operations for clients & markets at Deloitte Singapore, which released the data yesterday.\n\nOne-third of the proceeds raised this year ($2.04 billion) were driven by 11 IPOs that were completed in the third quarter, which led to the year-to-date listings outperforming the deal flow and volume of IPOs in the first three quarters of 2012.\n\n\"Despite a slightly muted fourth quarter, in line with historical trends of slower activity, we expect IPO activity to lift through the first few quarters of 2014, fuelled by the positive momentum in the IPO landscape by regulators, companies and investors that are expected to drive Singapore market at varying timing and pace,\" Dr Kan added.\n\nHe said that Deloitte is encouraged by the significant growth of the market capitalisation for each IPO this year, with 18 out of the 26 IPOs having a market capitalisation of above $100 million. That's compared to the 12 IPOs that had a market cap above $100 million in 2012.\n\n\"Another noteworthy point is that, of the 18 IPOs with market capitalisation of above $100 million, five of them were Catalist listings this year, compared to none last year, marking a stellar showing of the Catalist platform.\"\n\nIt was also a banner year for real estate investment trusts (Reits) - with interest in the property sector staying high - and business trusts; the seven Reits and business trusts raised a total of $5.28 billion in 2013.\n\n\"The two mega-listings of Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust and SPH Reit have not only driven the increase in number of IPOs and proceeds raised this year but also raised the profile of Singapore as a listing destination, further boosting Singapore as the key financial hub in South-east Asia,\" Dr Kan said.\n\nHe added that Singapore has a competitive edge when it comes to such listings, through its first-mover advantage position, having established itself as a major Asian hub for Reits and business trusts over the last decade. The number of Reit listings have increased, along with a broader diversity in asset types and an increased growth in cross-border S-Reits holding foreign assets.\n\nReits also generated better yields than Straits Times Index (STI) stocks on a dividend basis.\n\nEnergy and resources stocks have also proven popular, making up 19 per cent of the IPOs this year. They were second only to real estate listings, which made up 42 per cent.\n\nAnother notable trend was that, of the top five IPOs in Singapore this year, the companies with merger & acquisition (M&A) activities after listing fared best.\n\n\"It seems that investors respond well to companies with clear prospects. Halcyon Agri Corporation has carried out numerous acquisitions in the 10-month span that it has been listed. It is possible that the reason its share price has more than doubled in that period is that investors are responding to this company's prospects given the string of M&As,\" Dr Kan noted.\n\nOn the global front, he noted that China is expected to lead the IPO market next year following the country's decision to end a 15-month freeze on IPOs. This is expected to unleash at least US$11 billion of share sales in 2014. Singapore is expected to benefit from this with the establishment of a direct listing framework between the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission.\n\nLooking ahead, Dr Kan said: \"Even as there remains the prospect of the eventual quantitative easing (QE) by the Fed (US Federal Reserve), we believe our capital market will be resilient as it has grown stronger from the expansion of SGX's global presence in establishing a strong international investor base and their active outreach to attract IPO candidates.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Most of its clients now are institutional ones.\n\nWhether ICE will retain current SMX products - the most actively traded of which included its euro-US dollar currency pair, its copper futures contract and its e-gold futures contract - is not yet decided.\n\n\"We have to go through every product to make a determination on which ones we think are going to be valuable,\" Ms Ilkiw said.\n\nICE last month announced that it is buying the exchange for US$150 million. The deal reduced the amount of time ICE would have otherwise taken to build its own infrastructure here, and propelled it ahead of competition to become the first non-Asian exchange to own a clearing house in a region fast transforming into a battleground for exchanges.\n\n\"The transaction to acquire SMX provides us with exchange and clearing licences in Singapore, without having to go through the complete regulatory process from scratch,\" explained Ms Ilkiw.\n\nICE currently has a headcount of eight in Singapore, focused on marketing and business development.\n\nThe acquisition, now awaiting approval by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, is likely to be finalised by end-December.\n\nThe Singapore Mercantile Exchange was launched in 2010, to ride on Singapore's growth as a commodities trading hub.\n\nWithin a year, however, it was hit by an exodus of senior staff, including its chief executive, Thomas McMahon, reportedly due to disagreement over how SMX was being run by its parent company and owner, Mumbai-based Financial Technologies Group.\n\nIt has also struggled with low trading volumes.\n\nThe acquisition of SMX gives ICE a foothold in the fast-growing derivatives market in Asia as competition hots up.\n\nDeutsche Bourse is also reported to be considering building a derivatives clearing house in Asia.\n\nICE had looked at other markets such as Hong Kong, Australia and Japan, and decided on Singapore, noted Ms Ilkiw, partly due to Singapore's position as an oil trading hub.\n\n\"A significant amount of our existing energy business comes from here ... this is a natural fit for the expansion of ICE's business into Asia,\" she said.\n\nFounded in 2000, ICE has seen a meteoric rise to become the second largest exchange globally by market capitalisation. Its Brent crude oil contract is used to price for two-thirds of the world's internationally traded crude oil.\n\nThe Atlanta-based exchange, which has built itself up through acquisitions in its 13-year history, is also making a big push into Europe through a recently-concluded US$8.2 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext.\n\nThrough Liffe, NYSE's London-based derivatives exchange which is a leader in trading interest rate derivatives, ICE hopes to transform itself from a predominantly energy derivatives exchange into a multi-faceted one such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group and Deutsche Borse.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But consultants believe that last month's tally shows that there is still interest for attractively priced and well-located projects.\n\nSaid Christine Li, head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee: \"This could imply that there is demand in the market, and investors are simply biding their time.\"\n\nNovember sales were boosted by strong demand for the Duo Residences in Bugis, where 600 units were sold at a median price of $1,999 per square foot (psf), and Alex Residences at Redhill, where 171 units were moved at a median price of $1,706 psf. The pricing for Duo Residences was seen as particularly attractive by analysts.\n\nSuccessful developers adjusted prices to match current buyer sentiment, said Mohamed Ismail, CEO of PropNex Realty.\n\nAlan Cheong, head of research at Savills Singapore, said that the November numbers affirm his belief that the TDSR won't cause a \"slash and burn\" in the market and will merely slow down the rate of sales.\n\nIn terms of performance by region, Core Central Region (CCR) saw more homes sold than the Rest of Central Region (RCR) and Outside Central Region (OCR) combined last month. Only two new CCR projects were launched, Duo Residences and Clermont Residence at Tanjong Pagar, but the overall sales of 662 units made up 54 per cent of all transactions.\n\nBut Nicholas Mak, executive director for research and consultancy at SLP International, said that this was an \"unusual\" event unlikely to repeat itself often in the near future, as there are not many projects like Duo Residences in the pipeline.\n\nRCR sales volume was up 29 per cent from October at 352 units, backed by sales at Alex Residences, while OCR transactions fell 70 per cent to 214 homes, primarily on the lack of new launches.\n\nChia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International said that homebuyers may be turning to reasonably priced homes in CCR and RCR given the narrowing price gaps between mid-to-high-end homes and mass market homes.\n\nShe said that some 73 per cent of new homes sold last month were in the range of $1,500-2,500 psf. \"This is a contrast from past trends, where the majority of new homes were transacted at below $1,500 psf.\"\n\nThe lowest selling price on a psf basis in November was for a unit at The Inflora in Tampines sold at $723 psf, while the most expensive unit was one at Twin Peaks in Leonie Hill that transacted at $3,052 psf, SLP's Mr Mak said.\n\nIncluding ECs, 1,714 new homes were sold last month, 42 per cent higher than the month before. Sky Park Residences in Sembawang and Waterwoods in Punggol were the best sellers for ECs last month.\n\nFor the first 11 months of the year, 14,678 new private homes (excluding ECs) were sold. Analysts are expecting total sales for this year to be close to 16,000, a significant dip from the record 22,197 last year.\n\nDesmond Sim, associate director at CBRE Research, believes that prices will see a \"marginal rise of around 2 per cent\" on the year.\n\nDecember should be fairly quiet due to the festive season, with sales below 1,000 units, analysts said, and with demand likely to pick up again after Chinese New Year as pending projects hit the market.\n\n\"Going forward, pricing is key and developers have to price attractively to move units quickly,\" said Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty.\n\nProjects that may be launched in the first half of next year include Marina One developed by M+S, City Development's South Beach Residences, The Panorama by Wheelock Properties and Keppel Land's project at Kim Tian Road. Sales could be anywhere from 10,000 to 16,000 units next year, with some consultants expecting prices to be flat or marginally lower.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The TPA expired in 2007, but it is now crucial to completing the final round of negotiations on a historic trade deal with the 12 partner economies of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) as well as accelerating the talks on a trade pact with the European Union (EU) economies, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP).\n\nThe TPP is the centrepiece of the Obama administration's geo-strategic and geo-economic agenda, the so-called \"pivot\" to the Asia-Pacific region that was supposed to underline Washington's renewed commitment to Asia and to expanding its presence in the region.\n\nTrade ministers from the TPP completed their talks in Singapore on Dec 10 but failed to meet the earlier goal of concluding a trade agreement by the end of this year. But they hope to conclude a deal in early 2014. At the same time, the expectation in Washington and Brussels is that a TTIP deal could be reached in 2015.\n\nWith these big trade deals in the works, US Trade Representative Michael Froman is pressing Congress to approve the FTA legislation ASAP, insisting that trade negotiators in Asia would not be willing to make all the necessary concessions unless they were confident that the US Congress would not subject them to renegotiation.\n\nThe TPA bill, which is expected to be introduced in January, will face fierce opposition from Democratic legislators affiliated with the labour unions and environmentalist forces who warn that free trade accords such as the TPP encourage American companies to relocate operations to low-wage emerging economies that don't adhere to environmental standards. There will also be pushback from conservative Republican lawmakers with ties to the Tea Party movement who don't want to strengthen the power of President Barack Obama by granting him a new TPA.\n\nSo the president now has his work cut out. He must place the goal of liberalising global trade on the top of his policy agenda and exert leadership to ensure that the TPA legislation gets approved by Congress early, before Democrats and Republicans start preparing for next year's midterm Congressional elections. But he must articulate a coherent global trade narrative which highlights the benefits that liberalising trade, especially with Asia, can bring to the American economy - by creating new jobs and investments, while strengthening US global leadership.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The final PMI will be released on Jan 2. Growth in both new orders and export orders grew at a faster rate in the period surveyed, while sub-indexes measuring employment and stocks of purchases showed faster rates of decrease.\n\n\"The December HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI reading slowed marginally from November's final reading,\" said Hongbin Qu, chief economist for China at HSBC. \"But it still stands above the average reading for 3Q, implying that the recovering trend of the manufacturing sector starting from July still holds up. As a result, we expect China's GDP growth to stabilise at around 7.8 per cent year on year in 4Q.\"\n\nMany economists have said that China's economy is likely to show weaker momentum in the final three months of this year after a rebound between July and September, due to slowing credit growth and a fall off in restocking demand.\n\nData earlier in the month showed growth in China's factory output and investment eased slightly last month, though retail sales grew at their strongest rate this year, suggesting that the economy is on track to achieve the government's 7.5 per cent growth target this year.\n\nBeijing has made it clear that it would accept a slower growth rate while it pushes ahead with economic reforms to wean the growth away from investment and export towards consumption.\n\nThe leadership pledged to maintain stable economic policies to achieve reasonable economic growth next year while forging ahead with reforms, as they wrapped up a closed-door meeting last Friday.

We need to allocate the bulk of our profit into growing this company ... but the board also recognises that we want to put equal priorities between our shareholders' benefit and the (growth) of the company,\" he noted.\n\nThe dividend is also a result of the firm's ramp-up in gold production this year, he added.\n\nCNMC has produced 6,835 ounces of fine gold so far this year, compared with 4,641.86 ounces for the whole of last year.\n\nThe sizable boost in gold production was in large part due to CNMC's two new heap leach facilities which started operations this year.\n\nExtracting gold through heap leaching involves piling up the crushed ores and sprinkling the extracting chemical solution on top, a process which causes the gold minerals to leach to the bottom for collection and further processing.\n\nThe firm previously extracted gold using vat leaching, in which ores are placed in a tank filled with the extracting chemical solution. This had a smaller processing capacity and was also more expensive.\n\nCNMC expects a third heap leach facility to start operations once the monsoon season ends in February, which will bring its annual processing capacity to one million tonnes of ore a year.\n\nThis will further bring up its gold production next year, said Mr Lim.\n\nThe dividend announcement is a \"very positive move\" for CNMC, said Voyage Research analyst Liu Jinshu. \"Most junior mining companies will refrain from giving dividends, preferring to use it for their cashflow. This suggests that CNMC has managed to grow its production to a more sustainable scale.\"\n\nShares for many gold mining firms around the world have suffered as the gold spot price fell 27 per cent this year to about US$1,230 per ounce, breaking a 12-year bull run for the yellow metal.\n\nCNMC's shares, which hit a high of 47.5 cents on Jan 18 in response to its inaugural gold pour, have also since dropped to 25.5 cents yesterday, unchanged from Friday's close.\n\nThe firm, whose all-in gold production costs is at US$775 per ounce, is looking to minimise production costs. This includes making its new heap leach facility deeper and wider so that waste ores already stripped of ore content do not have to be removed, as is the case for its current facilities, and new ores can be piled on top of them.\n\nIn the longer term, CNMC is exploring more mining opportunities in Malaysia and the region. Two weeks ago, it announced a new joint venture with Menteri Besar Incorporated (Perak), the investment arm of the Perak government, to explore and mine tin in a 700-acre land.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the new campaign, Boeing would redouble efforts to recapture customers without sacrificing profitable growth.\n\nLast Wednesday, Mr Conner's counter-offensive paid off with a US$6.5 billion deal to sell up to 109 jets to Air Canada. His long-time rival, Airbus sales chief John Leahy, shrugged off the defeat, indirectly accusing Boeing of slashing prices aggressively to win the deal. \"It takes two to have a war,\" he told Reuters.\n\nPrivately, Airbus officials were said to be shocked by the symbolic loss of one of the first North American carriers to buy their planes 25 years ago - jets that Mr Leahy himself had sold when making a name for himself with flexible deals.\n\nDespite dominating last month's Dubai Airshow with sales of one of its biggest jets, the B777X, Boeing is lagging well behind Airbus in sales of the latest generation of smaller single-aisle jets - the best-sellers for both companies.\n\nIn 2010, Airbus went to the market nine months earlier than its rival with fuel savings on a new version of its A320, made possible by new engines. The revamped A320neo continues to upset the traditional balance in sales of medium-haul jets between the leading manufacturers.\n\nIn just six weeks between September and October this year, Airbus successfully wooed Delta Airlines, supplanted Boeing at Mexican budget carrier VivaAerobus and ended its monopoly at Japan Airlines (JAL) for larger models.\n\nBy end-November, the A320neo had a cumulative total of 2,523 orders, or 61 per cent of the market, compared with 1,639 for Boeing's competing 737 MAX, according to Airbus data.\n\n\"They always compete for market share, but there has been a change of pace in the battle between the A320neo and 737 MAX,\" said Teal Group aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia.\n\nMr Conner, promoted from sales chief in June last year, had already brought in a more direct approach, keeping up the habit of negotiating personally with airline bosses to clinch big deals and achieving the number one spot in overall sales last year.\n\nBut amid recent losses, he has decided to win back territory with a coaching effort based on unvarnished talk about the archrival's strengths, rare for an internal communication.\n\nThe new campaign reminded employees that Airbus had beaten them in net orders for much of the last decade and was now sitting on a bigger backlog. It was seen as a bold move in an industry where executives diligently stay on message.\n\nBy putting sales at the heart of company culture, and conducting frank post-mortems on losses such as JAL, Mr Conner has shifted Boeing's airplane division towards market results and away from the engineering-driven focus of his predecessors.\n\nIt also highlighted another burning topic: to regain market share and fund the company's future growth, Boeing first needed to put itself in a position to win by improving service and lowering costs, including the cost of its unionised labour. Boeing is currently locked in a dispute with workers over where to build its next jet.\n\nBoeing says that it does not target a specific market share, but is widely said to be looking to restore a broadly equal split in the single-aisle medium-haul jets seen in the past decade. \"We think about winning campaigns, not about accepting a certain market share,\" Boeing chairman and chief executive Jim McNerney said.\n\nAnalysts say that market share is, however, a key concern in a duopoly such as that between the world's largest planemakers. Failing to keep up volumes risks allowing a competitor to run away with advantages in costs, increasing its power to offer better prices and win even more share.\n\nIndustry analysts say that Boeing's 40-per cent share of the new single-aisle sales is getting close to a point of no return. Furthermore, losing ground in the single-aisle market restricts the supply of cash needed to maintain the attack on other fronts, notably the higher-margin long-distance jets.\n\nAlthough its underlying strategy has not changed, at some point in recent months, according to industry officials, suppliers and buyers, Boeing drew a line in the sand and put more emphasis on regaining share in the single-aisle market.\n\nIt flagged its intentions with a surprise decision to increase the 737-family production by 23 per cent in four years, leapfrogging Airbus and freeing up more planes to be sold.\n\nUnder Mr Conner's latest winter offensive, people in both camps say that Boeing has stepped up an already vigorous sales effort, identifying key campaigns it wants to win.\n\nSome say that he has taken a page out of his rival's playbook by racing to close deals at the end of the year when the industry is totting up annual wins and losses. Air Canada was therefore seen as a sales contest to watch. Planemakers compete by blocking and tackling each other with the help of price cuts and other sweeteners such as training, but winning Air Canada also called for an audacious throw.\n\nThe airline wanted to get rid of elderly planes sitting at high values on its balance sheet and had made that a key part of any deal, according to a person familiar with the talks. Boeing agreed to buy back up to 20 Embraer 190s as trade-ins, the airline said. Industry sources said that Boeing may also buy two of its competitor's jets: Airbus A340s that Air Canada had leased to a Brazilian airline, but were sitting idle. \"The Air Canada win implies that Boeing might actually break out of a 40-per cent market share and hit back onto Airbus territory,\" Mr Aboulafia said.\n\nDespite Boeing's focus on winning new sales, Mr Leahy said that he was confident of keeping 60 per cent of the market for single-aisle jets because the A320's makeover is more extensive, widening a relative gap in performance against the 737. Boeing disputes the Airbus performance claims and insists its 737 workhorse jet is, and will remain, more efficient. Most airlines say that the aircraft are broadly similar.\n\nBoeing's top sales executive, John Wojick, says that it is a long-term struggle he aims to win. \"There are 23,000 single-aisle airplanes forecast to be delivered in the next 20 years, and so far we and Airbus have sold just 4,000 of those. Airbus is declaring a decisive victory when only the first quarter of the game has been played. We plan to win our fair market share,\" he said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Yesterday, it announced strategic alliances with three airlines - Taiwan's China Airlines, India's low-cost airline SpiceJet, and Singapore Airlines' Scoot - to expand its network and commercial cooperation.\n\nGroup CEO of Tigerair Koay Peng Yen said: \"The partnerships unveiled today will help us to expand our network, attain greater cost-savings, and build a stronger brand presence in the region . . . without taxing our balance sheet.\"\n\nTigerair shares closed 4 per cent higher yesterday at its intra-day high of 52 cents on the news.\n\nThe airline said that it plans to form a joint venture with China Airlines to set up Tigerair Taiwan, a Taiwan-based budget carrier, just weeks after privately owned TransAsia Airways launched the market's first low-cost carrier.\n\nUnder the JV agreement, Tigerair will hold a one-tenth stake in the new carrier, or NT$200 million (S$8.5 million) of the paid-up capital of NT$2 billion.\n\nMr Koay said: \"The new JV will allow us to extend our presence into the new, untapped markets of Taiwan, Japan, and Korea.\"\n\nAlthough Tigerair Taiwan will operate under the Tigerair brand and will use Tigerair's website as its main sales and distribution platform, it will be independently managed. It remains subject to Taiwanese regulatory approvals.\n\nTigerair also signed a three-year interline agreement with SpiceJet to offer both airlines' customers the benefits of connecting onto each other's flights.\n\nStarting from Jan 1, customers travelling on SpiceJet's domestic network from 14 Indian cities can enjoy seamless connection through Hyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport onto Tigerair's Singapore-bound flights. The reverse for Tigerair customers from Singapore will come into effect from Jan 31.\n\nThe 14 Indian cities are Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Mumbai, Kolkata, Coimbatore, Delhi, Goa, Indore, Mangalore, Madurai, Pune, Rajahmundry, Tirupati, and Visakhapatnam.\n\nHyderabad's Rajiv Gandhi International Airport will also provide a free porter service to facilitate baggage transfer for travellers on connecting flights between the two airlines.\n\nA third agreement was signed with interline partner Scoot to deepen their collaboration in commercial activities and network coordination.\n\nThe existing cooperation enables passengers from outside Singapore to buy itineraries covering the services of both airlines, for example Jakarta to Singapore (operated by Tigerair), and onwards from Singapore to Tianjin (operated by Scoot).\n\nThis mainly benefits travellers outside Singapore, but the proposed enhancements will work to benefit Singapore residents as well, Tigerair said.\n\nFor instance, the joint operation, sales and marketing of parallel routes will offer customers more flexibility and flight options.

They are very proud of their technology - very high quality and very high reliability and safety,\" Mr Lee told reporters in the Japanese capital over the weekend.\n\nHe was there to attend a special summit to celebrate 40 years of relations between Japan and the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).\n\nLast Thursday, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak revealed that three top Japanese corporations - Hitachi, Sumitomo Corporation and Mitsui & Co - had expressed interest in the 330km project. Mr Najib added that his government was still conducting a feasibility study. Once that is completed, an international bidding process would be carried out, with Malaysian news agency Bernama saying that this would take place in the second half of 2014.\n\nIn a joint press conference with Mr Najib after their meeting, Mr Abe \"strongly requested\" Malaysia to choose Shinkansen technology for the high-speed rail.\n\nBesides Japan, firms from China and Europe are also keen in the high-speed rail link, which is targeted to be complete by 2020.\n\nThe project - reported to cost about RM40 billion (S$15 billion) - was first announced in February this year during Mr Lee's retreat with Mr Najib in Singapore.\n\nWhen ready, the trains will shuttle passengers from Singapore to KL in just 90 minutes. This journey usually takes about, on average, eight hours by train, five hours by bus and four hours by car.\n\nWhile in Tokyo, Mr Najib wrote on his Twitter page that the timeline for the high-speed rail would be finalised next year.\n\nTen days ago, Singapore and Malaysia announced they would form a joint work group to discuss and jointly recommend requirements for the project.\n\nThis work group will fall under the purview of the Malaysia-Singapore Joint Ministerial Committee for Iskandar Malaysia.\n\n\"(The committee) has agreed on defining the (high-speed rail) project by next year.

Nok will have a 51 per cent stake, while Scoot will take a 49 per cent interest in the new airline, which is the Thai legal limit for foreign ownership.\n\nThe airline will be based at Don Mueang International Airport and operate widebody aircraft on medium and long-haul international routes.\n\nNoting that Thailand is Asia's premier tourist destination and a logical hub for Scoot to expand to, Campbell Wilson, CEO of Scoot, said yesterday: \"In supporting Nok with Scoot's experience in medium-haul widebody operations, we look forward to developing a new market segment and offering Thai consumers and travellers to Thailand more travel options.\"\n\nThe new airline is subject to regulatory approvals from the Thai authorities.\n\nBack in 2011, similar plans were made for a budget carrier joint venture between Singapore's Tiger Airways and Thai Airways, which was scrapped after a year of negotiations. The two airlines had announced plans in August 2010 to set up a new Bangkok-based budget carrier that would be 49 per cent owned by Tiger Airways, with the remaining stake owned by Thai Airways and affiliates.\n\nThe Thai transport ministry had then questioned the need for Thai Airways to set up a new airline with the Singapore carrier when it already had a 39 per cent stake - now increased to 49 per cent - in Nok Air. The proposed JV airline never took off.\n\nThe setback between Thai Airways and Tiger Airways notwithstanding, Scoot and Nok are both optimistic about the new venture. \"We are excited at the prospect of expanding Nok's presence overseas, and to be doing so with the assistance of Scoot. It has always been Nok's goal to offer Thais more choice and more value, of which this venture is yet another example,\" said Patee Sarasin, CEO of Nok Air.\n\nThe two airlines said details of the new low-cost carrier's fleet, products and route network will be released at a later date.\n\nCIMB analysts Andrew Orchard and Raymond Yap said the new subsidiary requires substantially more scale before it can compete effectively with the more established low-cost brands.\n\nThey maintained a \"hold\" rating on SIA as they felt that competitive pressures from both Middle Eastern and low-cost carriers will continue to weigh on earnings.\n\n\"The new strategies that SIA is pursuing have yet to reap much benefit, while the parent airline continues to be hurt by competition,\" they added.\n\nSeparately, SIA released its operating results for November yesterday showing its passenger load factor (PLF) dipped 0.7 percentage point to 77 per cent.\n\nPLF softened across all route regions except Americas and Europe. SIA said the operating environment continues to be challenging and efforts to stimulate demand to boost loads will continue to place downward pressure on yields.\n\nSIA shares closed nine cents higher at $10.14 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[LONDON] Peter Saunders had to stretch his resources to buy a house this year in UK Prime Minister David Cameron's constituency town of Witney, where values have risen at twice the UK average over the last three months.\n\nThe 27-year-old hotel manager said he needed money from an inheritance as well as a mortgage to afford the \u00a3200,000 (S$410,000) Witney home in Oxfordshire.\n\nThe market town, which has a 13th-Century church at its centre, is surrounded by rolling hills and farms.\n\nOxford, 21 km away, is even more expensive, he said.\n\nMr Cameron's efforts to spur the economy by supporting mortgage lending are fuelling price increases across the country, prompting buyers to extend their credit and leaving them vulnerable to interest-rate increases.\n\nPeople purchasing a first home in the UK are borrowing 3.4 times their annual income on average, matching a record set in August 2007, according to data compiled by the Council for Mortgage Lenders.\n\n\"Witney is a bit of a bubble,\" Mr Saunders said.\n\n\"We kept hearing in the news about how the Bank of England is feeling more positive about the economy and how interest rates might rise quicker than expected, so we went with a five-year, fixed-rate mortgage,\" he added.\n\nHouse prices climbed in all of the UK's regions for the first time in more than six years in November, according to Hometrack Ltd.\n\nValues have reached records in areas of the South-east including Oxfordshire, Hertfordshire as well as the Welsh capital, Cardiff, LSL Property Services Plc said in a Dec 13 report.\n\nPrice growth in the West Midlands region was second only to Greater London in the three months through November compared with a year earlier, according to the report.\n\n\"It's very dangerous to boost house prices, given they already start from an unsustainable level based on price-to-earnings ratios,\" David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College and a former member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, said by e-mail. \"There are no signs of wages rising, so buyers beware as interest rises eventually will come.\"\n\nMr Cameron first took steps to bolster home purchases in the aftermath of the recession as banks curtailed mortgage lending and demanded higher down payments.\n\nThe London market became the first to recover in 2009 as lower unemployment and higher-than-average wages, as well as investment from abroad, pushed up prices.\n\nThe government's Help to Buy and the Bank of England's Funding for Lending programmes have helped drive the price gains.\n\nThe government in October brought forward the second phase of Help to Buy by three months.\n\nIt enables purchasers to take out a loan with a down payment of as little as 5 per cent on homes valued at up to \u00a3600,000.\n\nFunding for Lending permits banks and building societies to borrow from the Bank of England if they use the cash to fund residential mortgages or loans to businesses.\n\nDuring the next five years, prices in the centre of the capital will rise about 23 per cent, slower than the 25 per cent gain for the UK as a whole, according to broker Savills Plc.\n\nThe number of mortgages with down payments of 15 per cent or less rose 80 per cent in October from a year earlier to the highest since April 2008, according to property appraisal firm e.surv Ltd.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said in May that unless the UK's efforts to lift housing increased the supply, the initiatives would cause price increases that \"would work against the aim of boosting access to housing\".\n\nThe average home in England and Wales costs 6.2 times the median income for full-time workers, according to government filings this year.\n\nBank of England governor Mark Carney last month signalled that the housing market needs cooling when he limited the Funding for Lending programme to business loans rather than household borrowing starting in 2014.\n\n\"This will help keep the housing market on a sustainable path and ensure the broader economy continues to receive the stimulus it needs,\" Mr Carney said when he announced the change.\n\n\"By acting now in a graduated fashion, authorities are reducing the likelihood that larger interventions will be needed later.\"\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne told Parliament's Treasury Committee on Dec 12 that the housing market is not in a bubble.\n\nMr Osborne has asked BOE's Financial Policy Committee to carry out an annual review of Help to Buy.\n\nAbout two-thirds of 27 economists in a Bloomberg News survey last week said property in the UK is at risk of overheating.\n\nMost mortgages in the UK have variable rates, meaning that property owners benefit when interest rates are low and pay more when they rise.\n\nThe improving economy is helping to push unemployment closer to 7 per cent, the level at which Mr Carney says officials will review their policy stance.\n\nHe has said he won't raise the benchmark interest rate at least until then.\n\nAbout a third of 29 economists in the Bloomberg News survey see the threshold being reached by the end of next year, while two-thirds expect it to happen by the second quarter of 2015.\n\nThe jobless rate is currently 7.6 per cent.\n\nRates banks charge each other to borrow are forecast to rise to 3 per cent at the end of 2017, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor.\n\nThat would mean a buyer with a 20 per cent down payment and a variable-rate mortgage would see monthly interest payments double in four years, Green Street Advisors analysts including Hemant Kotak said in an Oct 23 report.\n\n\"There are many young people who can afford a mortgage but are struggling to save for the deposit because there aren't 95 per cent mortgages available,\" Mr Cameron said in a Nov 13 speech. \"We're not encouraging people to buy homes they can't afford or have mortgages they can't afford; we're helping them get mortgages they can afford.\"\n\nHomebuilding has increased, partly thanks to the government's FirstBuy lending programme.\n\nUK residential construction expanded at the fastest pace in a decade in November, rising 60 per cent from a year earlier, according to a survey by Markit published on Dec 3.\n\nThe current level of price increases shouldn't be cause for concern, Pete Redfern, chief executive officer of High Wycombe-based homebuilder Taylor Wimpey Plc, said by phone.\n\n\"We've had four or five years of totally stagnant house prices, which means real prices have been going backwards,\" he said. \"With that backdrop, 2 or 3 per cent inflation isn't the kind of environment that should worry anybody.\"\n\nEven after the increase in construction, demand is outstripping the supply of homes.\n\nDemand for housing rose by 3 per cent in November, while the supply of homes for sale declined by 3.5 per cent, Hometrack said.\n\nThe greatest imbalance is in London and the South-east, where prices have grown 4.8 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively, during the six months through November.\n\nPrices in Witney, which is about 108 km north-west of central London, rose 1.2 per cent in the last three months, according to property website Zoopla Ltd.\n\nThat's more than twice the average UK home's gain in the three months through October, according to data compiled by the Land Registry.\n\nMartyn Brittain, a branch manager of local broker Connells Ltd, said that home buying has \"shot up\" in Witney during the past six months.\n\nConnells is advising buyers to use Help to Buy to obtain the biggest home they can get, so they can avoid moving again if their personal circumstances change, he said.\n\n\"I'm hoping that the government is going to take more care so that the crash doesn't happen again,\" Mr Brittain said in an interview. \"They seem to be a lot more wary than last time, but you never know until it happens.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special

This may extend to the financial services sector, which has been relatively quiet this year, said Moray Armstrong, executive director (office services) at CBRE.\n\n\"There is a very tangible uptick in CBD leasing activity as we close 2013, and we expect this momentum will continue into next year. While US and European banks' office requirements may take longer to return, we are seeing strengthening interest from Asia-Pacific financial institutions and, in particular, the Japanese banks,\" he added.\n\nAgreeing, DTZ's regional head, occupier services, SE Asia, Angela Tan, said: \"Some major Japanese banks such as Mizuho, Norinchukin and SMBC are expanding in Singapore. We're also seeing enquiries from our Japan offices about other Japanese banks wanting to enter the Singapore market.\"\n\nMs Tan also expects further activity from the insurance sector, which along with sustained demand from professional services, technology and social media sectors, should lend support to the office market.\n\nAccording to CBRE data, 2013 is likely to end with a 2 per cent rent rise in the average monthly rental value for Grade A (CBD Core) office space to $9.75 psf, following stagnation in the first three quarters at $9.55 psf. CBRE's Grade A (CBD Core) basket covers the best-quality office buildings in Raffles Place, Marina Bay and Marina Centre.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle too noted that Grade A rents in the CBD have stabilised and started to grow over the past year, as vacancy levels have slowly reduced. Many well-located, existing Grade A buildings are now fully let or over 95 per cent occupied. A majority of new lettings have been from occupiers of less than 30,000 sq ft.\n\n\"As landlords have stabilised their occupancies, they are now looking to grow rents on a case-by-case basis,\" JLL said.\n\n\"Given the current economic uncertainty, there will be some headwinds. However, the current low islandwide office vacancy rate of 3.9 per cent, notable lack of new CBD office completion in 2015, along with Singapore's successful positioning as a business hub in Asean all point to positive take-up and an upward shift in rental,\" said Chris Archibold, head of markets at JLL.\n\n\"The key question is whether demand sustains at current levels or better.\"\n\nBased on JLL's numbers, 2013 is likely to end with about 1-1.1 million sq ft net increase in islandwide office demand - about half the nearly two million sq ft last year and at least 30 per cent shy of the 20-year average annual take-up of 1.6 million sq ft.\n\n\"(Since 2011), the key piece that has been missing from the market and therefore reducing overall demand has been front-office activity from the major financial institutions. Most of the large international banking & finance occupiers, which are typically responsible for the majority of CBD demand, are fairly static and focused on cost saving at present,\" said Mr Archibold.\n\nThe current situation is in contrast to the seven-year period between 2006 and 2012, when FIs accounted for 45 per cent of space leased in major new office developments islandwide.\n\nWeak demand from FIs' front-end operations is also behind a contraction in the average office lease-size in major new projects from 57,000 sq ft in 2010 to 18,700 sq ft in 2011 and 23,800 sq ft in 2012. Mr Archibold reckons the figure for 2013 will be similar to last year, but predicts it will again start to increase next year, when he expects the islandwide net increase in office demand to pick up to around 1.4-1.6 million sq ft. He cites Asean's economic growth and Singapore's positioning as a hub for various industries.\n\nAnother positive for the office market is that despite a relatively strong pipeline of new completions scheduled from now to 2017, there is a notable lack of completions in 2015.\n\nMr Archibold reckons that CBD office rents, which will end this year about 5 per cent higher, could climb a further 8-10 per cent in 2014. \"Singapore and Asean look well placed to take advantage of any upside in economic cycles, but there are still mixed messages in the office market.\"\n\nA number of FIs are looking to give up potentially up to 500,000 sq ft of space, he added. \"If this materialises, it may not move the needle compared with the 63.6 million sq ft of (leasable) islandwide office stock, but it could be a dampener on sentiment,\" Mr Archibold said.\n\nHe declined to say which banks were planning to release excess space. However, word in the market is that these include Credit Suisse, which is widely expected to begin its phased exit from One Raffles Quay from next year. It is also said to be seeking replacement tenants for some of the space it has leased at One@Changi City.\n\nAt Six Battery Road, about 55,000 sq ft leased to Standard Chartered Bank will be available next year. Barclays has about 50,000 sq ft of excess space in Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 2 already on the market, plus around 29,000 sq ft at Eightrium@Changi Business Park that could be available in March.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is the lowest half-yearly land quantum for the confirmed list in the past two years. In the current H2 2013 slate, the government is releasing 14.52 ha on the confirmed list, and in H1 this year, the figure was 15.27 ha.\n\nIn H2 and H1 2012, the figures were 17.35 ha and 15.91 ha respectively.\n\nLooking at the figures on a yearly basis, MTI released 33 ha in 2012 and 30 ha this year on the confirmed list - in the face of a substantial increase in industrial property prices.\n\nHowever, with this market segment starting to stabilise - following the introduction in January this year of a seller's stamp duty to discourage short-term speculative trading of industrial properties as well as the rollout of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework in late-June, it makes sense for MTI to start tapering supply on the Industrial GLS Programme, say market watchers.\n\nThis is especially noteworthy given the substantial pipeline of industrial space. Some 47.6 million square foot gross floor area (GFA) of factory space is slated for completion by end-2016, based on Urban Redevelopment Authority's data as at end-Q3.\n\nAccording to SLP International executive director Nicholas Mak, the potential GFA that can be developed from the confirmed list for H1 2014 will be 234,000 square metres (2.5 million sq ft) - 10.7 per cent lower than the current half year.\n\nHowever, while MTI seems to be clipping industrial land supply on the confirmed list - where sites are launched according to a pre-stated schedule - it is holding supply steady on the reserve list. The government launches reserve-list sites only upon successful application by bidders.\n\nThe five reserve-list sites for H1 2014 add up to 8.35 ha, which is similar to the 8.32 ha for the current half year.\n\nHalf of the eight confirmed list sites in MTI's latest slate comprise relatively small plots (under one hectare each) on short tenure (21 years) in Tuas South, typically targeted at end-user industrialists keen on building their own customised facilities. The other four have 30-year leases and comprise a 0.9-ha site in Tuas Avenue 11, a 2.57-ha site in Tuas South and two plots in Woodlands Avenue 12 and Gambas Crescent. The last two will be transferred from the current H2 2013 reserve list.\n\nKnight Frank executive director (industrial) Lim Kien Kim noted that while the total hectarage of confirmed list sites for H1 2014 will be lower, the average land size of the Tuas South plots targeted at end-users has been increasing in response to market demand. \"A lot of the demand for smaller plots in the area appears to have been satisfied but users seeking bigger plots in the past needed to bid for two adjoining sites which may be hard to come by.\"\n\nMr Lim added that he was surprised that MTI had included in the confirmed list the Woodlands and Gambas Crescent sites, both zoned for Business 1 use and targeted at developers, given the weak demand for strata industrial properties post TDSR.\n\n\"Currently, in the vicinity of these two sites, there are projects with unsold units. Further supply of strata units can be expected in Gambas Crescent from the three sites sold this year to Far East Organization,\" he said.\n\n\"Perhaps the authorities moved the two sites to the confirmed list to supplement industrial activity for the proposed North Coast Innovation Corridor.\"\n\nThe H1 2014 reserve list will include a 2.72-ha site in Tuas Bay Close that will be rolled over from the current reserve slate, and four new sites in Tuas South. Three are 21-year plots with land areas of 0.5, 0.8 and one ha, while the fourth is a bigger plot of 3.33 ha and with 30-year leasehold tenure.\n\nMr Lim said the Tuas Bay Close site will be \"an interesting one to watch as it will appeal not only to developers but also end-user industrialists in the oil and gas, marine and logistics sectors\".\n\nIn its announcement yesterday, MTI also said that JTC Corporation, as the main government agency overseeing the industrial property market, will take over the land sales agent role from URA for all new sites under the Industrial GLS Programme from H1 2014. However, URA will remain land sales agent for the Woodlands and Gambas Crescent sites that are being moved to the confirmed list.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was as if stock traders awoke to find everything they ever dreamed of beneath the Christmas tree, then slunk off in the corner crying because they feared the central bank would come and take them all away. Stocks sold off not because retail sales and industrial data were bad but because they were too good.\n\n\"The retail sales number was fantastic,\" said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TDAmeritrade. Sales of heavy items such as cars, were particularly good, said Mr Kinahan.\n\nLast week, Ford Motor said it would hire 4,000 more workers, mostly in the US as it prepares to launch more models. Similarly, export data from China indicated that global demand for manufactured goods is picking up.\n\nStrategists are talking about a Goldilocks economy again, a balance between growth and inflation that means the economy is neither \"too hot nor too cold\".\n\n\"There's good corporate earnings growth, an improving economic environment, (and) signs . . . investors are willing to pay up for all this,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\nIn the last two weeks, the risks to the stock market rally have been checked off almost systematically. November jobs alleviated worries about a stagnant jobs market; retail sales data addressed fears about weak Black Friday sales; most significantly, the compromise between Republican Congressman Paul Ryan and Democratic Senator Patty Murray proved that Congress could actually cut spending and pass a budget, even if it wasn't going to solve long-term deficits overnight.\n\nBut even the end to three years of damaging 'sequester', 'debt ceiling' and 'government shutdown' brinksmanship was deemed to be negative in a Fed-focused stock market. The boost to consumer and business confidence would motivate the Fed to start its tapering at next week's meeting, according to this interpretation.\n\nIn another example of this inverted logic, stocks bounced back, briefly, on Thursday after a reported spike in weekly unemployment claims. The only disappointment there seemed to be the Labor Department's warning that seasonal retail hiring often causes volatility in weekly data at this time of year.\n\nMr Kinahan, of TD Ameritrade, said the recent data and political developments were not radical enough to change the Fed's outlook.\n\nOverall, he said the economy is in the midst of a \"fragile\" recovery, just as it was when Mr Bernanke first floated the \"taper\" plan in May.\n\nWhile several Fed officials, including Bank of Dallas Fed president Richard Fisher, say they will push for \"tapering\" at the central bank board meeting tomorrow and on Wednesday, Mr Kinahan and others say they are unlikely to persuade key players such as Mr Bernanke's successor Janet Yellen.\n\nMr Bernanke's Fed, which has been so supportive of the economy, is unlikely to make a drastic move during such a critical time of the year for an economy based on consumer spending. The same Fed officials who are pushing for a withdrawal of stimulus acknowledge that inflation is not yet a major worry.\n\n\"We do not expect the (Fed) to announce any change in its asset purchase programme,\" said economists at brokerage Nomura Securities, in a note to clients. \"However, it is possible that the (Fed) will begin tapering at its December meeting, given that the pace of hiring has picked up since the end of summer, and the unemployment rate continues to decline.\"\n\nEven if the Fed did start tapering early, strategists say the medium-term outlook for the stock market is bright.\n\n\"Monetary policy is going to remain supportive,\" said Mr Pursche of Gary Goldberg. \"Investors are going to start recognising that (interest rates) are still very low.\"\n\nSome sceptics are invoking the \"Ghost of Bubble Past\", saying stock market gains this year are unsustainable.\n\nTrue, the broad Standard & Poor's 500 has almost tripled in price since its 2008 low. By the standards of recent bubbles - oil's ascent from roughly US$10 a barrel in the late 1990s to more than US$140 in 2008, gold's move from less than US$275 an ounce to more than US$1,800 in the same decade - this means the stock bubble, if there is one, is only just getting started, however.\n\nRight now, based on options prices and other measures of market sentiment, the only sector that registers as \"overbought\" is the tech sector, said Mr Kinahan.\n\n\"And so people who are calling for a bubble - it's hard to justify that terminology,\" Mr Kinahan said.\n\nThis week's Fed meeting will be the last led by Mr Bernanke. After five years as the bearded Santa Claus, bearing gifts of monetary stimulus, will he exit as Scrooge?\n\nThe answer to that question will determine whether the stock market finishes 2013 at its peak.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/gold-funds-see-unprecedented-31-slump", "site_title": "Gold funds see unprecedented 31% slump", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGold funds see unprecedented 31% slump\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Dec 16, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Investors are dumping gold-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs) at the fastest pace since the securities were created a decade ago, mirroring the steepest price drop in 32 years.\n\nHoldings in the 14 biggest ETPs plunged 31 per cent to 1,813.7 metric tonnes since the start of January, the first annual decrease since the funds started trading in 2003.\n\nThe removals erased US$69.5 billion in the value of the assets as prices fell by the most since 1981. A further 311 tonnes will be withdrawn next year, according to the median of 11 analyst estimates.\n\nETP investments reached a record US$148 billion last year, helping sustain the bull market that drove a more than sixfold increase in prices since 2001 by offering a way to own bullion without needing to store it. The slump shows some investors losing faith in gold as a preserver of wealth after inflation failed to accelerate and the Federal Reserve signalled it may curb stimulus. John Paulson, the biggest investor in the largest ETP, said last month he doesn't plan to buy more.\n\n\"All the bullish factors we had pushing gold higher in the last 12 years are now going into reverse,\" said Robin Bhar, a London-based analyst at Societe Generale SA who's ranked by Bloomberg as the most-accurate precious-metals forecaster over the past eight quarters. \"There will be more ETF selling in 2014 as the price goes lower.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc called bullion a \"slam-dunk\" sell in October and said it was among the bank's most bearish commodity forecasts for next year. Bullion may average US$1,216 in 2014, the least since 2009, according to the median of 14 analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. Hedge funds and other large speculators were the least-bullish since June 2007 in the week to Dec 3, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show.\n\nETP sales of more than 800 tonnes since the start of January, including by billionaire George Soros, exceeded total purchases in the previous three years. Paulson & Co cut its holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest ETP, by half in the second quarter, while Mr Soros and Third Point LLC's Daniel Loeb sold their entire stakes.\n\nInvestors see less need for \"disaster insurance\", Fed chairman Ben Bernanke told US lawmakers on July 18. Traditionally, investors turn to gold in times of turmoil as an alternative store of wealth to equities and the dollar and as an inflation hedge. Until 2003, most held gold bars, coins or jewellery in vaults or bought futures and options.\n\nThe introduction of gold-backed ETPs, which trade like equities, gave access to the metal without the need for arranging storage or dealing in derivatives. One futures contract traded on the Comex bourse in New York, equal to 100 ounces, costs US$123,460 while a share in the SPDR Gold Trust, representing 0.1 ounce, is valued at US$119.38.\n\nETPs backed by gold were created by Graham Tuckwell, a Canberra, Australia-born entrepreneur who persuaded the producer-funded World Gold Council to back the proposal after the Australian Gold Council rejected his plan in 2002. The products are cheaper and more transparent than mutual funds, Mr Tuckwell told Bloomberg News last year.\n\nMr Tuckwell's ETF Securities Ltd oversees the second-largest gold-backed ETP, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zuercher Kantonalbank, Switzerland's biggest state-owned regional bank, and BlackRock Inc, the world's leading money manager, are the next-largest operators.\n\n\"Gold ETPs are preferred by a lot of people because at the end of the day it's easier to trade and easier to manage your portfolio,\" said Francisco Blanch, the head of commodities research at Bank of America Corp in New York.\n\nIn Asia, where many buy jewellery as a form of investment, the cost to consumers is higher. At a store of SK Jewellery Ltd in central Singapore, a gram of 99.9 per cent purity cost S$62.50 on Dec 11. That's equivalent to about US$1,555 an ounce, 24 per cent more than the London spot price that day.\n\nA one-ounce coin at United Overseas Bank Ltd, Southeast Asia's third-largest lender, was on sale for S$1,640 an ounce the same day, according to its website.\n\nSome of the economic conditions that prompted investors to buy gold over the past few years no longer exist. The US unemployment rate that touched a 26-year high of 10 per cent in October 2009 after a recession in the world's largest economy dropped last month to a five-year low of 7 per cent, the government reported on Dec 6. The US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.6 per cent in the third quarter, the strongest in 18 months. Inflation in the US is running at a one per cent annual rate, half the pace of the past decade.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 25 per cent this year, heading for the biggest annual gain since 2003. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is now valued at US$164.5 billion, compared with US$33 billion for the SPDR Gold Trust.\n\n\"Equities continue to be the only game in town,\" said Jeff Sica, who helps oversee more than US$1 billion of assets as president of Sica Wealth Management in Morristown, New Jersey. \"Why would you want to hold gold and see the value depreciate when you can buy equities and see your money grow?\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

In other countries, this figure hovers at the 1.8 per cent mark, on average. \"Singapore is small, and doesn't have huge manual industries like sprawling factories taking up power needs, so that number is higher here,\" she said.\n\nThe other factor pushing up power needs in Singapore is that almost a decade ago when some of the older data centres were built here, power efficiency wasn't the focus, she added. \"It's expensive to be eco-friendly, but that's a clearer priority with newer equipment.\"\n\nSingapore is a popular choice for many vendors because of its political stability and it generally being safe from natural disasters. Its location is crucial too, being central to the Asean region, and close to Hong Kong, a neighbouring hub for MNCs. As data centre distance affects speed and performance, companies try to locate their data centres as close to customers as possible.\n\nUpon launching Singapore's data centre and another in Taiwan last week, Google's vice-president of data centres, Joe Kava, said in a statement that the focus on setting up more data centres in the region is due to the massive growth in Asia's Internet population.\n\n\"The number of Internet users in India doubled, from 100 million to 200 million (in two years). It took six years to achieve that milestone in the US,\" he said.\n\nAnd according to Analysys Mason figures, mobile data traffic in emerging markets in the region are on track to rise 68 per cent in 2014, ahead of the global growth rate of 48 per cent, making this region the fastest-growing worldwide.\n\nMs Hayes said that Singapore is one of the more mature data centre markets in the region, having received investment early and on par with Western markets, as MNCs set up shop here.\n\nStill, it continues to grow in usable data centre space, termed \"white space\", at 2 per cent per annum.\n\nElsewhere in the region, DCD Intelligence found that China now accounts for a whopping 30 per cent of data centre white space in the Asia-Pacific region, excluding Japan. The country's white space growth is also at the highest in the region, at 24 per cent per year.\n\nChina also accounts for 28 per cent of all data centre power in the region.\n\nAll this data centre growth is being prompted by cloud computing's popularity, said Ms Hayes. She noted that cloud-computing use will continue to grow as the delivery mechanism improves and users get drawn to the cost savings associated with tapping into a third-party cloud, without having to invest and build their own data centres.\n\nShe said that more companies want to outsource their data centre requirements because of the need to chase the equipment refresh cycle constantly. \"You can't really incrementally upgrade with every piece, so there is rip-and-replacing required for some upgrades. If you already have capex sunk in, this is not an easy decision,\" she said.\n\n\"A lot of the data centre money here is going into refitting, not going into finding new white space. Singapore has a lot of legacy equipment, she said.\n\nShe pointed to Facebook, saying that the company refreshes its kit every 18 months, way ahead of the typical five-year refresh cycle for most companies.\n\nThe aggressive refreshing is done to keep its data centre tip-top, but also more energy efficient, as new technology comes out.\n\n\"It's cheaper to get rid of your gear and just replace, because tech prices are coming down,\" she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(So) it is bound to take time to change to a new system,\" said Charlotte Winter of law firm Norton Rose Fulbright. \"One of the reasons this is building momentum is you have particular trades that appear to be comfortable with electronic bills and significant parties in the market seem to be promoting their use.\"\n\nIn recent months, a growing number of global companies have started using secure electronic bills of lading on shipments of dry bulk commodities, starting with grains and lately iron ore.\n\nIn late October, miner BHP Billiton , trading house Cargill and other counterparties completed the first trade-financed iron ore shipment using an electronic bill of lading called CargoDocs, which was developed by Malta-headquartered company Electronic Shipping Solutions (ESS).\n\n\"We support electronic bills of lading and have made good progress with all parties involved in the chain to build an infrastructure that supports electronic document execution,\" a BHP spokeswoman said.\n\nThe electronic bill of lading for the iron ore cargo was drafted, approved, signed, issued to the shipper, presented to the confirming bank and passed to the issuing bank and on to the buyer in two days, unlike paper trades, which can take weeks.\n\nWith an array of costs that can include ship hire, on top of insurance, fuel and port fees, companies are keen to make savings by speeding up the logistical and administrative process to streamline invoicing and customs clearance.\n\nWhile change has been slow, officials and companies involved expect volumes to grow.\n\nSwiss trader Trafigura said it welcomes the development. \"At present, this technology is not in widespread use and, along with other companies, we are currently . . . in discussions,\" it said.\n\nAnglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto has also started to use other types of e-bills of lading. A bill of lading specifies the name of the captain of the ship, the port and destination of the ship, the goods, the consignee and freight rate.\n\nEarlier this year, Cargill completed the first grains deal using an electronic document, with the paper transfer from the United States to Mexico taking just 19 minutes.\n\nESS chief executive Alexander Goulandris said his firm is in talks with other trade houses and companies over the use of CargoDocs in grains and iron ore as well as other markets such as coal and coffee. Trade houses Louis Dreyfus and Noble Coffee are poised to use e-documents on coffee trades.\n\nHe said that with the growing complexity of global trade, including new sea routes emerging, there is more interest in using electronic freight. Tighter bank credit lines are also pushing global firms to find new efficiencies. \"Changes in the transport system have also led to a fragmentation of the market. This has led to operational headaches getting larger,\" he said.\n\nCargoDocs was first offered in 2010 to the oil tanker market and is already used by major firms such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips, ESS said, adding that it is was based on a secure Internet-based system.\n\nSmaller traders say it will take time for them to change as some cost-competitive banks offering trade finance still require paper documents. \"It seems a great idea and could probably roll out or be used by the big boys from Australia to China. I very much doubt it will be used on a wide scale in Africa for the next two years or so until major regional banks in the area also sign up,\" an Africa-focused iron ore trader said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The main draw is that the company does everything at source. The seafood comes from fishing vessels that ply the Pacific and Indian Oceans and frozen immediately on board at minus 60 deg C - similar to the method used by Japanese tuna fishermen. Far Ocean even has its own private wharf, so they get the frozen seafood directly from the ships, process and cut them up according to customers' needs. Although it's a Singapore company, most of its seafood is exported around the world but now that it's become an investor/partner with Swiss Butchery, it wants to make its products accessible to Singapore foodies.\n\nAll the fish is wild-caught except for the Norwegian salmon which is farmed, says Mr Quek. And the fact that the fish are bled and frozen on the ship means they can be fresher than those caught and brought to shore. But more important for the food shopper, it means a whole lot of variety at your fingertips without having to poke around in the wet market or take a risk with the stocks at upscale gourmet fish markets. While not pretty in their pre-cut, frozen, rock-solid vacuum-packed portions, you're at least assured that issues such as how the fish was transported, or how long they've been sitting unattended before being packed in ice, are irrelevant here. The only problem is deciding what to choose - the familiar tuna, scallops or Alaskan crab, or the intriguingly named oilfish - which you're not supposed to eat more than a portion of because of its high oil content - wahoo, Chilean seabass, escolar, blue shark and even local favourites such as garoupa and pomfret.\n\nIf you can't decide, then check out Swiss Butchery's tasting event today at its Tanglin Post Office location where it's offering free-flow sashimi and meats so that you can try before you buy.\n\nBy Jaime Ee\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nPat Chun\n\n17-19 South Bridge Road\n\nTel 6438 0480\n\nE-mail:\n\nsingapore@patchun.com\n\nwww.patchun.com\n\nIF you've heard of the brand Pat Chun, you've probably also filled your suitcase with its famed sauces and vinegars from its Hong Kong shops every chance you get.\n\nThere's no need to hoard the stuff now because, as of early November, almost everything from its fermented bean pastes to its sweetened and spiced vinegars have been available at its new store in South Bridge Road - its first store outside of Hong Kong.\n\nThe family-owned sauce maker, which uses traditional recipes handed down through its founding family for over 80 years, also owns the Singapore outlet. They chose Singapore as their first overseas venture because of family connections here, says manager Aileen Kwok.\n\nAccording to her, almost everything that can be found in the Hong Kong store can also be found here, from their range of vinegars, to their different grades of soy sauce, as well as a wide variety of instant sauces such as imperial stir-fry sauce, lemon sauce, and bean sauce.\n\nOne of Pat Chun's signature products is the sweetened vinegar sauce, which is available in bottles either with or without ginger.\n\n\"The vinegar is what made them famous in the first place,\" says Ms Kwok, who manages the store on top of running her own furniture store in Liang Court. \"The Cantonese use it to cook pork knuckle - which new mothers have during confinement. It's a very traditional Cantonese dish.\"\n\nShe adds that the prices of the items here compared to those in Hong Kong are more or less of a similar range.\n\nThe smallest bottle of 600ml sweetened vinegar sauce without ginger costs $5.90 while the largest bottle with 4.8 litres costs $43. At their online store, the 600ml bottle is priced at HK$35 (about S$5.60) and the 4.8 litre bottle at HK$256 (about S$41).\n\nThe Singapore store is likely to be their only outlet. \"Rental is too high here. We will try to distribute our products to supermarkets and restaurants. Maybe we will also bring in dumplings and mooncakes for festive seasons as we do with our Hong Kong stores. For now we are mainly establishing the brand,\" she explains.\n\nBy Rachel Loi\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nSpringbok Bazaar\n\n1 Jalan Anak Bukit\n\n#02-42 Bukit Timah Plaza\n\nTel 64633641\n\nwww.springbokbazaar.com\n\nSOUTH Africa may be continents away from Singapore, but you'll find a piece of it in Springbok Bazaar, a tiny grocer tucked away in the unlikely location of Bukit Timah Plaza.\n\nThe modest 1000 sq ft space is a goldmine of South African produce - with everything from cereals, snacks and cooking sauces to wines, beer, barbecue equipment and even safari outfits and stationery.\n\nTheir origin may sound exotic, but the products are more familiar than you think. Chicken restaurant chain, Nando's, originated from South Africa, for instance, and an extensive range of its peri peri and other ready-made sauces can be found at Springbok. Rooibos tea, too, is a South African product and a bestseller among the store's local patrons, along with Simba potato chips and Endearmints candy, says the store's owner, David Fisher.\n\nWines, including the award-winning Pongracz sparkling wine, are priced affordably from $17 to $33, and there's a range of South African brandy labels such as Kipdrift too.\n\nMr Fisher, 59, and his wife, Cheryl, 55, a Zimbabwe-born retiree couple, took over the six-year-old business in June when the store's original founders, South African Paul Smith and his Singaporean wife Janet, had to give up the business for \"personal reasons\", says Mr Fisher, who was by then a regular patron of the store.\n\nThe Fishers, both Singaporean permanent residents who had previously lived in South Africa, hope to further ramp up the store's offerings with less commonly found items, such as chilli-tinged Bovril and a cheesey Marmite spread.\n\nThey've also added a fridge stocked with chilled boerewors, or coiled gourmet sausages custom-made by a local butcher, frozen steak and ribs from Australia, as well as New Zealand-imported biltong, a South African version of meat jerky.\n\nBesides expanding their online store, Mr Fisher hopes to tie up with other partners to eventually run a brick-and-mortar barbecue eatery-cum-retail store. \"South Africans love to barbecue, and it would be the best way to showcase our meats and sauces,\" he explains.\n\nBy Debbie Yong\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The man had done it at least once before, but without incident, the report said. He has been suspended with pay, and SingTel is considering disciplinary action that will be taken.\n\nThe report, released yesterday by an independent committee of inquiry (COI), uncovered \"shortcomings in fire safety practices that require immediate rectification\", its chairman, Bobby Chin, said. \"The technical expert has, however, affirmed that the network has a high degree of resiliency. SingTel should continue to build on this.\"\n\nMr Chin is also a non-executive and independent director of SingTel and chairman of its risk committee. He was assisted on the COI by two other non-executive and independent directors. Telecommunications consultant Bell Labs as well as fire specialists Octis Technology and JT Megan & Partners were among those who provided expertise for the investigation.\n\n\"On the day of the incident, the said worker did not have the SingTel standard-issue blowtorch equipment with him. Instead, he borrowed a non-SingTel blowtorch from a contractor assisting in the cable diversion works,\" the COI report said.\n\nThe unauthorised blowtorch - used on a lead seal on the cable chamber in the exchange - heated up to 800 degrees Celsius, almost twice as hot as the company-issued one, which ran up to 450 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe fire came from a concatenation of events - the employee had disabled the fire detection system in order to use the blowtorch, but forgot to turn it back on after. He then left for lunch and the lead seal smouldered unnoticed, becoming a \"slow-burning fire\". The cable chamber also had no automatic fire suppression system.\n\nWhen the fire was finally discovered, thick smoke prevented the various employees linked to the exchange from entering the chamber. The Singapore Civil Defence Force had to be called in. In the end, 139 fibre optic cables were burnt, disrupting services for homes and businesses, as well as StarHub's and M1's customers, as two-thirds of those cables belonged to OpenNet.\n\nThe report recommends that SingTel stop using \"hot works\" in cable chambers, install automatic fire suppression systems in cable chambers and switch all lead-based sealants to ones that do not require heating, which are called Multi Cable Transit (MCT) systems.\n\nSingTel began introducing MCT systems more than 20 years ago, but of its 22 exchanges, only eight use solely MCT systems. The Bukit Panjang exchange had a mixture of both MCT and the older lead seals. The fire has brought forward the telco's timeline for upgrading all the lead-based seals to MCT-type ones from an undisclosed date to end-2014.\n\n\"The process of conversion takes time to effect. It's not just a matter of conversion. It doesn't mean that just because it's lead- based, it will catch fire. (It's the) first time. It should be a combination of fire prevention (and) fire detection,\" said Mr Chin.\n\nIn the interim, SingTel has also switched to an alternative heating method - a hot air blower without open flame, and put a longer fire watch in place.\n\nSingTel's board has accepted the COI's findings. Its management will implement the recommendations and update the board within three months.\n\nWhile SingTel did not disclose how much it would all cost, group CEO Chua Sock Koong said: \"We have an idea of the cost, but . . . the cost is not the consideration here. We will do what it takes for us to prevent a recurrence of this incident.\"\n\nIn the fire's aftermath, SingTel had a good level of collaboration with OpenNet, the report found, but \"there appeared to be low levels of collaboration among operators during the fire when compared to US operators\".\n\nThe report recommended that SingTel lead industry collaboration so that there could be a \"coordinated response\" during a major network incident. The telco had several saving graces, with the experts observing \"significant strengths in SingTel's people, processes and network infrastructure\". It deemed the core network \"world-class\" and noted that the robustness of its network had kept the fire's impact geographically localised. The report also lauded SingTel's recovery activities, during which the telco repaired 28,000 fibres in two days.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Financial institutions must consider all outstanding debt obligations - such as property loans, car payments and credit card loans - in computing the TDSR, which also fixes interest rates at the higher of either the prevailing market interest rate or a specified medium term rate.\n\n\"The restrictions on prospective homebuyers to secure more loans have greatly affected the buying momentum of residential properties,\" said Alice Tan, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore.\n\nIn July, just over a month after the TDSR was introduced, private home sales took a drubbing. Excluding executive condominiums (ECs), developers moved 481 private homes in July, less than a third of the 1,806 units in June. The number of homes launched also fell to 557, from 1,768 units in June.\n\nMarket watchers said part of the reason for July's abysmal numbers must also be attributed to the cumulative effects from the seventh round of cooling measures since 2009 put in place in January.\n\nThen, the government rolled out a slew of measures such as steeper additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) rates, lower loan-to-value limits and a tighter mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) in its bid to cool the buoyant market.\n\nBut what was different about TDSR was that sales and prices have remained subdued, unlike the recovery that came after the initial shock of previous cooling measures wore off.\n\nSaid Elaine Chow, head of research at Chesterton Singapore: \"Compared with the series of cooling measures imposed previously, the TDSR single-handedly chilled the private residential market.\"\n\nThe take up rate for new private home sales (including ECs) in the third quarter was 80 per cent, down from 125 per cent last year, Ms Chow said.\n\n\"On a month-to-month basis, the take up rate fell from 106 per cent in July to 81 per cent in August and dipped further to 72 per cent in September 2013.\"\n\nAnalysts expect sales volume to come off significantly from the record of about 22,000 last year, to a more sustainable range of 15,500 to 18,500 units.\n\nFor the entire year of 2013, prices could dip up to 3 per cent, going by their predictions, in part as developers cut prices to attract prospective buyers.\n\nChristine Li, head of research at OrangeTee, noted that it was only after TDSR was implemented that developers started to reduce their selling prices.\n\nEven as many consultants expect prices to moderate in 2014, they see severe price corrections as unlikely barring economic shocks.\n\nRecent launches such as the Duo Residences in Bugis, The Inflora in Upper Changi and the Sky Vue in Bishan drew keen interest from buyers.\n\nLee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ, said owners and developers still have holding power and there is unlikely to be widespread distress sales \"although price resistance has set in and certain areas could see prices weakening\".\n\nSupply will also continue to exert pressure on prices. Ms Chow from Chesterton estimates some 77,000 private non-landed homes and ECs will be completed in the next three years.\n\nMs Li from OrangeTee noted that the long-term average from 2003 to 2012 is about 9,396 units a year.\n\nWhile demand over the next two years is likely to be able to meet supply, some analysts have cautioned about 2016.\n\n\"Should our population growth and labour workforce not keep pace with the influx of completed supply, vacancy rates could rise further and add pressure to rentals and prices in the long run,\" said Knight Frank's Ms Tan.\n\nBut projects of perceived value - such as those in good locations, are in an area of limited supply or are offered at lower prices than earlier projects in the vicinity - should continue to shore up demand.\n\nOrangeTee's Ms Li said that as prices fall, \"buyers looking out for good deals may still come back to the market\", and prices could be supported by attractive projects expected to launch in the first half of 2014, such as for the site at Kim Tian Road.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, said much will depend on whether developers continue to offer discounts to meet buyers reduced financial power post-TDSR.\n\n\"For those unwilling to cut prices, and even if their project designs are exceptional, buyers can't afford it due to their TDSR limits . . . then these projects will see slower sales.\"\n\nWith the bulk of completions coming from the mass market, or Outside Central Region (OCR), analysts see prices falling by anywhere from 3 to 10 per cent.\n\nIn the Core Central Region (CCR), prices could ease further as the ABSD and TDSR continue to bite.\n\nThe bright spot may come from city-fringe, or Rest of Central Region (RCR) homes, which benefit from their location close to the city and lower prices than CCR offerings.\n\nSales volume in 2014 could come in anywhere from 12,000 to 18,000 units, according to estimates.\n\nConsultants noted also that more Singaporean investors are heading overseas amid high prices and stringent property measures. They advised that while investment quantums are lower in general and that there are opportunities, investors should be aware of potential pitfalls and do their due diligence before committing.\n\n\"A cheap deal is not always a good deal,\" said Ms Li from OrangeTee.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/ageing-and-heart", "site_title": "Ageing and the heart", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAgeing and the heart\n\nHeart disease afflicts a majority of the elderly and the key to keeping one's heart 'strong' is understanding the risk factors and how to manage them\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 13, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBASED on American Heart Association data published in the Circulation journal in 2002, studies from autopsies indicate that in those aged 70 years or more, blockage of heart arteries was present in about 50 per cent of women and 80 per cent of men. This elderly group accounts for up to 40 per cent of all heart attacks and 60 per cent of all deaths related to heart attack. Hence, heart disease will afflict a large majority of people as they grow older and its impact is larger in the older group. Understanding heart disease will help us to keep our heart \"strong\" as we grow older.\n\nRecognising symptoms of heart disease\n\nWhile most people dread the diagnosis of cancer more than the diagnosis of heart disease, it may be sobering to know that following the first heart attack, those in their middle age are likely to have a median survival of about 17 years in men and 13.3 years in women and this decreases significantly to 3.2 years in both sexes in those 75 years and above.\n\nThe presence of chest tightness or pain on exertion is typical of the presence of significant blockage of the heart arteries. However, even in those below the age of 65 who present to a hospital with a heart attack, only about three quarters have chest pain and this decreases to 40 per cent in those 85 years and above. Less recognised heart attack symptoms, which include shortness of breath, sweating, nausea and fainting, often result in heart attacks being unrecognised. Heart attacks can also be silent without any symptoms, the incidence increasing from one quarter in the young to two thirds in the elderly.\n\nOver a five-year period, up to 10 per cent of these heart attack patients will develop a stroke, mostly due to blockage of the brain arteries. Blockage of the arteries in the legs is also correlated with the presence of heart disease. Up to 50 per cent of these patients have no symptoms and about one-fifth may have pain in the calves on walking. In a study published by Ness in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society in 1999, close to 80 per cent with narrowing of the leg arteries had heart disease and previous stroke. Hence, pain in the calves while walking should alert one to look for presence of heart disease and stroke risk.\n\nManaging risk factors\n\nHigh blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus and smoking are known risk factors for heart artery disease. Managing these risk factors are important for the prevention of adverse outcomes in those with heart disease. Most studies which demonstrate the benefits of treatment of heart disease,whether it be medication or invasive procedures, are in relatively younger patients and the data may not necessarily be extrapolated to the very elderly patients.\n\nAge-related changes resulting in stiffer arteries, less elastic heart muscles, gradual reduction in kidney function, muscle mass reduction and changes in brain function present challenges in the management of heart disease in the elderly. Age related bodily changes have implications for treatment. First, in the elderly, more than 90 per cent of those with high blood pressure have elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP or upper value of blood pressure reading) with no elevation of the diastolic blood pressure (DBP or lower blood pressure value). Contrary to popular belief that the increase in SBP in the elderly is a normal part of ageing, the HYVET study published in 2008 in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that treatment of isolated SBP elevation was associated with reduction in stroke, heart failure and death.\n\nStress reduction, weight reduction, salt restriction, alcohol reduction, smoking cessation, increased exercise and low fat diet may help to decrease the blood pressure. In the elderly, blood pressure medication which can cause a sudden drop in pressure from changing from a lying to a standing position (postural hypotension) may increase the risks of falls. Let your doctor know if you feel dizzy on standing up as you may have postural hypotension or there may be excessive lowering of blood pressure.\n\nBeta blockers and certain calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem), which are drugs that lower the blood pressure and can slow the heart rate, are routinely given to heart patients but they can also aggravate age-related abnormalities in the heart electrical conduction system causing dangerously low heart rates and a drop in blood pressure.\n\nSecond, while cholesterol reduction using cholesterol lowering drugs, called statins, have demonstrated significant reduction in heart attack, strokes and deaths, these potential benefits must be balanced against the risk of statin-induced muscle aches and potential memory impairment which can have a significant impact on the mobility and quality of life in the elderly. Careful attention must be paid to those who complain of deteriorating memory after commencement of statins.\n\nThird, although strict diabetic control is the norm for younger patients, for the elderly patients, a higher blood sugar target is acceptable as they are at much higher risk of drug-induced low blood sugar and the resultant coma may bring about permanent brain damage.\n\nFourth, blood-thinning agents such as aspirin or clopidogrel are commonly given to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke but this must be balanced against the increased risk of bleeding from the stomach, intestine and brain. Hence, where possible, only one blood-thinning agent should be given and this should be taken together with medication that reduces stomach acidity.\n\nFifth, vitamin deficiencies are common among the elderly as a result of decreased dietary consumption and decreased ability of the intestines to absorb such vitamins and minerals. Among the vitamins, vitamin D deficiency has been identified as a risk factor for death from heart disease in the elderly. Vitamin D deficiency is common in the elderly because of reduced sun exposure, decreased production in the skin and inadequate intake of the vitamin in foods. While taking Vitamin D appears to be beneficial, recent trials on omega 3 fatty acids and vitamin B intake have shown no significant benefits in preventing heart disease.\n\nSix, personality and psychological factors are also important in the management of heart disease in the older patients. Those with a hostile character, have depression and have high stress are more likely to have adverse outcomes such as precipitating a heart attack or increased risk of death. Treating depression can be beneficial.\n\nTo treat or not to treat\n\nFinally, we often hear the familiar refrain that \"he is too old to be treated\" for those elderly patients with chest pain refractory to medication. For elderly patients with known heart disease, there will always be an option between medication versus invasive procedures such as stenting or open heart bypass surgery.\n\nThe TIME (Trial of Invasive versus Medical therapy in Elderly patients) study published in the Circulation journal in 2004 looked at elderly patients with a mean age of 80 years who had chest pain, and found that those who underwent treatment with stenting or bypass surgery had less adverse outcomes than those who were just on medication alone. Hence, in making a decision, the biological age rather than the physical age of the patient should be the main deciding factor. Even for those in their 80s, it is never too late to treat their heart disease.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

He upgraded estimates for the industry to \"in-line\" from \"cautious\", and said that demand for ships to haul everything from iron ore to grains will benefit most.\n\nThe more positive forecast mirrors wider predictions by shipping analysts that the worst of an industry rout is ending. Rates for 10 out of 11 commodity-carrying ships will advance next year, led by a 53 per cent rally for Panamaxes hauling coal and ore, according to the averages of more than 50 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.\n\n\"We see a 12-to 18-month window to play the cycle,\" Mr Giannakoulis said. The industry's recovery will last two years after which vessel supply will quicken again. The rally favours owners and operators including Diana Shipping Inc, Safe Bulkers Inc, Knightsbridge Tankers Ltd, and Star Bulk Carriers Corp, he said.\n\nWhile China's economic expansion will slow to 7.5 per cent next year, the weakest since 1990, its growth will still be more than three times the global average, according to economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFleet growth will decline to less than 5 per cent next year and lower than 4 per cent in 2015, Mr Giannakoulis wrote.\n\nThat compares with demand expansion of as much as 6.5 per cent in 2014 and 5.5 per cent in 2015, he said.\n\nRates for capesize ships that transport iron ore averaged US$25,970 a day since the start of October, on course for the highest quarterly average since the end of 2011, according to data from the Baltic Exchange, a London-based publisher of freight prices on more than 50 trade routes.\n\nEarnings from the largest crude oil tankers are close to the highest in 3 \u00bd years, the data show.\n\nThe ClarkSea Index, a measure of earnings across the maritime industry, has doubled to US$15,189 since reaching a 2013 low in February, according to Clarkson Plc, the biggest shipbroker. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Now, British hedge fund manager Crispin Odey is making a multimillion-dollar bet that the club's New York-listed shares are destined for a similar slide.\n\nOdey Asset Management, Mr Odey's fund, has taken a US$22 million short position against Manchester United shares. Investors take short positions by borrowing a company's stock and selling it in anticipation of pocketing a profit when they buy the stock back at a lower price. Mr Odey's bet pits him against several investors who remain strong supporters of the team. George Soros has a 5.3 per cent stake, and GLG, a division of the world's biggest hedge fund, Man Group, has a 2.2 per cent stake.\n\nBut Manchester United's journey since its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange in August last year has been a tale of two teams.\n\nOn the field, the 135-year-old club has fallen from the top of the English Premier League standings last season to ninth place this year. The team has endured a series of changes, including the retirement of the club's long-time manager, Alex Ferguson, and its chief executive, David Gill. During Ferguson's 27-year tenure, Manchester United transformed itself from an underdog to a champion, winning 38 trophies along the way. David Moyes, its current manager, is under pressure to push the team back to the top of the league.\n\nIn the stock market, the club has experienced steady growth. After its debut at US$14 a share, the stock closed at US$16.98 on Wednesday. With a strong brand and hundreds of millions of fans around the world, the club reported record revenue this year. In its latest quarterly results, Manchester United said that its sponsorship revenue had risen 63 per cent compared with the period a year earlier.\n\nFive per cent of Manchester United's stock is out on loan, a proxy indicator for how much is being shorted, according to data collected by Markit.\n\nFears that the team's relatively poor performance this year in the Premier League will seep into its balance sheet are not unfounded, according to some analysts. Among the risk factors listed in the team's prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Manchester United said that it was \"highly dependent on members of our management, coaching staff and our players\". The company also has \u00a3389.2 million (S$795.9 million) in debt, and investors have no voting rights.

We are well aware of the pros since banks advertise them all the time, but not so much about the cons. Here are some issues to think about.\n\nPromotions\n\nCredit cards constantly advertise discounts for dining and shopping. I spent a few days trying to compare them and the winner is ... none. Some go for French cuisine while others, like me, prefer McDonalds and Burger King.\n\nBut each card has its own niche. The \"best\" deal depends on your own tastes.\n\nGotta get 'em all?\n\nIf you really have lots of time on your hands, one questionable strategy is to obtain all the credit cards available. It will give you access to many deals and lots of one-for-one meals.\n\nSomeone I know of has as many as 24 cards. He said he uses them mostly for dining deals.\n\nOne drawback is banks could wonder what you are up to and lower your credit rating. See how banks view your credit history from the Singapore Credit Bureau.\n\nYou can access it through any of the 62 SingPost branches or online at\n\nwww.creditbureau.com.sg\n\n. It costs $6.42 (which you can pay by credit card).\n\nDon't pay annual membership fees or late fees\n\nA problem with having many credit cards is you will incur lots of annual fees. Fortunately, there is an easy way out. When your bank statement arrives with your annual card member fee, call the bank and say, \"Sorry but I prefer not to pay.\"\n\nBanks quietly permit this. All you have to do is make the request and if the bank argues, you can add a little pressure by saying: \"We can cancel my credit card or cancel my fee. We would prefer to cancel the fee. Please help.\"\n\nThat seems to work. Banks want to keep your business, which is worth more than the card's annual fee.\n\nSurprisingly, all cards, including American Express, will consider waiving annual membership fees although they don't talk about it much.\n\nLate fees are similar. Banks usually waive it automatically so you don't need to tell them a long story about how you were stuck on top of Mount Everest and couldn't descend in time to pay.\n\nAir miles, VIP lounges and free travel insurance\n\nIf you collect air miles, the choices are American Express, Citibank, DBS, HSBC and UOB. Even more useful may be access to VIP lounges at airports. The top cards for that perk come from Citibank, DBS, HSBC and ANZ.\n\nThese banks also offer free travel insurance, and some toss in \"inconvenience coverage\", which pays in case your flight is delayed or your bags are lost.\n\nDon't roll over\n\n\"Roll over\" means carrying your credit card balance forward rather than paying on time.\n\nThe cost is typically 2 per cent per month, which comes to 26.8 per cent per year with compounding. It is super-expensive and only loan sharks charge more.\n\nMalaysia has a better scheme that our banks might consider some day. Their credit card charges are layered at 15, 17 and 18 per cent depending on whether cardholders have had zero late payments for the past 12, 10 and less than 10 months.\n\nA mystery is why Singapore charges remain so high. The banks claim it is necessary because these loans have high default rates.\n\nNot true. According to a Sept 16, 2013, reply to a parliamentary question on credit card debt, credit card default rates are very low, at only 0.2 per cent.\n\nMy guess is banks charge 26.8 per cent interest because they can and not because they need to.\n\nBalance transfer\n\nNo matter what I recommend, some people will roll over their debt and end up paying 26.8 per cent interest.\n\nWe have five million credit cards and rollover debt is around $4 billion. The good news is it's easy to rollover and still pay zero interest.\n\nHow? Simply borrow for six months at 0 per cent interest plus a yearly administrative charge of 3 per cent.\n\nThis particular deal is offered by Maybank, but other banks offer six to 12 month balance transfer deals that are roughly the same.\n\nAfter the promotion period, the interest rate reverts to 26.8 per cent. Then what? It's time to go look for another good balance transfer deal at another bank!\n\nOn the downside\n\nOne of the basics of business is that companies are tempted to charge more if customers don't realise how much they are paying.\n\nBanks have succumbed to this temptation. An example: For every currency conversion on overseas credit card purchase, banks charge an \"administrative fee\".\n\nEveryone who uses their credit card overseas has to pay this \"currency conversion cost\" but no one knows how much. Rough estimates are possible but even that is difficult.\n\nIt works like this: Your credit card statement arrives in the mail with only (i) the cost of the purchase in foreign currency plus (ii) the cost in Singapore dollars. Hidden in all that is the currency conversion cost.\n\nSuppose you took a holiday to Australia and purchased a boomerang for A$100. The credit card bill shows that charge as well as the charge in Singapore dollars (like $1.14).\n\nYou look for the exchange rate history and find it was $1.107 on the posting date, so it looks correct if the currency conversion cost was around 3 per cent. So far, so good.\n\nOne problem, however, is that's not cheap. It is much higher than the costs to the bank and higher than it needs to be.\n\nA second problem is that most customers don't have the skills to do these calculations, so they can't uncover basic bank charges like the ones in this little example.\n\nThe third problem is even if they have those skills, a part of the cost is hidden, so it's impossible to know total currency conversion costs.\n\nBuried deeper than the Titanic\n\nAnother way to find the cost of using your credit card overseas is to study the small print on the back of your bill (which is filled with legal jargon so why bother?).\n\nWhat it appears to show is that almost all banks charge 1.5 per cent of the foreign currency transacted amount for currency conversion costs.\n\nAfter that are charges imposed not by the bank, but by the credit card companies themselves. They are 0.8 per cent to 1 per cent for MasterCard depending on whether you transact in Singapore or foreign currencies outside of Singapore, and one per cent for Visa, bringing the total cost to the cardholder to about 2.5 per cent. For American Express (Amex), the fee is 2.5 per cent - but this is different with co-branded cards.\n\nA separate problem is you don't know if you will receive the perks that typically come with Amex cards since you don't know if you are really getting an Amex card. Your Amex card could be a co-branded card issued by big banks like DBS, UOB and Citibank. It will carry the Amex name and logo on the card but co-branded cards follow the rules and offers from the banks and not Amex.\n\nTo get Amex deals, you need a \"pure\" Amex card issued by American Express. It's confusing and the only way to know for sure what you are getting is to call the co-branded bank or American Express.\n\nWhat are the charges?\n\nBack to the problem of credit card charges, currency conversion fees might not what they appear to be.\n\nIt is difficult to figure out what exactly you are paying, and what you pay might be more than the stated 2.5 per cent that you find after some digging.\n\nEven so, 2.5 per cent might amount to big numbers. Questions can be asked on whether this charge is fair.\n\nBillions of dollars have been spent by credit card holders for overseas purchases and not one has ever been told about their total cost of currency conversion.\n\nAn amusing part of my investigation is how the banks and card companies blame one another for this non-disclosure.\n\nOn this, I vote with the card companies. They say disclosure is up to the banks since banks mail out the credit card bills. Only banks know how much they have charged their customers for their overseas credit card spending.\n\nVisa and MasterCard have no way of knowing this. It is quite unfair for banks to insist that card companies provide complete currency conversion cost information which they don't have.\n\nThere are no good solutions. The only alternative to paying for an overseas purchase with your credit card is to do it yourself (DIY) and make a cash conversion from Singapore dollars to the foreign currency on your own.\n\nHow do you do that? It's easy. Do it at a bank or a moneychanger. Of course, these have currency conversion charges too, which are nearly as high as the credit cards.\n\nYou roughly pay 2 to 3 per cent to a bank or moneychanger when you convert currencies with them. As a retail customer, you don't have access to low forex rates of 5 to 10 pips (0.05 per cent to 0.1 per cent), while institutions - like banks and credit card companies - have access to those rates.\n\nOf course, you can get these rates if you are a forex trader, but you can only trade at those rates, and not convert and take the foreign currency in cash.\n\nWell, I am supposed to give you tips but in this case, there is no tip.\n\nThe only partial (and unsatisfying) solution is to try not to spend when on an overseas holiday. Wait until you get home and don't need to convert a currency.\n\nBack to the good old USA\n\nPerhaps our role model on this issue can be the US. It has more discussion, transparency and competition on the topic. From time to time, it even shines a spotlight on it.\n\nAs a result, two large credit card issuers, Charles Schwab and Capital One, waive credit card currency conversion fees entirely.\n\nIt's great for customers, although not quite as generous as it seems since foreign exchange costs to all card issuers as well as banks are very cheap, especially for the huge volumes they deal in.\n\nDepending on the currencies traded, the costs rarely exceed 10 pips, which is 0.1 per cent. Compare this to what our banks and card companies charge customers. While not precisely known, I think it could be around 3 per cent (300 pips).\n\nIn a revealing US court case on this subject (Schwartz vs Visa), Judge Ronald Sabraw found that Visa and MasterCard \"merely act as a clearing house, performing arithmetical calculations at insignificant cost\".\n\nWhile cardholders benefit by paying their bills a little later (about 52 days), the convenience comes at a cost.\n\nFor example, a 3 per cent conversion charge would translate to an annual rate of at least 21 per cent. All overseas shoppers pay, but it is unlikely anyone knows how much. That's because banks embed the currency conversion fee in the cost of the overseas purchase.\n\nBig questions that should be asked are - whether banks and card companies should change their ways and disclose their charges immediately, and whether banks should be required to compensate cardholders for decades of non-disclosure.\n\nThe writer is an adjunct faculty member at Singapore Management University and an instructor in the Citi-SMU Financial Literacy Programme for Young Adults.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After he became Singapore's most expensive living artist, he decided to concentrate fully on his other profession: investment-grade watches.\n\nMr Khoo and his friends had made money from a decade of collecting and studying watches before deciding that \"it's about time\" to start The Watch Fund. It is a world-first investment-structure that allows investors to actually wear top-level watches and sell them later for a profit.\n\nAt US$16 million assets under management in six months, The Watch Fund has garnered many supporters. \"It can only exist now with this concept, connections, database and execution,\" says Mr Khoo. The idea of a watch fund is not original - a watch fund was started in Luxembourg a few years ago but in that system investors only held onto a statement of investment and were not allowed to wear the watches. \"We need to have a 'fun' fund,\" says Mr Khoo. \"Money making is not enough, fun must co-exist. If I can't wear what I spent money on, then what's the point? We wanted to create a whole new different kind of investment system.\"\n\nThe Watch Fund partners make money during win-win situations for all involved parties. Stakeholders gain access to extreme limited editions and enjoy unheard-of price advantages. The fund even offers provenance pieces - timepieces that used to be worn by royalty and historical figures, capturing great moments of human history on the wrist.\n\nSo how does The Watch Fund work? The concept can be described with the scenario of a car fund. Let's say that you want to drive and own a super car. You invest US$250,000 in the car fund and they only take a 5 per cent fee, giving you immediately a car to the lines of a Ferrari or a Bentley. You speed the car away. You attend the great events. You put the top down and let the wind through your hair. The person next to you kisses you on the lips. However, one day in the future you get sick of the car. The car fund would buy it back for more than US$275,000. You can choose to take the cash profit or reinvest it to get an even more exclusive car.\n\nOf course, such a car fund does not exist. But the exact same concept works for The Watch Fund - and it works well. Some investors have already experienced a 15 per cent gain in just three months. Investors are told to expect a minimum return of 20 per cent at the end of three years' daily wear - whilst also the possibility of a 400 per cent return in a few years. \"For men that understand watches and finance - this is a no-brainer. Some even say it's too good to be true!\" says Mr Khoo, a certified watch expert.\n\nSince its foundation in February 2013, The Watch Fund has become a serious player in the international investment scene. The hook is simple: Typical millionaires would end up buying 15 to 20 watches in their lifetime whether it is for themselves as individuals, for business associates or for loved ones. Considering that 99.9 per cent of watches bought at retail prices would end up losing the buyer money, why not make a portion of this investment-grade? Particular watches have an annual increment of up to 15 per cent.\n\nMr Khoo and his partners are connected to the highest levels of the industry and use their unparalleled network to gain access to these pieces that sometimes even money cannot buy.\n\nMr Khoo is a veteran in the watch industry, having trained with the world's biggest watch auction house Antiquorum (Geneva, 1974). Subsequently, he worked in brand management for Girard-Perregaux and wrote as a journalist for world-class watch magazines.\n\nMr Khoo recently started up the watch auction arm for Spink (previously owned by Christie's), the world's oldest auction house (London, 1666).\n\nDuring his 14-year experience of watch collecting, Mr Khoo spoke on watches for several companies like The Hour Glass, UBS and Hermes. He was also given a royal warrant for watch- related and photography services by HRH Prince Hakeem Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei Darussalam.\n\n\"One truth I know to exist: Guys have nothing else wearable to buy except for watches. If you know you're going to spend the money sooner or later, you better do it early,\" Mr Khoo says, referring to Warren Buffett's regret that at 11 years old, he had started investing too late. \"With the price of skilled labour only going to go up in the watch industry, top-level watches will always be rarer and more expensive,\" he continues.\n\nContrary to public belief, Mr Khoo was the only South-east Asian watch expert even before he started photography. The passionate watch collector was given a camera on his 28th birthday to take pictures of watches. He continued to take shots of celebrities wearing watches and eventually became a famous celebrity photographer. During his seven years of photography, he has photographed more than 150 international celebrities including actors like Nicolas Cage and Tony Leung, soccer star Zinedine Zidane and the Dalai Lama. Mr Khoo built up his career as a certified watch expert at the same time, but it was more a silent passion contrary to the big spotlights and the red carpets. \"I think it's much easier to believe a 28-year-old is a famous photographer than a trained watch expert,\" he admits, laughing.

There were no breaches of the alcohol ban and no one was caught for drinking alcohol in public.\n\nThe ban on the sale and consumption of alcohol covers 1.1 sq km around the area where the Dec 8 riot took place.\n\nMany restaurants, pubs and convenience outlets saw fewer customers come through their doors during what is normally the busiest part of the week for them. Some establishments even closed for the day yesterday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Tokyo after he ended a regional summit, Mr Lee said that the government had already consulted businesses in Little India on how best to implement a \"reasonable restriction\" on alcohol even before the riot broke out.\n\n\"We have wanted to restrict and manage the sale of alcohol in Little India for some time because we have seen some of the problems which have been arising,\" he noted.\n\nThe riot erupted on a Sunday when many of the foreign workers in the area were enjoying their day off. A total of 33 men have been charged in court so far for their part in the fracas. Mr Lee said that the alcohol ban would allow people to \"calm down, cool down and make sure things are back to normal\".\n\nThere is no decision yet on whether the ban might be extended further. Mr Lee said that the authorities would study the fallout of the ban and then calibrate and establish new rules. He expects some interim rules to be announced sometime this week.\n\nTransport Minister Lui Tuck Yew was quoted in The Straits Times website last night as saying that measures such as the alcohol ban and temporary suspension of private buses need to be evolved \"to a more sustainable state\".\n\nMr Lui, who was visiting Little India with his grassroots leaders, added that a greater police presence, stricter enforcement as well as less alcohol and congestion are some of the measures needed to make the area a better place.\n\nOn its part, the government is putting in measures to improve the welfare of the more than one million foreign workers in Singapore. Mr Lee said that a \"substantial\" number of new dormitories would be built in the next two to three years to give them better living conditions.\n\nAn inter-ministerial committee spearheaded by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam to look at foreign worker issues has been studying how to speed up the construction of more dormitories.\n\n\"(This is) so that the workers who are now housed in either HDB estates or private properties which have been rented out can be put in proper dorms and be better taken care of. Then there can be less impact on the community,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nHe added that even as steps are in place to tighten the foreign worker inflow, the government will manage the population that is already here and see to their housing and transport needs, among other areas.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/another-exciting-year-ahead-bond-markets", "site_title": "Another exciting year ahead for bond markets", "publish_date": null, "content": "Another exciting year ahead for bond markets\n\nDemand remains strong, especially given the smaller number of deals this year\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Dec 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] If you have been following the experts who have been calling an overweight on developed markets, you would conclude that they are right as stock market punters here are licking their wounds. The Straits Times Index is down about 3 per cent from a year ago.\n\nBut bondholders - admittedly a much smaller bunch, including private bank types, and tend to be ignored by pundits - are likely to be swilling their champagne.\n\nThe Markit iBoxx SGD corporates index has been hitting new highs this month, though it eased a bit last Friday. The index is up around 3 per cent from a year earlier at 105.05, fuelled by investors' search for yield amid low interest rates.\n\nEven long-tenured perpetuals such as Genting are off their September lows. Newly issued perpetuals - United Overseas Bank 4.75 per cent and DBS Group Holdings 4.7 per cent - are doing well, with yields falling to 4.47 and 4.48, respectively. When bond prices rise, their yields fall. \"SGD corporate hybrids (perpetuals) have seen good interest in this more stable backdrop and private banks have topped up on solid names that offered attractive returns,\" said Alan Roch, Royal Bank of Scotland's head of bond syndicate, Asia.\n\nSavings interest rates remain at rock bottom. DBS Bank pays 0.1 per cent for amounts above $1 million.\n\nPerformance is expected to carry on next year as demand remains strong, especially given the smaller number of deals this year.\n\n\"Levels of issuance have been lower this year versus 2012 and in our view there is significant pent-up demand that should ensure that deals that do come early next year will be well received,\" said Mr Roch.\n\nThe total value of SGD corporate bonds issued year-to-date is $19.6 billion, down 37 per cent from last year. \"Most bond markets have rallied recently, it's not specific to Singapore,\" noted Marc Van de Walle, Bank of Singapore global head of products.\n\nSingapore bonds are highly correlated to US bonds, and their high-yield category - equivalent to perpetuals - has not done badly either, said Mr Van de Walle. He also noted that data on fund outflows from the region, including Singapore, is on retail equity unit trusts. \"Generally institutional investors buy bonds directly,\" he said.\n\nThe main factor driving bond markets everywhere is that interest rates have steadied after surging earlier in the year. The 10-year US Treasury started the year at around 1.8 per cent and shot up to 2.74 per cent on June 5.\n\nThe fear was that the rate would go through 3 per cent but it has hovered around 2.75-2.8 per cent. \"The reason for the rally is simply because interest-rate volatility has gone down,\" said Mr Van de Walle.\n\nAnother explanation is that while investors think tapering, or the shrinking of easy money stimulus, is going to happen, their fear of its consequences has receded.\n\nPut simply, tapering is not the same as hiking interest rates. Many are convinced that interest rates will remain low following tapering, taking their cues from Janet Yellen, the incoming chairman of the US Federal Reserve.\n\nMs Yellen, who will succeed Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman when his term expires on Jan 31, said that policy was likely to stay loose \"long after\" one of the thresholds has been crossed. \"It is also important to note that the thresholds are not triggers,\" she said last month.\n\nMr Bernanke, too, noted that interest rates could stay at rock bottom \"well after\" the 6.5 per cent unemployment threshold was crossed.\n\n\"The Fed will most likely signal a push back in rate hike expectations by lowering the current unemployment threshold from 6.5 per cent to 6 per cent or even 5.5 per cent,\" said a note from the Bank of Singapore.\n\nThe US unemployment rate fell to a five-year low of 7 per cent last month.\n\nFor the local bond market, strong demand continues to exceed supply and bondbuyers tend to be domestic and long term. \"SGD bonds have performed relatively well, mainly due to strong demand going after a limited supply of issuances,\" said Joyce Tan and Adeline Tan from UOB Asset Management Asia.\n\n\"In the secondary market, bond prices are being supported by asset managers pursuing limited investment-grade bonds as well as private banking clients seeking higher yields in the current low interest rate environment,\" they added.\n\n\"The market is still under-supplied,\" said Clifford Lee, DBS Bank head of fixed income.\n\nAt a recent meeting with investors in London, there was a general complaint that there were not enough bond deals to invest in, according to Mr Lee.\n\nDBS continues to be the market leader of SGD bond deals in 2013, with a 31 per cent share. The bank has also ventured into foreign-currency bond deals, raking in more than $18 billion worth of issues this year. In the US dollar space, DBS handled 24 deals worth US$11.6 billion. Last year, it was 16 deals worth US$8.1 billion. Total value from 22 yuan deals for 2013 is CNH18.1 billion. In 2012, it was six issues worth CNH1.4 billion. CNH refers to offshore renminbi or yuan.\n\nNext year promises a lot of excitement, in particular from Chinese companies which are encouraged to tap the offshore market as China steps up economic reforms.\n\n\"From a global standpoint, the renminbi is the most exciting bond market in Asia,\" said Mr Lee.\n\n\"China will drive the supply. CNH is having the best quarter in a long while, volumes are increasing,\" said RBS's Mr Roch. \"Expect to see more Chinese state-owned enterprises issuance in the USD, including Chinese banks.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/curbing-personal-devices-work", "site_title": "Curbing personal devices at work", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCurbing personal devices at work\n\nBanning not the way, security strategist tells VICTORIA HO\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Dec 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMOST executives don't seek permission for the gadgets or software they use for corporate tasks in their offices, and it's time companies stopped fighting this trend, say industry experts.\n\nBlue Coat's chief security strategist and senior vice-president, Hugh Thompson, told BizIT that the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) trend has so quickly become a mainstream reality that companies now need to figure out ways to manage employees' personal devices, rather than lock them down.\n\nIn the early days of allowing employees to choose or bring their own devices, many firms, especially those in the financial services industry, chose to disable portions of these devices. Some of them only allowed employees to use the devices within the corporate network if they could install blocking apps that would prevent social media apps from being used, or games from being played, for instance.\n\n\"But that's not going to work. People will be resistant to diminishing the capabilities of their devices,\" he said.\n\nMore companies are now moving away from this method and instead choosing a hybrid security method of installing apps that will allow the IT department some measure of control over the devices, or securing what activity can happen within the company's network.\n\n\"But if you fast-forward about five years from now, only the latter method will survive,\" he noted.\n\nQuoting a recent report done together with the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU), Blue Coat found that nearly half of the respondents in a survey said they made technology decisions without consulting IT. These included using non-authorised online storage accounts and office software.\n\nThe survey was conducted on 1,900 executives globally.\n\nMr Thompson said BYOD is happening because the quality of consumer technology is so high now that often these surpass what companies can provide.\n\n\"You could use Dropbox in Tahiti sitting on a beach and be up to speed with everything in the office. I don't recommend that, but the value is very high. The experience is too terrific,\" he said.\n\nDropbox is a cloud-based storage service that syncs file folders between users automatically. Compared with legacy IT infrastructure such as clunky file-sharing, something like Dropbox is a lot more advanced, he pointed out.\n\nCompanies worry about third-party services because this takes data out from a company's four walls to an unauthorised external data centre belonging to the service provider. Consumer e-mail services such as Gmail or Yahoo Mail are common examples of this.\n\nRisky as using unsanctioned services sounds, the EIU report found a clear link between companies that allowed this sort of behaviour and profitability, Mr Thompson said.\n\n\"High-growth companies - those that increased more than 50 per cent in the past three years - saw tremendous value in giving autonomy in tech decisions to workers,\" he said.\n\nFellow security company McAfee too found that risky employee behaviour is rampant in the enterprise. During the weekend, it released a study that found that 80 per cent of employees across the United States, United Kingdom and Australasia use unapproved cloud software at work.\n\nThe top unapproved software was Microsoft Office 365, at 9 per cent of the respondents. Office 365 is the cloud version of Microsoft Office.\n\nThis was followed by Zoho's office productivity software, LinkedIn and Facebook, said McAfee.\n\nPat Calhoun, general manager of network security at McAfee recommended that companies monitor these applications on the network and enforce security policies without restricting employees. Policies should include encryption and data backups to prevent loss of information and malware protection, he said.\n\nGartner Research echoes these finding too. In a recent report, it said more than 60 per cent of employees worldwide have used personal devices for work. And the trend is expected to keep rising as millennials join the workforce, it said.\n\nAnd Gartner estimates that by 2016, companies will spend more than US$300 per employee per annum to support and manage these devices.\n\nBYOD may save companies some money in the long run because they have offloaded the cost of the device and wireless services to the employee, but peripheral costs of support and security still need to be upheld, said Gartner.\n\nAdditionally, Gartner estimates that by 2016, 38 per cent of companies globally will be \"completely\" BYOD.\n\nMr Thompson pointed out that it can be more dangerous for an employee's mobile to be broken into than a laptop. Mobile devices carry additional information such as a user's live location, as well as extensive data from contact lists and e-mail. Furthermore, it has equipment such as cameras and microphones that can be turned on remotely and be used to spy easily on users, he said.\n\n\"Attackers find mobiles very attractive because of this,\" he said.\n\nRelating an incident with a mobile app's flaw, he said some employees at a company had an app that kept repeatedly trying to download a large software update. The combined load on the network ended up taking down the company's connectivity, greatly impacting the employees while the IT department scrambled to get to the root of the problem.\n\nThis happens because there is a much higher trust placed in mobile devices, he said.\n\nPeople tend to install antivirus software on their computers, but not on their phones, and there is lower discretion when people install apps on their phones, compared with downloading unknown software off the Internet on their PCs, he noted.\n\nThis can lead to a higher incidence of misbehaving apps on mobile phones, so companies should watch out for mobiles, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

From our side, we would like better access to petrochemicals and also for foodstuffs, whether it is milk powder or processed foods - things that are important to our exporters,\" he told reporters in Tokyo.\n\nHe was in the Japanese capital to attend a special summit marking 40 years of relations between Japan and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\n\nAs part of the FTA review process, Mr Lee said that the Singapore government would approach companies and get their feedback on what they would like to have in order to improve the way they do business.\n\n\"What we do is, MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) will talk to the companies and industry and find out what is of value, what is useful to them, and then MTI will go and push for that because that is the dividend for us. Then we can see what the other side wants and we try and reach a deal,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nHe did not provide a specific timeframe for the review to be completed. In May this year, Mr Lee had said that he wanted the FTA review to be an ambitious one and not merely making minor adjustments to the agreement.\n\nSingapore was the first country which Japan signed a free trade pact with. The landmark agreement - also the first bilateral FTA between Asian countries - was inked by former prime ministers Goh Chok Tong and Junichiro Koizumi in January 2002, coming into force 10 months later.\n\nOn a related note, Japan and Asean also announced last Saturday that they have wrapped up their negotiations for their FTA, after both sides managed to settle the two remaining chapters on services and investments.\n\nThe good news paves the way for Japan's full participation in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a major trade pact involving Asean and six other countries including Japan, China and South Korea.\n\nMr Lee described the conclusion of the Asean-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership talks as a \"significant achievement\" of the summit.\n\n\"(These last two chapters of the FTA) have been negotiated for a long time, but I think because this summit was coming, there was an extra impetus to complete it and to be able to resolve the difficult outstanding issues,\" he said.\n\nOnce in place, the FTA is expected to boost trade between Asean and Japan, which Mr Lee noted had actually decreased by 4 per cent in 2012, even as Asean's trade with other North-east Asian countries had gone up. He added that Asean and Japan were committed to doubling their trade volume by 2022.\n\nSeparately, Japan has proposed to explore a regional air services agreement with Asean.\n\nMr Lee said that Singapore looked forward to strengthening air services beyond those exchanged bilaterally between Japan and the 10 Asean member states.\n\nMr Lee and his delegation returned to Singapore yesterday after a week-long, two-nation trip that also saw him visiting South Korea.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

But all five commissioners said they shared the public's doubts about such a change.\n\nAfter nearly three weeks of public complaints for even raising the possibility of passengers' having to sit for hours while seatmates chatter on cellphones, the FCC chairman and the Transportation secretary agreed last week that there was a way to both promote technology and protect the public interest.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, we have heard of concerns raised by airlines, travellers, flight attendants, members of Congress and others who are all troubled over the idea of passengers' talking on cellphones in flight, and I am concerned about this possibility as well,\" said the Transportation secretary, Anthony Foxx.\n\nThe department will consider whether allowing in-flight voice calls \"is fair to consumers\", he said, in part by soliciting public comment.\n\n\"This is not a rule about usage,\" said the FCC's chairman, Tom Wheeler. He added: \"This is a rule about technology,\" specifically new technology that allows cellphones to be used on airborne planes without interfering with wireless networks on the ground.\n\nA Quinnipiac University poll conducted last week found that roughly 59 per cent of Americans said using a cellphone to make a call should not be allowed during flights, while 30 per cent said that it should.\n\nEven younger, tech-savvy Americans are not keen on the idea of in-flight calls. An Associated Press-GfK poll, also conducted last week, found that 48 per cent of Americans did not want to allow cellphone conversations on flights, while 19 per cent were in favour of it. About 30 per cent had no opinion.\n\n\"Let me make clear what's going on here - nothing will be different on your flight tomorrow,\" Mr Wheeler said. He added: \"I don't want to listen to the personal conversations and the business deals of the person sitting next to me on a flight.\" Mr Wheeler and the FCC were surprised last month by the flood of phone calls and e-mail expressing anger at the possibility that cellphone conversations would be allowed on flights. Repealing the existing regulation is necessary, Mr Wheeler said, given the commission's responsibilities.\n\n\"If technology eliminates interference and therefore it eliminates the need for an interference protection rule, then we ought to eliminate the rule,\" he said.\n\nThe commission's two Republican members voted against seeking public comment on the proposed change. One of them, Ajit Pai, said removing the rule would not be in the public interest, because it would allow airlines to infringe on the rights of wireless companies, which have exclusive licences to use the airwaves at given frequencies.\n\nCommissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, concurred with the other two Democrats on the panel to ask the public about the cellphone proposal.\n\nBut she also made clear that she was unlikely to support a rule that would allow for in-flight voice calls.\n\n\"If we move beyond what we do here today and actually update our rules to allow calls on planes, we could see a future where our quiet time is monetised and seating in the silent section comes at a premium,\" Ms Rosenworcel said.\n\n\"But worse, given the anger this proposal has generated and the negative response of so many of those who work on planes, I fear that our safety would be compromised.\"\n\nMr Wheeler has regularly said that it would be up to individual airlines to permit the use of cellphones for voice calls.\n\nSeveral airlines in Asia, Europe and Australia allow the practice, but with rules about where the devices can be used and for how long.\n\nIn a second cell phone-related measure, the FCC and the wireless telephone industry announced terms that would allow consumers to unlock a cellphone bought from one carrier so that it may work on another's networks.\n\nThe rules will apply to devices bought from a cellphone company under a mandatory subscription plan, once the contract is fulfilled, and to prepaid cellphones no longer than a year from purchase.\n\nLocked mobile devices contain software that prevents cellphones or tablets from being used on compatible mobile networks and can make it harder for consumers to keep the same phone when changing carriers.\n\n\"Consumers win when they are armed with the right information and know their options, especially when it comes to navigating how to unlock a wireless phone after completing a contract,\" Mr Wheeler said in a statement.\n\nThe wireless industry has opposed the measure until recently, but it is not likely to promote the practice. Its industry group warned consumers not to confuse what the measure would and would not let them to do.\n\n\"Devices that work on one provider's network may not be technologically compatible with another wireless provider's network,\" said Steve Largent, president and chief executive of CTIA-The Wireless Association. \"Additionally, unlocking a device may enable some functionality of the device but not all.\" For example, an unlocked device may support voice services but not data when activated on a different network. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/5f3a781c0acf8c12ecafab8dc2b0df3dfe99f5ef386ffe5969a90ee1a875954a?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "In-flight chat: Several airlines in Asia, Europe and Australia allow the practice, but with rules about where the devices can be used and for how long. -\u00a0FILE PHOTO"}]}

With my girlfriends, we usually have a Christmas lunch, and do our Secret Santa gift exchanges after the meal.\n\nI dislike the mad shopping rush towards the end of the year, so I start looking out a few weeks in advance, and if I chance across something I think my friends would like, I buy it ahead of time.\n\nBesides my close friends with whom gift-giving is a tradition, I also buy gifts for my two sisters and mum.\n\nI usually pick up things from my travels. But I have also bought a few things recently from some Singaporean stores such as edgeofember.com for socially responsible jewellery; kithandkin.sg, which carries carefully sourced, beautiful objects from around the world; thehappysprout.com, for my friends who have babies; cossetme.com which has super-comfortable lounge wear; and curatededitions.com for trendy, statement jewellery pieces.\n\nThe best Christmas gift that I have received is a Cocoonababy from a friend, for my baby who is due in three months' time. This is a little ergonomic sleep pod that can be placed anywhere around the house so it saves me the trouble of getting a sleep basket.\n\nApart from the gift exchange that I do with close friends, I don't usually get many gifts during Christmas. I prefer spending the time with family and close friends, and that is always more special than physical presents.\n\nOn my Christmas wish list, is good health for everyone in my family. A present that I will be giving this year, is a cushion in the shape of a French bulldog for my sister. And if I am feeling generous, I may get a print from theartling.com for my husband Federico.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Growing up, I'd often spend Christmas at my parents' home.

It has suggested a corporatised investment vehicle similar to that in Europe - the SICAV or the open-ended investment company (OEIC). Hong Kong is moving in this direction.\n\nIn the latest review, it looked into how other jurisdictions approached the issue of variability of capital, for instance. Only the United Kingdom and Channel Islands have stand-alone legislation for the incorporation of a variable capital company or OEIC.\n\nPwC also raised the question of how investment funds should be regulated. It said the days of unregulated products appear to be coming to an end judging by global trends. It said it is a matter of debate whether non-retail structures should come under the regulatory purview.\n\nOn distribution of returns and capital, it said the variability of capital would be a commercial impossibility without the ability to freely distribute dividends and return of capital with minimal legal and administrative hurdles. Ireland, Luxembourg and British Virgin Islands allow free distributions. For Luxembourg and Ireland, this is so provided the funds maintain a minimum net asset or capital size.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Traditionally, Filipinos go to church for Misa del Gallo, a mass that's heard before sunrise on each of the nine days before Christmas, after which there are always fireworks. But I have a personal tradition of visiting animal shelters to give food and assistance to animals as many of them are traumatised by the fireworks. Most dogs end up running into the road and getting hit by cars, or getting lost.\n\n\"My family usually has Christmas dinner on the eve. Since my sister and I have both been vegan since childhood, there will usually be vegan and non-vegan food on the table. My sister and I will have vegan versions of arrabiata, paella, pizza, burgers and cakes and, of course, Tofurky or vegan turkey - enough food to last us three days. Now that I'm based in Singapore, I celebrate Christmas with my fiance and also spreading the word that Christmas can be as fun and tasty without meat.\"\n\nRoasted Rosemary and Tiger Beer Tofurky\n\n(serves 8)\n\nIngredients:\n\nOne Tofurky (defrosted, available at Four Seasons Market)\n\n1/4 cup vegan margarine, melted (Nuttelex brand, available in Cold Storage)\n\nOne tablespoon Dijon mustard\n\nOne teaspoon rosemary (dried and crushed)\n\n1/4 teaspoon onion powder\n\nOne tablespoon Braggs liquid amino acids, available from SuperNature\n\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black peppercorns\n\nOne bottle Tiger beer\n\nDash of liquid smoke (hickory flavouring)\n\n1/4 cup wholewheat flour\n\nStuffing flavouring that comes with\n\nTofurky package\n\n1/3 cup vegetable broth\n\npinch of sage (rubbed)\n\n1/4 teaspoon rosemary-infused olive oil\n\n1/4 teaspoon white wine\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Heat oven to 400 deg C.\n\n2. In a bowl, blend the stuffing flavouring with a whisk until the sage has blended in completely. Marinade the Tofurky with the mixture.\n\n3. Put the defrosted Tofurky in a deep casserole dish or Dutch oven.\n\n4. In a mixing bowl, make the rosemary beer by blending margarine, dijon mustard, rosemary, onion powder, Braggs, pepper, Tiger beer, liquid smoke and flour with a whisk until there are no flour clumps.\n\n5. Pour about 1/4 cup of the rosemary beer mix over the Tofurky with a ladle. Roll your Tofurky a few times to make sure it gets coated evenly. Put in the oven uncovered and bake for five minutes. Then brush another coating of rosemary beer mix over the top. Turn heat down to 350 deg C and return your Tofurky to the oven uncovered. Use a ladle to pour a little more rosemary beer mix over the top every 10 minutes while your Tofurky roasts. You'll notice that the rosemary beer mix will begin to form a crust over the Tofurky. This is a good thing and the more you brush your Tofurky with beer, the thicker that crust will get. You'll want to bake your Tofurky roast for 45 minutes to one hour. You'll know it's ready when your Tofurky is golden brown and the crust is crispy.\n\n6. Mix the leftover marinade with a cup of vegetable broth to make a gravy.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

My family always celebrated Christmas the same way: we would meet at my aunt's house around 5pm on Christmas Eve and there would always be a huge spread of food.\n\n\"Our Christmas feast actually changes every year, depending on what my uncle was feeling passionate about. One year, he came up with a four-course feast with onion soup, baked fish, beef Wellington and souffle, and another year, he served locally made cold cuts and cheese with boiled potatoes and cold butter. I come from a family of foodies so they always need to have something different to make every Christmas very special - but the one thing we were never really interested to eat was turkey. Austrian food is always hearty with little plating or garnishes - just simple, good food. The smell ofpork, leek and pie crust always remind me of home.\n\n\"In Singapore, I live with my wife, son and brother-in-law so our Christmas is more local now. We'll typically have a dinner at home with friends and family, but I'm usually the one behind the kitchen stove cooking for the others.\"\n\nChristmas pork and leek pie\n\n(serves 6)\n\nIngredients:\n\nLarge knob of butter\n\n3 leeks, washed and shredded\n\nSmall bunch of thyme\n\nSmall bunch of tarragon\n\n6 rashers bacon, chopped\n\n1kg minced pork\n\n10g of garlic, chopped\n\n2 heaped tablespoon plain flour\n\nOne glass of white wine\n\n100ml chicken stock\n\n250ml fresh cream or cream fraiche\n\nFor the pie pastry\n\n600g strong white flour\n\n300g cold butter, diced (best to use 150g beef dripping, 150g cold butter, diced)\n\n2 tbsp ice cold water\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 200 deg C. To make the pastry, mix flour and cold butter until you have large breadcrumbs. Add the cold water and when the pastry has come together, roll it into a sausage. Cut into half and use a rolling pin to roll the pastry between two sheets of parchment paper until it forms a layer that is 5mm in thickness. Do this with the second dough piece. Wrap it with cling film and leave it to chill for 30 minutes before using.\n\n2. Meanwhile, heat a large frying pan on medium heat and melt the butter. Add leeks, garlic, salt, pepper and thyme and cook for 10-15 minutes until soft and sweet.\n\n3. Season pork with salt and pepper. In a separate pan on high heat, fry the bacon until crispy, then add the minced pork and fry till brown.\n\n4. Once the leeks are softened, stir in the flour, then add the wine and cook for a couple of minutes until the alcohol has evaporated. Add the browned pork, chicken stock, bacon, and then add the creme fraiche. Stir thoroughly, then add the chopped tarragon. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool.\n\n5. Remove the pastry sheets from the fridge and use one sheet to line the bottom of a pie dish. Fill with your cooled chicken and leek mixture, then lay the other sheet over the top.\n\n6. Use your fingers to crimp and pinch around the outside to seal the pie. If you like, make a little design with the off cuts. Brush the top with beaten egg and bake for 25 minutes until golden brown.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At her previous workshops which take place about once a month, there are usually a variety of designs of prints that participants choose and alter to their liking, to print on paper or tote bags.\n\nFor each workshop, Ms Ong begins with an introduction to screen printing and the background of printmaking. \"I want to introduce basic printmaking techniques that attendees can work with at home,\" she says, adding that she loves the process and technicality that goes into screenprinting, \"from the calculated layers of colours to the painstaking alignment of each design.\"\n\nMs Ong teaches the direct block-out technique of screen printing. A chosen image is traced lightly with pencil on the silkscreen. Negative areas of the image will be painted on and carefully blocked out with a screen filler on the screen. When the screen filler has thoroughly dried, ink can be screened through the open areas. This allows the positioned image to appear from the negative stencil. \"This home-friendly method is challenging but gets easier with much practice,\" she says, adding that her workshop is popular with working executives.\n\n\"With the introduction of printing, participants will be able appreciate the many visual aspects of everyday art and design around them, such as the prints on T-shirts and posters,\" says Ms Ong.\n\nWhen: Dec 22, 3pm to 6pm\n\nVenue: Tyrwhitt General Company, 150A Tyrwhitt Road\n\nFee: $99\n\nRegister at:\n\ntyrwhittgeneralcompany.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I usually start baking Christmas cakes at that time to allow time for the flavour to intensify. From around late October, any time I see something that would make a great Christmas present, I buy it.\n\nAs Christmas draws closer, I begin to shop online. I rarely have much free time to roam around the stores, and to be honest, I don't quite like crowds, so shopping from the comfort of my armchair is great for me. A lot of my gifts have been bought while I am at the hair salon. If you shop on American sites, there are some great post-Thanksgiving sales and many of them will ship to Singapore quite reasonably. Like most mothers, I would have to say anything made by my kids are the best Christmas presents. The present of their time and affection beats anything else. Be it a mug they have hand-decorated or a playlist that they have put together for me, anything that they have spent time thinking about beats anything that money can buy.\n\nWhat's my worst Christmas gift? Of course, I cannot answer that. One present that I will be giving this year, is a pair of ski gloves which have a built-in battery-operated heater. My husband is an avid skier and he loves gadgets, and so this pair of gloves is just wonderful for even the coldest ski days. Another gift that I often give to dear friends are tickets to a show. This year I have bought tickets to the fun musical My Fair Lady, which will be playing at Marina Bay Sands in February. I have seen it in London and defy anyone to leave without a smile on their face or not hum one of the catchy tunes.\n\nNowadays , we all lead such busy lives and finding time to spend with dear ones is important. By buying them tickets to see a show, I can make sure we schedule in time to spend together. We will probably make an evening of it and have a nice meal at one of the restaurants at Marina Bay Sands. This year, I have friends who are spending Christmas overseas. Tickets are small and easy to carry, and it means that they can easily pop it in their luggage and have something from me to open on Christmas morning.\n\nWhile shopping at Shanghai Tang recently, I spied a beautifully designed tea-cup and saucer. The set is called Phoenix, and it is the perfect mix of sophistication and the unexpected. I love it, and would really love to receive this.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Instead, he has turned it into a business of sorts.\n\nMr Tan is known in the local creative scene for building scenes of Singapore in the 1990s using Lego. Most of his creations can be seen on his Facebook page, My Little World. \"I grew up in the 1990s, and want to preserve my memories this way,\" says Mr Tan, 36.\n\nHis creations caught the attention of Tyrwhitt General Company (TGC) who invited him to conduct Lego-building workshops. Mr Tan initially found the idea rather strange. \"Lego is about playing, and I find it unusual that I had to teach people how to play,\" he says. Having played with Lego since he was a child, he is very familiar with the different types of bricks. \"I was always making my own creations, rather than following instructions on the box.\"\n\nFor TGC's workshops, Mr Tan teaches participants how to build miniature playgrounds. These are not the typical playgrounds, but iconic ones around Singapore such as the Dragon at Toa Payoh Lorong 6, the Elephant at Pasir Ris Park and the Sparrow from Clementi Ave 3.\n\n\"I enjoyed incorporating some nostalgia into the workshops. I also share some history of these playgrounds, and share their exact location so participants can see the real thing for themselves,\" says Mr Tan.\n\nHe begins workshops by first explaining what the different bricks in Lego are called. Then participants try to build the playgrounds on their own. Those who find their building skills lacking need not worry, as Mr Tan takes them through the paces step-by-step. \"I tell them which piece goes where, which pieces to stack on top of the other, so no one will get lost,\" he says.\n\nDecals are also provided so participants get a complete miniature of the playground.\n\nThe workshops have proven popular not only with children, but adults as well, \"Lego brings back childhood memories for them,\" says Mr Tan. \"More importantly, participants build structures that are very Singaporean and close to their heart.\"\n\nWhen: Dec 15, 1pm to 2.30pm\n\nVenue: Tyrwhitt General Company, 150A Tyrwhitt Road\n\nFee: $89\n\nRegister at:\n\ntyrwhittgeneralcompany.com\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On Christmas Eve, we would usually go to Church for an early mass followed by a small dinner, often with a more Italian focus as my grandparents on one side of my family are from Italy.\n\n\"On Christmas Day, the extended family would come over and there would be turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, spiced mashed sweet potatoes, parmesan, asparagus or green beans, and many other things. My mother would bake for the whole of December to prepare for her own solo exhibition during the dinner. She'd have shortbread, Swedish butter balls, black-bottomed coconut bars, truffles, rum balls, chocolate bark and, as a centrepiece, her much-loved butter tarts, a pastry filled with sultanas, vanilla, butter, sugar and other goodness. After the first bite, you had to hold them at a 90 degree angle because the sweet interior would ooze out everywhere.\n\n\"Occasionally, our family would also drive an all-terrain vehicle to our cottage in the woods on the days after Christmas. We'd drive across a frozen lake, slide down a toboggan in the snowy wilderness and drink hot cocoa - and all that storybook stuff.

Cook the lard in a pan until it liquefies, then pour in the cognac. Mix well and leave to sit for at least 24 hours. After 24 hours, move the mixture into the freezer and leave until the solids have frozen. Strain the mixture and collect the liquid, which is the fat-washed cognac.\n\n3 . Take 50ml of the liquid and stir together with the syrup and bitters and serve in a short glass over rocks. Garnish with orange zest and other holiday ornamentation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be headed by former supreme court judge G Pannir Selvam and is expected to submit its findings and recommendations within six months.\n\nThe other members of the COI are former police chief Tee Tua Ba, former trade union leader John De Payva and grassroots leader Andrew Chua Thiam Chwee.\n\nSpeaking to the media yesterday evening, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said: \"I have appointed members of the committee who have experience in law, understand security requirements and are familiar with workers' issues as well as managing relations between the community and workers.\"\n\nThe committee will establish the factors and circumstances which led to the riot, how the riot unfolded and how the response forces managed the incident.\n\nIt will also consider whether current measures to manage such incidents in areas where foreign workers congregate, such as Little India, are adequate, and recommend further measures to improve their management and reduce the risk of such incidents.\n\nThe committee is to conduct itself in accordance with the provisions of the Inquiries Act.\n\nMr Selvam has vast experience in legal matters and co-chaired the Commission of National Inquiry looking into the resignation of the President of the Maldives. Mr Tee, the commissioner of the police force from 1992 to 1997, brings a security perspective to the inquiry.\n\nMr De Payva, former president of the National Trades Union Congress, is well versed with labour issues, while Mr Chua, as chairman of the West Coast Citizens' Consultative Committee and member of the South West Community Development Council, has been involved in managing relations between the community and foreign workers.\n\nMr Teo stressed that the COI's purpose was to determine the causes of the riot and to make recommendations as opposed to criminal investigation, which the police investigation will focus on, so there will be no duplication between the two processes.\n\nHe said an inter-ministry committee already exists to look into larger issues concerning the impact of foreign workers on Singapore and their welfare.\n\nSeparately, the police said yesterday that they had arrested a 31-year-old Indian national in relation to the riot. He will be charged in court today for rioting under Section 147 of the Penal Code.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Asia Pacific as a whole is a strategic priority and Australia is one of the most attractive markets in the region.\"\n\nInvestor demand for Australian property is climbing, driven by relatively higher yields, and as home prices in the nation's biggest cities reach records each month. Australia was among the three most active Asia-Pacific markets for commercial property transactions in the three months to Sept 30, after Japan and China, data from CBRE Group Inc show.\n\nHome prices across the nation's biggest cities jumped 8.3 per cent this year to Nov 30, according to the RP Data-Rismark home value index.\n\nUBS manages US$8 billion of retail and industrial property in Japan through a joint venture with Mitsubishi Corp, and partners with Chinese developer Gemdale Corp in a residential development fund on the mainland, Mr Cooke said today.\n\nUBS Grocon Real Estate will select investments both from the Melbourne-based builder's A$2 billion of current and planned projects, and from other sources depending on investor demand, Mr Cooke said. It will set up separate accounts and \"club-style\" vehicles that have a maximum of five institutions, rather than traditional funds open to multiple investors, he said.\n\nWhile the number of funds and time-frame for establishing them will depend on investor appetite, \"we're looking for 2014 to be an exciting year in the development of this platform\", Mr Cooke said.\n\nThe partnership will begin by focusing on prime office properties for more conservative investors, and residential developments to cater to those seeking higher returns, he added.\n\nThe venture will have the first right of refusal on the Australian builder's planned developments, the companies said in a joint release yesterday.\n\nJohn Fraser, who will retire as chief executive officer of UBS's global asset management business next year, while staying on as chairman, will be non-executive chairman of the joint venture, according to the statement. Daniel Grollo, CEO of Grocon, will be a non-executive director, and the rest of the board will be appointed in the coming months, it said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

But attendees of Sing Messiah! by the Braddell Heights Symphony Orchestra (BHSO) have the unique option to play a much larger role.\n\nAt their concert at the Esplanade Concert Hall on Dec 22, the BHSO will take on Messiah, an oratorio (or large musical composition for vocals and an orchestra) created by composer G F Handel in 1741.\n\nAnd what's special about it is that the audiences can choose to take part, and join in the choir to sing certain choruses. The choice will be presented during the purchase of tickets, where you can choose either to join the \"audience\" or the \"singers\".\n\nAn open rehearsal session will also be conducted tomorrow afternoon for the \"singers\" to practise. PDFs of the music scores and midi files have also been uploaded on the BHSO website for reference.\n\nSays Adrian Tan, the music director and conductor of BHSO: \"Too often, classical music feels very serious and austere. But in Handel's time, people would purchase the music scores and organise 'Messiah parties' in their homes where they gather a group of friends to sing the Messiah together around a piano.\n\n\"I think there's such a wonderful sense of community in that, and that's what we're trying to bring with Sing Messiah, albeit on a grander scale.\"\n\nThe open rehearsal runs tomorrow afternoon from 3 pm to 5 pm at the Esplanade concourse.\n\nSing Messiah! runs on Dec 22, at 5pm at the Esplanade Concert Hall.

Here are seven recommendations from HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMastermind: How To Think Like Sherlock Holmes\n\nBy Maria Konnikova, $32\n\nBOOKS on how to think better are not always an easy read. But Maria Konnikova's Mastermind: How To Think Like Sherlock Holmes is something of an exception. Written in a breezy fashion, it splices excerpts of the detective's adventures with scientific studies on memory and reasoning. It offers good and sound advice on sharpening your powers of logic and observation.\n\nBut Konnikova doesn't stop at fiction and science. She also advocates practising a zen-like centredness, especially in times of crisis, because she believes it is most difficult to apply logic in those moments that matter the most. Learning to focus is not quite \"elementary, my dear Watson\" because our minds are prone to wander. But this book will have you convinced that training your brain is worth it. Holmes, for one, would certainly approve.\n\nA Map of the World: The World According to Illustrators and Storytellers\n\nBy Antonis Antoniou (editor), $98\n\nIf you know a person who is curious about the world but doesn't like to read, you might want to get him A Map of the World: The World According to Illustrators and Storytellers. It's a compilation of more than 500 gorgeous, quirky maps by various artists, that don't quite illustrate parts of the world as much as they depict the way we live.\n\nFrom a Kyushu Train All Stars map that shows what you can do on the Japanese island in cute, graphic terms, to an LA Film Map that renames Los Angeles roads according to appropriate film titles, some of these maps are abstract and profound, while others are downright funny. Cartography never seemed more fun.\n\nHow To Fail At Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life\n\nBy Scott Adams, $35\n\nRemember Dilbert, the comic strip? For years, many white-collar office drones relied on Dilbert to find the funny side of the workplace with all its bureaucracies and mismanagement.\n\nNow, its creator, Scott Adams, has written an autobiography of sorts which, like the cartoon, has a complete anti-career outlook. In short, he advises you to \"invite failure in, embrace it, then pick its pocket\".\n\nDismissing as rubbish a lot of typical career advice such as \"follow your passion\", Adams shows how goofy optimism, hard work and a logical way of calculating your odds are among the best ways to find success. Adams should know something about it, since Dilbert is his first real career success after a long series of failed get-rich schemes.\n\nLost Cat: A True Story of Love, Desperation, and GPS Technology\n\nBy Caroline Paul and Wendy McNaughton, $37.40\n\nKnow a cat lover? Get her Lost Cat, an illustrated novel that would charm her socks off - and perhaps those of other folk too. Author Caroline Paul tells a real-life story of how her cat Tibby went missing for five weeks - and then returned home nonchalantly, looking shinier and healthier than he ever did.\n\nUnable to contain her curiosity, the author tried to find out what happened to Tibby. She distributed flyers, purchased a kitty-camera and tracked Tibby's movement using GPS. What she pieced together is nothing short of funny and surprising. Indeed, don't be fooled by the book's plain-looking cover. The story inside - together with Wendy McNaughton's illustration - is just purr-fect.\n\nThe Big New Yorker Book of Dogs\n\nBy The New Yorker magazine, $76\n\nWe would be remiss in our duties if we recommended a book for cat lovers but not for dog lovers. Well, the famous New Yorker magazine - a favourite of literatis - has published its own The Big New Yorker Book of Dogs. It's a wonderful compilation of short stories, essay and poems by very big names, including Roald Dahl, Arthur Miller, John Updike, Jonathan Lethem, Roddy Doyle and EB White, together with a foreword by Malcolm Gladwell and a new essay by Adam Gopnik.\n\nFor most New Yorker magazine readers, however, the icing on the cake has always been the cartoons by the magazine's staff which intersperse with the fine writing.\n\nBOOKS FOR CHILDREN\n\nThe Day the Crayons Quit\n\nBy Drew Daywalt & Oliver Jeffers, $23\n\nNeed a gift for the young one? The Day the Crayons Quit has been charming kids since, well, the day in July when it was released.\n\nRanked as one of 2013's most popular kids' books by sites such as Amazon and Goodread, it tells the delightful story about a box of crayons that's gone rogue because the crayons feel either overworked or neglected: Blue is tired of colouring just water. Black wants to do more than just outline things. Yellow and Orange are fighting over sole rights to colour the sun.\n\nIf you're giggling, imagine the book's effect on kids.\n\nFortunately, the Milk\n\nBy Neil Gaiman and Chris Riddell, $19\n\nTerrific title, eh? Well, the story's good too. Another kid's bestseller of 2013, Fortunately, The Milk tells the story of a pair of siblings who wakes up one morning to find no milk in the refrigerator. The father goes off to get milk and doesn't return for a very long time.\n\nWhen he eventually does, he relates a fantastical tale of how he had already bought the milk but had to rescue it from monsters, aliens, pirates, wumpires (the cuter version of vampires) and other threats. Written by the faultless Neil Gaiman, it's a first-rate charmer.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nAll books are available at Kinokuniya in Takashimaya Shopping Centre\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We are learning lessons of crisis,\" he said after the agreement was reached by representatives of the European Parliament, the European Council - the EU's executive arm - and the 28 member states.\n\nThe aim is to make European banks stronger so that they \"can lend to the real economy\", he added.\n\n\"This is a fundamental step towards the completion of the Banking Union,\" Mr Barnier said in a separate statement.\n\nThe new system will take effect from 2016.\n\nThe \"bail-in\" will primarily require important hits to be taken by shareholders and bond holders of a financial institution in trouble.\n\nSmall depositors will be explicitly excluded from incurring any costs but depositors with more than 100,000 euros (S$172,600) could be affected, though lastly under a pre-defined hierarchy, the European parliament said.\n\nFor each member state, a fund will be established which will come to the aid of banks in order to help them recover or to wind them down.\n\nThese funds will be built up through bank contributions and by 2025 should reach the level of one per cent of the covered deposits of the banks in that country.\n\nAll banks will have to contribute but those contributions will be bigger for the banks that take the bigger risks, said Mr Barnier.\n\nHowever the deal does not exclude the possibility of public money being used \"in exceptional circumstances\", the parliamentary statement said.\n\nWelcoming the deal, Gunnar Hoekmark, who steered the legislation through the European parliament, said: \"We now have a strong bail-in system which sends a clear message that bank shareholders and creditors will be the ones to bear the losses on rainy days, not taxpayers.\"\n\nThe deal must still be finalised on a technical level and will then need official approval by the EU member states and parliament.\n\nThe new directive will eventually dovetail with the EU's \"Banking Union\", which is being hammered out but will only apply to countries that use the common euro currency and others that choose to participate.\n\nAll countries now accept the principle that if banks get into difficulty, then it will not be the taxpayer but investors and creditors that bear the costs. But differences remain as to how to put that into practice.\n\nEU ministerial talks in Brussels on Tuesday focused on a so-called Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) that would step in to close a bank at risk before it could do too much damage to the wider economy.\n\nThe SRM would have a pot of cash at its disposal - funded eventually by the banks themselves - to cover the cost involved so the taxpayer does not have to pick up the bill.\n\nThe SRM would follow an already agreed Single Supervisory Mechanism that the European Central Bank will run to oversee the top 130 or so eurozone banks directly, and thousands more indirectly via national authorities.\n\nWhile all agree in principle, the political issues are fraught since the new system would effectively hand control of national banks to the EU.\n\nThose talks will resume at ministerial level next week with hopes for agreement by the end of the month. - AFP\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition to being a graphic designer by trade, he helps run a cafe, is a singer-songwriter with a solo album to his name, and he is a photographer fresh off his exhibitions at both Hong Kong and Singapore's Affordable Art Fairs this year.\n\nRight now, the latest thing keeping him busy is the release of his first book - a compilation of over 50 of his photographs, titled Residue.\n\nThe book was officially launched last night at his cafe, Artistry, together with his own exhibition of the same name.\n\nResidue is a series of photographs taken against a weathered surface, with a clear acrylic panel between the surface and the camera adding a reflection of high-rise buildings in the shot.\n\nHeijnen's photos are his way of exploring rapid urbanisation in Asian countries, namely Hong Kong, China, Indonesia and Singapore, by juxtaposing modern high-rise buildings against the textured walls or floors of older buildings worn and torn by nature.\n\nExploring urbanisation\n\n\"I don't know why I feel so strongly about urbanisation, but it's a very interesting theme because the world is moving towards that,\" says Heijnen, who was born in a small town in Holland but moved to Singapore two decades ago.\n\n\"Asia is my playground for this theme. I tried this in Europe, but there, you get a lot of old buildings. Juxtaposing that against old textures deflates the effect a little bit. Plus the Asian climate creates more interesting textures,\" he explains.\n\nHis prints are on sale at the cafe and his website, priced from $800 to $4,000 based on size and the number of pieces that were printed. Heijnen's book is also on sale for $65 at Kinokuniya's main store and Artistry, among other places.\n\nOn first look, Heijnen's works could easily be mistaken for a hipster's double-exposed piece of lomography, or even an abstract painting. Instead, they were shot with just his full-frame Nikon D600, and the aid of his acrylic panel.\n\nNo photo-editing is done beyond the basic cropping or dodge and burn, he promises.\n\n\"Everyone thinks my works are painted, or a product of Photoshop ... With some of my works, people go close to look at them at exhibitions, or look at them from the side. They think it's 3-dimensional,\" says Heijnen. \"That's why I don't really see myself as a photographer so much, but more as a visual artist who uses photography.\"\n\nHis idea for this technique of combining textures and reflections developed four years ago, and according to him, it happened mostly by accident.\n\nHe was always obsessed with photographing textures and reflections, and had accumulated thousands of such photos in his personal collection, but he had never combined the two.\n\nIt was only during a trip to France in 2007, that he saw a shop window with scratches on its blue paint, and spontaneously took a shot of the building reflected in it.\n\nEven then, it took another two years before he started making a series out of it.\n\n\"The principle elements of these photos are the same - buildings and texture. But what differentiates each photo is their unique formations, colours, and textures.\n\nWith depth\n\n\"I'm always looking for a texture that has a slight depth to it, so when the building is slightly out of focus, it feels like the two are merging. That's what I'm looking for - to merge the two, so it looks like it's painted, but it's actually painted by the texture,\" he explains.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nResidue runs till Jan 19 at Artistry at 17 Jalan Pinang. Opening hours are from Tues to Sun, 10am to 7pm. Admission is free.\n\nGo to\n\nwww.marcelheijnen.com\n\nor call 6298 2420 for more information.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The announcement came shortly after the company also announced its involvement in building telecommunications towers and a new property deal.\n\nThose announcements are part of Yoma's growing diversification, even though more than 90 per cent of total revenue still comes from property. The company now dabbles in auto servicing through its Mitsubishi partnership; telecommunications through a partnership with Digicel; and retail, through a joint venture to develop Parkson department stores in Myanmar.\n\n\"There is vast opportunity in Myanmar in a number of strategic sectors, and our key strength is that we are a partner of choice for many international companies looking to expand into Myanmar, as well as our ability to attract strong talent,\" Yoma chief executive Andrew Rickards told The Business Times.\n\nMitsubishi said a second after-sales service centre was set up in Mandalay on Dec 5, allowing Yoma's joint venture with Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Mitsubishi Corp and First Myanmar Investment Co to service almost 80 per cent of Mitsubishi vehicles in the country.\n\nThe business partners are now planning to sell new vehicles as well, and could even explore local production in the future.\n\n\"Timing will be driven by market conditions,\" Mr Rickards said.\n\nThe motivation behind Yoma's diversification is not difficult to understand. In a high-growth, frontier market like Myanmar, everything looks like an opportunity, while putting all the eggs in a single industry can seem risky.\n\nThe key is balance.\n\n\"The group remains focused on building a diversified conglomerate in Myanmar . . . We are building our non-real estate businesses, and are selectively expanding into other businesses in the country,\" Mr Rickards said. \"We are confident that in the medium term, we expect to have a well-balanced portfolio of businesses.\"\n\nYoma shares closed flat at 73 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With the very first sip, you know it's a big wine, with great concentration of citrusy fruit and minerality. A very fresh taste, very rich with fruit. Attractive to drink now in what I would call \"childhood\", and deserves to be aged a minimum of 10 years, preferably more. This Domaine has a well-deserved reputation, the current generation being the 14th! True Chablis family, thus steeped in its tradition and folk-lore. Valmur has the reputation of being perhaps the weightiest of the Grands Crus. Weight and power, and always very rich in extract. A little less elegance than Les Clos and Blanchots, my two favourite Chablis Grands Crus. We should really see more of these Chablis; they are such a change from the usual Pulignys and Meursaults. This wine, for instance, was served with thinly sliced Australian abalone and what a magical combination, the minerally Chablis cleaning the palate after the smoky, slightly earthy taste of the abalone.\n\nMontrachet 1993, Marquis de Laguiche by Maison Joseph Drouhin\n\nGolden colour, nose of citrus and almonds; very good ripeness, medium length finish, now fully mature. Have seen better Laguiches though.\n\nThe Marquis de Laguiche Montrachet is my favourite Montrachet. Two reasons, the first being that it is a great wine, and the second, as important as the first or even more so, it is always most reasonably priced. And it ages beautifully. Drouhin farms and makes the wines from this vineyard in the Montrachet Appellation, the vineyard obviously belonging to the Marquis's family.\n\nCorton Charlemagne 1992, Bonneau du Martray\n\nA light golden colour. A lovely wine at just the right age. After the Montrachet, it appeared to be on the slim side. But very elegant and showed very good ripe fruit, very, very long. A great bottle.\n\nCorton Charlemagne 1993, Faiveley\n\nA Grand Cru, white burgundy by Faiveley that one hardly ever sees on the dinner table. One sip made me sit up. Corton Charlemagne Grand Cru 1993, Domaine Faiveley. I should have known.\n\nGolden colour, very rich aroma of very ripe oranges and mixed nuts - the aroma of a very complex old white. On the palate, a big deep wine, very rich, intense and concentrated. Beautifully balanced, a gorgeous wine. Almost voluptuous.\n\nA great white wine leaves me in greater wonderment than a great red. I think the extraordinary almost out-of-the-world flavours that a great mature white wine produces are more complex, more unusual, even sublime and rare, than those from a great mature red. Or mainly because they are much rarer than reds?\n\nChateau Haut Brion Blanc 1993\n\nThe Everest of the Graves Blanc brigade, and at the mature age of 20 years! Light golden colour, an aroma of orange peel and hay, atypical of Haut Brion Blanc. Very concentrated flavours, mixture of very ripe fruit and great acidity.\n\nA very different flavour from the Chardonnay-based white burgundies. In Chardonnays, the aroma and taste remind of a blend of citrus fruit, mainly very lush ripe oranges, with a mixture of nuts, mainly almonds and peanuts, enveloped in a \"bright\" shining acidity.\n\nIn contrast, white Graves, especially the big guns, give me the impression of a \"cooler\" acidity, not rapier-sharp as in white burgundy. Must have something to do with the \"free radicals\"!\n\nThis Haut Brion Blanc was a splendid example of Grand Cru white Graves at its best. This is a rare wine - both in quantity and in its super-star price. Readers should take heart from the very fine white Graves now being produced by the likes of Domaine de Chevalier, Pape Clement, Smith Haut Lafitte, Malartic Lagraviere, and Latour Martillac.\n\nThese are well worth trying; they are inexpensive in comparison to Haut Brion Blanc and La Mission Haut Brion Blanc, the new name for Laville Haut-Brion.\n\nBeaune Greves 1er cru Vigne l'Enfant Jesus 1997, Bouchard Pere et Fils\n\nIt is not often that Cote de Beaune reds appear on Singapore tables. Perhaps, they are not much seen on wine merchants' lists here. Or not in any demand? More likely the latter. So the opportunity to taste one, and a mature one at that, was most welcome.\n\nA mature red showing the brownish tints of age. Soft ripe fruity nose, very pinot character - whiff of very ripe red berry fruit. A wine with very ripe fruit, very well balanced and very pleasant to drink but lacks complexity. Apart from that, it was actually very good!\n\nMusigny Grand Cru 1994, Comtes de Vogue\n\nNineteen years old and showing this in its dark brown-red colour. A very fine \"pinot\" aroma, fresh and delicate, aroma of red berries which was reflected on the palate but I thought there was insufficient ripeness although very good acidity salvaged the otherwise poor impact. An interesting example of the 1994 vintage in Burgundy, where it rained during harvest and diluted the acidity but not the ripeness. Perhaps this wine might have shown better when it was younger, say at 10 years' age.\n\nRichebourg 1999, Gros Frere et Soeur\n\nThe big guns now.\n\nVery dense, dark red colour, virtually black-red. Hardly any brown tints even at the edges. A beautiful, very fine aroma, a blend of blackcurrant sweetness combined with lovely acidity and good balance. The taste was a mixture of very ripe fruit, mainly very fresh oranges blended with a mixture of nuts, mainly cashews and almonds. Very complex indeed, but so good! At top maturity and a fabulous drink.\n\nGros Frere et Soeur is the third member of the Jean Gros family who trace their origin in Burgundy to Alphonse Gros, who settled in Vosne-Romanee in 1830 after marrying Madame Latour. From this family came Domaine Jean Gros, founded by his great-great-grandson Jean Gros in 1963. Hence, Domaine Jean Gros. Gros Frere et Soeur was formed by two of the fourth generation of the Gros family! And it is one of Jean Gros's children, Bernard, who is the winemaker for Gros Frere et Soeur. Tracing the history of the wine-making families in Burgundy is tougher than doing a jigsaw puzzle!\n\nA remarkable family though, now into its fifth generation!\n\nA disclaimer needed: I am involved in the distribution of Domaine Bonneau du Martray's wines\n\nCorrection:\n\nLast week, I wrote: \"d'Alba and thus has a commanding view of the valley below and the mountain range in the distance.

These will make up about 8.4 per cent of the post-IPO total issued share capital of 571.15 million shares. The market cap on listing will be some $685 million.\n\nThe group yesterday also said that it had secured Genting Strategic Investments (Singapore) as a strategic investor.\n\nThe wholly owned subsidiary of Genting Berhad - the investment holding and management company of Genting Group which also owns palm plantations in Malaysia - plans to subscribe for 47.85 million of the offer shares. Part of these will come from the over-allotment option.\n\nGenting also has an option to subscribe for up to 10.75 million shares at the offer price any time from the listing date till six months after.\n\nLinc Energy's oil and gas assets, which generate the bulk of its profits, are in the Gulf Coast region, Wyoming and Alaska in the United States.\n\nThe first two are already producing, while the last is still in exploration stage.\n\nIt has 2P (proven plus probable) oil reserves of 168 million barrels.\n\nThe group also holds licences to more than 65,000 contiguous square kilometres in the Arckaringa Basin in South Australia that has been found to be rich in shale reserves.\n\nThe firm intends to spend about US$10 million in capital expenditure next year to develop the shale block, its managing director Peter Bond told reporters yesterday.\n\nFor a start, it will drill six vertical wells, and will then look for a partner to bring the project forward.\n\nA partnership in the form of a joint venture or other forms of investment can \"unlock the value\" of the asset, said Mr Bond.\n\nThe firm also owns underground coal gasification technology, which involves burning coal while it is still in the seam and capturing the gas for use in power generation or feedstock in liquid fuels, fertilisers or chemical products.\n\nOf the $47.9 million to be raised (assuming no over-allotment), about $18.8 million will be used for its conventional oil and gas business.\n\nSome $23.5 million will go towards its clean-energy business, in particular to develop the UCG project in Poland and South Africa, and for other project development activities in Europe, Russia, North America and Asia.\n\nThe rest will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nCredit Suisse (Singapore), DBS Bank and JP Morgan (SEA) are the joint issue managers, bookrunners and lead managers.\n\nLinc Energy's IPO closes at noon next Monday. Trading is expected to start at 2pm on Wednesday.\n\nThe group, which first listed on the ASX in 2006, recorded revenue of A$124.4 million (S$141 million) for the 2013 financial year, and a net loss to shareholders of A$26.7 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHOWARD TAM\n\n47, USA\n\nTechnical director of a medical technology firm\n\nHOWARD Tam applies a simple rule of thumb when deciding whether to buy art: \"I categorise art into three baskets - oh, oh my and oh my god. The oh my god is the top tier.\n\n\"I buy only works that are oh my god. Works that are oh my may slip down the list to become oh; works that are just oh may slip off the list altogether. The oh my god are the ones you should collect.\"\n\nSo far, that strategy has worked like a charm. The pieces belonging to his collection currently on display at Artspace@Helutrans include some extraordinary works such as Sopheap Pich's Buddha, one of only three in the world.\n\nThe famous Cambodian rattan sculpture comes apart in its bottom half, as a symbol of how goodness and humanity unravelled under the Khmer Rouge rule, which the artist witnessed as a child.\n\nMr Tam says: \"There are two things I think about. First, whether the work has a deeper political, social and religious meaning. Second, how does that work fit into the artist's entire body of work? Does it represent a progression? Or is he just producing more of the same?\"\n\n\"Oh my god\" artworks seldom come cheap, and Mr Tam has seen his budget for each work rise from US$20,000 in 2005 to around US$100,000 these days. He has amassed some 250 pieces of mostly South-east Asian artists that include the Who's Who of the art world, such as Filipino Ronald Ventura, Indonesia's Handiwirman Saputra and Malaysia's Yee I-Lann.\n\nMr Tam is clear about one thing, though - he doesn't buy art to speculate. Even though several of the works have seen their value rise, he's never sold a piece.\n\nOne day, the American hopes to loan or donate them to museums in the United States which he feels need greater exposure to South-east Asian art.\n\nHe says: \"To collect art for investment's sake would be rather foolish. You'll get burned because you never know when the tide will turn. Artists who may be hot right now may collapse in two years. And art is not liquid - not like stocks or real estate.\"\n\n\"There are wiser ways to spend your money,\" he notes. \"Collecting art requires genuine passion.\"\n\nFinal word of advice:\n\n\"I have very few Singaporean artists in my collection. Historically, I've been very cynical about Singaporean artists. I generally found the works derivative ... And even among many Singapore collectors, I noticed there wasn't strong interest in local art.\n\n\"But in the past 10 years, I've seen a lot of progress. The young generation of Singapore artists are producing some really good works, so I recommend that collectors look at Singapore art now.\n\n\"My picks include Robert Zhao, Donna Ong, Joel Yuen and Jane Lee.\"\n\nPart of Tam's art collection is currently on show at Artspace@Helutrans, 39 Keppel Road, #02-03, Tanjong Pagar Distripark, from now till Dec 15. Opening hours: 11am to 7pm daily. Admission is free. Call 6329-6847 for details.\n\n5 takeaways\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Any tough restructuring of the airline to suit a foreign investor would also weigh on the already fragile coalition government of Enrico Letta. A union representative who took part in the meeting said Alitalia was targeting total cost savings of 295 million euros, with some 128 million euros to be obtained through salary cuts or by freezing pay increases.\n\n\"This whole plan focuses only on cuts, but does not present an industrial perspective for the company nor is there talk of a possible partner,\" said Guido Barcucci, a spokesman for the CGIL union. \"In this form, this is a non-starter.\"\n\nHe said Alitalia proposed to postpone an earlier plan to increase its presence on more lucrative intercontinental routes. Boosting the number of long-haul flights has so far been seen as imperative to turn Alitalia's fortunes around.\n\nManagement and unions will meet again, although no date has been set yet.\n\nThe capital raising, later extended to new investors including Italian businessman Antonio Percassi, is likely to allow Alitalia to keep flying throughout the key Christmas holiday season.\n\nBut with daily losses of around 700,000 euros and net debt of more than 800 million euros, the company could risk having to ground its fleet again within six months, analysts said, unless a strong partner is found.\n\n\"With this fresh capital, Alitalia's problems have been swept under the carpet for a few months, but by summer next year they will reappear,\" a Milan-based analyst said. \"Alitalia needs much more than 300 million euros to revamp its fleet so it can finally start making revenues. Three to four billion euros is more like it.\"\n\nTop shareholder Air France-KLM, which has a 25 per cent stake and had been seen as most likely to come to Alitalia's rescue, was one of several investors to snub the rights offer. The Franco-Dutch group said Alitalia's pledge to make severe cost cuts was not enough to save it without its creditors having to write off some of its debt.\n\nOver the years, other major airlines, including Lufthansa and British Airways, have flirted with partnering the carrier, which offers access to Europe's fourth-largest travel market and flies 25 million passengers a year - but decided it was too much of a gamble.\n\nOn Tuesday, daily la Repubblica said Alitalia and Etihad Airways were in advanced talks on a possible investment by the Abu Dhabi-based airline. Etihad declined to comment. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

It has also spoken to some employers on the matter.\n\nNoting that some dorms were already organising activities for their residents, MOM said it \"has urged vigilance and calm, and to provide workers with reassurance that police investigations are under way and will be conducted fairly\".\n\nChannel News Asia reported that the Dormitory Association of Singapore had issued an advisory yesterday, recommending that its members organise more activities for workers to remain indoors and use the dormitory facilities. They were also told to tell their resident workers to avoid Little India unless for work or business purposes.\n\nThe dormitory association also asked its members to beef up their security by, for instance, increasing operational staff, as well as establishing or activating emergency recall systems.\n\nTo keep foreign workers away from Little India on Sunday, LTA and Public Transport Council (PTC) will temporarily suspend the 25 Little India bus services run by private bus operators. The two bus associations, Singapore School Transport Association and Singapore School and Private Hire Bus Owners' Association, have been informed of the suspension.\n\nIn addition, the police have suspended the sale and consumption of alcohol at Little India and its surrounding vicinity, from 6am this Saturday to 6am next Monday. The suspension of alcohol sales will affect about 374 establishments in Little India and its vicinity, including areas such as Mackenzie Road, Race Course Road, Farrer Park and Petain Road. The affected establishments include liquor shops, restaurants, hotels, pubs, coffee shops and convenience shops.\n\nThe police will also deploy officers to conduct enforcement checks on outlets in the affected areas. Violators would be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000 on conviction and could run the risk of losing their liquor licences.\n\nLittle India will be declared a \"proclaimed area\" under the Public Order (Preservation) Act, where police officers can take action against anyone who consumes alcohol in the area, including seizing the alcohol. The police may also arrest anyone who is drunk and behaving in a disorderly manner under the Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.\n\n\"In deciding the next steps after this weekend, the police will have to carefully weigh these considerations and balance the interests - some of which are competing - of the various stakeholders. Eventually, the police are likely to recalibrate the alcohol ban in a graduated and measured way. Even after we have lifted the alcohol ban, there will in most likelihood continue to be certain restrictions on the sale of alcohol, and certain areas where alcohol consumption will not be allowed,\" said the statement.\n\nBoth the Transient Workers Count 2 and the Migrant Workers Centre will be holding events to celebrate International Migrants Day this Sunday, which they hope will help the workers stay out of trouble.\n\nMeanwhile, four more Indian nationals, aged between 24 and 45 years, were charged in court yesterday for rioting under Section 147, taking the total number brought to the docks so far to 31.\n\nThree of the four men were charged for throwing concrete pieces at police officers. The fourth was charged for rioting with five others and damaging the bus involved in the fatal accident by throwing a dustbin at its front window, smashing the windscreen with a wooden stick and throwing pieces of hardened concrete, bottles and a metal drain cover at the windscreen and windows of the bus. He is accused of overturning and setting alight a police car.\n\nThe four have been remanded for further investigations and will return to court on Dec 19.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nHADY ANG\n\n61, Singapore\n\nDeputy director of a transport-related company\n\nIF you weren't born with a silver spoon in your mouth and you wish to collect art, you may want to follow the footsteps of the Vogels or Hady Ang.\n\nMr Ang, 61, began collecting Chinese antiques in 1979 on his modest civil servant's salary. But, by the 1990s, the prices of Chinese antiques had risen so much that he could not afford them.\n\nSo he turned his attention to South-east Asian art instead and became one of the most avid local collectors of the region's art - amassing under 100 works by the likes of Geraldine Javier, Agus Suwage and FX Harsono.\n\nHis biggest buy is a stunning piece titled Resurrection by Ronald Ventura, which features a Christ-like figure with Asian features painted on a door, bought for an undisclosed sum. He says: \"I have a limited budget, so I have to be very, very selective. And I don't pay for everything at one go - I pay by credit or instalments, and often incur interest charges.\"\n\nBut the interest is worth it, he thinks, because some of his works have seen their value rise substantially over the years - especially the ones he bought before South-east Asian art prices took off in the late 2000s.\n\nMr Ang, who rose through to the ranks to become a deputy director in his company, certainly has advice for novice collectors buying on a budget. He says: \"If you're buying for investment, don't buy $2,000 to $4,000 works, or these so-called affordable art. You'll find that, in most cases, these works will get you nothing in return.\n\n\"Instead, focus on blue-chip artworks by the top 20 artists in the region. If you need to, save up for one expensive work above $10,000 instead of buying three or four cheap works. If you need to, share the costs and risks with a friend.\"\n\nMr Ang says he learnt about the importance of buying only the best in the early years when he was buying only Chinese fineware: \"If you buy an average quality piece and later try to sell it, the good auction houses will not take it and you're not likely to get the kind of returns you hope for.\"\n\nMindful of the huge financial risks of collecting art, Mr Ang focuses on other investments as well, such as property, to finance his passion for art.\n\nIn the early years, when there was little international interest in the Asian art scene, he made it a point to befriend the artists whose works he collects. Today, he counts many famous Indonesian artists like Suwage and Jumaldi Alfi as his friends.\n\nHe plans to hold an exhibition of his collection next year.\n\nFinal word of advice:\n\n\"Look for art with a strong historical context, that give you an insight into the issues affecting the region. That kind of art is more relevant and enduring.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will also open malls in cities including Hai Phong, Can Tho, Da Nang and Binh Duong over the next few years, she said.\n\nVingroup, founded by billionaire chairman Pham Nhat Vuong, will compete with Korea's Lotte Group to add malls in cities other than Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, luring consumers in a country where more than half the population of 90 million people is below the age of 30. The companies are expanding their retail reach as per capita income in the nation is expected to double next year from its 2009 level.\n\n\"Vietnam's consumer market has so much potential,\" Ms Thuy said yesterday in Hanoi. \"It always makes sense to be the first big mall in any big city.\"\n\nOptions for consumers in Vietnam's urban cities outside of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are limited, said Ralf Matthaes, a Ho Chi Minh City-based regional managing director at market research firm TNS.\n\nShares of Vingroup dropped 0.7 per cent in Ho Chi Minh City at open yesterday. The stock has climbed 18 per cent this year, compared with the 22 per cent gain in the VN Index.\n\nVietnam's middle class is growing. The International Monetary Fund estimates per capita income in Vietnam to almost double to US$2,174 next year from US$1,182 in 2009.\n\nLotte Group opened its sixth shopping centre this month in Phan Thiet. The mall, spread over 7,000 square meters, is Lotte's largest retail centre in the country's central region and the first by a foreign company in Binh Thuan province, according to website VietnamPlus, citing the local operator, Lotte Mart Vietnam.\n\nVingroup, which also develops residential properties and operates resorts, will consider malls in cities with population of more than one million. It plans to build shopping centres in Can Tho and Danang by 2016, Ms Thuy said. Vincom Retail, the division that operates the malls, will open its sixth shopping centre in two weeks in Hanoi. The company sold a mall in Ho Chi Minh City earlier this year.\n\nShopping centres can bring in traffic by offering entertainment and dining choices, TNS's Matthaes said.\n\nVingroup has taken note of Vietnamese consumers' penchant to go to malls for food and drinks, says Ms Thuy. Its malls have a higher food and beverage mix than is typical in Southeast Asia and is designed to be an entertainment complex, she said.\n\n\"In Vietnam, the dining culture is big and food and beverage brings in customers,\" she said. \"People go to malls to eat and then shop.\"\n\nThe company opened its Vincom Mega Mall Royal City in Hanoi in July. Vingroup says the shopping centre is Asia's largest underground mall with more than 180,000 square metres of restaurants, shops, a skating rink and a waterpark.\n\nRevenue from Vingroup's malls will reach about US$75 million this year, up from about US$58 million last year, she said. The company plans to begin construction of a megamall in Ho Chi Minh City in the second half of next year, she added.\n\nReal estate leasing accounted for about 16 per cent of Vingroup's revenue last year, according to its financial statement.\n\nVingroup's strategy to increase recurring revenue from its malls and hospitality services is sound, said Dinh Thi Mai Anh, a Hanoi-based analyst at Saigon Securities, which has a \"hold\" rating on the company.\n\n\"It would be good for the group to maintain its stable cash flow when the overall residential sales segment does not show strong performance,\" she said. \"This also eases pressure of debt payments.\"\n\nStill, Vingroup's mall expansion comes as consumer demand cools. Retail sales rose almost 13 per cent in the eleven months through November, the slowest pace since at least 2005, according to government data. Vietnam's economic growth of 5.25 per cent last year was the weakest since 1999. The government forecasts the economy will expand 5.4 per cent this year.\n\nWith the economic slowdown, price-sensitive consumers have turned to traditional mom-and-pop stores and neighbourhood open- air markets for everyday needs, Mr Matthaes said. Sales at shopping malls and other modern outlets increased 11 per cent this year, slower than the 19 per cent pace in 2012, he said.\n\nDevelopers should be considering building more affordable centres that cater to middle class consumers, he said.\n\n\"Everyone's building these five-star shopping malls no one can afford. They should be building two- or three- star malls which would make it affordable for tenants and consumers.\"\n\nVingroup raised money from an overseas bond sale last month as it prepares to boost its mall operations, Ms Thuy said. The company announced in May that Warburg Pincus LLC, the private- equity owner of Neiman Marcus Group, is leading a consortium to invest as much as US$325 million. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

Over the past three years, returns have turned negative; the broader MSCI Emerging Markets Index has been relatively resilient with an annualised loss of 3 per cent, compared with a loss of more than 9 per cent per annum for Latin America.\n\nNot surprisingly, some are raising the question of whether the structural growth story that had long underpinned expectations for emerging assets is finally over. For now, among investment strategists, the consensus view remains in favour of developed markets such as the US and Europe, and to give emerging markets a miss. There are a few reasons for this view, foremost of which is that a tapering of quantitative easing (QE) measures - widely expected by the first quarter of 2014 - would trigger fund outflows and hurt emerging markets. Markets saw a dry run of this scenario earlier this year.\n\nThere are a number of fundamental reasons for negativity in the near term. One is slower growth in China, whose economy is rebalancing towards a more consumption-driven engine. This has had knock-on effects on raw material suppliers such as Indonesia, for example.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

We reckon a healthy long-term growth rate of 1-2 per cent a quarter on the Property Price Index is what the state is comfortable with.\"\n\nChia Siew Chuin, Colliers International's director of research and advisory, does not expect new measures to be introduced, given that the ramifications of existing measures are still being felt in the various segments.\n\nThe most significant event this year was the implementation of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework, whose impact cut across the private residential, as well as the strata-titled retail, office and industrial sectors, she noted.\n\nThe TDSR, which came into effect on June 29, required that lenders consider a borrower's total debt obligations (including other mortgages and loans for cars) before granting a new home loan. The total debt obligations ceiling was set at 60 per cent of a buyer's gross monthly income.\n\nThis followed the seventh round of cooling measures, announced in January, which included lower loan-to-value limits, higher cash downpayments, size curbs on EC (executive condominium) developments, and anti-speculation moves targeted at the industrial sector. Notably, a seller's stamp duty was imposed on the industrial sector for the first time.\n\nGiven the two rounds of measures, Ms Chia described 2013 as a \"a tale of two halves\". The implementation of the TDSR, she said, marked a turning point for the healthy level of sales for strata-titled, non-residential properties which was seen in the first half of the year.\n\n\"To date, TDSR appears to have had the most far-reaching impact on property compared with the previous property-specific measures. Overall, residential prices will end about 2 per cent higher from a year ago and flat over the last quarter. For the most part, developers have been able to hold onto current prices for luxury projects but may be pressured to adjust prices to a competitive level with more projects receiving their Temporary Occupation Permits (TOP) next year,\" said Joseph Tan, executive director, residential, at CBRE.\n\nOn the public housing front, the mortgage servicing ratio (MSR) of 30 per cent curbed demand as buyers were no longer able to afford to upgrade to larger flats with smaller loans.\n\nThis has helped stabilise the HDB resale market, noted Eugene Lim, key executive officer of ERA Realty. In addition, cash over valuation (COV) has continued to fall, with more flats changing hands with no COV or below valuation, he said.\n\n\"HDB resale transactions are likely to remain low for now, but we are hopeful of volumes increasing after the festive period as more buyers come back into the resale market, attracted by the prospects of being able to pick up a property at or below valuation, particularly in the non-mature estates,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nMohamed Ismail, chief executive officer at Propnex Realty, has a more conservative outlook for the HDB resale market.\n\nWith demand sapped by the release of new Build-To-Order (BTO) flats - 77,000 BTO flats were launched in the past three years to quell the voracious demand for homes - the resale market is effectively serving only the upgraders and permanent residents who have attained three- year status now, he noted.\n\nThis, combined with the various rounds of property measures aimed at keeping price growth sustainable, will create a \"balancing effect\" in the resale market, gradually softening price growth to a more sustainable level.\n\nThis year, he expects HDB flat prices to dip one per cent. By end-2014, flat prices are expected to fall by up to 5 per cent as a result of the falling prices of all HDB flats when the 77,000 new flats come on stream, he added.\n\nAgainst this backdrop of multi-pronged approaches to stabilise the market, a number of significant announcements that are expected to have a major long-term positive impact were also unveiled this year.\n\nThese included the freeing up of some 800 hectares of land with the moving of Paya Lebar airbase to Changi, and the unveiling of plans for new housing areas, such as Bidadari, Tampines North, and Punggol Matilda.\n\nThe government has also tried to meet the various housing needs of different groups after satisfying the needs of first-time married couples. Its initiatives include the unprecedented move of allowing eligible singles to buy new two-room HDB flats in non-mature estates, and the pilot launch of Three-Generation (3Gen) flats catering to multi-generation families, which was warmly received.\n\nNovember marked the rolling out of a record 8,952 flats, the largest joint BTO and sale of balance flats exercise.\n\nWith such laudable moves in the public-housing space, Colliers' Ms Chia said she looks forward to equally \"incisive and targeted initiatives\" in the industrial and commercial sectors.\n\nWhat is needed is a more intentional and detailed approach to addressing the different types of business requirements in the industrial and commercial property sectors. This means that the eventual building must meet end-users' needs without ambiguity, said Ms Chia.\n\n\"Should there be a mismatch between the type of real estate formats and the real needs of users, planning efforts will be futile and scarce resources will be wasted,\" she said.\n\nLooking ahead into 2014, the retirement housing sector will be worth keeping an eye on, given Singapore's demographic trends and ageing population, said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see what the take-up will be for the retirement village at Jalan Jurong Kechil that is currently being planned by World Class Land. We could see more of such developments going forward if the project attracts strong buyer interest,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere, Knight Frank Singapore's research head, Alice Tan, said that assuming global economic growth improves, she expects the office sector to make a comeback in 2014 with greater interest from investors and space users.\n\n\"The positive prospects of improving occupancy and rentals with more businesses choosing to set up their operations in Singapore, combined with an improving global market outlook, would provide a boost to the office sector,\" she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This could help it raise US$22 million, assuming all options are exercised.\n\nShareholders also gave the green light for an issuance of capital securities to Saudi Arabia-based offshore oil and gas company Rawabi. Under this agreement, Rawabi will subscribe to US$35.2 million of the capital securities, which can be converted to 800 million shares in Vallianz.\n\nDarren Yeo, CEO of Vallianz, said the strengthening of its capital base through the funding exercise is \"in line with our current plan to deepen our capital structure, including exploring Islamic financing through a sukuk programme\".\n\nIn total, Catalist-listed Vallianz could raise up to US$57.2 million in proceeds, which are intended for future fleet expansion and general working capital.\n\n\"We will look for opportunities to tap Swiber's strong business network by providing long-term charters to third parties while our partnership with Rawabi will enable us to strengthen our position in the Middle East,\" Mr Yeo added.\n\nThe company also received approval at the EGM to diversify its business into sourcing and supplying of vessels and equipment, and additional shipping-related services to the offshore oil and gas industry.\n\nMr Yeo said any new business that Vallianz enters into will be \"synergistic\" with the current businesses of marine asset ownership, leasing and fleet corporate management.\n\nShares in Vallianz closed 1.6 per cent down yesterday at 12.4 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By HELMI YUSOF\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Dec 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMIKE AND LOU SAMSON\n\nBoth 43, Singapore PRs originally from the Philippines\n\nHe's a regional head of a bank, she runs an events firm\n\nTHEY started collecting art in 2000 when they had just moved to Singapore from the Philippines. At the time, they picked mainly colourful, pleasant-looking artworks with little historical or artistic value.\n\nThe turning point came in 2003 when they discovered an emerging group of Filipino artists who were creating art totally unlike what had been produced before in their country. \"The paintings were figurative but austere, photographic-looking but were not photographs. They dealt with dark, urban themes like anonymity, displacement, dislocation - themes that frankly connected with us because we were expatriates in Singapore and we had both spent a few years studying in American universities before moving here,\" says Mike Samson, one half of the collector couple. \"The Philippines is a Catholic country,\" adds his wife Lourdes, or Lou for short. \"Very few people wanted to buy these works because the subject matter was so taboo. We bought them at low prices because the artists didn't have an audience yet.\"\n\nBut as it turned out, top auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's had also been closely watching the groundbreaking artists, which include Geraldine Javier, Nona Garcia and Yasmin Sison.\n\nAnd when the two houses began to introduce their artworks in regional auctions, the prices \"exploded\", says Mrs Samson. \"Many young art collectors were exposed to the same things that we were exposed to, and saw what we saw. So the works were snapped up and the prices shot up.\"\n\nThe \"accidental collectors\" admit that they were just \"buying art that we liked\". But their personal collection now boasts some 300 works by South-east Asian headliners like Jose Legaspi, Natee Utarit and Mariano Ching - not to mention, Garcia, Sisson and Javier.\n\nMr Samson says: \"The lesson we learnt is, buy art from your own generation, because that's how you get the best works as well as a snapshot of your time.\n\n\"In the early years, we were buying - beside decorative art - art by famous artists from our parent's generation. But we quickly realised that we couldn't buy these artists' best works because they were (a) expensive, (b) already in our parent's generation's collections, or (c) in museums.\n\n\"So we focused on artists who were in the same age group as us. And that's worked out for us.\"\n\nFinal word of advice:\n\n\"Buy what you like; buy with your eyes, not your ears, because people will tell you stuff, but you should go with your heart. Also, art is very hard to sell, so if you're buying for flipping potential, it's a bad idea,\" says Mr Samson. Because artists of the likes of Garcia and Javier have gone up in value, the Samsons recommend looking at good Filipino artists whose prices are still in the affordable ranges. They are Lyle Buencamino, Norberto Roldan and Luis Santos.\n\nPart of the Samsons' art collection is currently on show at Artspace@Helutrans, 39 Keppel Road, #02-03, Tanjong Pagar Distripark, from now till Dec 15. Opening hours: 11am to 7pm daily. Admission is free.\n\nCall 6329-6847 for details.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But for now, there are better trades to be made in developed markets like Japan and Europe.\n\nSchroders' head of emerging market equities Allan Conway said in a note: \"The short-term outlook remains uncertain, so we believe it is too early to get super-bullish.\n\n\"Even though we would not rule out further weakness in the near term, a strong global emerging-markets rally at some point in 2014 is quite possible. Moreover, we are confident that returns over the next three years or so will be substantial, both in absolute terms and relative to developed markets.\"\n\nHe added: \"An expanding emerging-market middle class continues to drive strong consumption, and fixed capital investment is growing due to the still-low levels of capital stock per capita. So in our opinion, the structural story remains intact.\"\n\nPascal Blanque, chief investment officer of asset manager Amundi, also sounded a word of caution about it being too early to enter emerging markets. He told The Business Times: \"Most global portfolios are overweight in emerging markets, so it is too soon . . . We are neutral in our global asset allocation.\"\n\nHowever, he warned against throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Amundi is positive on China stocks in the energy and telecommunications sectors and some banks, he said. Other than China, he said he had no emerging country preference, but that investors could look at technology and export-led sectors because these will drive growth.\n\nAlain Bokobza, head of global asset allocation at Societe Generale cross-asset research, said in a briefing yesterday: \"Do not catch a falling knife until taper.\"\n\nValuation measures show emerging-market equities have plunged from a 20 per cent premium to developed-market equities in the peak years of 2008 and 2010 to more than a 20 per cent discount now.\n\n\"There will be a time when cheap is cheap enough,\" he said, adding that he may make a \"buy\" call in the second quarter of 2014 or when emerging- market equities trade at a 30 per cent discount.\n\nBut there are still political uncertainties in the year ahead to paralyse decision-making, he said, citing the Indonesian elections in April, Indian elections in May and Brazilian elections in October.\n\nMarket strategists urged investors to be selective and to go only for emerging-market stocks with strong economic fundamentals.\n\nIf the US starts slowing down its financial-asset purchases next year, liquidity could flee emerging markets in a repeat of what happened in the middle of this year. India, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia and Turkey - the so-called \"Fragile Five\" - experienced sharp selloffs because of their current-account deficits; the Indonesian currency is the worst-performing Asian currency this year, said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin.\n\nPersistent current-account deficits in poorer countries are viewed as threatening their ability to repay their creditors. A current-account deficit can be caused by a country importing more than it exports (meaning it is uncompetitive), or having a low savings rate relative to what it invests.\n\nHot foreign money flowing into investment projects can lead to asset bubbles. A bursting of such a bubble can cause companies to default on their debt, as was the case during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Similar fears after the US hinted at tapering its financial-asset purchases, together with slower expected growth in these economies, caused the \"Fragile Five\" to slide.\n\nBut Schroders' Mr Conway pointed out that these countries represent only 30 per cent of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. China, Korea, Taiwan and Russia - with their large current-account surpluses - represent half the index and were relatively unaffected by the post taper- fear selloff, he said.\n\nSimilarly, SocGen's Mr Bokobza said some countries are more vulnerable than others to a Fed taper. \"Before stock picking is country picking,\" he said. Emerging markets have learnt their lesson since the Asian financial crisis and have much lower debt-to- GDP ratios now, he said.\n\nBut this is still not yet the time to buy China assets, he said, even though they are looking \"super cheap\" at 11/2 times book value, versus four times four years ago.\n\nObservers have hailed China's recent Third Plenum policy meeting - which pledged a \"decisive\" role for markets - as a game changer. But for Mr Bokobza, China is losing competitiveness even as wage growth remains in double digits.\n\nLiberalisation of markets will lead to competition from foreign companies, which shrinks profit margins. China is also not devaluing its currency to become more competitive, unlike Japan.\n\n\"I don't buy a dream. I buy facts,\" Mr Bokobza said.\n\nHe said eurozone equities are still attractively valued amid an economic recovery, and Japanese equities are set to soar again next year if its central bank announces even more money-printing for the market. A devalued yen will make Japan's exporters more competitive. The cost of currency hedging is not material, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are sheltered coastal areas of water where salvors can take a ship in difficulties and carry out emergency repairs and cargo transfers.\n\nMr Muller said that taking a ship to a place of refuge \"carries some risk of pollution to the nearby coastline if the condition of the ship gets worse, but that risk is even greater in the open sea or at a more dangerous coastal location\".\n\nHe continued: \"The problem is that too many states refuse to accept their obligations and refuse to grant a place of refuge. Our members have frequently had to battle the authorities to find a safe place to bring a casualty.\"\n\nThis issue has been in news again recently. One reason for that is the outcome of the Prestige trial in Spain, where denial of a place of refuge was a central factor.\n\nConvicted for disobedience\n\nTanker owners body Intertanko's reaction was probably typical of that of the wider shipping industry. It said the tanker industry had cause to celebrate that, 11 years after the event, the master of the Prestige, Apostolos Mangouras, and the vessel's chief engineer Nikolaos Argyropoulos, had finally been acquitted by the Spanish courts of criminal damage to the environment. But it was deeply disappointed at his criminal conviction for disobedience.\n\nAlso acquitted was Jos\u00e9 Luis L\u00f3pez Sors Gonz\u00e1lez, former head of Spain's merchant marine department - which means the Spanish state will not be held responsible for the disaster. The courts failed to find anyone guilty of directly causing the disaster in November 2002 when the laden tanker Prestige broke up and sank off the Spanish coast, spilling some 50,000 tonnes of oil.\n\nIntertanko noted that Captain Mangouras was forced by the Spanish authorities, against his judgement, to take a series of actions that resulted in the damaged tanker being taken out to sea in appalling conditions.\n\nThere are more recent examples of salvors being unable to take casualties to places of refuge. At Monday's press lunch, Mr Muller said: \"Last year, for example, the containership MSC Flaminia suffered a severe fire in the eastern Atlantic. Salvors stabilised the situation but then had real difficulty bringing the vessel into a European port. Likewise, the Stolt Valor, a chemical tanker that suffered a fire, was refused entry to numerous ports in the Middle East.\"\n\n\"The frustration,\" he said, \"is that there is already a helpful framework of international and regional regulations that effectively require states to offer a place of refuge to a casualty. We know it is politically difficult to voluntarily allow a damaged ship into home waters but the alternative - as was seen with the Prestige - can be serious pollution over a much wider area.\"\n\nA couple of months ago, ISU published a position paper on the issue and started discussions with the shipowners' International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and others to explore ways of making progress on this issue.\n\nIn the paper, ISU says it wishes to see wider adoption by coastal states of simple, robust, \"single-point\" command-and-control models similar to the UK's, where an industry expert known as the Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP) takes all the decisions.\n\nYesterday, in London, ISU's executive committee discussed the issue with the UK's SOSREP. Today, an alliance of ISU, ICS and the International Union of Marine Insurance (IUMI) is to have a meeting to plan how to convince coastal states of the need for a system that provides places of refuge and, ultimately, protects their coasts.\n\nIt is hard to be optimistic, given the track record, but this is a cause that deserves general support. It is in nobody's interest to let another Prestige disaster happen.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investors from the Middle East to Asia splurged, buying everything from multi-million-pound mansions to apartments in Battersea and the City of London.\n\nThat's driving prices beyond the reach of many British buyers and sparking a development surge that's increasingly dependent on non-British investors buying homes before they are completed.\n\nSouth Asian buyers account for two-thirds of new London homes sold before completion, according to Land Securities Group, the largest British real estate investment trust. The high-end market is dependent on pre-sales to overseas buyers to help get development finance and deal with rising land costs, Michael Lister, a lecturer at University of Westminster, said in a Nov 22 interview.\n\nThe market \"only needs a bit of an international hiccup for the buyers to hold back, and then you're really stuck\", said Mr Lister, a former head of British property lending at Bank of Ireland plc. \"You can't possibly afford to sell to the domestic buyers because they can't afford to pay those figures.\"\n\nPopular\n\nBattersea Power Station Holding raised a \u00a3790 million (S$2.7 billion) syndicated loan to develop and refurbish the first phase of the site after it pre-sold about US$1 billion of apartments and townhouses in May, the company said in a Nov 21 statement. The record of pre-sales was reflected in the terms of the financing, it said.\n\nChancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced the new capital-gains tax in a statement to Parliament on Dec 5. It will apply to \"future gains\" after the tax goes into effect in April 2015, he said without specifying the size of the levy. Capital-gains tax rates for second homes of British residents currently range from 18 per cent to 28 per cent.\n\nLuxury-home developers plan to build more than 20,000 properties in London with a value of about \u00a350 billion in the next decade, Mark Farmer, head of residential property at consulting firm EC Harris LLP wrote in a Nov 25 report. As well as a strengthening pound, the developers face rising building costs and a risk that investors will grow weary of repeated sales exhibitions, he said.\n\n\"You'll see softening in pricing, at the bottom end of the luxury-housing market,\" Mr Farmer said. Investors will remain interested though they will \"drive a harder deal\". EC Harris defines the lower-end of the luxury homes market as \u00a31,250 to \u00a31,700 a square foot.\n\nIn central London, about 28 per cent of home buyers in the two years to June didn't live in Britain, according to broker Knight Frank LLP. That rises to about 49 per cent for new homes. In Greater London, 10 per cent to 15 per cent of new homes are bought by non-residents, Knight Frank estimated in October.\n\nSingapore and Hong Kong, two destinations also favoured by south Asian buyers, have introduced measures to cool property prices and curb speculation. Singapore linked borrowers' maximum debt levels to their incomes and raised transaction and capital-gains taxes. Hong Kong has increased minimum down payments six times in fewer than three years and in February doubled stamp-duty taxes for all properties over HK$2 million (S$323,000).\n\nTransactions in Hong Kong will probably drop as much as a third this year compared with 2012, Knight Frank estimated. In Singapore, home-price declines accelerated in October from a month earlier to 1.2 per cent.\n\nThe frequency of changes to property-tax law and the possibility of further levies are also seen as a hindrance to homebuyers from abroad. Mr Osborne raised a transaction tax known as stamp duty to 7 per cent from 5 per cent for properties priced at more than \u00a32 million in March 2012.\n\nMansion tax\n\nLabour Party leader Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, head of the Liberal Democrats, which govern in a coalition with Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party, support an annual levy on houses valued at more than \u00a32 million known as the mansion tax. Mr Cameron opposes the idea.\n\n\"The government had a chance to review property taxes in 2012 and they fudged it,\" Rob Perrins, managing director of homebuilder Berkeley Group Holdings plc said in a telephone interview. \"Our real concern is that the government will keep playing around and changing the tax every six months. Property is a long-term acquisition and people deserve to know where they stand.\" About 30 per cent of Berkeley's customers are foreign, Mr Perrins said.\n\nThe capital-gains tax will affect prices at the lower-end of the prime central London homes market where \"speculators\" who didn't intend to live in the properties are more involved said Alex Michelin, a founder of luxury developer Finchatton Ltd. \"It's not going to switch off the tide. The marginal investor will say 'this no longer makes it as attractive for me and I will stop doing it'.\" The tax won't affect the super-prime market, he said, as buyers there are more likely to live in their homes. Super-prime homes are valued at \u00a35 million or more, according to broker Savills.\n\n\"It's not an unfair tax. It brings London in line with Paris and New York,\" Mr Michelin said. \"This is just trying to say we want to make it fair for everyone.\"\n\nThe tax also may result in falling land values on the fringes of London's prime areas as developers wait to see the tax's effect on overseas buyers, he said. Residential land rose almost 14 per cent in those areas in the year through September, twice the rate of prime homes, according to Knight Frank.\n\nStill, some say London will always be appealing. \"It is a place where people's homes will never be taken away from them,\" said Gary Hersham, a joint managing director at luxury broker Beauchamp Estates LLP. \"There is no political risk in this country, there's no security risk in this country. Aside from this you get good education, you've got decent people and it's a safe place to live.\" Economic growth is increasing more rapidly than previously expected, Mr Osborne said last week. That may affect property investors from abroad more than the new tax as it puts pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates, boosting a pound that has already been rising.\n\nThe pound plummeted against a basket of major currencies after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings, making London homes a relative bargain for wealthy investors and buyers from emerging Asian economies. The Singapore dollar gained 60 per cent against the pound from September 2007 to June this year and the Malaysian ringgit climbed by 50 per cent. Since then, the pound has risen 6.8 per cent and 12 per cent respectively against the Asian currencies.\n\n\"One of the key drivers around demand in that market, particularly from the Far East, has been the relative weakness of sterling over the last three or four years,\" said Mr Farmer of EC Harris. \"The improving economy is good for UK Plc but it might make residential investment slightly less competitive or good value in the eyes of the international community.\" - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/fb4ad17f431a78b053a055db8d35074b3fd8f0e05a0c7a1bb5011bcaa506611d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Snapped up: Battersea Power Station Holding raised a \u00a3790 million syndicated loan to develop and refurbish the first phase of the site after it pre-sold about US$1 billion of apartments and townhouses in May. -\u00a0PHOTO: BLOOMBERG"}]}

Others, however, wanted to see even more tightening of the EP criteria so that Singapore can further reduce its reliance on foreign manpower, and pay more attention to grooming local talent.\n\nDuring the Budget debate, Acting Manpower Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said that further adjustments will be made to the EP framework to tighten eligibility requirements for EP holders. These adjustments were announced in September by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) under what it called the Fair Consideration Framework (FCF), which said that the qualifying monthly salary for new EP applicants will be raised to $3,300 from $3,000 from 2014 onwards.\n\nCompanies will also have to prove that they have tried to hire Singaporeans first before they are allowed to apply for an EP to recruit a foreigner. This affects firms with more than 25 employees which are hiring for posts that pay less than $12,000 a month.\n\nMany contributors to Reach had voiced frustrations over the unfair hiring practices of some companies which they said favoured foreigners, and questioned the dominance of foreigners in industries such as banking and IT. The FCF was therefore welcomed by many, although some also pointed to \"loopholes\" which they said employers could exploit - such as offering low salaries that would be unattractive to Singaporeans, so that jobs can still eventually go to foreigners.\n\nApart from manpower, transport and population matters also captured the attention of Singaporeans. Discussion channels saw sustained chatter over the high Certificate of Entitlement (COE) prices, and general public transport woes. Many also voiced unhappiness over the Population White Paper's estimate of a 6.9 million population by 2030.\n\nOverall, Reach received more than 43,000 feedback inputs up to November this year. Of these, 4,300 were related to manpower issues while the topics of transport, and population and immigration, received 2,900 and 2,800 inputs, respectively. Reach gathers feedback online and through face-to-face conversations, dialogues, forums and focus group discussions.\n\nSaid Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for Health and Manpower and Reach Chairman: \"The public's feedback, views and suggestions through Reach, as well as those raised at OSC (Our Singapore Conversation) sessions and through various government agencies, have contributed to significant policy changes announced over the course of the year.\n\n\"In the coming year, Reach will keep the conversation going between the Government, the community and the people as we embark on a new chapter in the Singapore story. We will continue to reach out to various segments of the population to get their views on various policies and national issues. We will do so via our face-to-face dialogues and forums, as well as via our online platforms.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is another key milestone for both retail and institutional investors seeking diversified multi-asset exposure through the Singapore market.\"\n\nThe new indices come just months after global index provider Markit introduced the Markit iBoxx SGD family of benchmarks, which were touted as the first to comprehensively track the Singdollar corporate debt market.\n\nThomson Reuters said that two factors set its indices apart. In terms of comprehensiveness, the new indices will cover more than 80 per cent of the current Singdollar bond universe by market capitalisation, and it is the only family of benchmarks to provide five years of historical data.\n\nTimely and independent pricing is also a key selling point, especially for a market that is largely traded over the counter and for which transparent and accurate pricing can be challenging to obtain.\n\n\"It's very transparent in terms of how the indices are computed, and these are based on specific time of market fair value of these bonds, which is superior to what you would normally refer to as either the composite or contributed prices, which typically can be quite out of date,\" said Sanjeev Chatrath, managing director of financial and risk in Asia-Pacific and Japan for Thomson Reuters.\n\nHe said that no products are using the new indices out of the gate, but he expects the market to quickly find uses for the new indicators.\n\n\"It's relevant to a num-ber of different market participants, whether you are a fund manager, ETF (exchange traded fund) provider, retail investor, what have you,\" he said.\n\nMr Chatrath said that with Singapore's bond market growing to more than $120 billion outstanding principal amount over the past 10 years, and with new issuance hitting a record $26 billion in 2012, there is now enough critical mass to attract investor demand for better market tracking.\n\n\"The growth in Singapore has been very, very strong, and somewhere in that time continuum, in our mind, I think the need has arisen more, and we are having more and more client discussions,\" he said.\n\nAmong the main Singapore bond index funds at the moment are the ABF Singapore Bond Index exchange-traded, which tracks the iBoxx ABF Singapore Bond Index, and the db x-trackers II iBoxx ABF Singapore Government UCITS exchange-traded fund, according to data compiled by SGX.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Shares of the carrier are trading on Nasdaq under the symbol \"AAL\".\n\n\"We will now have a network that can get customers everywhere they want to go. Because of that, we have more ability to compete for corporate customers,\" said Scott Kirby, the former president of US Airways who has that role at the new American.\n\nCorporate customers can spend three times as much as leisure travellers, making them a lucrative segment for airlines. Mr Kirby said that corporate accounts could bring in \"hundreds of millions of dollars\", adding that New York was a prime example of an area where American could make corporate customer inroads and compete better with rivals such as Delta Air Lines, which offers an international network as well as domestic shuttle service for business passengers.\n\nThe combination will enable the new American Airlines to combine the former American's international route map with US Airways' shuttle service, Mr Kirby said. \"We'll now eliminate that competitive advantage and be on a level playing field with both Delta and United competing for corporate customers.\"\n\nAt its Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters, American marked the merger with a ceremonial bell-ringing to open trading on Nasdaq. \"American has a tremendous legacy and knows what it feels like to be the best,\" chief executive Doug Parker, who had held that title at US Airways, said.\n\nAmerican Airlines, once the largest US carrier, had fallen to third place behind United Continental Holdings and Delta, both of which used Chapter 11 to cut costs. For years, American's higher cost structure had put it at a disadvantage. \"In order to compete satisfactorily with Delta and United, it needed the additional destinations and the additional frequency that US Air will bring it,\" Robert Crandall, the former AMR Corp CEO said.\n\nAMR declared bankruptcy in November 2011, citing high labour costs, and eventually reached cost-saving contracts with its three primary unions, including its pilots, after bitter negotiations.\n\nThe new American Airlines Group has annual revenue of about US$39 billion based on figures last year. It has a solid presence on both US coasts and on North Atlantic routes, given American's revenue-sharing joint venture with British Airways and Spain's Iberia. The new carrier has hubs in Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Washington, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

A 112 basis point jump since May 9 pushed the credit-default swaps past those on British Airways, which lost its S&P investment grade in 2009.\n\nQantas expects to lose as much as A$300 million (S$342 million) in its first half, forcing the airline to either take on debt, issue shares or sell assets to pay for new planes. An internal review looking at divestments, and a proposed sale-and-leaseback arrangement for its fleet, have heightened the uncertainty, according to Westpac Banking Corp.\n\n\"If they can't see a way to a competitive position, then selling assets isn't a positive move,\" Brendon Cooper, head of credit strategy at the bank, said by phone from Sydney. \"There's not a lot of protection for bondholders if Qantas sells off businesses and planes.\"\n\nQantas last week announced 1,000 job cuts and a A$2 billion cost-cutting programme to compensate for a decline in domestic ticket prices that's driving losses as it seeks to retain market share amid a challenge from Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd.\n\nThe company's shares dropped to a record low yesterday, touching 95.5 Australian cents intra-day and falling for a sixth straight session.\n\nThe more aggressive behaviour of Virgin has changed Australia's domestic aviation market, S&P credit analyst May Zhong wrote in the Dec 6 opinion reducing Qantas's rating to BB+. The Sydney-based carrier had a monopoly on full-service domestic flights for a decade until Virgin quit its budget airline roots by adding business class seats in 2011.\n\n\"Virgin Australia has become a more formidable competitor,\" in part thanks to its \"well-capitalized shareholders\", Ms Zhong wrote. \"The profitability of Qantas' domestic operation is key to the group's competitive position and long-term viability.\"\n\nThe S&P downgrade leaves Qantas at the rating company's highest junk rating, with a negative outlook. Moody's on Dec 5 put Qantas's Baa3 rating, its lowest investment grade, on review for a possible downgrade.\n\nQantas, one of just four airlines globally with any investment-grade rating, is the only one of 11 global carriers whose default risk has risen this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe downgrade will probably push up the rate on Qantas's syndicated loans by about 50 basis points, Anthony Moulder, an equity analyst at Citigroup in Sydney, wrote in a Dec 6 note to clients.\n\nQantas had A$6.08 billion in net assets and a gross A$7.32 billion in aircraft and engines at the end of June, according to its latest annual report. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The younger Mr Chan said earnings have been lumpy over the years with HFE historically focused on turning troubled companies around.\n\n\"Our goal now is to re-engineer the company to focus on an ongoing, recurring business because we recognise that the lumpiness that we have created in our historical P&L (profit and loss) statement is not conducive for a listed company,\" he said.\n\nHFE recorded a loss of HK$36.3 million (S$5.85 million) for the six months ended Sept 30, 2013, an improvement from the loss of HK$45.3 million the year before.\n\nFurther, Asian markets such as Singapore, Hong Kong and China are becoming riskier with higher costs, local cooling measures and uncertainty over interest rates. Meanwhile, the US property market is still on the upswing, Mr Tony Chan said.\n\nHFE also plans to raise capital for the company and the Reits under its management through listings on other exchanges. Among those considered are Singapore, London and the United States.\n\nThe company has taken the first steps in its new direction. It is in the process of buying 100 homes in Texas by the end of 2013 for a US-listed vehicle to be renamed American Housing Reit. The plan is to grow this number to 300 homes by the end of next March.\n\nAmerican Housing Reit, in which HFE owns 94.9 per cent, will focus on single-family homes and is expected to have an annual yield of 8 per cent. The first payout is slated for the quarter ending next March.\n\n\"We are actually able to pay at maturity yields right off the bat,\" Mr Tony Chan said, as the Reit will not buy a home without an acceptable tenant in place.\n\nIn the quarter following that first distribution, the Reit is likely to raise capital by issuing new shares in the US market, with a view to moving from its current over-the-counter listing to the Nasdaq Global Market by the end of financial year 2015.\n\n\"The plan is once we are able to pay out our first dividend and demonstrate the viability of the model . . . we can then raise money for that Reit vehicle,\" said Mr Tony Chan.\n\nMr Chan Heng Fai said \"our hope is ultimately we will be diluted to one per cent\" interest, as the Reit raises more capital to invest in more homes as it becomes increasingly successful, which feeds back into management fees for HFE.\n\nHe also has a bold vision for the parent company. \"I think this will be definitely the number one fastest growth company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in the next five years.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The award applies to vessels scrapped in the years 2013 through 2015.\n\nChinese shipbuilders also stand to benefit from the subsidy, half of which is awarded only after replacement orders are placed.\n\n\"The programme will be positive for the shipbuilding sector in the long term,\" said Lawrence Li, a Shanghai-based analyst at UOB Kay-Hian Holdings. \"In the near term, it may not be material for the shipping industry, as the incentive is not attractive enough and many cash-strapped shipping firms may not be able to place new orders amid a bad market.\"\n\nUnder the programme, ship operators get half the money upon completing scrapping and the rest after placing new building orders, according to the statement. By comparison, under a 2010 rule, they had to complete scrapping and place new ship orders before getting any of the subsidy.\n\nThe programme is \"somewhat disappointing\" as it didn't lower the age requirement for ships that can be scrapped, which means less tonnage is eligible, according to a note published yesterday by Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Davin Wu.\n\nThe Baltic Dry Index, the benchmark for commodity-moving rates, has slumped 41 per cent in the past four years. The monthly index that tracks prices for all types of vessels dropped 31 per cent in November from its peak in September 2008, when the global financial crisis caused orders to slump, according to Clarkson Plc, the world's biggest shipbroker. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Equity valuations are said to be reasonable - at least relative to bonds - and earnings are forecast to be robust. Since central banks are not expected to start hiking interest rates any time in 2014, stocks should therefore do well. The big question is - which markets to buy?\n\nThe majority of expert recommendations favour Western markets, the main reason being that after five years of recession these economies are recovering and are possibly gaining upward momentum. Credit Suisse for example, expects US growth to rise from 1.6 per cent in 2013 to 2.6 per cent next year and growth in the eurozone to rise from -0.3 to 1.2 per cent. Schroders said it expects 8-10 per cent US earnings growth and an upside of 10-15 per cent for US large-cap stocks, whilst its positive view on Europe is based on diminished risks of a banking failure and a European Union break-up.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects the US Federal Reserve, under new chair Janet Yellen, to lower its unemployment threshold from 7 to 6 per cent before it begins raising interest rates, which suggests the first US rate hike would only occur in early 2016, thus pointing to a positive climate for stocks.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

Though growth shows signs of easing, this is in no way bad news for China, which needs to redefine its model and focus on achieving slower, more sustainable growth.\n\nInvestments were also on the low side last month. The statistical bureau said fixed-asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, grew 19.9 per cent year- on-year in the first 11 months of this year, compared to an increase of 20.1 per cent for the first 10 months.\n\nIndustrial output increased 10 per cent in November from a year earlier, down from the 10.3 per cent growth recorded for October. This figure is largely in line with estimates, and not a real concern for analysts, who say the world's second largest economy is benefiting from better global growth and on its way to transitioning.\n\nThe biggest drag came from non-metal and ferrous metal manufacturing and the private sector. The automobile sector performed the best; its growth accelerated to a 19-month high of 20.3 per cent, up from October's 18.2 per cent.\n\nRetail sales expanded 13.7 per cent year-on-year in November, picking up from 13.3 per cent the month before. This was probably the result of the marketing campaign around Singles' Day on Nov 11, when e-retailers notched up unexpected takings.\n\nExports were another bright spot for China in November, with gradually recovering demand from Europe and the US powering a 12.7 per cent year-to-year expansion.\n\nInflation fell to 3 per cent during the month, well under the official target, signalling no imminent need for authorities to tighten monetary policy.\n\nMany economists had expected the rebound registered in the third quarter to run out of steam towards the end of the year, but figures published over the weekend and yesterday point to the recovery continuing into the new year. This leaves manoeuvring room for the central bank to continue tightening credit and space for the government to plough ahead with its awaited reforms.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch economists Lu Ting, Zhi Xiaojia and others wrote in a report: \"Today's data could be either market neutral or slightly positive.\"\n\nThey added that the figures might raise expectations for stronger growth in the current fourth quarter, while \"the structure of the economy seems to be improved towards consumption\".\n\n\"Overall, the November data indicates a largely-stable growth momentum in the fourth quarter, in line with our current GDP forecast of 7.7 per cent,\" said Yao Wei, an economist with Societe Generale.\n\nThough a short-term decline in investment will be a drag on future growth, it is in fact in line with the government's plan to move the economy to a model less dependent on investment.\n\nEconomists expect the Chinese economy to stabilise at around 7 per cent and maybe lower, as domestic demand gradually assumes a more prominent role. The challenge for the Chinese economy will be to make a transition without dampening growth by too much.\n\nGovernment leaders have begun their annual Economic Work Conference, a three-day closed- door event which usually concludes with a lengthy statement on the fiscal and monetary policy stance for the coming year. Some expect the 2014 growth target to be leaked, though this is traditionally announced at the Parliament session in March.\n\nEconomists have predicted the government will lower the growth target once more from 7.5 per cent to 7 per cent - a strong signal that the transition process in underway. The lower target is designed to leave Beijing with more breathing room to implement reforms, with the slower rates associated with the new economic model.\n\nCapital Economics analysts Mark Williams and Wang Qinwen said: \"Efforts to meet a 7.5 per cent target would probably lead to faster credit and investment growth, and thereby deepen China's structural problems.\"\n\nThis year, the conference will also provide an opportunity for the leadership to lay out next year's reform priorities, after having hailed the role of the market during the Party Plenum this month.\n\nAnalysts expect to see the first concrete measures from the Plenum blueprint, which includes an urbanisation plan, a deposit insurance scheme, tradable certificates of deposit and the establishment of private banks.\n\nThey also expect some movement on the fiscal front with another expansion of the VAT to cover new service sectors, as well as pilot programmes liberalising the one-child policy and the hukou system, which is the system of registering households as \"urban\" or \"rural\".\n\nAs a sign of the leaders' commitment to reform, new performance standards were issued this week for local officials. They will be assessed not just on their region's growth rate, but also on resource and environmental costs, debt levels and work safety.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Don't even try to do better than average, because you probably won't succeed. That's the crux of the argument for using these funds to capture overall market returns, and it's based on decades of academic research - including the work of Eugene F Fama, one of the finance professors who received the Nobel Prize in economic science yesterday.\n\nNobel or not, Mr Olstein is far from convinced. To the contrary, he says the rise of index funds is part of a trend towards sloppy investing - a willingness to follow the herd, to rely on momentum in a rising market.\n\n\"It's like saying mediocrity is OK - that it's more than OK; it's the best that anyone should hope for,\" Mr Olstein says. \"It's saying a guy like me can't beat the market - that he shouldn't even bother trying. That's wrong! It really ticks me off. I can beat the market. I have beaten the market.\"\n\nAnd, in fact, he has - not every year and certainly not every week or every quarter, but over the long run, which, in his case, started in September 1995.\n\nThat's when he founded the Olstein Financial Alert fund, now known as the Olstein All Cap Value fund. From its inception through November this year, including fees, his flagship fund returned 10.7 per cent, annualised. That's more than 2.4 percentage points better than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and substantially better than comparable small-cap indexes.\n\nIt's also slightly better than the comparable performance of shares of Berkshire Hathaway - a company headed by another value investor, Warren E Buffett. Berkshire returned 10.3 per cent, annualised, during that same period, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nIt hasn't all been smooth sailing for Mr Olstein. \"I've made mistakes,\" he readily acknowledges.\n\nHis particular approach relies on skills that he says are \"practically extinct\". They were honed as an auditor with the old Arthur Andersen & Co and then, in the 1970s, as co-author of The Quality of Earnings, a financial newsletter that shed light on the murky areas of corporate accounting.\n\nWhile he is aware of macroeconomic trends, he takes a bottom-up approach that isn't very fashionable these days.\n\n\"On Wall Street, so many people are basically just momentum investors, looking for growth and following whatever is trending up,\" he says. \"The market is becoming a casino. I don't play that game. I care about specific companies and whether they are good buys at their price, and if they are, we'll hold on to them.\"\n\nMr Olstein looks for stocks that are underappreciated and that are strong in a metric he has always favoured: \"free cash flow yield\". (It is cash, after subtracting capital expenditures and working capital, divided by market capitalisation.)\n\n\"Cash is king,\" he says. \"That's what you're paying for when you buy a stock - the ability to generate cash. But few people even bother with it these days.\"\n\nHe says he prefers \"boring companies\" - if their free cash flow excites him. One such company is John Deere, the agricultural equipment maker. He estimates that its free cash flow yield is about 7 per cent, a very high level, and that it's likely to grow to 10 per cent over the next three years.\n\nIts recent prices have been depressed by temporary phenomena like poor weather and low corn prices, which have slowed worldwide equipment purchases. Over the long haul, though, with global population swelling and demand for food increasing, Mr Olstein says, the odds are good that Deere will rise in price. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Bond returns in the region are poised for their first annual loss in five years.\n\nUS currency securities have fallen 0.3 per cent since Dec 31, set for their first 12-month decline since 2008 when they lost 14 per cent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. There haven't been any US dollar bond sales in Asia since Dec 5, the longest lull since the five business days through to Nov 14, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors are weighing the timing of any cuts to the Federal Reserve's monetary support amid budget negotiations in Washington. China's trade surplus widened last month to the most in more than four years as exports exceeded estimates, a sign that global demand is helping sustain a recovery in the world's second-biggest economy.\n\n\"Fed tapering is in the mind of issuers as well, and they would like to price deals before the tapering announcement, if possible,\" Shankar Narayanaswamy, the Singapore-based head for credit strategy at Standard Chartered plc, said yesterday. \"Issuance will be strong in the first quarter of 2014.\"\n\nFed policy makers will probably begin reducing the US central bank's US$85 billion-a-month of bond purchases at a Dec 17-18 meeting, according to 34 per cent of economists surveyed earlier this month by Bloomberg, an increase from 17 per cent in a November poll. Last month, 53 per cent predicted tapering in March, compared with 40 per cent in the more recent survey.\n\nFed Bank of St Louis President James Bullard, who votes on policy this year, said in a speech on Monday that the odds of tapering bond purchases have risen along with gains in the labour market, and any reduction should be modest to account for low inflation.\n\nChina State Shipbuilding Corp issued an US$800 million note on Dec 5, while Baoshan Iron & Steel Co, the nation's largest listed steelmaker, sold US$500 million of debt and Pacnet Ltd, a US$350 million debenture. Dollar offerings almost tripled to US$2.65 billion last week, the highest amount since the five days through Oct 25, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nChinese issuers now represent the single-largest geographical component of JPMorgan Chase & Co's Asia Credit Index, accounting for some 25.8 per cent of the benchmark by weighting, equivalent to US$115 billion, Moody's Investors Service said in a Dec 4 report.\n\nThe cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment fell yesterday, according to credit default swap traders.\n\nThe Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan declined two basis points to 132 basis points as at 8.16am in Singapore, Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc prices show. The gauge is falling for a third consecutive business day and is poised to close at its lowest level since Nov 29, according to data provider CMA.\n\nThe Markit iTraxx Australia index also decreased two basis points to 101.5 as at 11.07am in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp prices show. The measure is set for its lowest close since Dec 2, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.\n\nThe Markit iTraxx Japan index fell one basis point to 74.3 as at 9.08am in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc prices show. The benchmark, which has ranged from 74 to 148.1 this year, is set for its lowest close since May 22, according to CMA.\n\nCredit default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.\n\nThe swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt agreements. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

That was the highest period since 2011, when equity capital markets raised US$24 billion.\n\nIPOs raised US$4.9 billion, a 29.1 per cent increase over all of 2012, on the back of a number of real estate investment trusts (Reits).\n\nBut it was largely a front-loaded affair, as demand for equities hit a peak in May. The Straits Times Index (STI) rose to a close of 3,454.37 that month, before the prospect of a tightened US monetary policy by the Fed forced a market correction.\n\n\"This has been a fantastic year for IPOs,\" said American Appraisal Singapore managing director Srividya Gopalakrishnan.\n\nOn the M&A front, the numbers were more muted. Announced M&A deals involving Singapore companies totalled US$36.3 billion - a 39.1 per cent decline and the lowest annual volume since 2009, when activity slowed to US$22.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nBut part of that slowdown was due to the lack of 2012's massive jostling for Fraser and Neave and Asia Pacific Breweries. A closer look at the numbers suggests a relatively robust scene in Singapore, Mr Sivitilli said.\n\n\"What stood out was that the number of deals was also up in Singapore, compared to Asia and the rest of the world, where the number of deals fell,\" Mr Sivitilli said. \"This is an indicator that Singapore's M&A activity is more broadly based, so it's on a strong footing going into 2014.\"\n\nTrusty support\n\nReits and business trusts were Singapore's equity- deals story of 2013. Reits accounted for $3.1 billion, or 63.4 per cent, of the total IPO volume. Real estate targets were also the largest contributor to total year-to- date M&A volume in Singapore, accounting for $8.5 billion, or 23.3 per cent, of total volume.\n\n\"Singapore continues to be the favoured trust listing exchange in Asia, as the jumbo US$1.3 billion Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust listing clearly demonstrated,\" said Matthew Song, HSBC's head of equity capital markets for South-east Asia.\n\nAfter slowing down in the latter half of the year, the Reit pipeline is expected to pick up again in 2014.\n\n\"Going into 2014, barring any unexpected shocks, we expect the pipeline of Reit and business trust IPOs to continue for the early part of the year at least, offering attractive yield play to investors' portfolios,\" said OCBC head of corporate finance Tay Toh Sin.\n\nInteresting rates\n\nNews that the US Federal Reserve was considering tapering its buying of bonds hit the headlines in June, turning into one of the biggest market-moving events of the year.\n\nThe strong Reit turnout in the first six months of 2013 \"was in line with the theme in the first half of 2013 as investors looked for yield prior to any potential tapering by the Federal Reserve\", HSBC's Mr Song said. \"As we went into the second half of the year, we saw an increase in market volatility and the withdrawal of institutional funds from the emerging markets on the back of a potential increase in rates and weakening local currencies across the South-east Asia region.\n\n\"As a result, institutional investors became more selective in yield products and shifted their focus back to growth from a bottom-up analysis.\"\n\nJPMorgan's Mr Sivitilli said US central bank policy will continue to affect volatility in the year ahead, but he sees Singapore as relatively resilient.\n\n\"The Fed's QE (quantitative easing) drove down yields for risk, and Asia is typically a higher-risk environment, so Asia will be more susceptible to volatility from tapering. Big, well- capitalised Singapore players could use tapering as an opportunity to strike, whereas companies more reliant on the market for capital to support M&A could be stymied.\"\n\nBrighter skies\n\nIndustry insiders are expecting a better year ahead for deals.\n\n\"The deal value in the pipeline, based on current open offers made, is close to US$3 billion, and a significant part of this could materialise in the first quarter of 2014,\" American Appraisal's Ms Srividya said.\n\nThe IPO market is also drawing strong foreign interest. Indian regulators now allow domestic companies to list overseas without having to first list on a domestic exchange. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has also established a direct-listing framework with China that could reopen the S-chips pipeline.\n\n\"Going forward, we could see more Indian issuers looking to access the Singapore trust market,\" Mr Song said. \"Some of the postponements - such as the US$500 million Sports Toto Malaysia Trust IPO and the US$500 million MMI Technology IPO - could also potentially come back to the market in 2014, given the right macroeconomic conditions.\"\n\nBesides Reits, oil-and- gas-related businesses are also hotbeds of deal activity.\n\n\"We are seeing investors inclined towards capital-growth stocks, particularly in the oil-and-gas sector with spillover effects into the OSV (offshore supply vessel) segment, and possibly commodities sector,\" OCBC's Ms Tay said.\n\n\"Given a bullish outlook in these sectors as well as an acceleration of global GDP growth, we expect a strong pipeline of IPOs next year from such companies seeking to tap liquidity.\"\n\nCross-border M&A transactions could also pick up.\n\n\"The pace of asset divestiture by multinationals in Asia Pacific has increased in recent years,\" Mr Sivitilli said.\n\n\"MNCs have divested assets for various reasons including change in country/ region strategy, repaying government aid, operational challenges, company strategy. Singapore and Asian companies will continue to be on the prowl for more know-how, technology, and natural resources.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the US, Barclays' top overweight stocks for 2014 are the \"Big Four\", namely Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Schlumberger and Weatherford International.\n\nBarclays' top picks in the European oil services segment are Technip, Subsea 7 and Wood Group, with the first two firms' record backlogs and strong growth outlook driven by an above industry average acceleration in subsea spending.\n\nBarclays expects growth in E&P spending in North America to rise more than 7 per cent to US$199 billion (led by the US), and expects continued growth in international markets (up 5.7 per cent at US$524 billion), particularly in the Middle East, Latin America and Russia.\n\nIn its survey of more than 300 oil and gas companies worldwide on their spending intentions next year, Barclays found that spending in India, Asia and Australia is projected to post modest growth in 2014 (up 3 per cent year on year) on solid spending increases from Petronas, Pertamina and ONGC. But this will be partially offset by declines from Inpex and Santos. Chinese national oil companies (NOCs) are planning mostly flattish spending.\n\nOn the flip side, the Middle East, Latin America and Russia will show the fastest growth, with the Middle East being the fastest-growing oilfield services market at more than 14 per cent in 2014, led by Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Oil Company.\n\nAccording to Barclays, companies are basing their 2014 spending plans on oil prices of US$98 per barrel for Brent and US$89 per barrel for WTI and US natural gas prices of US$3.66. \"These projections suggest our early look at 2014 spending levels may underestimate total spending given current commodity price levels.\"\n\nThe bank also highlights two worrying trends which could have a significant impact on global oil markets. Firstly, increased pressure from shareholders on US mid-sized E&P companies and majors to improve cash returns in the short term is leading to slower spending growth, which could have repercussions on production growth. \"We think this underinvestment by the oil majors (forecast growth of just 2.9 per cent in 2014) will lead to a period of underproduction and could drive a structural leg-up in international oil prices.\"\n\nSecondly, Barclays sees the ongoing corruption investigations in China targeting high-level government officials at various state-owned enterprises (SOEs) as leading to a stagnation in companies, such as PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC. This explains the more modest 3 per cent growth projection for the Chinese SOEs compared with 14 per cent growth in 2013.\n\nIn the offshore rig space, Barclays expects continued bifurcation in the global floater market as more than 100 floating rigs are delivered through 2015, hence its preference for high-specification, ultra-deepwater pure plays including Ocean Rig and Pacific Drilling.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They are meant to encourage businesses to think more broadly and to consider all potential sources of value when explaining value creation.\n\nOng Pang Thye, head of audit at KPMG in Singapore, said of the newly launched framework: \"It is time to move business reporting beyond a mere discussion of past financial performance.\n\n\"Businesses can struggle to communicate their progress in developing and protecting their prospects through traditional reporting. The final version of the framework can prove an effective tool for businesses looking to shift their reporting focus from short-term financial performance to long-term shareholder value creation.\"\n\nImportantly, rather than just being yet another report for already compliance-burdened companies, an integrated report may be prepared in response to existing requirements and may be a standalone one or included as part of another.\n\nChen Voon Hoe, accounting advisory leader at PwC Singapore, said: \"As doing business becomes increasingly complex, the challenge is to communicate more relevant and useful information instead of increasing the volume of information.\"\n\nMr Ong added: \"Building narrative reporting around the business model to explain how the business has been developed should be especially attractive to management teams hoping to expand their investor dialogue beyond short-term earnings.\"\n\nThe IR Framework was developed with the input of over 350 responses from businesses, accounting bodies and investors around the world, following a public consultation exercise that ran from April to July, and also with the input of IIRC's pilot programme participants.\n\nDBS Bank managing director and head of tax & accounting policy Mikkel Larsen said: \"As the first listed South-east Asian company to participate in the IIRC pilot programme, DBS has been very active in providing comments on the draft framework and highlighting some of the important practical issues we experience when adopting the framework. We find the framework useful in articulating our integrated business strategy, specifically on how we incorporate the considerations of our multiple stakeholders and how we create value for them.\n\n\"It is important that the integrated report does not become another report both at the risk of not receiving the right focus and the extra cost. At DBS, we have chosen to make it part of our annual report rather than preparing a separate report. Our focus is on articulating how our strategy creates value in the short and long term to our investors, and also how our corporate governance and risk management structure are linked to our strategy.\"\n\nAs for whether integrated reporting will truly take off, Mr Chen said: \"What is clear is that companies are responding to the need for an evolved corporate reporting framework. However, there are challenges to overcome as the benefits (when) compared to the costs will be more obvious to some companies compared to others, depending on the industry, the type of business and their stakeholders.\n\n\"The jury is still out on whether the success of integrated reporting will depend on the promise of better share valuations and cheaper access to capital or the need for more regulatory guidance.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All three companies are controlled by Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, and both ThaiBev and TCC Assets hold stakes in F&N as a result of a successful takeover by Mr Charoen at the start of the year.\n\nThe group as a whole is \"highly leveraged\", mostly due to TCC Assets' debt burden as a result of the F&N takeover, S&P stated. While acknowledging that Thai-Bev and F&N had substantially stronger cash flow and considerably lower debt than the consolidated group, S&P nevertheless argued that ThaiBev's financial performance and funding prospects could not be entirely dissociated from the group.\n\n\"The large debt-funded acquisition of F&N by the common majority shareholder of TCC Assets and ThaiBev suggests, in our view, a significant shift in financial policy and a heightened risk tolerance that affected the entire group structure, with both entities simultaneously leveraging their balance sheets significantly,\" S&P wrote.\n\n\"We believe that TCCA's likely high debt burden and the subordinated nature of its debt has the potential to lead to more aggressive financial policies at ThaiBev and influence ThaiBev's financial performance, debt-servicing capacity, and financial policies to an extent.\"\n\nS&P also noted that F&N and ThaiBev could generate cross-selling synergies in their beverage operations, but expected those benefits to take time, \"in light of the slow build-up of synergies from ThaiBev's recent acquisition of a majority stake in Thailand-based soft-drink producer Serm Suk Public Co Ltd\".\n\nSome equity analysts that cover ThaiBev, however, felt that the rating downgrade may reflect changes in S&P's rating criteria more than they did changes in ThaiBev's fundamentals.\n\n\"The gearing issues probably went to a max when they bought F&N,\" CIMB head of research Kenneth Ng said. \"What has happened since then is they have received some cash from F&N, and meanwhile their spirits business is still cash generative, so they're still clearing the gearing issues. At this moment while we're unlikely to see a big change, it's already past its worst.\"\n\nShares of ThaiBev closed at 47.5 cents yesterday, lower by 3.1 per cent or 1.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The group said that, excluding property, it managed to maintain its gross margin at 15.4 per cent with the help of tight cost controls.\n\nBut profit from operations dived 76.4 per cent to $542,000. This was mainly due to higher expenses, offset slightly by improved advertising income. Distribution and selling expenses, as well as other expenses grew because of a higher number of book fairs and increased advertising and promotion expenditure from the Gadgets & Write Fair.\n\nFinancial income edged up but financial expenses climbed, resulting in profit before tax falling 72.6 per cent to $713,000.\n\nA 14.5 per cent drop in income tax to $776,000 failed to keep the group from slipping into the red.\n\nNo dividend was recommended for the period, the same as a year earlier.\n\nFor the half year, profit attributable to equity-holders fell 36.4 per cent to $5.3 million. Earnings per share for the six months was 0.65 cent, down from 0.98 cent a year ago.\n\nPopular said the global economic outlook could weaken consumer sentiment and property sales in Singapore could be impacted by the cooling measures.

The ministers will meet again next month to work on the TPP agreement, which Trade and Industry Minister Lim Hng Kiang suggested is within sight.\n\nThe TPP, an ambitious trade pact that goes beyond a traditional free trade agreement, is being negotiated by Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States and Vietnam. These countries make up 40 per cent of the global economy. Other countries may join the pact later.\n\nOnly days earlier, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Japan broadcaster NHK that Singapore was hopeful of a TPP deal before the end of the year, despite the complexity of the issues involved.\n\nMr Lim told reporters yesterday that deadlines are seldom met in trade pacts, but they help to sharpen the negotiators' focus on completing them.\n\nThe TPP had already missed an earlier deadline, the one set for 2012 by US President Barack Obama.\n\nYesterday's joint statement, read out by US Trade Representative Michael Froman, said the ministers have \"identified potential 'landing zones' for the next majority of key outstanding issues in the text\".\n\n\"We will continue to work with flexibility to finalise these text issues as well as market access issues,\" it added.\n\nMr Lim explained that the \"landing zones\" referred to trade-offs whose identification would help make it easier for a deal to be concluded.\n\nAccording to Mr Lim, the TPP covers 29 chapters, each covering a \"topic\", such as state-owned enterprises or intellectual property rights. Some \"seven to eight chapters\" are fully agreed upon and \"closed\". Most of the others are more or less completed but still need cleaning up because of some technical issues.\n\nOnly \"seven to eight\" chapters remain \"big issues\" that have been holding up a deal. They include market access - in particular the opening up of Japan's car and farm markets - and patent issues, especially on medicines.\n\nThese chapters still need \"substantial work\" but could be fixed over \"the next few weeks or months\", according to Mr Lim.\n\nAustralia's chief trade negotiator, Chris Decure, said the 12 countries are \"very determined\" to see the TPP take off and become a model for a 21st century trade pact.\n\nTim Groser, New Zealand's Minister of Trade, said the TPP trade talks have built up a strong momentum to push through a deal. This is why, according to Japan's Senior Vice-Minister Yasutoshi Nishmura, the ministers are meeting so soon to take advantage of it,\n\nMr Lim said Singapore has yet to conclude an FTA with Canada and Mexico. With a TPP deal, it would have one with them. For the other TPP countries which are already Singapore's FTA partners, the TPP will yield more benefits because it covers more than traditional FTAs.\n\nHe said the TPP will also be \"complementary\" to the limited global trade pact which the World Trade Organization managed to seal last week. The WTO multilateral trade deal will be able to tackle tougher issues that regional and bilateral FTAs can't tackle, such as export subsidies for agricultural products.\n\nBut he also cautioned against the \"spaghetti bowl\" effect that could complicate trade when there are too many FTAs with too many rules of origins. \"We've got to ensure there's coherence and that the rules of origin converge rather than diverge.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A vast majority (94 per cent) of large and mid-cap companies have a dedicated investment relations (IR) office or officer responsible for the IR function.\n\nThe survey was conducted to better understand the role of investor relations in modern corporations.\n\nHosted by IRPAS and SMU, and supported by the Singapore Exchange (SGX), the inaugural Investor Relations (IR) Roundtable was held yesterday. A high-level panel of professionals from the investor relations, academic and investment communities discussed the results of the survey as well as shared their insights on IR best practices.\n\nThe survey found that the main challenge faced by investor relations officers (IROs) was communicating with institutional shareholders.\n\n\"In an increasingly competitive business environment where investors are faced with multiple investment options, effective and timely communication is crucial to an organisation's reputation and valuation,\" noted Harold Woo, president of IRPAS. \"(Social media) is an emerging trend, but it's something that's new to corporations.\"\n\n\"It's good to monitor dialogue to see what people are talking about. But on social media, they expect instant response, and corporations have to be mindful about disclosure. Social media can go viral; once something is said, it's very hard to retract.\"\n\nIRPAS was established in 2006 as the professional body for IR practitioners in Singapore. It aims to champion IR best practices, enhance the professional competencies of IROs and elevate the overall standard of the IR profession in Singapore.\n\nThe organisation offers programmes such as the Certificate in Investor Relations, training courses and opportunities for the IR community to meet and share best practices to equip IROs with the expertise and network to thrive in today's fast-changing environment.\n\nSaid SGX CEO Magnus B\u00f6cker: \"A well-executed investor relations programme ensures that companies are better positioned to compete for the attention of investors both in Singapore and globally.\"\n\n\"I think there's no one- size-fits-all,\" Mr Woo said of the different IR practices of various firms.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All of us will probably lose about 30 per cent of our business,\" he told The Business Times at the meeting.\n\nBT was invited to the meeting by IRAS president C Sankaranathan, who is CEO of The Banana Leaf Apollo restaurant along Race Course Road, where Sunday night's incident took place.\n\nThe restaurateurs said that the root causes of the riot needed to be addressed before confidence could be restored among people who patronise the area.\n\nHarikrishnan Muthusamy, adviser to the IRAS, reckoned that part of the problem lies with these workers congregating in big groups in the area.\n\nThe existence of such an enclave can give rise to herd behaviour, he felt, as the actions of one or two individuals may lead others to follow suit.\n\nOthers at the meeting felt that their patrons might feel intimidated by the large groups of foreign workers who congregate in the vicinity on Sundays, and the government should look into managing these crowds better.\n\nThe proliferation of liquor shops in the area is another problem, said Mr Rajmohan, who believes that the availability of cheap alcohol sold by vendors who open till late makes it easier for the workers to get intoxicated.\n\nThis sentiment was echoed yesterday by Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew, who is MP for the ward in the Moulmein-Kallang GRC. Mr Lui said that he had been seeking curbs on alcohol sale there for a while, because he was concerned about the proliferation of liquor licences.\n\nWhen BT visited the area yesterday afternoon, several groups of foreign workers were consuming large quantities of alcohol in liquor shops and along footpaths.\n\nOne of these outlets, Kudai Canteen, a popular watering hole of foreign workers on Sundays, sported a sign saying that consumption of alcohol was prohibited on its premises after 11.45 pm.\n\nBusinesses in the area told BT that the alcohol consumption problem is worse on Sundays as the foreign workers tended to drink until the late hours of the night.\n\nOne liquor store owner told BT that his business more than trebled on Sundays. \"On normal weekdays, I can make slightly less than $1,500 of sales but on Sundays I can easily reach $4,500,\" said Krishnan Raju of Tasmac Mart on Chander Road.\n\nHe added that this was driven by sales to foreign workers and that business was so brisk on Sundays that he has had to turn them away so that he could shut his shop at 11 pm.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The remaining four were released yesterday as police investigations showed they were not involved in the fracas.\n\nSeparately, the police yesterday told reporters that they had arrested eight more Indian nationals in connection with the incident, and listed the actions they would take to beef up security in Little India and beyond.\n\nBesides the charge of rioting between 9.20pm and 10.45pm near Race Course Road on Dec 8, the 24 were yesterday accused of hurling hardened cement at the police officers at the scene.\n\nIf found guilty of rioting, they could each face up to seven years' jail, and possibly caning as well.\n\nThe four individuals freed yesterday were two Bangladeshis, one Singapore permanent resident and one Indian national.\n\nIn Court 26 of the Subordinate Courts yesterday, the 24 accused, dressed in red long-sleeved jerseys, appeared solemn as the charges were read out to them in the Tamil language by a court interpreter. One of the accused had a bandage around his head.\n\nThe court ordered them to be remanded for a week to facilitate further investigations. They will be back in court on Dec 17.\n\nA representative of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme (CLAS), lawyer Amarick Gill, told the court yesterday that it was willing to provide pro-bono legal representation to the accused and will secure lawyers for this.\n\nThe court then heard from the prosecution that the Indian High Commission was also looking into facilitating legal representation for the 24 of its nationals involved in the case.\n\nThe judge then directed CLAS to work with the High Commission to prevent a duplication of resources.\n\nThe Indian High Commissioner to Singapore, Vijay Thakur Singh, told The Business Times yesterday that contact had already been made with CLAS; discussions on the lawyers to be called in will be held.\n\nA minor altercation on the matter of representation for the workers unfolded outside the court yesterday.\n\nAs Mr Gill was speaking to reporters outside the court room, social activist Vincent Wijeysingha joined in the group and asked Mr Gill whether the Singapore Law Society, which runs CLAS, was taking the case, or had it been asked by the Ministry of Home Affairs to do so in a bid to block lawyer M Ravi from representing the accused.\n\nA verbal exchange ensued between the two in front of reporters.\n\nBesides announcing the arrests of the additional eight, the police said more security cameras will be installed in the area; police presence will be stepped up, not just where the riot took place but also in areas where foreign workers congregate, such as Geylang and Golden Mile along Beach Road.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yes, the benchmark Straits Times Index has held steady but overall volumes have plunged, reflecting a major loss of trading interest over the past two months.\n\nAnd this is largely due to the collapse in the erstwhile most vibrant segment of the market: sub-dollar counters. Much of this has had to do with the fortunes of several highly active stocks such as Blumont, Asiasons and LionGold, which had run up too high and too fast, and far ahead of their fundamental valuations.\n\nA sudden selldown and subsequent sanctions imposed by the Singapore Exchange effectively spooked the market and sent players scurrying for cover, not just from these counters but most other actively traded penny stocks as well. The net effect has been to turn this segment of the market into a virtual ghost town.\n\nThere is some logic to the argument made by many market insiders that sentiment might have gradually recovered - perhaps not for the stocks which were at the epicentre of the collapse but for some subsequent statements regarding the penny stock market by key people within regulatory circles.\n\nAnd the most impactful was probably that made by SGX chief executive Magnus Bocker, who asked whether the bourse should allow stocks that are traded at a few cents, and then answered in the negative. This has raised the spectre of enforced share consolidations or delistings. But really, when it comes to valuations and pricing, it is best to let the market decide.\n\nWhile the cynicism over penny stocks after the recent events is understandable, just wiping them off the bourse may not be the solution for a market such as Singapore, where the appetite for these counters has traditionally been strong. A few rotten apples should not be allowed to spoil the whole bunch.\n\nBut there is another factor that needs to be borne in mind. And it is that the penny stock market is often the \"incubator\" market for young companies - local and regional - trying to raise funds and grow. Many come with promising businesses and ambitious plans. By taking away this market - be it main board or Catalyst - one is effectively slamming the door on a critical avenue for their fund raising.\n\nSingapore, with its abundant liquidity, strong regulatory regime and standing as a financial centre, has attracted many of these companies. They should be encouraged to flourish, albeit under appropriate regulation. An important first step after the recent fiasco would be to announce the outcome of the month-long Monetary Authority of Singapore investigation. Uncertainty and opaqueness is the market's worst enemy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The incident, if one-off, is also unlikely to shake business confidence in Singapore - although the perception of risk may inch up a notch and the government response would be watched closely.\n\nThese views came a day after a 400-strong mob of mostly South Asian nationals set vehicles alight and hurled glass bottles at police and rescue officers following a traffic accident at Little India on Sunday night in which a private bus had knocked over and killed a 33-year-old Indian national.\n\nThe riot, the first here in four decades, shocked Singaporeans and led Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday to direct the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to convene a Committee of Inquiry (COI), which will look into the factors that led to the unrest and how the incident was handled on the ground.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWhat's moving the markets?

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/tablet-any-pocket", "site_title": "A tablet for any pocket", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nA tablet for any pocket\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Dec 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHIS Christmas, if you are an Apple fan looking for the latest-model tablet, you would have two choices: the iPad Air or the smaller iPad Mini, both with Retina display. Except for the difference in screen size and price, both tablets are essentially the same in specifications and performance.\n\nLife gets more complicated if you are looking for a Samsung tablet; you'd be spoilt for choice.\n\nIf you are on a budget and looking for a cheap device, you could pick up the 7-inch Galaxy Tab 3, whose base model has a list price below $300. And if you want the latest and greatest, you could go for the Samsung Note 10.1 (2014) edition, which starts from $798.\n\nIn between, you have a number of other options such as the 8-inch version of Galaxy Tab 3, whose base model comes in at around $468. And if you are a Note fan but you want a small tablet instead of a phablet, you could take a look at the Galaxy Note 8-inch ($588). Finally, if you want a 10.1-inch tablet but don't fancy the S-Pen features of the Note 10.1, you could opt for the LTE version of the 10.1-inch Galaxy Tab 3, which costs $748 (the Note 10.1 LTE version costs $998).\n\nIt's obvious that Samsung's go-to-market strategy is dramatically different from its arch rival Apple; there's a good reason for that.\n\nApple is content to position its brand as premium option in the tablet market place. It has been hugely successful in this, thanks to its excellent eco-system. However, the real growth area in the tablet space is in the low- end tablets, mostly in the smaller, 7-inch form factor. This is an area crowded with a number of little-known Chinese brands as well as some more established international ones. And every one of these tablets runs on the Android OS (operating system), which is also used by Samsung.\n\nAs a result, the aggressive Korean behemoth's strategy is to have a presence in all segments of the market with offerings with different specifications and price points.\n\nThis strategy seems to be working for the Korean company.\n\nApple is still the No1 tablet vendor in the world but Samsung is fast catching up. Consider the third quarter 2013 tablet sales numbers from IDC. In this quarter, Samsung sold 9.7 million tablets for a global market share of 20.4 per cent, while Apple shipped 14.1 million tablets for a global market share of 29.6 per cent.\n\nContrast this with the figures for Q3 2012. Apple sold 14 million tablets for a 40.1 per cent market share, while Samsung sold 4.3 million for a 12.4 per cent market share. Note that Apple's unit shipments have remained almost the same but Samsung saw a big jump, and this jump came from the cheaper lower- end tablet space where Apple does not have a presence.\n\nSo how do the Samsung tablets stack up?\n\nWhat is common to all its tablets is that they have expandible memory slots. Putting a microSD slot in its tablets (and phones) has been a hugely successful move by Samsung. A customer could spend less to buy a model with less internal memory and then add cheap memory through the microSD slot. The other common feature is the Samsung TouchWiz interface, which it slaps over the Android OS. Despite many refinements and added functionality, TouchWiz is still a bit clunky, and this results in a bit of a stutter now and then in even the most powerful models, such as the Note 10.1.\n\nAs expected, the 7-inch Tab 3's biggest plus is its affordability. Apart from that, the latest model has a smaller bezel and hence its overall dimensions are smaller than last year's version. However, its nearly 9.9mm profile makes it one of the clunkiest tablets in the market. It has a relatively poor screen resolution of 1024 X 600 pixels and sports an older version of Android, the 4.1.2 Jelly Bean. Despite these negatives, the tablet does what Samsung intended it to do - that is, provide a branded alternative to the grey market tablets that are available at similar price points.\n\nThe Tab 3 8-inch is a polar opposite of its one-inch smaller sibling. At 309.1 grammes, it's comfortable to hold one-handed, and comes in at just 7.36mm in thickness. With slim bezels, it has a premium look and feel. The tablet sports a 1,280 x 800 (WXGA) TFT LCD panel, and the resolution makes for a great viewing experience. Images and text are perfectly crisp, and colours look vibrant. It runs on Android 4.2 Jelly Bean OS. It is among the best smaller tablets in the market.\n\nThe Tab 3 10.1-inch comes with the same display resolution as the Tab 3 8-inch (that is, 1,280 x 800). However, on a bigger screen this reduces pixel density, which means the 10.1-inch is not as sharp as the 8-inch. The Tab 3 10.1, at 510g is significantly lighter than its predecessor and it's about 2mm slimmer, measuring just 7.95mm thick. Despite all that, the Tab 3 10.1-inch is essentially a slightly souped-up version of last year's Tab 2 10.1 and a cheaper alternative in the full-size tablet space, and it shows.\n\nThe Galaxy Note 8-inch and the Galaxy Note 10.1-inch are follow-on devices to Samsung's incredibly successful phone-cum-phablet, the Galaxy Note 3. As with the phone, the standout feature of both devices is the S-Pen. Interestingly, the S-Pen and the various features that it enables has led to extreme opinions regarding its usefulness or otherwise, both among technology journalists as well as common users; you either love it or hate it.\n\nSuffice to say that it helps Samsung to distinguish its products from other devices in the market and going by sales, at least of the Galaxy Note 3, it seems to have done well.\n\nThe Note 8 runs on a 1.6GHz quad-core Samsung Exynos 4 Quad processor with 2GB of RAM. This makes it a smooth performer, especially since it runs on Android 4.2. The device's 1,280 x 800 resolution in an 8-inch form factor makes it a standout device in terms of display sharpness.\n\nFinally the Note 10.1 (2014) edition is Samsung's top-of-the-line device and goes head to head with Apple's flagship tablet, the iPad Air. While the iPad Air with its sleek aluminium body looks far more premium than Samsung's 10.1 tablet, this is not to say the latter is any slouch in the looks department.\n\nHowever, on two important fronts, Samsung's tablet scores over its rival: the presence of a microSD slot, and a higher screen resolution. Despite having a bigger 10.1-inch display to the iPad Air's 9.7-inch, the former has a sharper screen with a 299 pixels per inch (ppi) count to the iPad's 264 ppi.\n\nIt's open to debate which of these two tablets is better. But in the Note 10.1, Samsung has a worthy competitor at the top end of the mobile tablet space.\n\nSo, in short, Samsung's strategy is clear. Unlike Apple, which is satisfied in having a presence in the premium tablets segment, the Korean giant wants to be present in every market category. This strategy has worked quite well for it, as market share numbers show. It will be interesting to see what the market looks like a year from now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The lender has expanded its home loan market share in 15 consecutive quarters to Sept 30.\n\nOutstanding mortgages across all lenders climbed 5 per cent in the year ended Oct 31, the highest since June 2012, data from the central bank show.\n\nANZ topped mortgage growth with a 7.1 per cent increase in the same period, according to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\n\"We are actually quite bullish on larger New South Wales,\" said Mr Boss, who moved from Bank of America in the US to ANZ in October last year. \"We expect strong economic growth there.\"\n\nNew South Wales, the most populous state with 7.3 million people, reported an unexpected budget surplus on Oct 29, helped in part by higher stamp duty revenue from the increase in home prices and activity.\n\nDwelling prices in Sydney in the past year climbed the most among the country's eight capital cities, increasing 12.5 per cent in the year through last month, according to RP Data-Rismark home value index. Property researcher SQM Research Pty on Sept 17 forecast that prices in the city will soar as much as 20 per cent next year.\n\nWhile ANZ is the fourth-largest mortgage lender in the country, it's the fifth-largest brand in New South Wales, behind Westpac-owned St George Bank, Mr Boss said.\n\nIt lags behind Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking and National Australia Bank (NAB) nationally.\n\nANZ already offers the lowest variable mortgage rate jointly with NAB in Australia at 5.88 per cent and Mr Boss said that the bank would consider higher mortgage discounts for customers in New South Wales.\n\n\"I will also give the team a bit more pricing discretion for some deals in the state,\" he said. \"We can probably be an attacker in NSW.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

And it is our party's duty to understand them, to tap their experience and wisdom, to come up with new ideas to address these needs, and to speak up for the elderly - just as we speak up in the party for the young through YP (Young PAP), and for the women through the Women's Wing, and the other segments of the population.\"\n\nIn addition, Mr Lee - who is also the party's secretary-general - revealed that Singapore's pioneer generation can look forward to \"good news\" come February next year. Details of a Pioneer Generation Package, he said, will be announced by Budget 2014. In recognition of their contributions to Singapore, the package will focus especially on the group's medical needs.\n\nCalling the establishment of a senior's group timely, PAP.SG chairwoman Madam Halimah said: \"Today, one out of 12 Singaporeans is above the age of 65. In 2030, (this will be) one out of five. So I think that's the gravity of the situation.\"\n\nWhile she emphasised that the party \"has always been there\" for the elderly, she said that PAP.SG's establishment is \"important\" in signalling the party's commitment to caring for seniors. \"We're already doing it through (our) outreach at different branches, (but) now we want a lot more of a targeted, focused approach,\" she added.\n\nUnlike YP and the Women's Wing, PAP.SG will not have a specific members list. To drive the movement forward, however, PAP.SG has a 14-member executive committee, comprising nine sitting Members of Parliament (MPs), two former MPs, and two party activists. It has already had one meeting, and is planning to conduct focus groups to gain ground-up feedback.\n\nExco members include Lily Neo (Tanjong Pagar GRC), Hri Kumar (Bishan-Toa Payoh), and Yu-Foo Yee Shoon, a former minister of state for community development, youth and sports.\n\nThe group will also work with the PAP Community Foundation (PCF) to pilot new solutions for eldercare needs, such as those involving medical, financial, employment, and caregiving concerns.\n\nLamenting how most Singaporeans only know PCF for its childcare centres, Madam Halimah said that the new seniors group offers the foundation an opportunity to raise its charity profile, perhaps by setting up senior activity centres. \"(PCF can) show that it is not just running childcare centres and kindergartens, but that it is concerned about other members in the community - of which seniors form a significant proportion,\" said Madam Halimah.\n\nThese outreach efforts, she said, will not be limited only to PAP supporters, but will extend to all seniors.\n\n\"This is an interest group, not a group of old people,\" said Mr Lee to appreciative laughter from an audience of about 1,300 PAP members. \"It's a group which will champion elderly causes - active ageing, for example.\"\n\nAgeing issues featured prominently in yesterday's party convention, which had eight speakers.\n\nWhile Mr Lee highlighted the Health Ministry's ongoing efforts to work out the details of MediShield Life - the government's new insurance plan which will cover all Singaporeans and for life - Women's Wing activist Chan Hui Min spoke at length about the \"urgent need\" to understand \"the political impact of ageing issues in Singapore\".\n\nMembers of the Women's Wing, she said, would like to see more rental flats in retirement villages so that these housing options become more affordable. Members also desire more help for seniors who are asset rich, but cash poor.\n\n\"We hope that the party, as government, could make it easier for their housing assets to become a means to their financial independence,\" said Ms Chan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And only Electronic Arts and Take Two Interactive had games that ranked in the top 20 by revenues.\n\nOn Android Market, none of the traditional gave developers had games on the bestsellers' list.\n\nIDATE sees these key players producing fewer and fewer blockbusters, which are also becoming more and more expensive to make. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Debbie Yong and Rachel Loi pick the brains of leading F&B professionals on their strategies for Christmas shopping and what they'll be giving foodie friends this year.\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 6, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nJeremy Nguee\n\nChef and owner of catering service\n\nPreparazzi and Rakusaba, a pop-up ramen bar at The U Factory in Gillman Barracks\n\n\"I usually keep a look out for things throughout the year. If I see something nice or interesting, I'll just pick it up first. I may or may not have someone in mind for the items.\n\nThey're usually limited edition pieces, like the Saut Hermes bracelet with trinkets, or ceramics for tea or shochu - you can't ever have enough sake cups.\n\nI love shopping overseas, popping into small boutiques featuring small independent businesses that carry items you can't buy elsewhere. Outlet malls are also another great place to pick up an entire year's worth of shopping.\n\nI usually shop for the usual suspects: my family, close friends, my wife, and people whose birthdays I usually forget. For each person, there's usually a theme I follow through the years as if I'm helping them build a collection, or a new wardrobe. For the wife, it's usually a bundle of small gifts - a mixture of things she'd like to get and things I'd like for her to have. Nothing too big or fancy, just a few things to say \"I was thinking of you.\"\n\nFor one of the first Christmases while we were dating, my wife (then girlfriend) bought me a complete painting set which she assembled herself. It was so special and meaningful as if she knew that secret artistic side of me. Painting together was a great couple activity too.\n\nI think gifts should reflect what you'd like for the other person, not something you think the other person should like. I love receiving gifts that have thought put into it, it could be self-made or just showed that the giver thought about the person that I really am, not the persona that everyone knows.\n\nThere was a time when I worked as a photographer, all I got were photo albums. What a bore.\n\nThis year, I'd recommend Franc Franc for its wonderful collection of ceramics that are both decorative and functional. The Monocle Shop at the U Factory pop-up also has many beautiful things, such as small leather goods as well as small works by Singapore artists in the Creative Cultures section. I also like giving kitchenware from Le Creuset and utensils from WMF, and Sam Leong's cookbooks - I've given away more than 20 copies of them over the years.\n\nChristopher Christie\n\nExecutive chef, Marina Bay Sands\n\n\"Just like in a professional kitchen, functionality is key to a proper home kitchen. I like to give appliances as gifts as people tend to trust a chef's knowledge on their quality. I've previously given friends coffee makers, panini grills - everyone loves a proper grilled sandwich at home - a Kitchen Aid mixer, and decorative canisters. I've also even given a set of pots and pans to someone, but you need to be sure they will actually cook with them or it's a waste. While kitchen utensils make good gifts, I never give knives as a gift. I'm always afraid someone might cut themselves with the knife I gave them and then I'd feel guilty. Choosing a good knife is personal to me.\n\nI approach my Christmas shopping like I cook - with lots of planning and thinking and then an efficient execution. I am normally really pressed for time so I tend to do most of the shopping at the last minute in stores. Generally, I've given a lot of thought into what I will get and when the time comes, I know where to find it. It's quick and easy.\n\nWho I shop for and what kind of gifts I buy for them changes every year. I don't tend to repeat gifts or keep to a similar pattern of giving. Of course for children, the gift should be practical and educational, such as a good book or a puzzle. It should be something that makes them think.\n\nThe most memorable gift I had ever received was a card with words that meant more than any material gift could. I still keep that card till today.\n\nWhat I don't like receiving is clothes or jewellery as I am very particular with these items. I would much rather choose these items on my own than have someone get me something I don't like or wouldn't use.\n\nLast year I published my novel and I gave a lot of my friends and family a copy of the book. It meant a lot for me to be able to share the story with them.\n\nOver the years, I've given homemade goodies such as the stollen and pate. It's nice to be invited to someone's home and to bring along a homemade culinary creation. It adds a personal touch.\"\n\nMaranda Barnes\n\nCo-founder and director of communications and business development, TWG Tea\n\n\"I usually collect presents all year long. Every time I find a unique item that one of my friends or loved ones would appreciate, I keep it until the next time I see them.\n\nSince the creation of TWG Tea five years ago, I always send tea to all my friends for Christmas - in fact, it has become something they look forward to. This year it will be the Magic Christmas Tea, a blend of my favourite ingredients - yuzu and dark chocolate - in a beautiful packaging. But many of my friends send requests for a specific tea even before I start my Christmas shopping, so they will receive just the blend that they like.\n\nMy husband, Taha already has a very distinctive style, and usually takes care of his own apparel and watches. So if I am overseas and get the time to visit some flea markets or antique stores, I try to search for vintage tea tins or teapots, anything that has a unique personality and charm that he would appreciate. Otherwise, since he travels nine months out of the year, travel accessories are always a useful gift.\n\nChristmas is a very important holiday to me and I love the warmth and joy of the festive season. The best gift I could ever receive is to have a celebratory holiday meal with my family. This year I plan to cook a wild organic turkey, as we are expecting some friends to join us for dinner.\n\nI love all the gifts I receive, since the thought is more important than the present itself. As I am surrounded with everything I could possibly want - a beautiful family, friends, a job I love, and a home I chose and decorated myself - I prefer small gifts that were chosen for me, which I can keep for years, as opposed to gifts that I would need to use or consume and then discard. I guess I am very sentimental in that way.\"\n\nTan Yong Hua\n\nChef-owner, Restaurant Home\n\n\"It's become a tradition for me to work on Christmas - but this will be the first Christmas for my son Aston so I will make the effort to spend time with him and my wife, Sandra.\n\nOn a weeknight close to Christmas, we will invite some close friends and family over for a home-cooked meal. But while other families have turkey, we always have Peking duck. My friends associate it with me so I can't run away from it. I try to give it a Western twist by serving it with bacon and portobello mushrooms. We'll then end with a log-cake made by my wife.\n\nI've also decided to do a Christmas countdown celebration with my staff after dinner service on Christmas Eve to thank them for their hard work in our first year together. My wife will come over to pass them some presents. I usually leave all the Christmas shopping to her - I am not the shopping kind.\n\nMy wife loves travelling and shopping so for Christmas, I am going to give her a Chef Tan-issued-voucher, which she can redeem for a holiday. But it comes with one condition - it can only be used after Chinese New Year as we have a lot lined up at the restaurant for the new year. This is my way of pacifying her as we work hard during this intense period.\n\nI like receiving presents from friends and families, but when a customer gives me a present it never fails to bring a smile to my face. That's when I feel that they are no longer customers but friends. I have received unique gifts from my customer-friends, such as a rare bottle of tequila from Mexico with a very unique leather cover, shark's fin and exquisite Chinese teas.\n\nI've always believed that one should not give for the sake of giving - if you want to give a gift, put some thought into it. If I'm giving a gift to a fellow chef, I might consider a customised chef's jacket rather than kitchen equipment. Unlike Western chefs, Chinese chefs don't have a lot of 'designer' cooking equipment, so I won't be making another chef's day if I give him another wok.\n\nAll chefs, and even friends who are homecooks, love showcasing their work so it could be a good idea to get them a food-photography package. The professionally taken shots help to preserve those memories long after their food has been eaten - and I'm sure these food shots will be a hit on Facebook.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The costs associated with inefficient, obsolete systems and procedures that apply to exports and imports are twice as high as tariffs. Average world tariffs are 5 per cent, but trade costs add 10 per cent to costs. In some countries they add much more. For instance, in landlocked parts of Africa, almost half the cost of a bar of soap represents transport costs. According to the World Bank's \"Doing Business\" Report 2013, in Chad, it takes an average of 101 days and costs an average US$8,525 to import a container of goods. By contrast, in Singapore, the same process costs US$439 and takes four days.\n\nReforming trade facilitation would include reducing the number of forms that importers and exporters are required to fill out; allowing forms to be submitted and processed online; introducing \"risk-based\" inspections of goods at the border (for example, checking selected cargo, rather than all cargo), improving customs administration, reducing inspection checkpoints within countries and tackling corruption.\n\nFewer bureaucratic hassles would not be the only benefit. Easier trading procedures would also enable more countries to join global or regional value chains, in which exporters are also importers. The trade in such \"processed\" goods where different countries make components which are then sent somewhere for final assembly (electronics in Asia is a prominent example) is growing much faster than trade in finished goods.\n\nA June 2013 study by researchers Gary Hufbauer and Jeffrey Schott at the Peterson Institute of International Economics estimated that a WTO agreement on trade facilitation could lead to export gains of US$1.04 trillion, add US$960 billion to global GDP and create some 20 million new jobs. Most of these benefits would accrue to developing countries - although it remains to be seen how fast they implement modern trade facilitation measures; some could take years rather than months to do so.\n\nWhat lies ahead for the WTO is the really hard part: first, tackling the rest of the Doha Round issues, particularly agricultural subsidies, removing barriers to international trade in services and more transparency in government procurement.\n\nSecond, the WTO needs to update its own agenda. There are a number of so-called \"21st century issues\" it must deal with: e-commerce, including online financial services; stronger intellectual property protection, foreign direct investment, freer movement of workers and a global trade regime that is more \"supply-chain friendly\", in which exports are crucially dependent on imports and in which old ideas of \"reciprocity\" (\"I won't allow imports from you unless you allow imports from me\") have no place.\n\nHere, the WTO could take inspiration from a number of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) - including many that Singapore has signed - which contain more up-to-date provisions, and which, indeed, are more than just trade agreements; they are even called \"Economic Partnership Agreements\".\n\nPurists of the multilateral system have criticised RTAs, which have been described as resembling a \"spaghetti bowl\" of bilateral deals which are discriminatory and have diverted attention from mulilateralism and weakened the WTO. Some of these criticisms - for example, on their discriminatory nature and sometimes confusing provisions on rules of origin - are valid. However, RTAs have not led to \"trade diversion\" or a decline in trade with non-members. Instead, they have widened the constituency for free trade, and they have addressed trade issues that the WTO has not.\n\nBut the world cannot depend on RTAs alone. We need the WTO, because multilateral trade liberalisation is bigger, fairer and more inclusive, because the WTO offers a good global dispute settlement mechanism, and the world needs a watchdog of global trade. But the WTO needs to modernise if it is to remain a relevant and effective institution. After Bali, there is some hope that it can rise to the challenge.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are some of the factors hindering the adoption of big data in Singapore.\n\nIn an interview with BizIT, Neville Vincent, senior VP and GM for Asia-Pacific at Hitachi Data Systems (HDS), said Singapore companies dipping their toes in the use of big data tend to be hampered by \"short-termism\". This means having a near-term outlook for the deployment, and going for piecemeal projects that result in poor outcomes and internal buy-in, he explained.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lack of communication between departments with regard to the sharing of data internally. This is indicative of having a short-term view to utilising big data, he added.

The statements were stolen in March from one of the servers at Fuji Xerox Singapore, which prints these statements for StanChart's private bank customers.\n\nThe incident has also raised the issue of the security surrounding client data especially if it is outsourced to third parties. Banks were quick to assure clients that they continually monitor the processes of these providers to protect against unauthorised access to client data.\n\nSeveral banks including DBS, OCBC, Barclays, Citibank and Maybank outsource print services to third-party service providers, including printing of marketing materials, business stationery, statements and advices.\n\nBut giant private banks like Switzerland's UBS and Credit Suisse do not. Interestingly, Bank of Singapore, whose parent is OCBC, also keeps the functions in-house.\n\n\"Ensuring that data is secure is a central topic at UBS,\" said bank spokeswoman Rachel Lin. \"All our client statement printing is done in-house within the bank's premises in Singapore.\n\n\"All data remains within UBS infrastructure at all times. At no point in the production process is data transferred externally to a third-party vendor,\" she added.\n\nUBS is the biggest private bank in Asia.\n\n\"We have in place clear policies, stringent monitoring system and access controls to ensure data security throughout the lifecycle of the information we handle - from creation and classification, to handling and processing, to dispatch and transport, to storage and, finally, to destruction of information,\" said Ms Lin.\n\n\"All Credit Suisse client statements are printed in-house using the bank's own infrastructure and on its own premises,\" said a bank spokeswoman.\n\n\"Bank of Singapore does not outsource printing of any materials containing customer information. All our customer statements are printed in-house,\" said chief executive Renato de Guzman.\n\nDenis Malone, OCBC Bank head, group operations, said customers' data confidentiality is very important to the bank and measures are put in place to protect customers' data and information.\n\nHe said: \"Outsourcing of our operations is done very selectively with the bulk of them performed internally. However, whether the operation is done internally or outsourced to a third party, we exact the same high standards required to protect and secure our customers' data and information.\"\n\nDBS Bank, the largest bank in South-east Asia, also uses outside vendors. In Singapore, the vendor is not Fuji Xerox but BT understands that DBS Bank (Hong Kong) uses a subsidiary of Fuji Xerox, Fuji Xerox Document Management Solutions Asia Ltd (FXDMS), for selected customer communications.\n\nIt is a different legal entity and there is no indication of any compromise of FXDMS's systems in Hong Kong, said a source.\n\nBT understands also that the bank has fielded some calls from clients asking about data confidentiality.\n\n\"All the bank's outsourcing arrangements are managed under stringent risk controls that are compliant with regulations and local laws,\" said a DBS spokeswoman.\n\n\"We also conduct regular reviews of our outsourcing policies and work closely with our vendors to review their respective security processes. There is no indication that any customer data has been compromised,\" she said.\n\nStanChart itself had calls from other customers and has reassured them that the incident does not impact them, a bank spokeswoman said.\n\nBut she declined to provide any information on the communications between the private bank clients and the bank about the case.\n\nIan Williams, HSBC Singapore's chief risk officer, said: \"We cannot say or do anything that may potentially put our customers at risk. Therefore, we cannot talk about how or what we do, or which vendors we work with.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Fear - the corporate kind - sounds an awful lot like waiting for the phone to ring.\n\nThat weekend, as Singapore braced itself for the hacking threat of Guy Fawkes Day, employees were put on standby and whole IT divisions kept their smartphones on, ready to go back to the office at the slightest whiff of online trouble.\n\n\"They were waiting for a call that they hoped wouldn't come,\" a spokesman for a large publicly listed firm told The Business Times.\n\nThen, his firm had beefed up its IT department with 20-30 per cent more staff than it usually has in more peaceful times.\n\nWeeks before that, masked individuals threatened the Singapore government with \"financial loss\" and \"aggressive cyber intrusion\" - terms that became shorthand for every business's worst fears. Guy Fawkes Day on Nov 5 - the festival that hacktivist group Anonymous has co-opted - became synonymous with a day of online reckoning.\n\nAt first, it seemed as though the public sector had borne the brunt of hacktivist season, with government websites defaced with taunting messages and images so embarrassing that officials would struggle to describe them to the media later.\n\nA month later, we now know several things that we did not during the panic of Guy Fawkes Day. On Thursday, Standard Chartered Bank revealed that the statements of 647 of its private bank customers were found on the laptop of James Raj Arokiasamy, the alleged \"Messiah\" hacker who has been charged with defacing the Ang Mo Kio town council website.\n\nWe now have to consider how James - thus far suspected of blowing digital raspberries at the government - might have had serious money on his mind. He has not been charged with anything related to this incident, so far. We also now know that these statements were stolen months before the vaunted Nov 5, taken off the server of the bank's printer, Fuji Xerox Singapore.\n\nUp and down the CBD, financial institutions did urgent checks with their own third-party vendors - a figurative frantic patting of their own pockets - desperate not to be the next StanChart.\n\nTo the private sector's credit, many heavyweights had sprung into action as Nov 5 loomed. Prominent businesses overhauled their Web storefronts. Whole systems were re-engineered so that if disaster struck and had to be contained, they could be shut down in 30 minutes instead of 60.\n\nOther firms activated more servers, prepared for abnormal volumes of traffic from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks - a hacker's way of overwhelming a server through repeated electronic requests.\n\nFirms which relied on the telephony network started having regular conversations with the telcos. \"If (the telcos) deem themselves to be under threat, they would alert us . . . by extension, we are under threat as well,\" one firm told BT.\n\nWary eye\n\nOn their end, the telcos have kept a wary eye on developments. \"To secure our network and protect our customers, we rely on a defence-in-depth approach with multiple security layers to identify and mitigate any malicious activity on our network,\" StarHub's chief technology officer, Mock Pak Lum, told BT.\n\n\"This includes the use of our StarHub Internet Clean Pipe service to minimise the impact of potential DDoS attacks.\"\n\nSingTel, too, has a \"multi-layered approach\" and has been adopting different means of addressing \"emerging threats\", it said.\n\nThis has been a sobering time for corporations. \"The hacking attacks can break down the company's IT system . . . interrupting internal business activities and its connection with the outside world,\" said CV Jagadish, CEO of semiconductor firm Systems on Silicon Manufacturing Co. His firm regularly reviews its risk assessment against cyber attacks, he told BT.\n\nWhile some firms unfurled continuity plans last month, others made frantic calls to technology security firms.\n\n\"The last two weeks, the number of calls I've been receiving? It's been pretty amazing . . . all that from not doing any marketing,\" Stree Naidu, vice-president for data centre security firm Imperva in Asia Pacific and Japan, told BT last month. Then, the number of enquiries his company received had trebled.\n\nElsewhere in the industry, security firm Trend Micro had to start selling a Web application scanning service not yet launched in Singapore to some of its customers, so pressing was the need for one in the wake of the hacking threats.\n\nThis might seem like hysteria, but to Imperva's Mr Naidu, there is not enough of the right kind. Firms, he believes, have focused on problems with trendy buzzwords such as malware protection and anti-spam software, but neglected the need for data-loss prevention.\n\n\"CIOs in Singapore need to push away the marketing jargon . . . and ask themselves: is anti-spam software going to protect their data?\"\n\n\"The difference between what the organisations have and what they need . . . (is) extremely frightening.\"\n\nWhile some large firms are long on funds but short on knowledge, the majority of firms - small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - are short on everything. For SMEs, this has been a terrible year for beefing up on the cyber-esoteric as rising business costs, the manpower crunch and a deterioration in sentiment close in.\n\n\"Day to day, (SMEs) are bogged down by very simple operational issues. Infocomm and hacking - you can imagine that (these issues) will fall numerous rungs in terms of being a concern,\" said Victor Tay, chief operating officer of the Singapore Business Federation (SBF).\n\nBleak outlook\n\nSo bleak is the outlook this year that the proportion of SMEs expecting double-digit growth hit an 11-year low - just 7 per cent of those surveyed - according to the SME Development Survey last month.\n\nAsked about the reluctance of SMEs to invest in cyber security, Trend Micro Singapore's country manager, David Siah, said: \"Oh, you have no idea. I see that every day. The business users feel that this doesn't add value.\"\n\nMuch can happen, even to a firm whose business does not revolve around data. \"Organisations who sell physical products could get their invoices hacked into and the payment instructions changed. That's a real possibility,\" Mr Siah warned.\n\nWith some firms, there is some resignation over an ostensibly indefatigable threat.\n\n\"Most companies would have a basic level of IT security, however I'm frankly not sure how effective it would be in deterring skilled hackers if they are intent on causing such mischief,\" a spokesman for a recruitment agency told BT.\n\nAlready, firms in Japan and China are ahead of Singapore on the data protection curve. There, the connection between data and security is seamless, claimed Imperva's Mr Naidu. As local companies struggle to catch up, they already fight the cyber battle on multiple fronts, combating a resource shortage, information asymmetry and, sometimes, blind panic.\n\nThe StanChart debacle has opened up yet another distressing front of this battle - that of the third-party chink in the armour. It is not enough that your own house is in order; everyone else in the supply chain has to lock their doors as well.\n\nFor many firms, Nov 5 might be over, but the nightmare has just begun.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Four years later, his government slashed spending and courted foreign investors, paving the way for the longest period of growth in the country's history.\n\nThe former president and Nobel Laureate, who died on Thursday at the age of 95, was instrumental in getting the African National Congress (ANC), which led the fight against apartheid and has ruled ever since, to embrace an open economy.\n\n\"Only a Mandela could have realigned the ANC's economic policy from the mindset of the 1950s, with the development state, with socialism, with nationalisation, to the world of the 1990s and beyond,\" Robert Schrire, a politics professor at the University of Cape Town, said in an interview. \"He recognised that for the poor to prosper, the rich had to feel they had a future in the country.\"\n\nMr Mandela's embrace of spending rigour and foreign capital allowed the economy to expand for 15 years, until the third quarter of 2008, when the global financial crisis pushed it into recession, Bloomberg reported. That growth and rising tax receipts enabled the post-apartheid government to extend welfare grants to about 16 million people and give more than 85 per cent of households access to electricity, up from 45 per cent in 1996.\n\nInstead of nationalising companies, Mr Mandela coaxed foreign investors into the country. His ideological shift laid the groundwork for Lakshmi Mittal's LNM Group to buy Africa's biggest steelmaker in 2004 and London-based Barclays to take control of South Africa's largest consumer bank in 2005. In 2011, Fayetteville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc bought a majority stake in the nation's biggest general-goods wholesaler.\n\nRestoring confidence in South Africa's economy in 1994 was a significant achievement. Apartheid had turned South Africa into a pariah state, subjected to international sanctions and boycotts. The economy was haemorrhaging foreign capital, had enough reserves to cover only 10 days of imports and was running a budget deficit of 9.1 per cent of GDP.\n\nMr Mandela asked Chris Liebenberg, who had just retired as CEO of what's now Nedbank Group, the country's fourth-largest bank, to become finance minister. He accepted the job on condition that South Africa would have a market-related economy and exercise fiscal discipline.\n\n\"Those were tough times,\" Mr Liebenberg said in an interview. \"We were heading for bankruptcy. Mandela was very mindful that the ANC having not been in government would not be as astute in managing the economy as it should be. He came to me because I was a banker with lots of international contacts and experience.\"\n\nIn his first budget, Mr Liebenberg raised taxes, equalised the tax system for all racial groups and slashed the defence budget. Those measures helped the government to raise US$750 million in 1994 in its first post-apartheid international bond sale, 50 per cent more than originally planned. By 1999, the Finance Ministry had reduced the budget deficit to 2.3 per cent of GDP.\n\nMr Mandela also persuaded Chris Stals, the central bank governor, to postpone his retirement by five years to help manage the country's transition.\n\n\"We made steady progress from day one on for those first five years,\" Mr Stals said in an interview. \"Our main task was to bring us back into the world economy. Mr Mandela certainly made a major contribution to that. The trust people had in him and his policies certainly enabled us to lay a very good foundation.\"\n\nThat trust was hard won.Mr Mandela helped set the broad parameters of economic policy, while leaving formulation and execution to his subordinates, according to Mr Liebenberg, who now helps manage charities established by the former president. \"Until Mandela set his stamp on a policy, I think it would not have been possible to drive it through the ANC,\" Mr Liebenberg said. \"It certainly would not have been possible to drive it through government.\"\n\nMr Abedian, now CEO of Pan-African Capital Holdings, a Johannesburg-based advisory service, was struck by the attention to detail that Mr Mandela, a trained lawyer, gave to policy-making. \"He would go through every document word by word, line by line,\" he said. \"It was a question of understanding the rationale for every step, weighing it up, questioning it in detail, far more than people would believe.\"\n\nMr Stals recounts how after Trevor Manuel was appointed finance minister in 1996 and the rand tumbled 8.8 per cent in the space of a month, Mr Mandela would phone him two or three times a day for market updates. \"He showed a great interest in what we did and he was always quite well-informed,\" said Mr Stals. \"He liked to discuss the monetary policy issues. He never really interfered, he never really gave instructions.\"\n\nStill, the stability that Mr Mandela engineered in those early years after apartheid never made South Africa an economic dynamo. Economic growth has averaged 3.5 per cent since 2004, compared with 10.5 per cent in China and 7.7 per cent in India.\n\nMr Mandela did the best he could for the country under the circumstances, Mr Abedian said. \"Very few people appreciated what unstable macroeconomic conditions apartheid had left behind,\" he said. \"In that type of environment what was critical was to have a credible, not necessarily an instant, solution. Mandela realised what steps had to be taken to normalise and stabilise the economy.\"\n\nThe world yesterday grappled with the loss of Mr Mandela, a towering figure of the 20th century who inspired millions across the globe with his struggle for equality. \"We will not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again,\" said US President Barack Obama. German Chancellor Angela Merkel cited his \"shining example\", while French President Francois Hollande said his message of reconciliation \"will inspire those who battle for liberty\".\n\nPope Francis said he will \"pray that the late president's example will inspire generations of South Africans to put justice and the common good at the forefront of their political aspirations\". Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas hailed Mr Mandela as a \"symbol of freedom from colonialism and occupation\".\n\nSingapore said history would remember Mr Mandela as a great man and hero.

South Korean banks have been attacked intermittently for years, with files lost and passwords compromised. Yet each time, they have survived to be hacked another day.\n\nThe end of the world notwithstanding, these attacks add up. A survey of 234 firms by Ponemon Institute (which carries out independent research on privacy, data protection and information security policy) found that this year, cybercrime cost each firm an average of US$7.2 million - a 30 per cent increase from last year.\n\nIn Singapore, the worst-case scenario has remained nebulous.\n\nTrend Micro Singapore's country manager David Siah said: \"So far, I don't see (what happened in South Korea) happening here . . . Singapore is pretty well defended.\"\n\nBut defence aside, a worst- case scenario might well come down to an alignment of motivation with ability.\n\nSenol Yilmaz, an associate research fellow with the Centre of Excellence for National Security at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said some conditions are key for a worst- case scenario to materialise.\n\nFor one, there needs to be a \"state-actor\" - an individual or group acting on behalf of a government - and this state-actor needs to have highly sophisticated cyber capabilities and great motivation to inflict harm, he told The Business Times.\n\n\"In the current international climate, I do not see any state-actor that would have the motivation to hit Singapore,\" he said.\n\nBut even if there is little political motivation for now, financial motivation still exists. Imperva's Mr Naidu said: \"We're a target because Singapore's the lynchpin of Asia.\"\n\n\"If I were a chief executive, my biggest fear would be to wake up in the morning and find that all my important information lies in the hands of my competition.\"\n\nIn March, the monthly statements of 647 Standard Chartered Bank private banking clients were stolen off the server belonging to the bank's printer, Fuji Xerox Singapore.\n\nWhere there is no apparent financial or political motive, pinning down a worst-case scenario is even more difficult. Delson Moo, the 42-year-old businessman charged with defacing the Istana's webpage, told the press last month that he did it because \"my hand was itchy\".\n\nExperts say that a hacker who is in it just for the heck of it is a bigger headache than one looking for a profit. \"He has a motivation we can't define,\" Mr Naidu said.\n\nAs more people answer the hacktivist siren call, the spectrum of worst possible outcomes will fluctuate, governed by the wildly differing kinds of hackers' expertise and intentions. At the same time, the decentralised nature of hacktivism will make them harder to identify.\n\nAmid all this, firms will have to put a price tag on a problem with no face.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The cap will only be applicable to the subletting of whole flats. MND and HDB are targeting to finalise all the details soon. We will announce the details once they are ready for implementation.\"\n\nThe way the cap is ministered could be similar to the way quotas on the number of Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) allowed to purchase resale flats are measured, said Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty. For resale flats, the SPR quota is set at 5 per cent and 8 per cent at the neighbourhood and block levels respectively, and is applied in addition to the existing Ethnic Integration Policy limits.\n\n\"To the HDB owner who is subletting his unit, if the foreigner ratio is filled for his block or his neighbourhood, it simply means he can only sublet to locals. By having less tenants to choose from, you may end up with lower rentals,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio could be calculated based on the owner's leasing history in terms of how frequently the flat owner has leased the flat to foreigners in the past, said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research.\n\nCurrently, more than 35,000 flats, representing less than 4 per cent of all HDB flats, are sublet to foreigners, excluding Malaysians. This figure refers to the subletting of the entire HDB flat, and not rooms. However, the proportion could go up to 9 per cent in some areas, or even 18 per cent in some blocks, Mr Khaw said on his blog yesterday.\n\nThere is no existing cap on the number of HDB flats sublet to foreign tenants.\n\nWith tighter caps, however, more foreigners might move to private residential properties, particularly older apartments which tend to have lower rents, suggested R'ST Research's Mr Ong.\n\n\"Also, the size of an old apartment's bedroom is usually larger, so it can cater to foreigners who still wish to co-share a bedroom to defray occupancy costs,\" said Mr Ong.\n\nMr Khaw had said earlier this year during a debate on his ministry's Budget that the government would implement a quota. This was in response to a call from West Coast GRC MP Foo Mee Har for a quota of 10 per cent to address her worry that foreign enclaves were sprouting.\n\n\"I agreed with MP Foo Mee Har that we need to maintain the Singaporean character of our heartlands. In principle, MND has agreed to impose such a cap. The question is at what level,\" said Mr Khaw.\n\nMohamed Ismail, chief executive of PropNex Realty, reckoned that 10 per cent was a good level, adding that he did not expect the cap to have any impact on the rental market.\n\n\"This will mainly even out the foreign enclaves in each estate,\" said Mr Ismail. \"However, as there is a need to fulfil some of these criteria, rental of the flats may take a longer process.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, as banks reel from a breach in the defences of one of their own, some questions stand out like the balance of a sorely overdrawn account.\n\nYesterday, Standard Chartered Bank revealed that the February statements of 647 of its private bank customers were found on the laptop of alleged Messiah hacker James Raj Arokiasamy, currently charged with defacing the Ang Mo Kio Town Council website.\n\nThese statements contained customers' account numbers, balances and transaction details - every pair of Manolos bought, every ill-timed investment in the Australian dollar - taken from the server of Fuji Xerox Singapore, which prints these statements. To be a private banking client, StanChart customers must have at least US$2 million in assets managed by the bank.\n\nIt's too early to tell how such a breach happened, security experts say, listing a range of causes ranging from a malware attack to a security lapse\n\nEven so, a security expert who declined to be identified told The Business Times that his first guess was that it was an internal leak. Hacktivists tend to recruit people who already have access to information, he reasoned.\n\nHowever, Fuji Xerox Singapore told BT that \"definitely no employee is involved\". It also said there was no connection between the company and Arokiasamy. As at last night, he had not been charged for this incident.\n\nEven without inside help, there is freeware on the Internet that could make a simple attack possible, the security expert said. This comes in the form of a Structured Query Language (SQL) injection attack, which an attacker could have used to figure out user names and passwords.\n\nGallingly enough, after a firm's data has been breached, it takes a disturbingly long time to find out.\n\n\"(The attacks take) forever and a day to discover, and that discovery is rarely made by the victim,\" the 2013 Data Breach Investigations Report by Verizon said.\n\nThe StanChart information was stolen from the Fuji Xerox server in March, but the printer found out only eight months later, after StanChart told it so.\n\nAccording to the security expert that BT spoke to, intrusions go unnoticed when firms lack a system that is able to detect anomalies in how files are moved and what they are used for.\n\nWhile this week's revelations are unsettling enough to make the well-heeled clutch their pearls, virtually no one in the security sector is surprised. Last year, 37 per cent of data breaches affected financial organisations, the Verizon report found.\n\n\"The value and worth of data (that) banks and financial institutions own make them extremely attractive for cybercriminals,\" said Trend Micro Singapore's country manager David Siah.\n\n\"(This incident) further highlights the need for organisations to relook their current security infrastructure and policies.\"\n\nFirms pay dearly for data breaches in four ways, said Jeffrey Kok, RSA's technical consultant director for the Asia-Pacific and Japan. RSA is the security division of storage giant EMC.\n\nThe first two are internal and external \"remediation\" costs, as the company figures out what went wrong while engaging external investigators at the same time. The cost of external help alone can range from $50,000 to millions of dollars, Mr Kok said.\n\nThen there is the cost of civil penalties. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said on Thursday that it was considering whether to take regulatory action against StanChart.\n\nThe fourth category is the most damaging but the hardest to pin down: the cost to reputation.\n\n\"An organisation stands to lose customer trust and experience significant commercial loss, as well as long-term damage to its reputation,\" said Stree Naidu, vice-president for data centre security firm Imperva in the Asia-Pacific and Japan.\n\nWhile the data breach happened on Fuji Xerox's end and not on StanChart's, what recourse the bank has depends on the service- level agreement (SLA) crafted.\n\nAlthough the particulars of the contract are not known, BT understands that even if a penalty is enforceable on the third-party vendor, these tend to be capped and calculated as a percentage of the contract value.\n\nThe rest of the losses tend to be shouldered by the victim whose data has been compromised.\n\n\"There is a saying: 'You can outsource labour, but you cannot outsource liability',\" RSA's Mr Kok said.\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A handful of factors caused this decline, most recently the October penny counter saga, which wiped a sizeable amount of funds from the market.\n\nInvestors' anticipation of a Fed tapering of its quantitative-easing also sent the index to year-lows in late August.\n\nA slew of property cooling measures and stricter bank-lending regulations announced this year, compounded with weak corporate earnings, especially in Q3, further crimped the market's performance, said Voyage Research's deputy research head Ng Kian Teck.\n\n\"The (weightage of the) three local banks make up 31 per cent of the STI; real estate makes up another 10.5 per cent. I think it is safe to say the new government measures had an impact on STI returns,\" he said.\n\nIreland, sixth last year, took the top spot as the most business-friendly country. It is the first time that it has done so since Forbes began compiling this ranking in 2006.\n\nIts pole position may surprise some, given that it had required a US$113 billion bailout package just three years ago, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. But it appears to have turned crisis into opportunity: a significant drop in nominal wages from 2008 to 2011 and a stubbornly high unemployment rate (and thus larger labour pool) have attracted and sped up investments from foreign companies between 2008 and last year. Its stock market has been on fire, with its stock exchange index boasting a 44-per-cent return in the 12 months through Nov 20.\n\nNew Zealand was dethroned from first place and now ranks second. Forbes said: \"The US$170 billion economy is the smallest of the top 10, but one of the fastest growing, with gross domestic product up 2.5 per cent last year.\"\n\nHong Kong took third place for the second year running, although its economic growth last year was slower than in 2011.

No prize for guessing who won.\n\nThe Last Days on Mars has plenty of indie heart with its modest production budget and a great cast; but despite Robinson's best efforts to reach for the stars in his debut feature, the film somehow crash-lands mid-course and leaves the audience lost in space.\n\nBased on prolific English writer Sydney J Bounds' 1975 short story, The Animators, it has an interesting premise, not unlike the one about the homesick spaceman who wants to go home in Duncan Jones's excellent minimalist sci-fi drama Moon (2009).\n\nBut despite a promising start, The Last Days on Mars abruptly goes into B-grade territory as Robinson trades in the claustrophobic tension he builds up in the first act for cheap zombie scares in the second.\n\nLiev Schreiber plays Vincent, one of the crew members of an eight-person team stationed on Mars. After a six-month tour of duty, they are all weary and ready to head home.\n\nWith less than 24 hours to go before they get picked up, everybody gets busy packing. Except Marko (Goran Kostic) who earlier discovered some signs of life on the Red Planet but has chosen to keep mum about it for his own personal glory.\n\nDisobeying orders, he heads out for one last unauthorised mission to collect samples but gets swallowed up by the ground instead.\n\nThe incident causes panic as the team sets out to recover his body. Before they can find it, another member goes missing and suddenly, The Last Days on Mars turns into a full-blown outer space zombie flick with Vincent and the rest of his colleagues trying to stay alive for as long as they can.\n\nIt's here the film lets its audience down. Instead of developing his characters, screenwriter Clive Dawson conveniently kills them off one by one as Robinson rehashes Ridley Scott's Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing. At just over 90 minutes, The Last Days on Mars has a compact runtime but still feels draggy because genre fans would have seen it all before.\n\nIt's a missed opportunity for Robinson who should have turned this into a character drama with a small serving of horror on the side instead of trying to mimic a studio creature feature.\n\nThat way, he could have also realised the full potential of his cast - many such as Schreiber and Elias Koteas are great character actors by nature - instead of them just becoming monster feed.\n\nBut the director does a great job of transforming Jordan into Mars with the help of his cinematographer Robbie Ryan and production designer Jon Henson so the film looks well-crafted and never cheap despite its modest budget. Max Richter's atmospheric score is also haunting and effective in inducing goosebumps.\n\nA little more originality is probably all it takes for The Last Days on Mars to go a long way instead of it feeling like a real drag.\n\ndylantan@sph.com.sg\n\nRating:\n\nC\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Check out\n\nalternativeldn.com\n\nfor details\n\nIF - like me - you've always been suspicious of street art and remain unconvinced by the rise of UK-based graffiti artist Banksy, then it might do you good to go on the excellent Alternative London Walking Tour.\n\nIt's a far cry from the august museums and chi-chi gallery scene, but the tour opens your eyes to the vitality and importance of street art, not just in giving artists a chance to display their creativity but also in reviving the economic fortunes of certain areas. Take Brick Lane, for instance, which is one of the poorest parts of London. When the shop owners decided to allow street artists to paint graffiti on the exterior walls of their shops, Brick Lane became street-art central. It drew businesses, local visitors and tourists which, in turn, led to a jump in real estate prices as wealthier residents wanted to move there.\n\nThe politics and economics of gentrification aside, the art itself is pretty fantastic. Some of the street art is so subtle or small, you'd have to look very hard to find it - like the realistic-looking but fake road signs that make anti-government statements, or the funny figurines on top of some lamp-posts.\n\nMeanwhile, the larger wall displays by artists such as Martin Ron and Ben Eine are simply stunning.

Just slightly more expensive than Hoshi, which is priced around 20,000 yen (S$245.50) per person, Ryokan Tanigawa is an affordable way to cap off a visit to Hoshi while still enjoying the spectacular mountain scenery.\n\nUnlike other ryokans, what you see isn't necessarily what you get. As in, while it looks like a regular ryokan, there are little design touches that show off owner Tomio Kubo's keen eye for detail. The trained horticulturist and second generation ryokan owner created a Japanese garden from scratch on Tanigawa's grounds,and he was the first to replace the wooden floors of the dressing area of each room with tatami mats. He was also the first to use hinoki wood for the baths instead of rocks - a practice that has since been adopted by other ryokans.\n\nApart from all the creature comforts, food also gets extra attention at Tanigawa. Breakfast and dinner are usually packaged into the price at any Japanese inn, and tend to be pretty straightforward affairs, but Tanigawa offers extra elaborate menus that maximise the fresh produce from the surrounding area. If you spend your day schlepping around the neighbourhood to find the best camera angle for the stunning Mount Tanigawa which the ryokan is named after, you'll more than welcome this splendid repast. After which a soak in the joint-soothing alkaline waters that fills your private bath guarantees you a blissful stay.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The negotiations - which began in Doha, Qatar in 2001 - have seen the 159 member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) bicker over achieving a trade liberalisation pact. Two years ago, countries watered down the initial ambitious pact to cut tariffs on goods and services in an effort to nail down an agreement. This is the right approach. But it has not yielded a pact which brings all 159 members onboard a single liberalisation regime.\n\nThe ninth WTO Ministerial Conference in Bali presents perhaps the best opportunity yet to seal some kind of deal. It is important - for the global economy and indeed for the WTO itself. The failure of past attempts to strike a global trade deal has seen a proliferation of regional and bilateral trade pacts in the last decade. Negotiated between groups of countries with congruent interests, such deals have been easier to hammer out, and their success has questioned the need for a multilateral deal. But such a deal is still vitally needed.\n\nThe irony of the \"spaghetti bowl\" of regional and bilateral trade agreements is that their proliferation erodes the exclusive benefits that countries accrue from their trade partners. For instance, Country A is extended certain trade benefits by Country B when it signs a trade deal with the latter, but this benefit is eroded if Country B inks similar agreements with Countries C, D and E - which is what has been happening. After a point, it makes increasing sense for everyone to seek a multilateral deal; it's not only simpler for businesses, but also results in wider trade creation and economic benefits.\n\nBut the lack of progress on the global trade deal has dented the credibility of the WTO, which it needs to salvage to retain its relevance as an institution and to keep hopes of a multilateral trade deal alive.\n\nIn Bali, the WTO should focus on a series of plurilateral agreements which would allow groups of countries to voluntarily agree to new rules on specific trade issues (as with the information technology agreement at the WTO's inaugural Singapore Ministerial Conference in 1996) rather than chasing a full-blown multilateral agreement where all member countries have to agree.\n\nIn recent years, India (in particular) has been a stumbling block to a multilateral deal due to its insistence on maintaining its food subsidy programme. It might be more expedient for the WTO to focus on other less contentious areas - clean technology, and selected services, for instance, in addition to trade facilitation - so that there is some movement forward.\n\nAfter 12 years of failed negotiations, it seems clear that the Doha Round of trade talks would be very difficult to wrap up in a comprehensive fashion. But incremental successes are possible. These would add up and help restore faith in the multilateral system - and perhaps eventually lead to a comprehensive trade deal a few years down the road.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It boasts traditional English-style rooms with four-poster beds and classic furnishings. Nearly all of the furniture are antique and the artworks are unique - which explains why no two rooms look alike. KOP Group, which runs luxury developments such as Hamilton Scotts and The Ritz-Carlton Residences Singapore, took over from its previous owners in Nov 2011. The rooms were refurbished and occupancy doubled to approximately 90 per cent.\n\nThe hotel rates are competitive considering its location, with room prices starting at \u00a3138 (S$283). It is close to major museums such as the Victoria & Albert Museum, as well as the Saatchi Gallery. The hotel's nearest tube station is Gloucester Road, which is five stops away from Piccadilly Circus.\n\nBecause the hotel is relatively small with less than 40 rooms, the staff remember all the guests' names. Not surprisingly, it receives many returning guests.\n\nIf there is one gripe this writer has, it's that the hotel is initially hard to find because it's not located on the main road.\n\nSo be sure to get precise directions on how to get there from Gloucester Station - if you're taking the train from the airport to avoid the crazy traffic into central London.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But since getting married and having a child, her music has mellowed and softened considerably.\n\nThe Light Princess is based on a Victorian fairy tale by George Macdonald. It tells of a princess who becomes completely weightless and starts to float when she refuses to cry at her mother's funeral.\n\nA turning point, however, comes when her kingdom goes to war with another and she is ordered to lead the army. Amos's music is intricate and melodic, but not terribly memorable. What's worth writing home about is the extraordinary direction by Marianne Elliott, who also helmed the hit musicals War Horse and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. In her hands, The Light Princess is a wondrous flight of fantasy, with enchanting sets and costumes. Above all, the sheer technical genius of making the princess float in the air throughout the musical is something to behold.\n\nBecause it's showing at the National Theatre, tickets are also considerably cheaper than most musicals in London, with ticket prices ranging from \u00a312 to \u00a350 (S$24.60 to $102.60).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It asserts that \"China's credit crunch bites in the third quarter, but nightmare scenarios have yet to play out\".\n\nIt notes: \"The slowdown in China is far from over, as credit rationing and fears about private and public sector debt have continued to damage the Chinese recovery.\"\n\nEmmanouil Schizas, ACCA senior economic analyst, says China's liquidity crunch is a side-effect of a deliberate policy shift, since this summer, by its central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to rein in credit growth and reallocate funds away from shadow banking, in addition to using it as a test of its liquidity tools.\n\n\"The PBOC seem to regard it as tough medicine for the banking system, and they are trying to manage the side-effects,\" Mr Schizas says, adding that the central bank appears fully aware of these side-effects, including the inevitable slower economic growth and the impact of credit tightening on small and medium enterprises which depends more on shadow banking than their bigger state-owned peers.\n\n\"The authorities are aware of this and have been pressuring banks to direct more funds towards SMEs for years now. Unfortunately, this rebalancing cannot happen as quickly as the reduction of credit, so we will be interested to see how the authorities intend to compensate for the loss of credit to SMEs,\" he adds.\n\nMr Schizas suggests that Chinese authorities have a higher threshold of tolerance for small business failures than its western counterparts and will not be rushed in their response.\n\n\"A banking crisis is unlikely but banks remaining damaged in the long term is perhaps not so impossible,\" Mr Schizas says. \"Historically, China has previous experience of successfully clearing up bad debts but this took over a decade and a very substantial amount of money.\"\n\nCredit crunch has become a recurring theme in the Chinese banking system. Following a severe crunch in June, authorities allowed credit to expand in August and September only to tighten the screw again in the next two months, with overnight interbank lending rate shooting up to 3.93 per cent on Nov 22, higher even than in June. Liquidity in the banking system has taken a breather recently after an injection of funds from the central bank.\n\nBroadly, however, liquidity remains tight outside the traditional banking system, as evident in the high yields offered by Chinese banks for their wealth management products, a major line of business in the shadow banking world. Yields for these products rose to as much as 5.37 per cent on average in the last week of November, setting a yearly record, according to statistics published by industry website yinhang.com.\n\nLouis Kuijs, chief China economist at RBS, says he expects China will maintain a firmer stance in the coming quarters. \"The tightening does affect some banks' ability to lend, mainly some smaller and mid-sized banks that fund themselves via the interbank market. It does not affect much the other, often larger banks which fund themselves via deposits,\" Mr Kuijs says.\n\nOne thing that policymakers could do is to ease up on its credit quotas to these affected banks as a way to ensure bank lending continues to expand at a reasonably pace despite a tight interbank market. The RBS team believes \"as long as core bank lending continues to expand at a reasonably solid pace, the impact on economic growth of a reduction of (shadow banking) expansion centred around lower non-bank financing can be moderate\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So mobile is getting more and more important in this game,\" said Alan Chan, CEO of Singapore Press Holdings, whose wholly owned subsidiary SPH Interactive International (SPHI) owns a third of 701Search.\n\n\"We really welcome Telenor's participation because as a mobile operator, they can bring us perspective of the mobile world,\" Mr Chan added. He was speaking at a media briefing yesterday.\n\nOn Tuesday, Telenor finalised the acquisition of a one-third stake in 701Search. Through its unit, Telenor Communications II, it bought an equal number of shares from the existing shareholders - SPHI and Norway's Schibsted Classified Media AS - as well as subscribed to additional shares in the joint- venture firm. The three partners now each own one-third of 701Search.\n\nTelenor has more than 150 million mobile customers globally, the bulk of whom are in Asia. It has a presence in Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and Myanmar.\n\n701Search occupies the same geographical orbit, operating online classified companies such as Mudah.my in Malaysia, Berniaga.com in Indonesia and Ayosdito.ph in the Philippines.\n\nWhere expansion of 701Search is concerned, Mr Chan said yesterday that the unit \"will keep looking at various countries in the region\".\n\n\"We are always prepared to explore new markets. If it works, then we will push on. If it doesn't work, then we will quickly shift our strategy,\" he added.\n\nNow, Telenor will bring the knowledge of its own customers in the market to 701Search's table, said Rolv-Erik Spilling, CEO and head of Telenor Digital, yesterday.\n\nIts experience working with other Internet players will also come in handy, with practices such as service bundling and preconfiguration of mobile handsets as possibilities. \"When you make it very easy to access, you get more traction on the service,\" Mr Spilling said.\n\nAt the same time, for Telenor, the deal represents a prime way to break into the classifieds markets in the region. Several years ago, it had attempted to do just that in Malaysia on its own but did not succeed, according to Mr Spilling.\n\n\"It's almost an art to do good classified sites,\" he said yesterday. \"Now we see that, being part of this initiative, and we will learn a lot from our customers.\n\n\"We are certainly entering a partnership which brings value from a usage and customer insight perspective.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The US will account for two-thirds of properties managed by the new global business, Westfield Corp, and income from the assets will grow by as much as 6 per cent in 2014, it said.\n\n\"This is a great addition, and it's the type of asset and location that sits neatly with Westfield's strategy,\" said Tony Sherlock, Sydney-based head of property research at Morningstar Australasia Pty.\n\n\"There's not much risk to this project, and if you want valuation upside, you want it on your balance sheet, not someone else's,\" he said.\n\nWestfield first acquired a 99-year lease interest in the retail concourse at the original trade centre six weeks before it was destroyed in the Sept 11, 2001, attacks, and sold it back to the Port Authority in December 2003. The group agreed in July 2011 to pay US$612.5 million to take a half-stake in a joint venture with the Port Authority to develop the centre. The retail complex is scheduled to open in 2015.\n\nThe project will encompass about 365,000 square feet of retail space, with another 90,000 sq ft to be added in future, according to the statement.\n\nThe Port Authority owns the 16-acre (six-hectare) site. It includes the 72-storey 4 World Trade Center, developed by Larry Silverstein, which opened last month; 1 World Trade Center, the Western Hemisphere's tallest skyscraper, set to open in January; the 9/11 memorial, a 9/11 museum, a performing arts centre and a mass-transit hub designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.\n\nWestfield's investment will allow the Port Authority to \"refocus agency resources on our core transportation mission\", chairman David Samson said in the statement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Westfield, which jointly owns malls in Australia and New Zealand with Westfield Retail Trust, proposed combining their stakes to create a new company called Scentre Group.\n\nIts overseas operations, in the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy, would become a separate entity, Westfield Corp, it said.\n\nThe move advances its attempts to distance itself from Australia and New Zealand, where it expects to see the slowest growth this year of all its markets. Westfield spun off half of its Australian and New Zealand malls into Westfield Retail Trust in 2010, and billionaire co-founder Frank Lowy and his family sold their 7.1 per cent stake in the trust in February.\n\nMr Lowy is Australia's fourth-richest individual with a net worth of US$5.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nWestfield Corp will have a US$1.2 billion share of US$1.4 billion of projects under construction, including the World Trade Center, the company said. It also plans US$9 billion of future projects including malls in London and Milan, it said.\n\nIn the US, where the group forecasts growth of as much as 5 per cent in 2014, retail sales in October recorded their biggest gain in three months, while a private gauge on consumer confidence rose in November from a month earlier, beating a preliminary reading.\n\nWestfield's acquisition of the 50 per cent stake in the World Trade Center's retail space represents a 30 per cent premium in value for the authority, according to Wednesday's statement.\n\n\"In addition, the Port Authority will have the potential to receive an additional one-time payment from Westfield within the first five years after the retail grand opening, should Westfield exceed certain agreed-upon return thresholds,\" the agency said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

COVs have consistently declined through 2013 from a peak of $35,000 in January.\n\n\"COV continued to fall and we are seeing more flats exchanging hands for zero COV or below valuation,\" said Eugene Lim, key executive officer at ERA Realty.\n\nOverall, on the month, SRX expects an estimated 1,051 resale flats to have been sold in November, down from the 1,187 units the month before.\n\nSRX data showed that 97 resale flats sold last month were transacted below their valuation price, higher than the 82 units in October. Sengkang, Choa Chu Kang, and Jurong West had the most resale HDB flats sold below valuation in November.\n\nThe overall HDB resale price index in November dipped 0.6 per cent from October to 146.9 - the lowest level since last September.\n\nMr Lim attributed the weak performance overall to a tighter mortgage servicing ratio, as well as other policies such as allowing singles to buy Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, a three-year wait before new permanent residents can buy a resale flat and an increasing supply of new flats.\n\nIn the private residential sector, resale activity was lacklustre as well.\n\nResale prices for non-landed private residential units are estimated to have fallen 1.5 per cent from the previous month to 171.5 in November - which would make it the third straight month of decline.\n\n\"Prices have continued to soften and will continue to soften with all the property cooling measures snowballing and upcoming supply,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nAll three regions saw price drops, led a by 2 per cent decline in the Core Central Region, followed by a 0.9 per cent dip for Outside Central Region and a 0.7 per cent loss in Rest of Central Region.\n\nAn estimated 387 non-landed homes were moved last month, 22.9 per cent lower than the 502 units in October.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The monthly statements include information such as their account numbers, account balances and transaction details.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said it was considering whether to take regulatory action against StanChart, even as it noted that the theft - believed to be the first such case here - was an isolated incident.\n\nHow the bank statements ended up in James Raj's laptop is unknown as police investigations are still ongoing. As of last night, he has not been charged for anything related to this incident.\n\nStanChart, which made a police report on Monday, said that no unauthorised transactions had been found as a result of the theft. The bank also informed MAS that the incident had not compromised the bank's own IT systems or infrastructure.\n\nStanChart has since contacted the affected clients \"as a precautionary measure\", adding that none of its wholesale banking clients, SME and retail customers have been affected.\n\nSpeaking at a hastily convened media briefing last night, StanChart chief executive officer Ray Ferguson issued an apology to all the bank's customers.\n\n\"The confidentiality and privacy of our clients are of paramount importance to us, and we take this incident very seriously. Customer data protection is our responsibility and we sincerely apologise to all our customers and specifically to our private bank clients who have been affected,\" he said.\n\nFuji Xerox CEO Bert Wong said the theft was the first in his company's history. \"We share (StanChart's) concerns on the theft of information on the system, and deeply regret the incident. There was unauthorised access by a third party to the server, dedicated to Standard Chartered Private Bank, in a standalone printing facility,\" he said.\n\nDespite Fuji being ignorant of the theft for eight months, Mr Wong said yesterday there has been no impact on the data of customers on any other systems of the company.\n\nIn response to separate queries by The Business Times, Fuji Xerox Global Services associate director Paul Han revealed that the data theft took place in March\n\n. The company, however, only found out about the incident when StanChart informed it on Nov 28.\n\n\"We took action as soon as we were alerted to this. A professional forensic team has been engaged to conduct a thorough review of the unauthorised access and we have since heightened our vigilance and strengthened our security infrastructure,\" said Mr Han. Bound by client confidentiality, he could not say if other banks were among its clients. He would only say that \"no other clients are at risk\".\n\nIt is understood that Fuji Xerox Singapore is also contracted to print statements for one other non-bank financial institution (FI).\n\nIn its statement, MAS noted that, globally, FIs have been facing an \"increasing number and variety\" of cyber threats. \"MAS takes a serious view of such threats and has stringent requirements in place for FIs to protect the security of their IT systems and confidentiality of client data,\" said the central bank.\n\nThese include regular vulnerability assessments, penetration tests and external audits of the effectiveness of their controls. These requirements, said MAS, apply regardless of whether such client data is processed in-house or at third-party providers.\n\nThe banking regulator added that this recent theft \"underscores the need for heightened vigilance in financial institutions, including close management of risks pertaining to service providers\".\n\nMAS has since reminded all FIs to heighten their vigilance to safeguard their IT systems and customer information, including controls at third-party service providers. MAS also said it was paying \"special supervisory attention\" to FIs' compliance with its requirements for IT outsourcing.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

A film adaptation starring Daniel Radcliffe was released early last year.\n\nThe Woman In Black is a spine-chilling thriller that frightens not with special effects but with its story. An old man named Arthur Kipps recounts a supernatural experience in his life to a young actor. It took place 30 years before when he was a junior solicitor attending a funeral, at which he saw the eponymous apparition.\n\nThough director Robin Herford, who has been with the show since it started in 1987, refrains from revealing any more of the plot, he wants people to know that The Woman In Black is far more than just your run-of-the-mill ghost story.\n\n\"People say it's a horror show, but it's not. It is a human tragedy. There is no blood. It's not about alien forces of evil from outer space or zombies. This is a human story and if you have a human sensibility you will appreciate it,\" explains Herford, who will also be playing the role of Kipps during the show's run in Singapore.\n\nAccording to him, the show is made scary not by any special effects or computer generated images, but by simple tried-and-tested theatre tricks such as lighting, sound and a manipulation of the audiences' imaginations. \"I think this show demonstrates exactly what it is that's so special about live theatre,\" says Herford. Being in the same room as the actors gives an immediacy and an impact that you don't get with an image projected onto a flat wall. You can't just shut your eyes and put your fingers in your ears. You're captive in the same room with them. And it's not just what happens on stage, the whole auditorium is part of this show, so you can never sit quite comfortably in your seat.\"\n\nThe Woman In Black runs at the Kallang Theatre from Dec 11 to Dec 15 at 8pm from Wed to Sat, and 3pm on Sat and Sun.

A new base in Hamburg will boost the number of aircraft flying out of Germany, Europe's biggest economy, to 12 by next year, by which time the carrier will run 243 routes to and from the two countries.\n\n\"We are shaking the tree,\" French regional director Francoise Bacchetta said in an interview at EasyJet's headquarters in Luton near London. Consumers have \"long-term habits from dealing with the same operator\".\n\nMounting losses have forced network airlines to slash jobs and shift short-haul operations to stand-alone units including Transavia, Hop! and Germanwings.\n\nEasyJet chief executive officer Carolyn McCall has intensified efforts to siphon off business passengers by offering allocated seats, flexible tickets, fast-tracking and higher frequencies on key routes.\n\nHer strategy has been rewarded with a 78 per cent stock gain this year, the second-best annual return since the company first sold shares to the public more than a decade ago.\n\nSome 11 million of EasyJet's 58 million customers in fiscal 2013 booked business-class seats. Ms McCall estimates that about 86 million short-haul passengers flying from Europe's top 20 airports each year could migrate to discount from network carriers.\n\nEasyJet today has 960 employees and 25 aircraft based in France, up from five jets in 2002. The carrier became the largest operator this year at Nice on the French Riviera. The airline is among the top two operators at eight out of 10 of France's biggest airports, Mr Bacchetta said, adding that Air France still controls 40 per cent of the market.\n\n\"The thing is in France, there is no French low-cost airline, so we try to be the French low-cost airline,\" Mr Bacchetta said. \"We saw the opportunity in the regions especially.\"\n\nAir France-KLM is considering reducing frequencies, shutting routes and adjusting prices for flights from provincial bases in southern France created just a year ago.\n\n\"Given the amount of disruption and seemingly interminable adjustments to the short-haul strategies of both Air France-KLM and Lufthansa, EasyJet should be able to continue to build out its fleet and route growth in France and Germany,\" Investec's James Hollins said.\n\nFrance lags behind the rest of Europe, with the low-cost proportion standing at 26 per cent versus an average of 42 per cent across the continent, Mr Bacchetta said. EasyJet operates 27 domestic routes today, competing with Air France's regional unit Hop!, which was created last year from three disparate airlines and offers point-to-point services with a fleet of 98 regional planes.\n\nAir France is also switching services to the Transavia low-cost subsidiary created by KLM, which provides non-hub flights using Boeing 737s to transport mainly leisure passengers.\n\nIn Germany, where Lufthansa is ceding all short-haul flights outside the Frankfurt and Munich hubs to its Germanwings subsidiary, EasyJet is the fifth-largest carrier, with 3.5 per cent market share. By the end of next year, the airline will employ close to 500 people in Germany, regional director Thomas Haagensen said.\n\n\"Our customers are used to comparing prices, are used to the low-cost concept, so it's almost easier to grow from that basis,\" Mr Haagensen said.\n\nGermanwings has responded to the low-cost challenge, saying last month that it will add six destinations from Hamburg from the middle of next year, including Rome and Toulouse. EasyJet in turn is targeting corporate passengers with refined schedules and new routes that link Hamburg to financial centres including Milan and Copenhagen, the executive said.\n\n\"There is great potential to stimulate the demand and increase the traffic,\" Mr Haagensen said. \"Our objective is not to steal market share from anyone.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Theatre Awards.\n\nThe one-man play tells the real-life story of Chong's search for his family's ancestry in China. Although the production was very small, the story had a humanity and universality that transcended its production scale.\n\nIt is with high expectations then that audiences watched Chong's new Mandarin play Citizen Pig last weekend, a collaboration with fellow writer-director-actor Liu Xiaoyi and staged by the Finger Players. Like Roots, Citizen Pig also employs gentle humour and pathos as it depicts the real-life struggles of Singapore tenants at the hands of mercenary landlords.\n\nChong and Liu took on multiple characters to relate how they were separately duped into renting spaces that either didn't belong to the landlord or had already been rented to other parties.\n\nTheir subsequent attempts to seek legal recourse proved futile as the legal cards were largely stacked against them.\n\nThe point that both men make is that, however \"fair\" Singapore makes out its system to be, it still favours the rich and penalises the rest. Legal services, for one, come at such exorbitant costs that the average Singaporean has to think twice about before seeking. Using a minimalist stage design once again, Chong together with Liu have managed to craft a clear and concise story that would resonate with most ordinary Singaporeans.\n\nAnd though, admittedly, Citizen Pig does not have the far-reaching universality that Roots has - not because of the subject but its narrower treatment of the subject - it is still a heartfelt, humanistic work.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The entire four storeys have been converted into a dramatically-lit Hollywood movie studio where a story of ambition and murder unfolds.\n\nBut you won't be told the story in a straightforward fashion. And you won't really get to sit down and watch it either. You are made to wear a masquerade ball mask, cut yourself off from your companions (unless you choose to stay with them), explore the space on your own, and piece the narrative together.\n\nIn every room, painstakingly designed to evoke a certain bygone era, a set of actors play out hypnotic scenarios that ranges from the funny to the tragic to the flat-out creepy. Together, they tell the story of a young actor and actress who are willing to sacrifice everything - including their marriage - for a slice of Hollywood stardom.\n\nYou find yourself moving from room to room, almost in a daze, as the action takes place around you. Sometimes, if you're lucky, they burst into beautifully choreographed dance routines just inches from you. And because you're watching a live show in a movie studio setting, the lines between the actual and illusory, the story and the story they're filming, become very blurred.\n\nYet despite the fragmented nature of the scenes, the production is structured so ingeniously that you find yourself converging with other audiences for the play's stunning finale.\n\nIf you're looking for a stage production that gives you real bang for your buck, The Drowned Man would be it: for its standard ticket price of \u00a347.50 (S$98), you get to watch all the action up close - instead of somewhere up in the circles had you opted for a similar-priced ticket to a hit musical.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At 17 years of age it should be quite mature. It had been some time since I last drank one and it would be interesting to see how this 1996, the first vintage of Cims had matured. It was very enjoyable, its colour showing just a tinge of brown against a deep red.\n\nThere was an aroma of fresh ripe fruit, and the palate showed surprisingly good freshness and the taste of well-ripened fruit.

Service costs on the four-engine jet would fall to the equivalent of two powerplants to improve its economics.\n\nAirbus stopped building the plane in November 2011 after customers picked up more fuel-efficient two-engine models such as Boeing's 777 and the shorter Airbus A330. Adding more seats would underpin Airbus's efforts to bolster the A340's value in the secondary market as operators renew their fleets.\n\n\"This will revolutionise A340 economics,\" Airbus chief operating officer John Leahy said in a e-mail following the presentation, where engine makers Rolls Royce and CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and Safran, also spoke to a group of about 100 people with an interest in A340 values.\n\nThe new high-density version of the A340 would compare to the A340-600 that can seat 359 in a two-class layout. The A340 can seat nine abreast in seats 16.7 inches wide, said the Toulouse, France-based aircraft maker, which has been publicly pushing for an 18-inch seat standard for long-range planes.\n\nThe 8 per cent increase in capacity would translate to a potential US$5.5 million in extra revenue per year, according to the presentation at the London gathering, which sought to assure A340 customers of the residual value of their asset.\n\nThe extra seat count would bring the A340 close to the capacity of the largest four-engine aircraft, the Boeing 747 jumbo and the A380 double-decker. A handful of airlines have also boosted jet capacity, and operating economics, by cramming large numbers of economy seats onto existing air frames.\n\nDemand for the A340 shrank after large twin-engine models such as Boeing's 777 won regulatory approval for the long over-water flights that were once the domain of four-engine planes. Airbus built 377 A340s, of which 359 remained in operation at the end of October.\n\nLufthansa, Europe's second largest carrier, is the biggest operator of the A340, with 48 still in service. The German airline said that it plans to fly the aircraft for some time, and that the residual value is irrelevant for the airline.\n\nCFM makes the turbines for the A340-300 with Rolls-Royce as the sole powerplant provider for the larger A340-500 and -600 models.\n\nRolls-Royce may ease the terms of long-term maintenance agreements that it calls TotalCare to better suit second-hand operators. Leased engines may also be provided, said the London-based company, which operates a small turbine leasing unit. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

In response to a glut of new vessels, operators such as AP Moeller-Maersk A/S are forming alliances with competitors to lower costs and eliminate excess capacity on trade routes.\n\nThe billionaire Luksic family controls CSAV with a 46 per cent stake. The Luksic's holding company Quinenco SA has put more than US$1 billion into CSAV in the past two years after the company lost a record US$1.25 billion in 2011.\n\nTop executives of Hapag-Lloyd and CSAV last month met in Miami to discuss a possible merger, Die Welt reported on its website, without saying where it got the information.\n\nHapag-Lloyd is owned by a group of shareholders including German tourism company TUI AG, HSH Nordbank AG and the city of Hamburg. TUI, which holds a 22 per cent stake, has endorsed an initial public offering of the shipping company.\n\nCEO Friedrich Joussen on Nov 7 said he doesn't expect an exit through an IPO before Hapag-Lloyd's Rolf Habben-Jansen replaces current CEO Michael Behrendt next July.\n\nHapag-Lloyd formed an alliance in Asia-Europe trade, called G6, in March 2012.

We collect our data in local currency, but for the purposes of the rankings, we convert all prices to USD.\n\n\"Regionally, Singapore may be down one spot, but that doesn't indicate that prices have fallen. On the contrary, prices here have risen by about 3 per cent in comparison to the previous year.\"\n\nPrices elsewhere - China and Hong Kong, for instance - were up one per cent over the year, but Mr Quane stressed that the Republic was \"still considered competitive\".\n\nInflation rates in Indonesia and India are more than 8 per cent, \"so we still see that Singapore, relative to other competing locations in the region, is cheaper\".\n\nHe pointed out that Singapore is still less expensive than Tokyo, Shanghai, and Seoul - major developed locations that compete with it for talent and for foreign investment.\n\n\"So Singapore does remain relatively competitive, I think.\"\n\nGlobally, Singapore inched up one place to become the 30th-most expensive location worldwide for expatriates.\n\nMr Quane said: \"Again, this is all due to relative movements. Locations which were previously ranked as being more expensive than Singapore have now fallen in our rankings. The Australian dollar, for example, has depreciated against the USD by approximately 15 per cent, so places like Sydney, Melbourne and Perth have all fallen below Singapore this time.\"\n\nThe top three most expensive cities are Caracas, Luanda and Oslo, in that order; Manhattan was ranked 33rd.\n\nThe survey, conducted to help companies calculate the remuneration packages for employees being sent on overseas assignments, compares a basket of like-for-like consumer goods and services commonly bought by expatriates in 440 locations worldwide.\n\nSince accommodation rentals, car purchases and school fees are typically compensated for in a separate benefits package, ECA International's survey does not take such items of expenditure into account.\n\nEven if it does, Mr Quane said he does not think Singapore's regional ranking would shift substantially.\n\nHe expects Singapore to remain in the top 10 most expensive locations in the region in the years to come.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Deutsche Bank received the biggest fine of 725.36 million euros.\n\nThe European Commission said it would continue to investigate Credit Agricole, HSBC, JPMorgan and brokerage ICAP for similar offences.\n\nRoger McCormick, who is a former partner with City law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, is leading a team of seven in the Conduct Costs Project of the London School of Economics.\n\nSo far, the calculations from regulator and bank reports, legal and other public information has involved only ten banks which were given the opportunity to assess and comment on the calculations.\n\nThe budget from the UK Higher Education Innovation Fund was a shoestring \u00a337,000, but Prof McCormick wants to broaden the study to include a larger number.\n\nThe aim is to keep it rolling over for a five-year period and possibly include other costs, for example, rogue trader losses which are generally the result of poor compliance and management.\n\nBank of America has paid the price for being the \"worst offender\" and has had to fork out \u00a330.4 billion.\n\nIncluding provisions for future costs, amounting to \u00a323.6 billion, the total expense between 2008 and end 2012 is calculated at a whopping \u00a354 billion.\n\nJP Morgan, which recently received considerable publicity over a settlement of US$13 billion, had total costs of \u00a324.7 billion at the end of 2012 and UBS a similar amount.\n\nLloyds Banking Group heads UK banks with conduct costs of \u00a39.24 billion followed by HSBC at \u00a36.3 billion and Barclays, \u00a35.1 billion.\n\nStandard Chartered is not included but it made a settlement of US$667 million with the US authorities for alleged unacceptable finance and relationships, notably entities in Iran.\n\n\"The fundamental question is whether these costs will start going down soon, if these banks now have sound ethical cultures? If not, why not?,\" asks Prof McCormick.\n\n\"Banks are required by regulators to 'know your customer', but do we know as much as we should about them?\"\n\n\"Despite ongoing scandals, they say they are, at last, trying to be more ethical than in the past and determined to restore public trust. How can we test that? Is it just the latest PR message or is there some substance to it?\"\n\nProf McCormick advises customers to change banks if they do not perform as promised even though it could be a time consuming administrative hassle to move.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its success building one of the nation's biggest warehouse landlords has garnered far less attention.\n\nIndCor Properties Inc, the Chicago-based industrial real estate company that Blackstone formed in 2010, has more than doubled in size since its inception and continues to make acquisitions. Demand for US warehouse space is outpacing construction, leading to higher lease rates and declining vacancies as spending by consumers and businesses recovers.\n\n\"It's an essential part of the economy as we move goods around the country,\" Frank Cohen, Blackstone's senior managing director overseeing industrial investments, said in a telephone interview. \"You don't just need it in New York or Los Angeles. You need toothpaste everywhere. The tile guy needs tiles, or plumbing supplies, everywhere.\"\n\nBlackstone, the largest private-equity real estate firm, began buying industrial property in a depressed market, in many cases acquiring assets whose owners had purchased them close to the market's 2007 peak and were hurt by a plunge in values after the credit crisis. IndCor's crown jewel is 20 million square feet of warehouses, mainly in California, that it acquired from Walton Street Capital LLC by amassing positions in the underlying debt.\n\n\"Traditional, high-quality industrial has been very sought after by investors, so it was very hard for us to buy it prior to the market downturn,\" Mr Cohen said.\n\nInvestors of late have been focused on hotel, retail and rental-housing deals by Blackstone's real estate arm, a testament to the breadth of its property empire.\n\nIts Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc, the world's largest hotel operator, is planning an initial public offering (IPO) of as much as US$2.4 billion, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. That would surpass Hyatt Hotels Corp's US$1.09 billion sale in November 2009 as the largest lodging IPO.\n\nIndCor's holdings exceed 100 million sq ft. That makes it about the same size as the largest real estate investment trust (Reit) focused on US industrial properties: Indianapolis- based Duke Realty Corp, which has 121 million sq ft of distribution space in the nation and a US$4.9 billion market value.\n\nThe biggest warehouse Reit is San Francisco-based Prologis Inc, with 562 million sq ft in 21 countries, including about 280 million sq ft in the US.\n\n\"IndCor has been buying like crazy,\" said Rene Circ, director of industrial research at CoStar Group Inc's Property and Portfolio Research division in Chicago. \"They've been focusing on large, large portfolios.\"\n\nMr Cohen declined to comment on whether Blackstone plans to sell IndCor or take it public.\n\nThe three-month rolling average price for industrial buildings peaked at US$78.60 per square foot in October 2007, and fell to a low of US$47.12 psf in November 2009, data from Real Capital Analytics Inc shows. Prices have since climbed to US$77.06 psf. Industrial-property purchases rose to almost US$32 billion from January through September, up from US$24 billion a year earlier, according to the New York- based research firm.\n\nTwo deals that kicked off IndCor, among 10 transactions Blackstone has made to build the company, were purchases from Eaton Vance Corp funds and Prologis totalling almost 41 million sq ft.\n\nBlackstone typically looks for assets that need work to increase their value. The firm has acquired warehouses that have vacancies higher than the national average and are in key distribution markets, including smaller cities, said Tim Beaudin, IndCor's chief executive officer.\n\n\"With this recovering market we've had a lot of success,\" he said. Many of the properties were in need of increased leasing, capital investment and improved management, Mr Beaudin said. \"We look for assets that need some tender, loving care.\"\n\nAnother purchase now part of IndCor's holdings was about 16.5 million sq ft acquired in stages from sellers including Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and Prologis. Those transactions included Blackstone Real Estate Partners VII's acquisition of a Reno, Nevada, industrial portfolio for US$427 million in August.\n\nThe fund also has agreed to buy about 7 million sq ft from Pacific Life Insurance Co, including warehouses in Reno, in a deal of about US$320 million set for completion by the end of the year, said a person with knowledge of the agreement.\n\nIndCor has increased occupancies in Reno, and rents are starting to rise, Mr Beaudin said.\n\n\"That market had been kind of beaten down,\" he said. \"We see that market being very, very good to us.\"\n\nThe fundamentals of the US industrial market are likely to keep improving for the next 3-5 years, Mr Beaudin said. Internet stores such as Amazon.com Inc and traditional retailers are leasing more space in distribution centres, helping reduce vacancies.\n\nRising industrial production, increased trade and growing business inventories also have helped support demand for warehouse space, said Jared Sullivan, senior economist with CBRE Econometric Advisors, part of Los Angeles-based commercial-property brokerage CBRE Group Inc.\n\n\"That's why people are excited about industrial real estate right now,\" Mr Sullivan said. \"The seeds are there for continued strength in the sector.\"\n\nAlso helping industrial owners such as Blackstone is a decline in warehouse and distribution-centre construction. About 59 million sq ft of industrial real estate will be added in the US this year, down from the pre-recession average of about 150 million sq ft annually, according to CBRE.\n\n\"We'll build as many industrial warehouses this year in the US as were built in 1955,\" Mr Cohen said.\n\nIndustrial availability in US metropolitan areas fell to 11.7 per cent in the third quarter from 13 per cent a year earlier, data from CBRE shows. Warehouse landlords have had 12 consecutive quarters of net occupancy gains, starting in the fourth quarter of 2010, according to Reis Inc, a New York-based real estate research firm.\n\nIndustrial rents will climb 4.4 per cent next year and 4.6 per cent in 2015, according to a CBRE forecast. The availability rate probably will fall to 11.2 per cent next year, and 11.1 per cent by the end of 2015, the firm said.\n\nRental growth this year is projected to outpace inflation for the first time since 2006. CoStar expects rents to continue gaining and return to pre-recession highs by the first half of 2016, Mr Circ said.\n\n\"Rents are definitely still on the rise,\" he said. \"We've had a decent year.\"\n\nRent and occupancy improvements have been a boon for warehouse landlords. A Bloomberg index of seven industrial Reits has returned 8.6 per cent including reinvested dividends this year, making it the third-best performer among Reits, after hotels and self-storage. First Industrial Realty Trust Inc, a Chicago-based company with 62.5 million sq ft of space in 25 states, is the best performer in the warehouse index this year, rising 22 per cent through Monday.\n\nPrices for warehouses are increasing as well. The three-month rolling average capitalisation rate for US industrial property was 7.6 per cent in October, compared with a high of 9.2 per cent four years earlier, according to Real Capital Analytics. (A measure of yield, cap rates fall as prices rise.)\n\nInvesting in industrial real estate isn't risk-free. A slowdown in the global economy, hurting worldwide trade, would cut demand for US warehouse and distribution-centre space, said Craig Guttenplan, a Reit analyst at CreditSights Inc in London. Absent such a decline, IndCor may find it difficult to keep expanding as rents and occupancies rise.\n\n\"There are still some interesting opportunities out there - just not as many as in the last few years,\" Mr Cohen said.\n\nIt may still be a year or two before the industrial properties' performance is improved and Blackstone begins to decide how to exit the IndCor investment, either by taking the company public or through a sale, Mr Beaudin said. Blackstone is \"still trying to stabilise what we have\", he said.\n\n\"There seems to be, among the people who invest in this asset class, excitement about the possibility\" of an IPO, Mr Cohen said. \"What we've assembled is basically a really simple, high-quality national industrial portfolio.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

However, load factors are showing signs of bottoming out after a year of continued decline, Iata noted.\n\nThe airfreight market was also stronger in October compared to the month before, when traffic contracted 0.3 per cent.\n\nPerformance differed among the regions in October, though Africa was the only one to experience a decline.\n\nAsia-Pacific carriers, which account for nearly 40 per cent of global cargo traffic, rebounded with volumes increasing by 2 per cent in October after posting year-on-year declines throughout 2013. However, this was outstripped by a 4.1 per cent bump in capacity, resulting in a load factor of 56.2 per cent.\n\nThe expansion in cargo traffic in the region came on the back of a pick-up in regional trade as a result of a stronger Chinese economy, where manufacturing activity hit a seven-month high during the month.\n\nIata noted that both export and import volumes in emerging markets in Asia were up, vis-a-vis a decline in the middle of the year, which \"bodes well\" for further growth in coming months.\n\nMiddle Eastern carriers chalked up double-digit growth of 12.3 per cent, after slowing in September because of Ramadan. Capacity was just slightly under, growing at 12.1 per cent, while cargo load factor worked out to 45.4 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, European and North American airlines saw growth of 4.4 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively. In Europe, the recovery is fragile, given that Q3 growth slowed to 0.1 per cent from 0.3 per cent in Q2, Iata said, adding that weak growth for the rest of the year should result in \"further modest expansion\" in European freight traffic.\n\nIn Africa, traffic was down 2.7 per cent compared with a year ago, continuing a trend seen for several months. While trade volumes in Africa are rising, competition on key trade routes is stiff, and the insufficient infrastructure and political stability remain challenges.\n\nTony Tyler, Iata's director-general, said: \"Since mid-year, we have seen modest but sustained growth in cargo fed by stronger business confidence and improving trade flows. Air cargo is still a very tough business. Matching capacity to demand has been difficult in an environment where passenger traffic is growing more robustly. There is some evidence that the fall in load factors has stabilised, but yields remain under pressure.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It also operates online fashion retailer The Iconic, which serves Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe Singapore-headquartered group was started by Rocket Internet, a start-up incubator set up by German brothers Marc, Oliver and Alexander Samwer, and has added new investors since.\n\nIn May this year, it announced investments of US$100 million from Summit Partners, Investment AB Kinnevik, Verlinvest and German retail group Tengelmann. This comes after it secured a 20 million euro (S$34 million) investment from Tengelmann in March.\n\nThe latest round of financing will enable the group to beef up its operations and strengthen its foothold in South-east Asia and Australia, which have a collective market of 600 million consumers. This will include expanding its portfolio of products, investing in IT as well as raising service standards.\n\nMichele Ferrario, managing director of Zalora, said: \"We are focused on offering the best possible customer experience paired with a unique product offering of local and international brands. We will use this new investment to improve our position as the high-street fashion authority in South-east Asia. We will grow our assortment and further enhance the portfolio of our private labels.\"\n\nZalora was started in February last year with its Singapore and Malaysia websites, and hit the one million order mark in May this year. It offers around 130,000 products and more than 500 international brands, and sees about 17.9 million unique visitors to its regional websites each month.\n\n\"We believe e-commerce in South-east Asia will be very big, much bigger than it is today,\" said Mr Ferrario. Nonetheless, areas such as logistics and payment avenues can be a challenge, he added.\n\nZalora offers a cash payment on delivery option to accommodate markets where credit card penetration is lower, and this has proven a popular choice among consumers in countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nWhile declining to reveal actual revenue figures, the group said revenue has been growing over 15 per cent month-on-month. It had said previously that it had achieved annualised double-digit million (USD) revenues and employs more than 1,000 staff.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Set to a carnival theme, it is said to be the most ambitious effort in the concert's nine-year history.\n\nNearly every aspect of the show - from its programme highlights to its elaborate set and costumes - is designed to evoke the atmosphere of a circus.\n\nThe 110-minute extravaganza is jointly organised by The Business Times and The Straits Times, and aimed at raising funds for the The Business Times Budding Artists Fund (BTBAF) and The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (SPMF). Three shows will be held tomorrow and Saturday at Marina Bay Sands, the official venue partner.\n\nSome 170 performers aged 19 and under will perform before a live audience. They include Circus Infinity, comprising 11 performers aged 13-16, some of whom will walk on balls or stilts while performing magic tricks.\n\nAmong the musical talents is 11-year-old Ariadna Padron Yassin, whose moving, pitch-perfect rendition of Emile Sande's ballad Clown belies her youth.\n\nAnother highlight is 19-year-old Tim Ng's jazzy vocals and guitar-playing in a mid-tempo interpretation of Britney Spears' dance-floor hit Oops! I Did It Again, which is easily worthy of being recorded and sold on iTunes.\n\nThen there's the Animato Quad, a group of four teenage boys who will jointly put their eight hands to a shared piano keyboard - while delivering comic gags.\n\nLast year's concert raised a record $2.01 million for financially disadvantaged children. The organisers hope to top that figure this year.\n\nThe show's youngest singer, six-year-old Anne- Sophie Cazaubon, said: \"I've sung at other concerts before, but this concert is special because I get to perform for two really good causes benefiting kids.\"\n\nTickets for the concert tomorrow and on Saturday at $18, $28 and $38 (excluding booking fees) are still available from the Marina Bay Sands website, www.marinabaysands.com/ticketing and also at the Marina Bay Sands theatre box office, SkyPark, ArtScience Museum and MBS retail mall concierge.

It was not a coincidence.\n\nIn 2010, Mr Thien said, he rented an empty lot downtown here, where construction had largely stopped, and installed a grill. He added some homemade wooden furniture intended to conjure the image of a saloon - a motif inspired by his love of US Westerns. Word of his movable feasts began to spread on Facebook, and within months he was renting 15 lots for the equivalent of US$1,000-5,000 a month.\n\nBut as construction picks up again, Mr Thien, 32, is down to five locations. Some of his former grill sites are dotted with cranes or cement mixers, and he predicts that in three years he will be forced to pursue an entirely new line of work.\n\nVietnam's beleaguered property market is bottoming out just as macroeconomic indicators stabilise and the ruling Communist Party makes new pledges to reform a struggling and corruption-riddled banking sector, say developers and businesspeople here, the country's commercial capital. And if Vietnam signs onto the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a proposed trade agreement that involves a dozen countries, including the United States, it may bolster the Vietnamese economy and speed a real estate recovery.\n\nYet although lending rates have fallen to 12.8 per cent, from 20.3 per cent in 2011, no one in Vietnam knows whether the market can rebound to the peaks it hit before 2008, much less whether the government's statistics or commitments to banking reform are reliable. For the moment, the mid- to high-end apartment markets remain oversupplied in this city and in the capital, Hanoi.\n\n\"It's going to be another year before things get clearer - it's rather opaque at this point,\" said Trinh Bao Quoc, chief executive at Son Kim Land Corp, a local developer. \"But if you talk to foreign investors, a lot of them who are here in Vietnam know that this is a good time to buy.\"\n\nIn this city, asking rates for office rentals, now at about US$20-30 per square metre (or about 10 square feet), began to rise in late 2012 for the first time since 2007, according to Los Angeles-based real estate company CBRE. And in recent months, average selling prices for low-end residential properties in Hanoi have held steady around US$800 psm after falling precipitously for two years.\n\nSome foreign investors have bought real estate here this year, in what brokers suggest is a sign of rising liquidity and investor confidence. And a few major construction projects are in the pipeline, including a tower that will include Vietnam's first Ritz-Carlton.\n\nAnd in July, Vingroup, a real estate developer in Vietnam, opened the country's largest shopping mall, which has a gross floor area of more than 200,000 sq m, or 2.1 million sq ft. A company spokesman said 53 per cent of the 4,518 units at a new apartment complex nearby had already been sold, and 29 per cent of them were leased for 50 years.\n\n\"We believe the real estate market is recovering well now and we are expecting a positive turnaround by the end of this year or early next year,\" said Le Thi Thu Thuy, chief executive of Vingroup.\n\nBut Vietnam's economy has underperformed relative to predictions that accompanied its 2007 entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO), and its annual growth rate of about 5.3 per cent is the slowest in more than a decade. A central obstacle to economic recovery is that local banks are saddled with bad debts linked to speculative property investments.\n\nCredit has tightened in the years since the market began to sour in 2008, and in July the government created an asset management firm tasked with buying bad debts in the banking sector. In September, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung also pledged to raise the cap on foreign ownership in local banks to 49 per cent from 30 per cent.\n\nBut analysts say many of the bad debts are still linked to real estate.\n\n\"There are early indicators that the market is beginning to move,\" said Stephen Wyatt, Vietnam country director at Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL). \"It doesn't take away the fact that the banking sector still has to work itself out.\"\n\nVietnamese lawmakers have debated draft laws aimed at allowing foreigners to buy more than one apartment unit, secure apartment leasehold rights longer than the current limit of 50 years and buy land, David Lim, a Ho Chi Minh City lawyer who is advising the government on land reform, said last month.\n\nMr Lim said the draft laws were codifying years of piecemeal reforms and clearing up grey areas. They are likely to help the country compete with its Southeast Asian neighbours for foreign investment, he added.\n\nAnd some local developers are changing their habit of building high-rise apartment towers with only wealthy consumers in mind, according to real estate brokers. JLL's Mr Wyatt said low-end buyers dominated residential sales in this city, and a typical case is a 50-70 sq m (540-750 sq ft) apartment that sells for the equivalent of about US$30,000.\n\nDon Lam, chief executive of the fund manager VinaCapital, said that many middle-class Vietnamese couples were more interested in townhouses than high-rise apartments and that his company was focusing on a potential new growth area: US-style gated communities on the city's outer fringes, with three-bedroom units priced at the equivalent of about US$200,000. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

He didn't give a timeline or further specifics about the changes.\n\n\"Our team is committed to making a thorough and detailed review of processes before implementing a more complete and perfect safety plan,\" Mr Yamamura told reporters. \"Great haste makes great waste.\"\n\nAsiana said in September that it would increase the number of hours of flight-simulation training for its pilots to approach airports without landing-guidance systems. The carrier's manual flying skills and cockpit teamwork are under investigation in the US following the crash of Asiana flight 214, which struck a seawall short of the San Francisco airport on July 6, killing three people.\n\nThe airline also said it would hire another company to evaluate its procedures, add safety specialists and boost maintenance. South Korea's government is also reviewing plans to improve airline safety standards, including steeper penalties for accidents that involve casualties and better pilot training.\n\nMr Yamamura, 65, joined Asiana on Dec 1 to help revamp the airline's safety programme. Before that, he worked for All Nippon Airways as a pilot and safety officer.\n\nAsiana's stock has fallen 21 per cent this year, compared with a 0.3 per cent decline in the benchmark Kospi index.\n\nMr Yamamura said he will attend the National Transportation Safety Board's investigative hearing on the San Francisco accident next week in Washington.\n\nWhile flying airplanes on automated system has contributed significantly to safety of flights, the training programme is important, he said.\n\n\"If pilots are properly trained, there should be no problem for them to use autopilot to fly the airplanes safer,\" Mr Yamamura said. \"The design concept of automation is working very well to make flights much easier. Easier means safer.\"\n\nThe probe's focus on manual flying skills follows the crash that took place after instruments proved insufficient.\n\nCo-pilot Lee Kang Kuk, who had only 43 hours of experience flying a Boeing 777 model, was using a visual approach the day of the accident because the instrument landing system's glide slope, which helps line up the correct path to the runway, was closed for construction. Former Asiana pilots and trainers have said in interviews that the company's pilots were well trained on automatic systems and rarely flew manually.\n\nSince the accident, the South Korean government has been working to strengthen regulations on air safety standards.\n\nThe government is considering imposing stricter penalties starting as early as next year. Airlines that have accidents that result in less than five casualties can be ordered to stop operating for 30 days under current rules. More often, the punishment is a 500 million won (S$591,000) penalty.\n\nThe government also plans to tighten regulations on pilot training and issuances of operating licences to low-cost carriers, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.

The rest was an initial capital injection, according to the company website. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

Since 2000, he has taken Blackstone's hedge-fund-of-funds business from barely a blip on the radar screen to the No 1 spot. Its US$53 billion in assets are more than double its nearest competitor's.\n\nAt a presentation for analysts in May 2012, Mr Hill described his business as \"the largest investor in hedge funds in the world\". A typical Blackstone fund may be subdivided among a dozen or more hedge fund managers, such as William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, Paul Singer of Elliott Associates or Andrew Hall, the former Citigroup oil trader.\n\nMr Hill has succeeded not by posting titanic returns but by offering the funds to institutions such as public pension funds as a safer alternative to stocks without as much volatility.\n\nIts US$8 billion flagship Blackstone Partners Offshore Fund returned 6.3 per cent annually from 2000 through 2012, according a Blackstone presentation in mid-2013 obtained from another investor.\n\nWhile it may look unexciting, that return beat global stock markets, as measured by the MSCI World Index, which returned 1.9 per cent annually in the same period. The reason: The Blackstone fund posted healthy gains when markets tumbled in 2000-\n\n2002, and its 15.6 per cent drop in 2008 was less than half the 40.3 per cent market decline.\n\nBuilding this business organically has left some of Blackstone's rivals such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co, the Carlyle Group and Apollo Global Management trying to compete through acquisitions or hiring teams, said Marc Irizarry, who follows money management firms for Goldman Sachs. Carlyle announced such an acquisition last week. The division now accounts for more than one-fifth of Blackstone's total assets under management.\n\nThis year, Blackstone has focused on the market for individual investors who may want such hedge fund vehicles in their portfolios. In August, it started a US$1 billion mutual fund for wealthy clients of Fidelity Investments.\n\nInstitutions have 25 per cent of their assets in alternatives to stocks and bonds, such as private equity, hedge funds and real estate, but individuals have only 2 per cent, which Blackstone's president, Hamilton James, says \"shows you the massive potential that retail has\".\n\nThe second act for Mr Hill, who is 65, has helped him become Blackstone's third-highest-paid executive officer, with 2012 compensation of US$13.7 million. He also owns US$506 million worth of Blackstone stock and has sold US$45 million worth since the firm went public in 2007, according to InsiderScore, which tracks such sales.\n\nHe has homes in Manhattan, East Hampton, Paris and Telluride, Colorado, where he likes to ski. He also has a growing art collection including works by Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon and Brice Marden. His 32 Renaissance and Baroque bronzes will be featured in an exhibition that opens in January at the Frick Collection.\n\nAt Lehman, with the 1980s merger mania in full swing, one former banker recalls that the hypercompetitive Hill would know exactly how much he weighed before and after workouts in the firm's gym, where he would sometimes do sit-ups non-stop for 15 minutes. But after three years as co-chief executive alongside Richard Fuld, Mr Hill was ousted by Harvey Golub, the chief executive of American Express.\n\nHis front-page ouster from Lehman \"was a very jarring experience\", Mr Hill recalled. \"It was very hurtful as well because I thought I had done a good job\" engineering merchant banking buyouts that helped the firm's profits for the next few years. \"You deal with the reality of trying to reinvent yourself, and the test of anybody is how they do in adversity.\"\n\nWhen Mr Hill took over the fund-of-funds business in 2000, it managed US$1.3 billion, one quarter of it for the firm itself and its partners. Referring to his days as a mergers-and-acquisitions (M&A) banker, Mr Hill said he used \"an M&A approach instead of a product approach\", building the business by asking clients what they needed \"and not trying to sell them something\".\n\nOne of Mr Hill's first big clients, the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System, asked Blackstone to create a market-neutral fund in 2001, and eventually invested US$1.3 billion in it. Five years later, the retirement fund's chief investment officer, Peter Gilbert, told Mr Hill at an investors' meeting of a problem the retirement fund was encountering in investing in a well-known commodity index, as an inflation hedge, because of differences between futures and spot prices.\n\nMr Hill was able to find traders who could match or beat the index, including Mr Hall, who was working then at the Phibro trading unit of Citigroup. \"It didn't just solve our problem, it created a new business line for them,\" Mr Gilbert said.- NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

Last month's tender for two adjacent plots at Upper Serangoon View got eight bids each, with foreign developers continuing to outbid local players.\n\nThe increase in the private property price index has moderated since Q3 2009, with the average quarter-on-quarter rise of 0.67 per cent in the first three quarters of 2013 lower than the 0.70 per cent for 2012 and 1.43 per cent for 2011, the Review said.\n\nMomentum has varied across different market segments. Prices of private residential properties in the Outside Central Region on average increased by 2.5 per cent per quarter in 2013. In contrast, prices in the Rest of Central Region and the Core Central Region have started to show some weakness, turning negative in Q3 2013.\n\nOverall transactions have fallen by about a third while investment/speculative demand for home loans has halved.\n\nAverage monthly transactions fell to 2,100 units in the first 10 months of this year from 3,200 units last year. The fall in overall sales was driven by resale transactions, which fell by about half in 2013 (from an average of 1,100 units per month in 2012 to 600 units in 2013). New sales also dropped significantly to an average of 900 units per month between July and October 2013 (compared with an average of 1,600 units per month between 2011 and 2012) following the implementation of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework in end-June. Sub-sale activity has remained subdued.\n\nThe measures appear to have had a dampening effect on the growth of outstanding housing loans, with the year-on-year growth slowing from a peak of 22 per cent in September 2010 to 12 per cent in September 2013.\n\nThe volume of new housing loans, which reflects trends in overall demand in the property market, has contracted to $8.8 billion in Q3 2013 from $13.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe share of new housing loans with LTV ratios higher than 70 per cent has also fallen from a peak of 77 per cent in Q2 2010 to stabilise at about 66 per cent since 2012.\n\nFor outstanding housing loans, the share of loans with LTVs above 70 per cent has fallen from a high of 35 per cent in Q3 2009 to 26 per cent in Q3 2013. The share of housing loans in negative equity also remains negligible.\n\nThe average LTV ratio of outstanding housing loans was 47.3 per cent in Q3 2013. The asset quality of property-related loans remains robust with the non-performing loan (NPL) ratio at less than 0.5 per cent in Q3 2013.\n\nSpeculators seemed to have left the market in droves, with foreign buyers under 10 per cent. \"Borrowers taking up a second or subsequent housing loan accounted for about 30 per cent of new housing loans in 2011. This share has dipped to 14 per cent in Q3 2013,\" said the Review.\n\nThe share of foreign purchases in total transactions continues to be small, at 9 per cent in Q3 2013 following the implementation of additional buyer stamp duty.\n\nFurthermore, the average loan tenure of new housing loans has shortened from 30 years in Q3 2012, to about 24 years.\n\nWhile the NPL ratio for housing loans remains low, close monitoring is warranted, it said.\n\n\"Strains on borrowers can quickly materialise if the economic outlook and employment conditions worsen, or interest rates - and therefore mortgage repayments - increase.\n\nThe vast majority of mortgage loans offered by financial institutions in Singapore are floating-rate packages. As some households may have over-leveraged in order to buy properties which are priced higher now than before, strains can quickly materialise if interest rates rise after being at a low level for a prolonged period of time.\"\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore estimates that about 5-10 per cent of borrowers have monthly debt-servicing burden greater than 60 per cent and that the percentage of over-leveraged households could increase to 10-15 per cent should mortgage rates rise by 300 basis points.\n\nThe Review also noted the ample supply situation. In Q3 2013, there was a total supply of about 84,900 uncompleted private residential units from projects in the pipeline, an increase of about 13 per cent compared with the average supply in the last three years. Of these uncompleted units, about 37 per cent remained unsold in Q3 2013.\n\nApart from these, there were also 12,400 executive condominium (EC) units in the pipeline.\n\nIn addition, another 10,000 units will soon be added to the pipeline supply. In all, there will be about 107,400 private housing and EC units in the pipeline, many of which are expected to be completed over the next three to four years.\n\n\"While the property-related measures taken over the past few years have dampened momentum in the property market, vigilance is needed.\n\n\"Price levels remain high. The government will continue to monitor the property market closely, and if necessary, step in to ensure stability and sustainability in the property market,\" the Review said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Oil importers won't be allowed to buy more from Iran and EU and US sanctions on NITC remain in place.\n\n\"We hope that the recent developments reached on political levels will ease restrictions on our fleet and will smooth business grounds for those who are willing to work with us,\" NITC chairman Ali Safaei said on Monday.\n\nMost of NITC tankers delivered Iran's oil to the nation's customers since sanctions intensified, Mr Safaei said. The ships sailed to markets including China, India, South Korea and Taiwan since July last year, when European measures barred most non-Iranian tankers from the trade.\n\nNITC has a fleet of 37 very large crude carriers, which can typically hold about two million barrels of oil, according to Clarkson plc, the biggest shipbroker. The largest publicly traded owner of the vessels is Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd in Tokyo, with a fleet of 32, the broker's data show.\n\nThe way in which the EU and US intend to ease sanctions means NITC is unlikely to benefit, said Andrew Bardot, the secretary and executive officer of the International Group of P&I Clubs in London. The group's members cover about 90 per cent of the global merchant fleet for risks including oil spills.\n\nWhile Europe plans to suspend an insurance ban that stopped almost all international ship owners from calling at Iranian ports, NITC will still have to rely on a domestic insurer, Mr Bardot said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

This probably suggests that the electronics improvement will be sustained into Q1 2014 amid improved global demand conditions.\"\n\nThe electronics inventory index spiked up 7 points to 53.4 in November, which prompted CIMB economist Song Seng Wun to note: \"The increase looks quite significant, but coming from (October's reading of) 46.4 - which was a two- year low - I suspect it's just inventory restocking, and I'm not concerned as yet.\"\n\nNovember's PMI data - released yesterday by the Singapore Institute of Purchasing & Materials Management (SIPMM) - fell short of economists' expectations. The median estimate of seven forecasts submitted to Bloomberg was for a PMI reading of 51.4, but the actual reading stood at 50.8, mainly due to dips in orders and output.\n\nIn addition, the imports index saw its first contraction since February, slipping 1.1 to 49.2 - below the 50-point threshold separating growth from contraction month-on-month.\n\nSaid DBS economist Irvin Seah: \"Production activity has moderated somewhat, and this could essentially be a reflection of the approach of the year-end lull, as the earlier Christmas season orders were met and delivered.\"\n\nAdded Mr Song: \"The pullback in overall factory readings, despite the uptick on the tech side, reflects a picture of a somewhat uneven manufacturing performance. This was already seen in the latest industrial production numbers, where we had a strong electronics reading, which was somewhat offset by softer chemicals and biomedical numbers.\"\n\nOCBC's Ms Ling agreed, highlighting how non-electronics segments, like the biomedical cluster, are likely facing some specific industry pressures. \"Pharmaceuticals have been underperforming of late both on the production and export fronts, possibly attributable to a different mix of active pharmaceutical ingredients produced,\" she noted.\n\nStill, all three economists emphasised that November's PMI reading, even with its 0.4 dip, still stands above 50 and manufacturing is therefore in expansion mode.\n\nWhile Mr Seah warned of the seasonal lull that January may bring due to the Chinese New Year period, he said: \"Overall, it's still a good number. This marks the ninth time the manufacturing economy has expanded, so things are still good for now.\"\n\nCIMB's Mr Song pointed out that Singapore's November PMI is in line with regional data from Indonesia and Vietnam released on Monday, which also saw a slight pullback in last month's PMI readings, while staying above 50.\n\n\"North America and Europe have also posted stronger PMI numbers. So if the global economy continues to consistently do better, then I would also expect (the other clusters of Singapore's manufacturing sector) to catch up as well,\" said Mr Song.\n\nMs Ling added that her manufacturing outlook hasn't changed with November's PMI reading: \"The next industrial production figure is going to do fairly well, because November last year was a bit of a low base . . . We've pencilled in a manufacturing improvement story in Q4, and we're content to keep with that for now.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Airport muni debt is having its best rally since the start of 2012, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.\n\nSome American Airlines securities are trading at record highs after reaching as low as 18.9 cents on the dollar two years ago after AMR's filing, data compiled by Bloomberg show. A US bankruptcy judge last week approved a merger with US Airways Group that may boost the debt even more, said Dan Loughran, a portfolio manager in New York with OppenheimerFunds Inc.\n\n\"It does remove the final hurdle,\" said Mr Loughran, whose company oversees US$29 billion of munis, including AMR debt. \"You just have an airline going forward that is likely to be more profitable given the fact that they've consolidated.\"\n\nAbout US$3.4 billion of munis backed by revenue from AMR and American helped finance terminal expansions and upgrades in cities from Los Angeles to New York. The securities fluctuated in price because of the bankruptcy filing and after the Justice Department's August motion to halt the merger. The carriers settled the agency's antitrust claims last month, clearing the way for AMR's bankruptcy judge to approve its plan to exit bankruptcy through the merger.\n\nBonds sold in 2007 to support construction at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, backed by American Airlines revenue and maturing in December 2030, traded on Nov 20 at an average price of 114.1 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg data show. That was the highest ever and up from 18.9 cents on Nov 30, 2011, the day after the airline filed for court protection.\n\n\"These are very high-risk, high-reward bonds,\" New York-based Mr Rai, the Citigroup strategist, said in an interview. \"That's a lot of volatility.\"\n\nAn improving economy may help debt backed by specific carriers as well as munis sold for airport construction and repaid with facility revenue such as passenger fees and leases, Mr Rai said. Gross domestic product in the US may grow 2.6 per cent in 2014 and 3 per cent the next year, according to median estimates from a Bloomberg survey of 74 analysts.\n\n\"The airport bonds could still get a slight uplift from positive headlines because with increased economic activity, passenger traffic increases and it benefits airlines,\" Mr Rai said. \"And airports will also benefit from that.\"\n\nAirport bonds account for about US$150 billion of the US$3.7 trillion municipal market, Mr Rai said in a Nov 21 report. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is the biggest issuer, with more than US$18 billion of debt for projects at New York-area airports.\n\nChicago O'Hare has US$9.3 billion of obligations tied to its facility and Miami International has US$7.1 billion.\n\nAirport debt has benefited in the past few months from gains in the broader muni market after benchmark yields set a 29-month high in September, Mr Loughran said.\n\nAirport munis earned about 3.6 per cent in the three months through November, the most since the start of 2012, Bank of America data show. The securities have still lost 2 per cent this year, beating the 2.5 per cent decline for the entire market.\n\nWhile investors have pulled a record amount of cash from US muni mutual funds this year, a reversal of that trend would help airport bonds perform even better, Mr Rai said. Funds focused on longer-maturity bonds or high-yield munis, which include airport debt, have had the biggest withdrawals.\n\n\"Airport bonds unfortunately meet the criteria of high-yield as well as long-term, so they got whacked from both sides,\" Mr Rai said. \"These two categories of funds were impacted the most by these outflows, so when that reversal happens, they'll benefit the most as well.\"\n\nInvestors have yanked about US$50 billion from US muni mutual funds this year, after adding about US$43 billion in the same period last year, Lipper US Fund Flows data show.\n\nElsewhere in the municipal market, issuers from California to New York have scheduled about US$15 billion of offerings in the next 30 days, the most since July, Bloomberg data show.\n\nThe governments are borrowing with yields close to a two-month high. Top-rated 10-year munis yield 2.84 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent on similar-maturity Treasuries.\n\nThe ratio of the interest rates, a measure of relative value, is about 101 per cent, and compares with a five-year average of about 102 per cent. The lower the figure, the more costly munis are relative to federal securities.\n\nFollowing is a pending sale: New York state's Utility Debt Securitisation Authority plans to sell US$2.1 billion of revenue bonds as soon as next week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Proceeds will refund a portion of the Long Island Power Authority's US$7 billion of debt. The deal includes US$485 million of taxable bonds. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Asia (excluding Singapore) is the source of about half of the cross-border deposits and also the destination for the bulk of the cross-border loans (65 per cent as of September 2013), it said.\n\nA significant trend is the growing importance of China and India as lending destinations for Singapore's banking system, even as they continue to provide material amounts of cross-border funding.\n\nThe gross flows of funds (both loans and deposits) post-Lehman between Singapore and China and between Singapore and India have grown by 85 per cent and 129 per cent respectively, compared to pre-Lehman.\n\nHowever, a key difference is that China, which was previously a net lender to Singapore, is now a net borrower from Singapore, whereas India has remained a net borrower, it said.\n\nThe total volume of loans (comprising interbank loans, non-bank loans and trade bills) to China has been trending up since 2009. During this period, the composition of loans has changed significantly. Since August 2011, trade bills overtook interbank loans to become the primary contributor of loans to China. As of September 2013, trade bills accounted for about 65 per cent of total loans from Singapore to China.\n\nThe large increase in trade bills over the last two years has come alongside rapid growth of trade between the Asean economies and China. Meanwhile, the share accounted for by non-bank loans has remained relatively stable, standing at about 11 per cent as of September 2013.\n\nTwo-way trade flows between South-east Asia and China have reached record highs. Last year, China and South-east Asia saw US$400 billion in trade between them. By 2020, China and Asean have committed to increase trade volume to US$1 trillion.\n\nIn comparison, although loans to India have similarly trended upward since 2009, the increase tapered off towards end-2011. Another key difference between India and China is that non-bank loans have been the primary driver of the increase in loans to India, and accounted for more than half of all loans to India as of September 2013. A third difference is that the increase in volume of trade bills to India has been more gradual than for China.\n\nFor China, portfolio concentration is higher for local banking groups than for foreign banks, and the divergence has become more accentuated over the past two years. For India, the reverse is true - portfolio concentration has been higher for foreign banks than for local banking groups.\n\nThe MAS analysis indicates that some of the largest India-related borrowers are from the manufacturing sector as well as the financial institutions sector. The largest Chinese borrowers are from the general commerce and transport, storage and communication sectors.\n\nThe risk implications of the growing credit exposures to China and India need to be seen in the context of the rising economic and financial importance of both countries, uncertain economic growth prospects, possibility of financial conditions tightening ahead, and country-specific factors, the Review said.\n\n\"Even as banks expand their businesses, they need to take active steps to understand and manage the attendant risks.\"\n\nFor example, as advanced economies progress towards policy normalisation, global interest rates will likely rise from current record lows and funding conditions could tighten, it said.\n\n\"Cross-border banking flows may then increase at a slower rate or even contract. Domestic banks in Asia may also tighten credit to conserve liquidity and manage asset quality risks.\n\n\"Banks and non-bank borrowers that have managed their financial risks prudently will be more resilient to potential stresses arising from such developments,\" the Review said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite warnings of an increasing exposure to mortgages, net wealth has grown robustly over the past decade and stands at about four times GDP, according to the Monetary Authority of Singapore Financial Stability Review 2013.\n\nWhile household debt continues to increase, savings are piling up faster and massive cash deposits outweigh total liabilities, the review showed yesterday.\n\nMeasures to cool the residential property market are having a significant impact, too.\n\n\"However caution is in order as uncertainties and risks remain,\" MAS warned.\n\n\"Alongside firm growth of household sector assets and net wealth over the past few years, household debt has trended up, with mortgages accounting for a large share of household sector liabilities.\n\n\"Some households or individuals could also have overextended themselves in other ways, such as taking on bigger motor vehicle loans and unsecured credit,\" it said.\n\nHousehold net wealth (defined as household assets less household debt) has grown at an average rate of 9.1 per cent per annum in the past 10 years. In Q3 2013, household net wealth was $1.44 trillion - four times GDP and up 6.5 per cent from a year ago. This means the Republic's household sector net wealth relative to GDP is broadly comparable to other advanced economies, it said.\n\nProperty assets account for a large share of household assets, and property price increases have been the key driver of the significant rise in household net wealth over the past few years.\n\nOn an aggregate basis, the value of property assets, estimated at $838 billion in Q3 2013, accounted for about half of household assets. This share has remained broadly stable since 2010. The value of property assets has increased by an average of 13 per cent year on year since Q1 2010.\n\nSince Q3 2012, the value of financial assets held by the household sector - which comprise about half of household assets - has increased more quickly than the value of property assets. This is partly because of a slowdown in the pace of property price increase, even as financial markets have been buoyant for the most part.\n\nIn Q3 2013, the value of financial assets was $875 billion, up 7.7 per cent from a year ago. In comparison, the value of property assets was 5.8 per cent higher than a year earlier.\n\nSingaporeans continue to be massive savers.\n\n\"The growth in the value of liquid financial assets such as cash and deposits, and Central Provident Fund savings has remained strong, at about 10 per cent y-o-y growth in Q3 2013,\" it said.\n\nEven as debt has risen, along with worries that housing oversupply may lead to home prices falling as much as 10 per cent, cash alone exceeds household debt by more than 10 per cent.\n\nHousehold sector debt has trended up alongside the increase in household sector assets and net wealth over the past few years, though the pace of increase has slowed markedly in recent quarters.\n\nThe household debt-to-income ratio has risen from a low of 1.9 times in 2008 during the Lehman crisis to 2.1 times in 2012. In addition, household debt has grown more quickly than household assets since Q2 2011. In Q3 2013, household debt grew by 7.9 per cent year on year, while household assets grew by 6.8 per cent.\n\nHousing loans account for about three-quarters of total household liabilities, and could be a significant source of risk for households, MAS said.\n\nThis proportion is broadly comparable to that of several other economies, including Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, the US and UK.\n\nHowever, following successive rounds of property-related measures, the credit profile of housing loans has improved, it said.\n\nThe next biggest component after housing loans is motor vehicle loans, which constituted 4.6 per cent of household liabilities in Q3 2013. The average motor vehicle loan quantum increased to about $90,000 last year from about $40,000 in 2006.\n\n\"The generally benign environment of modest economic growth, tight labour market conditions and low interest rates could change in the period ahead,\" the Review warned.\n\nData from Credit Counselling Singapore showed that the average outstanding debt owed by individuals seeking credit counselling has increased 15 per cent over the past four years, from $69,600 to $79,700.\n\nThe Review revealed that number of individual bankruptcy orders made has risen, from about 1,500 cases in 2011 to about 1,700 cases in 2012.\n\n\"This trend has continued for the first three quarters of 2013 compared to the same period last year,\" it said.\n\nOver-leveraged individuals and households would be more vulnerable to adverse shocks. \"If the economy slows down and labour market conditions become less favourable, the property cycle could turn,\" it cautioned. Some households' financial resilience could deteriorate - the value of their assets could fall even as their debt servicing burdens increase in tandem with rising interest rates as advanced economies embark on tapering, it said.\n\nThe current economic outlook is moderately upbeat.\n\n\"Singapore's economic growth momentum has experienced swings through 2013, alongside changes in global demand conditions and general sentiment. While a continued recovery in the external environment should provide some upside momentum for Singapore's economic growth into 2014, several risks remain.\n\n\"All factors considered, the Singapore economy should achieve growth of 3.5-4.0 per cent for 2013, and 2.0 per cent-4.0 per cent for 2014.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Asean four - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand - are forecast to grow an average 4.6 per cent, similar to this year.\n\n\"So the equity market outlook is good as people like to buy into growing companies,\" she said.\n\nEven banks have been indicating that their loan momentum to corporates is strong.\n\nBusiness loans continued to power Singapore's bank lending growth in October, with total loans rising 1.4 per cent over the month from 1.1 per cent in September, preliminary figures released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore last Friday showed.\n\nIn the equity space, there are many companies, both Reits (real estate investment trusts) and non-Reits, especially in the oil and gas and related industries, preparing for listing, said Ms Tay.\n\n\"In terms of liquidity, people still feel IPO play is quite attractive to their portfolio,\" she said.\n\nSo far this year, total IPO proceeds raised hit US$5.03 billion, up 34 per cent from 2012's US$3.76 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.\n\nReits IPO this year raised US$3.02 billion while corporates raised US$2.01 billion.\n\nMs Tay said a healthy market should see annual IPO proceeds of $4 to $5 billion.\n\n\"Moving into 2014, we actually see maybe in the first part of the year, Q1, quite a strong pipeline of Reits IPO going to the market to tap into the liquidity before any tapering measures come into effect,\" said Ms Tay.\n\nProperty group OUE Ltd said last month that it was looking to sell its office and retail development OUE Bayfront for at least $1 billion, to the commercial real estate investment trust that it is looking to list on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nMs Tay said there are also some offshore business trusts including those from India looking to launch here. These companies are in the infrastructure sector such as windpower or toll roads.\n\nOn investors' familiarity with offshore companies, she said it is a challenge with retail players because of the unfamiliarity with the overseas jurisdictions and their regulations.\n\nInstitutional funds are okay as they are more familiar with offshore jurisdictions, she said.\n\n\"A lot of offshore players when they tap into the local market, are priced into the yield, so they have to offer higher yields to attract investors to compensate for all these uncertainties,\" said Ms Tay.\n\nAs to the type of yields investors can look forward to, she said there is no \"magic figure\" as this depends on outlook and demand. The range is from the \"high fives to 10 for business trust\", she said.\n\nFor instance, for commercial Reits, where investors are more bullish, yields were around 6 per cent while it was higher for hospitality Reits where the outlook is less certain, she said.\n\nFor overseas assets, the yield they have to offer is in the high single digit, she said.\n\nShe expects there will be more non-Reits going for listing next year, especially in the oil and gas sector, as investors are more bullish.\n\n\"As for overall 2014, we actually still see a very strong pipeline of OSV (offshore supply vessel) sector, the oil and gas supporting sector because in the upturn cycle, 2014 to 2017, we see strong order books coming through for the big players, like Keppel Corp down to the smaller players,\" she said.\n\nAccording to OCBC Investment Research, Keppel Corp has secured $6.4 billion of orders year-to-date, and its net order book stood at $13.6 billion as at end-September with deliveries extending to 2019.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we are expecting new order wins of about $6.75 billion in 2014 from the Caspian Sea, West Africa, Brazil and other regions,\" it said yesterday.\n\nOCBC Investment Research has a \"buy\" on Keppel and expects a 12-month total return of 18 per cent for the stock. It is also positive on the OSV market as growth of the offshore drilling market and increasing base of production infrastructure underpins potential increases in OSV newbuilds.\n\n\"Within South-east Asia, Malaysia and Indonesia have the greatest forecast investment in the oil and gas industry, due to increasing urgency of stemming production declines. Both countries are developing shallow water plays, while also moving to deeper waters. Against such a backdrop, the current OSV fleet in these two countries is not sufficient in meeting expected demand due to the old age of the current fleet and charterers' increasingly demanding requirements, as well as the push for younger and more eco-friendly vessels by regulators,\" it said.\n\nAs for the debt market next year, issuance could exceed 2013's with more smaller corporates doing deals and foreign issuers making a comeback, said Tan Kee Phong, OCBC Bank head of capital markets.\n\nTapering could come in the second half of next year and issuers will want to borrow before interest rates go up, he said.\n\nEven when interest rates rise, bond investors will not be deterred, he said. It is only when interest rate movements are not stable that markets get spooked.\n\nLiquidity, especially Singdollars is very healthy, he said. In October, SGD deposits were $530 billion, compared with $500 billion this time last year.\n\nSelling bonds in 2014 will be banks, local and foreign, and corporates, large and small as well as foreign entities, he said.\n\nForeign issuers may include Latin American financial institutions, corporates from Europe, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia and India, he said.\n\nSo far this year, bond sales are around $19.5 billion, considerably lower than 2012's $31 billion.\n\n\"Last year was an exceptional year, if you discount last year, take the last six to eight years, the average volume deals was in the teens,\" said Mr Tan.\n\n\"Every year, going forward, $20 billion should be sustainable,\" he said.\n\nA lot of major bond sales, including perpetuals, were done last year to take advantage of record low interest rates, he said.\n\nThis year saw the emergence of small corporates selling bonds. Average issue size this year has been $150 million versus $230 million in 2012, he noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was also reported that the Monetary Authority of Singapore also gave BToto the green light to proceed with the lodgement of its prospectus for the proposed listing.\n\nAnother condition is to set a minimum issue price of 50 Singapore cents for the initial public offering (IPO) of the trust.\n\nBToto had earlier proposed to undertake a dividend-in-specie exercise of up to 2.81 billion units.

The median COV in October was $12,000, according to data from the Singapore Real Estate Exchange (SRX). This is a 66 per cent drop from the $35,000 median in January.\n\nOrangeTee estimated last month that one in five flats in Singapore was being sold at zero COV or even negative COV.\n\nA Straits Times report on Monday cited HDB as saying 105 units were sold below valuation in October. This translates to 7 per cent of total resale volume, compared with an average of 0.3 per cent for each month of the first half of the year.\n\nMr Khaw said another sign of a more balanced housing market was in the decline of the number of applicants per unit. The average BTO application rate has fallen from a high of 5.3 in 2010 to a low of 2.9 this year, he said.\n\n\"We have cleared the backlog of young families buying their first flats, with average BTO application rate for first-timers holding steady at below two times.\"\n\nThe application rate (excluding studio apartments) in the latest November exercise was 1.2, HDB data showed yesterday.\n\nFor second-timers, average application rates for BTO flats fell to 2.4 times in the latest exercise from the peak of 25.9 times in November 2011.\n\nThat said, demand from singles remained high, with average BTO application rates at 25.2 times in the latest exercise, but still down July's 57.5 times, when the government first launched projects with BTO flats set aside for eligible singles.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The eight plaintiffs are Ms Quah; Mr Chen; Mr Neo's associated company Neptune Capital Group; Blumont wholly-owned subsidiary Powerlite Ventures; China Data System Investments, a private company in which Mr Wong is director; Chinese national Ge Lei; and the British Virgin Islands-incorporated entities Infinite Results Holding Corp and Skyline Agents.\n\nAccording to court documents, that dispute involved certain loan and extension agreements, among other issues, in which some of the plaintiffs allegedly borrowed from Sunmax Global Capital Fund 1 and pledged shares as security for the loans.\n\nSunmax Global Capital Fund 1 and Mr Li sued them back. But in his counterclaim, Mr Li added Mr Soh as a defendant, alleging that Mr Soh had agreed to the transfer of shares as compensation for some failed investments.\n\nOn Aug 31, 2012, it was Hua Xin's turn to fire its salvo. Hua Xin sued Ipco International, alleging that Ipco failed to return a $1.35 million advance on a loan agreement related to a joint development deal that was signed on March 12, 2012 and lapsed two months later.\n\nIpco said that the advance was included as part of a global settlement agreement that parties in the first dispute had allegedly reached on July 24, but Hua Xin disputed that. Ipco sought to move this dispute to arbitration, but Assistant Registrar Keith Han rejected that application, consolidated both cases and kept them in the courts.\n\nMr Soh is a prominent businessman from Malaysia who once controlled Ipco and Innopac. But he left those companies and fell off the radar at the turn of the century. From 1999 to 2002, Malaysian authorities sought his arrest over certain securities transactions. He eventually pleaded guilty to abetting charges.\n\nBut Ipco, Innopac and the companies that have been linked to them via cross investments, shared management and business deals - Asiasons Capital, Blumont and LionGold, among others - recently came under the spotlight.\n\nOn Oct 4, Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold shares were suspended after steep dives in their stock prices. Shares of many penny stocks, including Ipco and Innopac, also took a hit, resulting in massive losses in the market. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and Singapore Exchange are investigating.\n\nMs Quah, Mr Neo, Mr Chen, Neptune Capital and Ipco, via subsidiary Sun Spirit Group, are respondents in ongoing arbitration proceedings that have been filed by Interactive Brokers, which is trying to claim about US$68 million following the October plunge.\n\nMs Quah, Blumont executive director James Hong Gee Ho and LionGold independent director Lynne Ng Su Ling have also filed separate suits in the United Kingdom against Goldman Sachs, alleging that the bank had unreasonably force-sold their Asiasons and LionGold shares that had been pledged for certain borrowing facilities.\n\nIpco has not made any announcements regarding Hua Xin or Interactive Brokers' freezing of its Sun Spirit subsidiary's assets.\n\nNeither Ms Quah, Mr Neo nor Mr Soh could be reached for comment.

The registry will come into effect from Jan 2, 2014. From that date onwards, telemarketing companies will have to look up the registry and check telephone numbers before making calls. Local firms will pay a one-time registration fee of $30 (foreign firms pay $60) for an account which comes with 500 free number checks a year. Subsequent checks will cost 1-2.5 cents per number.\n\nThe new measure will be welcomed by many Singapore residents who do not want to be disturbed by cold telemarketing calls and SMSes. As such, the registry should be very popular, if one goes by international precedents. For example, in Australia, nine million numbers are listed on the Do Not Call Register (as it is called there), including two-thirds of Australian households with a fixed-line home phone and nearly four million mobile phones. Telemarketers found guilty of defying Singapore's DNC registry rules risk a maximum fine of $10,000. The only exception to this is if consumers give their written consent to telemarketers that they are willing to be contacted. Such consent, given before the registry's launch, will stay valid unless it is withdrawn.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that all unsolicited SMSes and phone calls will cease once a particular telephone number is registered. This is because there are many illegal telemarketing organisations, operating mostly from abroad, who have data-mined thousands of valid Singaporean phone numbers. These establishments are often hard to pin down. As an official of Cloudmark (which provides protection against spam) told BT recently, it is more economical for cyber-criminals to send SMS spam using prepaid SIM accounts than it is to send out email spam, since most of their messages on the latter platform are caught and filtered out.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nColumns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

A separate survey by China Real Estate Index System (CREIS) showed average prices in the 100 biggest cities rose 0.68 per cent in November from October, marking the weakest monthly gain so far this year. \"In terms of property policies, the central government is shifting away from the one-size-for-all solution and we can see more and more cities have launched tailor-made measures to curb home prices,\" CREIS, a consultancy linked to China's largest online property information firm Soufun Holdings, said in a statement. \"These measures help quench bullish sentiment in the market,\" the statement said.\n\nMany local governments have recently rolled out measures to cool fast-rising home prices, such as raising minimum down payments for second homes and promising to supply more land for building residential properties.\n\nSuch cities include first-tier cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen as well as second-tier cities, such as Nanjing, Xiamen, Nanchang and Shenyang.\n\nDespite a nearly-four-year campaign to calm a bubbling property market, ordinary Chinese in most cities are still facing relentlessly rising home prices that are well beyond their reach.\n\nThis has been adding to the threat of a price bubble and social unrest as housing becomes increasingly unaffordable. In China's 10 most expensive cities, including Beijing and Shanghai, average home prices rose 1.16 per cent on the month and 16.56 per cent on the year, the CREIS survey showed.\n\nFollowing a four-day conclave that ended in mid-November, China's top leaders pledged to speed up legislation to launch a long-awaited property tax in the nation, in a signal that Beijing would rely more on market forces rather than administrative measures to control the property market. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

Gains were led by Sydney where prices were up 12.5 per cent on November last year, while Perth recorded growth of 8.9 per cent and Melbourne 6.6 per cent.\n\nThe median property value across all eight major cities hit A$525,000 ($602,300).\n\nRP Data's senior research analyst Cameron Kusher said that while further growth was likely for this cycle, the peak may have passed for Sydney and Melbourne. \"The increase in home values seems to be slowing to a level reflective of more sustainability when compared to the growth in other indicators,\" he added.\n\nWhile there has been much media speculation of how record-low interest rates are feeding a \"bubble\" in home prices, policymakers have been unfazed.\n\nThe deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia recently said there was nothing to fear in higher prices, in part because it was necessary to encourage more home building. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

This has led to some Chinese companies, dubbed S-chips, getting a bad rap over \"quality control\". Several S-chips have been embroiled in corporate governance scandals in the past few years.\n\n\"It's a dual track, in that sense CSRC also provides another avenue of scrutiny,\" said Ms Tay.\n\n\"With this new structure, you allow better-quality companies to come in,\" she said as these companies will need prior approval from the CSRC.\n\nUnder the previous structure, investors had no recourse when S-chips misbehaved.\n\nUnder the new framework, there will be dialogue with the CSRC to get its help in enforcement when issues arise, she said.\n\n\"With this type of formal framework, it makes it easier for future collaboration,\" she said.\n\nMany Chinese companies are waiting to list in Singapore because the Chinese market has had a freeze on new initial public offerings (IPOs) for 14 months though reports over the weekend said the ban will be lifted.\n\nStill, it will take about a year to review more than 760 companies that are seeking first-time share sales, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a statement on its website on Nov 30, according to Bloomberg. A total of 83 companies' IPO applications have been cleared and are pending final approval, it said.\n\n\"The Chinese market has been closed for a while, the queue is so long, so obviously this provides an alternative for many companies, \" said Ms Tay.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This has not happened. In fact, over the last couple of years inflation has been falling, with the US, Europe, Japan and Canada all having inflation rates of one per cent or less. Australia has relatively high inflation but it is only 2.2 per cent. Oddly enough, currently inflation is really only an issue in some emerging countries - notably Brazil, Indonesia and India - where it reflects a combination of slowing productivity growth and cost pressures. But that's a separate issue.\n\nThe plunge in the price of gold from a peak of US$1,900 per ounce in 2011 when hyperinflation fears were at their peak to around US$1,240 now is another sign that inflation pressures are weak.\n\nWhy those predicting hyperinflation over the last few years have been wrong is very simple. Put simply, they did not understand the link between quantitative easing (QE) and inflation. While central banks have boosted narrow measures of money - bank reserves and cash in the system - this needs to be lent out en masse, boosting broad measures of money supply growth and credit, and resulting in much stronger levels of economic activity and the elimination of excess capacity before inflation takes off. And, of course, this hasn't really happened. So no hyperinflation.

It is also looking to add four more networks and network interfaces as well as enhance existing satellite capability, he added.\n\nIt will also be adopting a \"cloud-based\" strategy with regard to new products and services. This would mean integrating security, mobility, unified communications and collaboration, and contact centre services and deliver them via cloud deployment, he said.\n\nSecurity, in particular, will receive more attention across the organisation. The group plans to hire 25 more security specialists, said Mr Taylor.\n\nLuis Alvarez, CEO of BT Global Services, added it has three focus areas in security: providing consultancy using global experts based in five different markets; project management, and security operations control - whether shared or for specific organisations.\n\nWithin South-east Asia, Mr Hills pointed to Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines as the company's focus markets.\n\nMalaysia, in particular, will play a strategic role since the opening of the Global Shared Service facility in Kuala Lumpur earlier this year. The facility is made up of two centres - the Global Development Centre and Contract Delivery Shared Service Centre. The former provides services in ICT (Infocomm Technology) innovation and development, and is part of a global network with eight other centres, while the latter will offer commercial, contract management and project management expertise to multinational companies.\n\nGavin Patterson, the recently installed CEO of BT Group, said that the level of investments on AMEA reflects the region's importance to the company's overall business growth.\n\n\"The growth revenues will come from those regions outside of the UK, even though the (local) market continues to show good growth opportunities.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The challenge is also not one of opportunities: infrastructure plans laid out by the government have made that clear.\n\nRather, the seismic shift underway at the moment boils down to that dreaded P-word - productivity. Tighter manpower quotas, higher levies and a reduction in the number of employment passes issued have all colluded to drive up costs. At Koh Brothers alone, construction costs have gone up by 15 to 20 per cent.\n\nTender prices have also risen, but they have not gone up quickly enough to cover costs, Mr Koh points out. \"This is a transition period, during which some people (who) are not careful in terms of their tender prices may face financial difficulties.\"\n\nOne advantage enjoyed by bigger players such as Koh Brothers lies in relative economies of scale. The company not only builds structures, but is also its own supplier through its building materials business; it has four precast plants here and in Malaysia.\n\nMr Koh says: \"I can do a real-estate project, I can do pre-fabrication and ask our precast (plant) to supply and ask our construction arm to do it.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging that government productivity grants do help, he says that smaller players will still fall behind because new equipment can be very capital-intensive.\n\nAsked if Koh Brothers would buy out firms that run into trouble, he replies that it may be easier to absorb their employees because each company has its own work culture.\n\nThe pursuit of synergy has been a touch point for the company, which started in 1966 with initial renown in drainage construction. It has since spread its reach to three main businesses: construction and building materials, real estate, and leisure and hospitality.\n\nMr Koh oversaw the setting-up of the property business and the leisure and hospitality business; he did this to diversify the group's earnings and to benefit from each group's expertise. The concept of synergy was also in force in the group's recent acquisition of water treatment company Metax, a Koh Brothers subcontractor.\n\nDespite a challenging year, net profit for the nine months ended Sept 30 was 14 per cent higher than a year ago, at $15 million, backed by higher revenues from all three businesses.\n\nThe plan is to keep expanding on all fronts. All three divisions are financially independent, says Mr Koh, who does not rule out separate listings if they meet listing requirements.\n\nThis year, he is zeroing in on growing the group's stable of hotels. It has actually pared debt in order to afford this expansion, and is casting an eye on freehold, completed projects abroad because of the high prices here.\n\nKoh Brothers owns the Oxford Hotel in Queen Street here. It has about 130 rooms and an average occupancy of more than 80 per cent. \"Singapore is still healthy, but I think the upside may not be as great as for overseas properties,\" he says.\n\nIn construction, the company will focus on higher-value contracts. \"I think now the profit margins have to be slightly higher than last time; otherwise, the project may run into problems because of the productivity drive.\"\n\nAs for real estate, despite an uncertain outlook, Mr Koh remains confident that the market will grow, though in a \"conservative\" way.\n\nThrough it all, Mr Koh sees himself as a conductor for the disparate parts of the orchestra of the business, with passion carrying him through.\n\nAn avid traveller, he draws inspiration from his experience overseas for the design features of the company's real estate projects, and also relies on his daily observations and his personal interests.\n\nFor example, the health-themed Parc Olympia off Upper Changi Road North stemmed in part from his interest in badminton. Other bold designs he has initiated include a rooftop observatory at the Starville condominium in Kembangan, and what he jokingly describes as \"cheese\"-like sun screens - yellow and with holes in them - at Fiorenza condominium off Upper Serangoon Road.\n\n\"You see, for me, if I want to develop a project, (and I) don't have a theme, don't have a direction, I will feel uninterested. But if I have a theme, that's where the passion comes in.\"\n\nWhen it comes to construction, passion has to come from wanting \"not only to see things happen, not only to plan for things to happen, but to make things happen\", he adds.\n\nThis passion for work extends to the company caring for its staff. Koh Brothers has set up a $500,000 \"hardship fund\" for employees facing financial trouble (excluding gambling problems); it also strives to keep older staff on the payroll as long as possible, though they may be redeployed to less-demanding jobs that tap their experience.\n\n\"A lot of the older generation don't know how to retire,\" Mr Koh observes, drawing from anecdotal evidence of employees dying within a year of retiring.\n\nHe is all for being transparent and keeping the lines of communication open with his staff. \"We are not worried about problems. We are worried only that we don't discover the problem.\"\n\nFor starters, he asks that employees address him by his first name. \"You call me Mr Koh. Who? There are a lot of Mr Kohs (here),\" he says, with a laugh.\n\nongch@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

How else can Singapore become an even more liveable and productive business city?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Dec 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPauline Goh\n\nManaging Director\n\nCB Richard Ellis Singapore\n\nTHE blueprint is a well-considered plan that shows firm commitment to unlock more land for the future growth of Singapore, and to unlock more value in land that has already been developed, particularly in the older mature estates. This is not just for housing but for offices too. Despite Singapore's land scarcity, the Masterplan has managed to identify new pockets of land across all parts of the island to meet commercial and residential demand. The plan provides for a wide range of housing choices - be it city living or living within the established estates of Dawson and Bedok. The proposed plans for the retail belt at Marina Bay as well as the projected 9,000 residential units also reinforces the live, work and play concept long envisioned for the downtown Central Business District (CBD).\n\nMost importantly, this Draft Masterplan reads like a people's plan, being less technical and more holistic. It is gratifying that the plan is not just about maximising economic value of land. Rather, it is geared towards the development of communities and at the same time concerned about preserving heritage and unique attributes of certain estates.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and CEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia and Middle East\n\nTHE Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) ambitious and all-encompassing Draft Masterplan will certainly reinforce Singapore's position as one of the most, if not the most, liveable city in Asia. As a business and finance professional, what stands out for me, naturally, are the plans to rejuvenate the CBD and to heighten the buzz in the Marina Bay area. Coupled with initiatives to improve connectivity and sustainability, I believe Singapore's status as a global business and financial hub will be strengthened in the long run.\n\nABN AMRO's offices are located in the heart of the business district and we look forward to more initiatives to bring affordable cultural as well as art spaces, in addition to the residential, hotel and retail uses, to bring out the soul of the city. For the live, work and play concept to succeed, it is important to focus not only on building the ''hardware'' but also on enhancing the ''software'' by integrating and giving voice and artistic expression to the myriad of cultures living, working and playing in this area.\n\nMarc Mathenz\n\nSenior Vice President, Head of APAC\n\nFirst Data Corporation\n\nTHE URA's Masterplan is an important step toward Singapore becoming an even greater place to live, work and play. I particularly support the focus on recreation and green corridors. Having lived much of my life in Germany and the United Kingdom, I miss cycling through the forest and walking in the countryside. In Singapore, we all work too long and spend too much time on our mobile devices. The URA's plans will encourage more people, including children, to embrace the outdoors and appreciate the year-round sunshine that Europeans only dream about. Every week I cycle along the Ulu Pandan park connector network with my Singaporean wife. We are looking forward to exploring more areas by bicycle and seeing our kids play sports in the great outdoors rather than inside air-conditioned facilities. I hope that in time, pedestrians, cyclists and motorists can co-exist happily and safely on Singapore's designated paths. My wish, though, would be to have water coolers along the way and cashless dispensers (for which First Data can facilitate electronic payments) so I can reward myself with an ice-cold weissbeer.\n\nJanet Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nIBM Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE, like many cities, is moving to a smarter municipal infrastructure for traffic systems, water systems and public safety. It is changing the way we live, because digital intelligence is being injected into our physical systems through pervasive instrumentation and global interconnectivity. Last year, Jurong Lake District was named a recipient of the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge grant and we are honoured to work with the Economic Development Board, the URA and other partner agencies to explore what it would take to transform Jurong Lake District into a smart district. We look forward to contributing our expertise to cement Singapore's position as a Smarter City.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nTHE URA Masterplan illustrates Singapore's desire to continue to be a global ambassador of never-ending improvement.\n\nExtending the CBD and reducing commuting times with new eco-friendly industrial areas while maintaining focus on quality living put Singapore on a pedestal as a world model. Every home within 400 metres of a park is one of the best advertisements for our little island.\n\nTo become better in the future, we must capitalise on the fact that the fastest-developing economies in the world are our immediate neighbours. We provide a perfectly positioned gateway to the Far East and we must deliver that message universally at every opportunity.\n\nRussell Cole\n\nSingapore Office Leader\n\nArup\n\nAS Singapore continues to evolve as a global, sustainable and successful city, it is heartening to see that there is a strong, underlying focus on creating an urban landscape that preserves and strengthens Singaporean identity. A city's urban landscape is very much a part of its social fabric and increasingly, Singaporeans want to maintain buildings and spaces that are familiar to them. The urban landscape is the backdrop of peoples' lives and, as they relate their experiences in these spaces, it forms a common history and a sense of community. The Masterplan's focus on key districts is vital but may need to extend to all areas.\n\nA significant element of the Masterplan is the creation of spaces for pedestrians and cyclists. A holistic approach that ties living, work and leisure spaces together by combining walking, cycling and public transport commutes is needed. These need to be convenient and enjoyable so that cars and taxis become unattractive in comparison. To help people make the mindset shifts that will lead to behavioural changes, everyone's personal experience and comfort during the journey has to be considered regardless of age, mobility and attire from front door to destination. All links such as walkways, road crossings and frequency of bus and train services need to meet the travellers' needs, thus changing the design of buildings, roads, paths and districts.\n\nRaman Singh\n\nRegional Managing Director - Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Africa\n\nMundipharma\n\nOVER the years, Singapore has succeeded in establishing itself as a vibrant global business hub. Singapore's landscape is a constant reflection of its pace, changing frequently to provide world-class facilities. The CBD continues to grow from strength to strength with its Canary Wharf-type flagship areas such as the Marina Bay Financial Centre and Asia Square. A big part of the URA's plan is to balance this by building commercial spaces outside of the existing CBD so as to decentralise jobs and also bring workplaces closer to homes. This also allows for dedicated spaces tailored for specialised industries such as the pharmaceutical sector. This gives global companies like Mundipharma the opportunity to streamline operations in one centralised location while still providing a dynamic and attractive working space to attract top talent. It's a great move in Singapore's race for space, once again demonstrating how this island nation does not allow itself to be limited by its size.\n\nTim Moylan\n\nPresident, Asia-Pacific\n\nInfor\n\nAS one of Asia's iconic smart cities, the decision to establish our regional headquarters in Singapore was easy. An important component of any innovative city is having smart infrastructure that meets the needs of global businesses that use Singapore as a springboard to the Asia-Pacific. The new Draft Masterplan will provide rapidly growing businesses in Singapore best-in-class support to help them achieve greater operational efficiency. While Singapore continues to push the envelope in modernising its physical landscape, it is Singapore's focus on social innovation which has earned it its reputation of being a liveable city.\n\nChia Wee Boon\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nNCS\n\nTHE focus on strengthening connectivity and community interaction is key to building a sustainable, productive and safe township. This can be achieved through smart utilisation of social media, Big Data analytics, mobility and machine-to-machine technologies. Integrating data from a citywide network of sensors to achieve full situational awareness can enhance a city's community collaboration, urban safety and transport management. An intelligence-led approach can be taken by connecting disparate data and analysing it to predict and prioritise actions towards law enforcement. Use of analytics can also help streamline and manage traffic situations in real time. This, coupled with mobile apps and effective leveraging of social media, can help facilitate a delightful travelling experience for the commuters.\n\nNCS' solutions to enhance liveability and productivity will be showcased at the World Cities Summit next year.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHE URA's latest Draft Masterplan is a step in the right direction to develop an inclusive Singapore. While I am confident that the Masterplan will help address the needs at a ''facilities'' or ''infrastructural'' level, through the provision of adequate spaces for everyone to live, work and play, I believe more needs to be done at a ''societal'' level, in terms of enabling an environment that supports communities to come together. In other words, the hardware should be encapsulated with a strong flavour of heartware and software.\n\nMany Singaporeans often end up sacrificing family time for work. The newly created gathering spaces under the Masterplan hopefully can be a big draw for busy Singaporeans to set aside time for their families and friends. Singaporeans can now work hard and play hard more often, in addition to the regular escapades or vacations overseas. When we are able to accomplish this, Singapore can truly become an even more livable, vibrant and productive global city. The new Masterplan can facilitate this and help promote a culture of working hard and playing hard, which will benefit the family, society and nation.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group\n\nTHE draft URA Masterplan 2013 has a few standouts and concerns for me. I applaud the extension of the identity nodes concept. It is absolutely vital that the flavour of Old Singapore be retained for future generations. Having links to the past is nostalgic and preserves the Singaporean identity and bonding.\n\nThe Great Southern Waterfront project and the Marina South district concepts are fabulous. But transportation into and across the southern side of Singapore is going to be a massive challenge. I am highly curious how the URA and the Land Transport Authority intend to tackle this. The plan also states that by 2030, 80 per cent of homes will be within a 10-minute walk to a MRT station.\n\nCycling-friendly initiatives continue to be mooted in this plan. Achieving that would greatly increase the livability of Singapore. And the plan to decentralise the CBD is possibly one of the most important points in the Masterplan. Bringing the employment hubs closer to the heartlands is going to ease traffic and resource wastage. The promotion of work-life balance starts with a smooth commute, freeing up precious time for family life.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO and founder\n\nMHC Medical Network\n\nI AM glad the URA is taking active steps to preserve our heritage by designating more ''identity nodes'' for our future generations. But traffic congestion remains a real problem. Singapore is one of the most wired-up cities globally. We should capitalise on this and allow more people to work from home. This reduces traffic congestion and saves precious time otherwise wasted in travelling. Having more dedicated cycling tracks will also help lessen congestion. And cycling leads to a healthier population. For our ageing population, we need more garden spaces and parks that are wheelchair-friendly. Such green belts allow both young and old to recharge and rejuvenate from our dense concrete landscape.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director and Head, Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nGIVEN that we have limited land in Singapore, what stands out in the URA's latest Draft Masterplan is the creative use of land to create commercial hubs outside the city centre, especially for small and medium enterprises. Developments such as the North Coast Innovation Corridor and new industrial clusters will allow residents to live closer to their jobs, hence reducing their commutes and also congestion on the roads. At the same time, businesses in these areas will be able to enjoy lower rents. In addition, with land set aside for more open spaces and recreational facilities, Singaporeans can continue to have a quality of life in a liveable and productive business city.\n\nZaheer K Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore and Europe)\n\nQi Group of Companies\n\nTHE URA Draft Masterplan's ''ecological-business-friendly'' concept stands out quite brilliantly. The concept of decentralising the CBD to provide jobs closer to homes juxtaposes commuting to work and a vibrant economy neatly. The ''business and greening concept'' evident, for instance, in Changi Business Park is a prime example of a coterminous relationship outside of the CBD, though the 2013 Plan goes further in maintaining the special characteristics of the various areas for development. Individuals may commute longer distances if compensated by an intrinsically or financially rewarding job. Or they may prefer a pleasant work-life environment and short commute time. Overall, the Plan may just be the productivity and liveability boost for Singapore as a city-state.\n\nRiaz Mehta\n\nPresident and Founder\n\nImagine Group\n\nSINGAPORE has a fantastic reputation for diversity, both culturally and architecturally. Take, for example, Cantonment Road in Tanjong Pagar - an area full of character and heritage yet with easy access to the CBD. From our perspective what stands out is how much thought has gone into planning for the wellbeing of future generations, with housing incorporating green spaces and transportation soon to reach all corners of the island and amenities accessible to almost all of the island's population. There is definitely scope to do more with our well-established international branding as a Garden City, continuing to build on sustainable building construction, expanded recycling facilities, and advanced waste management, and it is heartening to see us as a prime example of a city that is green despite our urbanisation. The URA's Masterplan strikes a fine balance between social and economic needs. As a Singapore-based company, we have seen first-hand the benefits that maintaining a disciplined approach towards striking a balance between productivity and comfort provides as the city continues to assert itself on the global stage.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman\n\nHTwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nFOR me as a business entrepreneur, the new waterfront city and new housing estates stand out in the Draft Masterplan. The potential development of the large piece of coastal land freed up upon the move of the ports to Tuas is tremendous and can serve as a source of new business opportunity for emerging businesses. Development of new housing estates in areas like Holland Village and other iconic places also means a ready market of ''settlers'' in these areas for the services offered by our company.\n\nSingapore's urban planning is driven by the vision of a highly liveable city. The URA has done well to ensure a well-balanced environment for our city-state within our space constraints. We just have to continue to be innovative and creative in creating space for our growing population by adopting and adapting environment-friendly and exemplary practices proven elsewhere.\n\nSteve Melhuish\n\nCo-Founder and Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nPropertyGuru\n\nTWO key aspects stand out for me: Population redistribution, and new living and working corridors. One trend we see emerging from the Masterplan is to develop future growth corridors to redistribute employment areas around the island such as Jurong, Woodlands and Paya Lebar. This decentralisation will continue to entrench Singapore as a business-friendly environment. It will thin out the density of transportation into the CBD and free up traffic load while at the same time, create investment incentives and carve out potential commercial space for businesses.\n\nOne consideration, though, is that emphasis must be placed on how to achieve a balance in the composition of properties within each area earmarked for development, so as to ensure that there is a sufficient, and holistic, mix of commercial and residential real estate.\n\nAlso, critical to the Masterplan is the ''MRT Effect'' which looks to 80 per cent of the population living or working within walking distance to an MRT station. Examining the property market, and being a business owner myself, I understand that one of the key factors which affects employment or property decisions is access to transport networks and shorter commuting times. It is heartening to know that with greater focus on improving transportation, Singaporeans can get to live and work in areas conveniently and with lesser travel time.\n\nHaider Rashid\n\nCountry President Singapore and Region President South Asia\n\nABB\n\nSINGAPORE is recognised the world over for being a city that has attracted investment and talent and it now has the chance to bring that up a notch and show the world how it can balance growth and its externalities, such as pollution and over-crowding, in an innovative way. For example, we already see the strains on infrastructure, and here, technology and vision must work hand in hand. What worked in the past may not hold for the future.\n\nSo, how does Singapore harness renewables and how do we use energy more efficiently in our homes and buildings? In other cities, electric vehicles, buses and even ships are revolutionising the way people move around. Collaboration and understanding on all different levels, across strategic partners, authorities, investors and communities, will put the right infrastructure and services in place.\n\nIn the end, technology is just the means - the real enabler is the people, when decision makers and citizens devise new and bold solutions. After all, what makes a city liveable if not the people who live in it?\n\nJessica Tan\n\nManaging Director\n\nMicrosoft Singapore\n\nA KEY takeaway from the URA's Masterplan is the people-centric approach for a liveable Singapore for everyone. At Microsoft, we also believe that cities should take a people-first approach to innovation. This means developing infrastructures that will simplify everyday matters by enabling everyone to access personalised information anytime and anywhere. We also believe technology can empower citizens and businesses with insights that can be used to make faster and better decisions. Having access to real-time traffic information, coupled with information on the best route or transportation option based on your location, is one of the many examples of services that help cities be more liveable.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE URA's Masterplan is on the mark in addressing the pertinent issues that Singapore is facing at its crossroads. The six key areas identified - housing, transport, economy, identity, recreation and public space - are certainly key to raising the quality of life for its citizens.\n\nI believe public transport is the area that currently requires the most urgent improvement. The plans outlined in the Land Transport Masterplan 2013 to improve reliability, comfort and convenience of public transport are crucial. The plan to decentralise the business hub is another good move, as it will help to ease congestion in the city centre. In terms of the ''soft'' areas, I welcome the proposals to develop more green spaces, waterways and other recreational options to provide relief from the dense urban environment and ease the stress of city living.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB Asean\n\nWE fully support the URA's vision to green more community spaces and incorporate more eco-friendly features into our buildings and environment. To this end we cannot forget the importance of green building certifications and standards such as BCA Green Mark, ISO 14000, ISO 150001, LEED etc. These measures offer independent, third-party validations to a structure's green features. Benchmarking will identify our shortcomings and advocate improvements.\n\nWe hope the government will consider setting measures for indoor air quality. A superior level of indoor air quality is crucial to residents' health and workers' productivity. Green building measures can lead to substantial cost savings and make our country a healthier and greener place to live in.\n\nTan Tiong Cheng\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nKnight Frank Pte Ltd\n\nTHE latest Draft Masterplan suggests a paradigm shift in Singapore's urban planning focus. It embodies various community-focused and eco-friendly initiatives through placemaking and environmentally sustainable strategies. The emphasis on building 500,000 new residential units in existing and new townships, with many precincts close to amenities, parks and waterbodies, prepares Singapore for the next phase of population growth and creates pleasant living environments. Future residential developments such as at Kampong Bugis, Matilda and the current Keppel Club parcel would showcase waterfront living, while the proposed urban village at Marina South would be a key archetype to integrate various land uses with social and environmental elements.\n\nWe need to prepare our built environment for the next ''leap'' of economic growth. Could our physical planning strategies create adaptive and complementary business spaces that would help carve out economic niches to differentiate our economy from its competitors? Going forward, implementation of current and future urban plans ought to facilitate economic specialisation and nurture a culture of knowledge and innovation, which would strengthen our ''global literacy'' and augment our position as a world-class city in future.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nAN integral plan that unites the whole island while developing individual clusters as self-contained regions makes the city expansive despite scarce land. Building communities without boundaries narrows the gap of society levels in terms of infrastructure access and social facilities. The Draft Masterplan reinforces our direction to create a Singapore that is ideal to work, live and play. From an economics perspective, it boosts confidence levels and draw investors here for higher value job creation. Current initiatives are encouraging. What we could do next is to cultivate talent from within by focusing on specialised education platforms in line with global market conditions and industry demands, thereby enhancing employability with specialised skills to meet high-value jobs we continuously attract to the shore.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In New South Wales, the country's most populous state, investor mortgage approvals accounted for about 40 per cent of all home loans by value, the highest since 2004, the RBA said in its semi-annual Financial Stability Review on Sept 25. The average LVR on loans to this group has risen to about 80 per cent from about 60 per cent in 2009, according to Digital Finance.\n\nInvestors are betting on further capital gains after house prices started to rise in early 2013.\n\nThe average home price in Australia's biggest cities rose 8 per cent in November from a year earlier, the biggest annual gain since the year ended Oct 31, 2010, to an all-time high of A$606,003 according to the RP Data-Rismark home value index. Prices in Sydney surged 14 per cent in the 11 months to Nov 30 to a record A$724,628.\n\nSQM Research Pty, a Sydney-based data company, forecasts price gains of as much as 11 per cent in 2014.\n\nAustralian tax rules support investment in housing by allowing investors to offset any losses on rental real estate against other income. Along with higher LVRs, banks are writing a greater proportion of interest-only loans, which accounted for 39 per cent of the biggest banks' lending in the three months to Sept 30, from 37.5 per cent a year earlier and a low of 28 per cent in the first quarter of 2009, figures from the prudential regulator show.\n\nNAB has seen a \"slight increase\" in interest-only loans in recent months, which it attributes to investors returning to the property market, Nick Higginbottom, a spokesman for the bank, said. Younger homebuyers and those who rely on a single source of income are also taking out these loans, he said.\n\nInterest-only loans allow people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it to buy, while letting others acquire more expensive properties than they could with an interest-and-principal mortgage, said Andrew Wilson, senior economist at real estate data firm Australian Property Monitors.\n\n\"In a rising market, people become more risk-inclined, and banks are promoting\" these loans because people want them, Mr Wilson said. \"There's always a danger that if markets correct, it could present problems particularly for investors with a short-term focus.\"\n\nOn top of a decline in the average variable interest rate on standard housing loans to a four-year low of 5.95, banks are offering discounts to some customers.\n\n\"Australian house prices already looked in the 'bubble region' even before this 2013 spring surge so why are they reaching new highs?\" Brian Johnson, a Sydney-based bank analyst at CLSA Ltd, said in an October report. Aside from low interest rates, \"Australian banks are aggressively offering 'package discounts' to headline standard variable rates, rebating cash to borrowers, lowering credit underwriting standards.\"\n\nWestpac is offering to reduce the headline variable rate of 5.98 per cent on its Rocket Investment Loan to as low as 5.08 per cent on mortgages approved before Dec 20. NAB will reduce the 5.38 per cent interest rate on its Tailored Home Loan product to 5.03 per cent on mortgages of more than A$500,000.\n\nLenders are offering these discounts as their own cost of funding falls, Scott Manning, a Sydney-based banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co, said in a media briefing last week.\n\nBanks' borrowing costs in Australia are near their lowest level in more than five years, with the average yield premium over the swap rate for financial company bonds touching 96 basis points on Nov 26, the narrowest spread since February 2008, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.\n\n\"All of the major banks, if you borrow A$500,000 or more, have at least 80 basis points advertised\" as a discount, Mr Manning said. These are \"very early signs of a quite aggressive response\" as the cost of funds improves.\n\nFirst-time buyers, who are seeing the biggest challenges to buy as prices climb, are increasingly taking out loans with LVRs of more than 80 per cent, the highest in at least five years, according to figures from DFA.\n\nCommonwealth Bank requires borrowers to have a minimum deposit of 5 per cent and demonstrate an ability to save, spokeswoman Tracy Hicks said. The bank's maximum LVR was increased to 95 per cent from 90 per cent for eligible borrowers in February 2011, she said.\n\nUnlike other countries that faced spikes in speculative housing activity, including neighbour New Zealand, Australia's banking regulator is yet to impose any limit on the lending.\n\nAPRA is monitoring both high loan-to-value and interest-only home lending, and will \"take supervisory action\" if a lender skews its loan portfolio too heavily in favour of these mortgages, chairman John Laker said in an Oct 29 speech.\n\nNew Zealand required banks to limit loans with ratios higher than 80 per cent to 10 per cent of their total mortgage lending to curb price gains without raising interest rates.\n\n\"Transferring part of the risk to lenders' mortgage insurers does not negate your responsibility to maintain the quality of the lending book,\" Mr Laker said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

Costing some $600 million, it will bring the group's total investment on the petrochemicals island to $3 billion.\n\nThe new cogen plant will boost its power generating capacity to 1,215 MW, adding to its earlier 815-MW facility on the island. Sembcorp, which recently invested in woodchip-fired steam plants there, also just announced in August a $250 million-plus energy-from-waste facility which will supply steam from industrial and commercial waste collected by the group.\n\nSembcorp said the start-up of its new Banyan facility will now allow it to extend its utilities services - including providing process steam, industrial wastewater treatment, industrial water and service corridor services - to Tembusu and Angsana sectors of Jurong Island.\n\n\"Already, the company has secured a number of customers located in the island's new growth area, including Jurong Aromatics Corporation, Lanxess, Evonik Industries, Asahi-Kasei and Zeon,\" it said.\n\nThe new Banyan multi-utilities complex is Sembcorp's second on Jurong Island, following its earlier Sakra facility which has served customers at the island's Sakra and Seraya areas for over a decade.\n\nSembcorp's executive vice-president and head (utilities), Ng Meng Poh, said: \"The completion of Sembcorp's new multi-utilities centre marks a significant milestone as now we can provide energy, water and on-site logistics to serve customers across the whole of Jurong Island.\n\n\"Over the last 16 years, Sembcorp has developed an unrivalled track record on the island, with a reputation for strong technical and operational expertise and high reliability. We are confident that we are the best partner to meet the utilities requirements of companies entering the Banyan, Tembusu and Angsana.\"\n\nSembcorp's expansion is timely, given that rivals such as YTL PowerSeraya and Huaneng-owned Tuas Power have started to encroach into the utilities business on Jurong Island. Tuas Power, for instance, just started up its stand-alone coal/biomass-fuelled utilities complex there earlier this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It gave $1 million to the Institute of Technical Education Endowment Fund, and, more recently, $100,000 towards relief efforts in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.\n\nAnd even as the year is fast drawing to a close, there is still one more major CSR event left on its calendar - the annual ChildAid charity concert that is set to take place at MBS this Friday and Saturday at the Sands Theatre.\n\nEach of the three shows will feature a 130-strong cast comprising aerial acrobats, gymnasts, vocalists and musicians - all under the age of 19.\n\nThe event, now into its ninth year, raises money for The Business Times Budding Artists Fund and The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund, both of which benefit children and teens from under-privileged backgrounds.\n\nThis will be the second time that MBS is hosting ChildAid as the official venue partner, as part of a three-year deal that will culminate in the event's 10th anniversary celebrations next year. ChildAid is jointly organised by BT and ST.\n\nApart from helping out in kind, MBS is also contributing $50,000 to ChildAid and getting its staff involved in the event in one way or another, said MBS president and chief executive George Tanasijevich.\n\n\"We have people who are involved in our theatre production, for example, working with the kids and sharing their experiences and understanding about how to put on a major production like this,\" he tells BT.\n\nMr Tanasijevich adds that one of his biggest takeaways from the partnership is the realisation that there is a lot of young talent out there that needs to be nurtured.\n\n\"We have a role to play in this process, given that we have this wonderful facility with all these amenities that support the entertainment industry,\" he says. \"It's quite gratifying for us to host ChildAid and provide the kids with the opportunity to hone their skills. It also gives them a taste of what the entertainment business is all about.\"\n\nThis year, MBS also went the extra mile to get the corporate community involved in their various CSR activities.\n\nPitch to Win, an initiative by MBS and the National Volunteer & Philanthropy Centre, saw five non-profit organisations pitch their ideas and programmes in order to secure the funds needed to make them a reality. Senior MBS executives volunteered their time to help them fine-tune their presentations.\n\nTwenty companies ranging from banks to local small and medium enterprises came in to support causes aligned to their respective CSR goals. At the end of it all, the Alzheimer's Disease Association came up trumps by bagging the highest funding of $111,000.\n\n\"We hope that we gave the non-profits some skills that they could take and deploy elsewhere and increase their effectiveness at fund-raising. They need to be recognised, noticed and understood, and from that will flow significant support,\" says Mr Tanasijevich.\n\nNext year, Singaporeans can expect to see more of a certain David Beckham in town as the retired English footballer will be part of MBS's charity efforts once again.\n\nThe 38-year-old - unveiled last week as the newest partner of MBS's parent company, Las Vegas Sands - was in Singapore earlier this year to launch the Sands for Singapore Festival.\n\nBesides interacting with a group of underprivileged children, he also signed a jersey of his final club, France's Paris Saint-Germain, that was put up for auction as part of the festival.\n\n\"He will be coming to Singapore to engage in community events.

Shares will be listed on the Casablanca exchange.\n\n\"We want to raise funds as we're expanding,\" Ms Ahrar said on Friday. \"It's part of a process aimed at opening up the capital of Marsa Maroc. The stakes will depend on what the mandated banks propose.\"\n\nMarsa Maroc needs fresh financing to complete a new container terminal at the Tanger Med facility, west of the city of Tangiers, where a planned capacity of 8.5 million standard boxes a year would put the port on a par with Durban, South Africa, as the biggest on the continent. It also plans to spend close to 80 million euros (S$136.6 million) on a third container facility in Casablanca, the nation's second-biggest port.\n\nMarsa Maroc employs more than 2,200 people, handles 36 million tonnes of cargo a year and had sales of 1.95 billion dirhams (S$296 million) in 2011, according to its latest figures. The company has operations at 10 sites, including Morocco's main energy port, Mohammedia, on the Atlantic coast.\n\nIn Tangiers, close to the Gibraltar Straits and being built into a hub able to lure transhipment traffic away from ports in southern Europe, it aims to open a terminal in 2015 to compete with facilities run by the APM Terminals unit of Danish shipping giant A P Moeller-Maersk, the world's No 3 ports operator, and Germany's Eurogate, the top European independent. The expansion has taken longer than planned as world trade stutters.\n\nThe IPO move follows the relegation earlier this year of the MSCI Morocco index to frontier status from emerging due mostly to tight liquidity, and comes as the government struggles to tame budget and current account deficits that forced it to seek a US$6.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund in 2012.\n\nWhile the budget bill for 2014 didn't list privatisations, the finance ministry said last week it would modify the strategy for running the state asset portfolio. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

At the same time, with the roll-out of the nationwide fibre broadband network and fourth generation telephony (4G) services, Singapore's already good IT connectivity has become even better, among the best in the world. And tech-savvy Singapore has three in four residents carrying a smartphone.\n\nGiven the strength in retail and IT infrastructure, one area of growth that the government wants to promote is e-commerce.\n\nThe online and mobile commerce market here is still largely an untapped opportunity as only 3 per cent (in 2011) of local retail businesses had e-commerce capabilities. Despite that, Singapore's online shopping market is expected to reach US$3.45 billion by 2015.\n\nTo get retailers and technology providers to collaborate to build suitable technology platforms to enhance the online presence of local retailers, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) issued a CFC (call for collaboration) to bring together retailers, e-commerce solution providers and logistics service providers to develop integrated solutions. The CFC has closed and the government is now evaluating proposals.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, an IDA spokesman says the objective of the CFC is to make it easier for retailers to create and maintain their online channel or \"shopfront\" with a \"one-stop service\" which includes essential facilities such as payment, inventory management, content management and last-mile delivery services.\n\nThe spokesman notes that online and mobile commerce is growing strongly in Singapore. However, data suggests that local retailers are not the beneficiaries of this trend.\n\n\"Some reports show that up to 50 per cent of mobile and online purchases originating from Singapore are made on overseas portals.\"\n\nLocal retailers have traditionally focused on their brick-and-mortar strategy and hence do not have the expertise to build up their e-commerce competencies and thus are unable to compete effectively against international players.\n\n\"(Local) retailers have shown great interest in leveraging e-commerce as a channel to engage their customers and extend their market reach beyond Singapore. Thus this programme aims to help our retailers build up an e-commerce presence effectively to compete with their overseas competitors,\" the IDA spokesman adds.\n\nCorlison, one of the largest fully Singapore-owned distribution and brand management firms, believes e-commerce offers an excellent opportunity to brands to capture and retain customers.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Corlison director Andy Ong says: \"In our brand management/distribution industry, we see e-commerce as a means to allow consumers to easily make that first trial purchase of our products for which if they like, they will continue to purchase from regular retail channels.\"\n\nAsked about the major hurdles for retailers in Singapore, Mr Ong says the need to adapt to extremely fast and consistent technological changes, specifically on the interface area, is a big bottleneck.\n\n\"As a simple example, when we started several years back, our e-stores were being designed to accommodate proper formatting on PCs, iPads (and not Android tablets) and iPhones (and not Android or Windows mobile devices). We believe that in the years ahead, there will be many new formats and platforms emerging including a variety of 'wearable tech' like Google Glass and 'smart-watches'. This means we have to constantly evolve not only the coding of e-stores but ways in which to complete transactions.\n\n\"I can already see that the iPhone 5S, with its embedded fingerprint scanner, could lead to faster ways to complete online credit card transactions and also to store delivery/transaction preferences.\"\n\nColin Nah, director of Biz-Era.Net, observes that without any initial advertising, there will not be any traffic, however well an e-commerce site is designed. \"Without traffic, search engines will not pick up the URL from people typing the URL in their browsers, and in turn, the site will remain dormant. Biz-Era.Net is an IT consulting organisation that provides end-to- end IT services.\n\n\"If the initial push to create awareness to the site is done, coupled with on-going SEO (search engine optimisation) and social media interaction, the e-commerce site will gain momentum and become sustainable on its own.\n\n\"Some people may think that an e-commerce site will become a cash cow and that they can retire. However, customers are still people who would enquire on issues such as delivery schedules, shipment status and goods damaged, etc. The e-commerce site has to be able to respond in a timely manner and assure the consumer that there are real people working behind it.\"\n\nElaborating on this point, Corlison's Mr Ong notes that at the end of the day, especially for products sold online, it is still all about logistics. You cannot exempt factors like time and cost of deliveries, availability of stocks, packing, to name a few, just because you sell online.\n\nRajat Kataria of Digitology, an IT solutions company, notes that companies need to realise that online businesses have the potential to become a major revenue channel for retailers.\n\n\"A soft objective should be to make it bigger (in terms of revenue) than the largest brick-and-mortar store of the retailer. It offers a huge leverage wherein the investments are less than a traditional brick-and-mortar model and the reach to potential customers is tremendous. So it's all about the mindset and top management's commitment at the end of the day.\"\n\nMr Kataria adds that the major hurdle centres around running the online store successfully. \"With a limited knowledge pool and expensive resources it becomes very tough for retailers to manage their stores effectively from an operational as well as marketing perspective.\"\n\nThe IDA spokesman says that the CFC aims to establish a Retail Service Framework to groom multiple one-stop e-commerce service providers. These service providers will lower the barrier of entry for retailers aspiring to sell online by providing them with the necessary platform, know-how and logistics services all as one service.\n\n\"Retailers will then focus on their core activity, which is retailing, instead of being faced with the various challenges of going online such as finding the e-commerce platform, logistics players and payment service providers.\"\n\nThe spokesman adds that the Retail Service Framework aims to help not only the retailers to come online easily but also e-commerce service providers and logistics service providers to enjoy economies of scale by establishing a common interface between the e-commerce service platform and logistics systems.\n\n\"Consumers will also be able to enjoy greater peace of mind when buying from the integrated sites and monitor the delivery status of their purchase online,\" the spokesman adds.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Markets fundamentally reward those who correctly identify an erroneous collective, such that the correct contrarian nudges the price towards the right value.\n\nThe Dow Jones US Contrarian Opportunities Index, which seeks to track US stocks that lag the broader market but nevertheless possess stronger fundamentals, had a total return of about 37 per cent in 2013, compared with 29.1 per cent for the S&P 500 index, Bloomberg data showed.\n\nHowever, the numbers were more muted for the MSCI USA Barra Momentum Index, a long-short index that aims to represent a portfolio exposed to momentum risk where the weighting of a stock would typically be higher the faster it is rising. That index returned 28.8 per cent, just a touch behind the S&P 500.\n\nBut in practical terms, those numbers belie the fact that while consensus may have underperformed slightly, it was still mostly on the money in 2013.\n\nAt the start of 2013, for example, Franklin Equity Group institutional portfolio manager George Russell said that \"2013 can be a very good year for US equities and the (US) economy could surprise on the upside\", reflecting the consensus view. He was right on both counts, with US equities being one of the best-performing asset classes this year.\n\nA global survey of fund managers by HSBC at the start of 2013 also showed a 75 per cent preference to overweight equities, and no managers overweight on bonds. Pretty astute.\n\nIf there was one major area where consensus faltered, it was probably over-optimism over Asian growth.\n\nRuss Koesterich, chief investment strategist of BlackRock, recently wrote in a blog post: \"I completely missed on emerging markets. While the stocks were cheap, emerging market growth slowed, not just in China but also in Brazil, India, and even in previously high-flying Mexico.\"\n\nBut contrarians were not always right either. Citi Private Bank chief Asian strategist John Woods in January 2013 recommended Asian currency bonds and high-yield corporate bonds, arguing that spreads against US Treasuries could narrow further. The tapering of quantitative easing threw a twist in that thesis.\n\nThere is obviously no easy solution. One cannot just take the opposite tack; one has to take the correct opposite tack. A contrarian bull wants to buy a falling stock, for example. When should the trigger be pressed? When the stock is down 5 per cent? But what if it falls by another 10 per cent? Should that be a signal to buy more, or to cut losses?\n\nConsensus has found a path that is often correct albeit slow; and there are infinite alternatives to consensus and not all of them will get us to the promised land.\n\nAnd so it is that investors are inevitably left to decide, with every dollar being put to work, whether to jump on the bandwagon or to leave the crowd behind and seek a faster route.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dinner from Mon to Sat: 6pm till late.\n\nOnline reservations at\n\nwww.tipplingclub.com\n\nWHEN it comes to avant garde cooking - note the likes of Adria, Blumenthal, Redzepi, Aduriz and, in the Singapore concept, perhaps Andre Chiang - the niggling question always is: how much of it is about making food that tastes good and how much is it about mucking with the diner's mind?\n\nAs it is, current trends already point to a general fatigue with trends - hence a return to the basics, sustainability, calling a fish a fish (not espuma of thermomixed cod gel)... you know where this is going. But while there's always room for the perfect roast chicken or a comforting apple pie, it's still the chefs who push the envelope that make the dining experience one of joyful discovery.\n\nFor the past five years, Ryan Clift has been doing just that in Tippling Club's original outpost in Dempsey. One of the pioneers of Singapore's tiny avant garde movement, Clift has always been more of a cult favourite than a mainstream \"celebrity\" chef. Although that has been a bit of a double-edged sword for him - the good thing being that he stays true to his own path without doing the PR schtick; on the other hand, he doesn't get the wider public acclaim that he deserves.\n\nPart of that could also be due to Tippling's under-the-radar location in a hidden corner of the otherwise hopping Dempsey village. With its relocation to more visible premises in Tanjong Pagar, that could change. The new place is well, new, which means half the battle is won in terms of attracting buzz. It's also on trend - pleasing pastel green colour scheme, naked bulbs and semi-industrial look add up to a non-intimidating hangout that starts from the bar and leads into the main dining room-cum open kitchen and counter.\n\nFrom the spacious, laboratory-like kitchen, Clift dispenses his meticulously plated creations that form the two tasting menu options at dinner, priced at $160 and $265 respectively without wine pairings. There are no a la carte options for dinner, as it was at the old place, but after the new year, they will introduce a lunch menu that's a more price-friendly $42 and $57 sampling of some of the dinner courses.\n\nThe certified techno-geek Clift is in his element at this new space, rolling out one quirky amuse bouche to another to prepare you for the more heavy-duty mind-challenging courses to follow.\n\nHis take on Singapore curry, for example, is a little glass jar filled with a dense, creamy foam that tastes unmistakably of the coconutty favourite, topped with crunchy puffed rice. That's quickly followed up with silken-textured roasted red peppers encased in black \"carbon\" tempura batter, that you dip into a sculpted sphere of miso-soy dipping cream with a shiny veneer almost like glazed chocolate. Wash that down with a test-tube of clear tomato water with a smear of basil essence on the inside of the tube.\n\nAll this is before the real meal begins - kicking off with an immaculate two-textured omelette that sees creamy scrambled eggs magically encased in a layer of egg skin, finished off with a top layer of smoked eel that almost emulates the texture of the egg. Even as he re-interprets breakfast, the sea gets filtered through Clift's brain and emerges as a creamy blend of milk and elephant garlic infused with razor clam juice, enveloping juicy chunks of shellfish and seaweed-tasting chlorophyll sheets.\n\nEven if you've sworn off foie gras, you're likely to lapse once you've had a taste of the amazing whipped swirl of liver scented with cognac and Christmas spices, served with a curled crispy gaufrette (waffle cookie) and apples every which way - freeze-dried slice, dehydrated chunk and little cubes of apple gummy made using a special machine that cooks things in a vacuum at way below freezing temperatures. Suffice to say that the why and how of it would confuse anyone other than Clift, who has an arsenal of equipment from distillers to evaporators that would make anyone who recently bought a Thermomix cower in shame.\n\nYet, a lot of Clift's weird science works, because he approaches it from a technical, purpose-driven approach to achieving a certain texture or flavour, not because he had a dream about Mother Earth and tree spirits. For that reason, his food is clever without being pretentious and even if it seems unnecessary to take hours and expensive machinery just to make a garnish, that garnish completes the dish. A dish of crispy duck tongues probably wouldn't be complete if something was left out of the ensemble of flourless gnocchi, goat's curd, braised quinoa and celeriac; and you won't want to miss the little sweets like the strawberry and cream \"candy\" or cheesecake \"pills\" in a medicine bottle, and so on.\n\nIf anything, Clift is the leading light in Singapore's niche avant garde segment. Now that he's got a new platform, it's time for him to really shine.\n\nRating:\n\n8\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Further gains in hiring, household wealth and consumer confidence would help boost the housing recovery and give greater momentum to the economy.\n\n\"The combination of bank reluctance to lend and the pop in mortgage rates did throw a monkey wrench in that sector,\" Mike Englund, chief economist at Action Economics LLC in Boulder, Colorado, said before the report. \"We're looking for a solid spring season, but you may not see the big climbs in price until March, April and May.\"\n\nStocks remained lower after the figures, with the Standard & Poor's 500 Index declining 0.1 per cent to 1,840.25 at 10.04 am in New York.\n\nPurchases fell 4 per cent from the year prior on an unadjusted basis after a 2.7 per cent decrease in the 12 months ended in October, the NAR reported.\n\nThe pending sales index was 101.7 on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economists consider pending home sales a leading indicator because they track contract signings. Existing-home sales are tabulated when a contract closes, usually a month or two later.\n\nThe NAR projects that 2013 will be the best year in seven for existing home sales, with an estimated 5.1 million transactions.\n\n\"We may have reached a cyclical low because the positive fundamentals of job creation and household formation are likely to foster a fairly stable level of contract activity in 2014,\" NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement.\n\nNew home sales were close to a five-year high in November as builders responded to pent-up demand unleashed by employment gains and record stock prices.\n\nThe S&P/Case-Shiller national home-price gauge rose 11.2 per cent in the third quarter from the same period in 2012, the biggest year-on-year advance since the first three months of 2006. Its index of property prices in 20 US cities, set for release tomorrow, probably increased 13.5 per cent in October from a year earlier.\n\nHigher mortgage rates are also reducing affordability. The average rate for a 30-year, fixed mortgage was 4.48 per cent in the week ended Dec 26, up from 3.35 per cent a year earlier. In August, the rate reached a two-year high of 4.58 percent.\n\nAfter two years of rapid-fire growth, the housing market shows signs of returning to normal, said Budge Huskey, president and chief executive officer of Coldwell Banker LLC, a real estate services firm in Madison, New Jersey.\n\n\"We've been picking up slack, that's why the pace has been so torrid,\" Mr Huskey said in an interview. \"Going forward, when we start to take a look at year- over-year gains and activity, it's going to appear far more boring, which is not a bad thing.\"\n\nInvestors and speculators who contributed to the run-up in property values in recent years are becoming a less-important factor in the market, Mr Huskey said.\n\n\"We're getting on the right track. We're now getting to a real estate environment that's more about the fundamentals and less about these external factors that are artificially shaping the recovery.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": []}

These subsidiaries, a mix of investment holding, research and development and manufacturing companies, were independently valued and found to have no commercial value, the company said.\n\nAn intermediate holding company, Ever View, also has net liabilities of 139 million yuan. China Oilfield Tech has negative equity of 136 million yuan as at Sept 30 due mainly to secured debt. The company has also been on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) watchlist since March for making three years of pre-tax losses in a row and having a 120-day average market value of under $40 million.\n\n\"Selling the existing business will give the company more flexibility in considering the options to acquire a new business and seek to be removed from the watchlist,\" the company said yesterday.\n\nUpon completion of the deal, the firm will have no operating business and will have a net asset value of 1.8 million yuan, or 0.25 RMB cent a share (0.05 Singapore cent a share). It will become a so-called cash company - a company that consists of just cash - and it would normally be suspended by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) until it has a business that can satisfy SGX's listing requirements. Otherwise, the company could be delisted within a year.\n\nNet sale proceeds of $270,000 will be used for working capital requirements, estimated to be $30,000 a month including audit, staff costs, listing, directors' and professional fees, the firm said. The sale will be completed at the end of next February pending various approvals.\n\nChina Oilfield Tech had held its initial public offering in Singapore in 2007, placing shares at 60 cents each. Based in Heilongjiang province, the firm made equipment used to enhance production from China's mature, depleted oilfields. Investors were attracted to it in an era of soaring oil prices and a fast-growing China economy.\n\nThe company's main customer was Daqing Oilfield Company, owned by state-owned oil and gas giant PetroChina. The Daqing oilfield is the biggest in China. Then the global financial crisis hit and crude oil prices plummeted. To make matters worse, from the third quarter of 2008, Daqing Oilfield encountered a technical problem in its oil recovery production process. The machinery supplied by China Oilfield Tech could not be used. Revenue plunged from 219 million yuan in 2007 to 39 million yuan in 2008, and the company recorded a 120 million yuan loss. In 2009, the company recovered somewhat by selling a different set of equipment. But the technical problem persisted. In 2010, sales fell dramatically, and a loss of 22 million yuan was reported.\n\nTo reduce its reliance on Daqing Oilfield, the company had launched a 457 million yuan investment project in 2009 to make submersible linear oil pumping units. It also set up a subsidiary company in Texas, US. But in 2011, debt problems in the US and the eurozone caused a global economic downturn, affecting the company's overseas development plans. The company recorded a loss of 352 million yuan mostly due to impairment losses. Meanwhile, rare earth, a raw material needed to make the submersible linear pumps, had surged in price, affecting the commercial viability of the product. The plan was put on hold pending product modification.\n\nLast year, revenue was at just 3.3 million yuan and impairment losses again caused the company to record a 483 million yuan net loss. This year, there has been no revenue for the past nine months, even as losses for the period amounted to 32 million yuan. The company was trying to buy the wind energy business owned by chairman Mr Gao, but that was delayed by a shareholding restructuring.\n\nChina Oilfield Tech last traded on Dec 23 at 3.2 cents a share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is critical, given that gas is the fuel of choice, accounting for 85 per cent of electricity generated here today. Another underlying consideration is how the aggregators secure their LNG imports, or source this, and in turn, how it could help the Republic grow as a regional gas hub. The Energy Market Authority (EMA) is now finalising the framework for such future LNG supplies - not just through long-term contracts as is done now, but also through short-term, spot deals.\n\nAdditionally, in its draft determination on LNG imports beyond those by current aggregator BG Group, EMA is taking into account potential new piped natural gas (PNG) supplies. It is lifting the current restrictions on PNG, once BG reaches its franchised LNG sales volume of three million tonnes per annum (tpa), or in 2018, whichever is earlier. Besides these measures, the regulator is also looking to develop a dynamic secondary gas market to allow gas buyers to on-sell gas within Singapore through the domestic gas pipeline network. This will enhance competition by allowing gas buyers and sellers to procure gas from one another.\n\nThis is clearly the intent behind the Competitive Licensing Framework (CLF) that EMA has come up with after two rounds of industry consultation. It will see Singapore adopt a tranche- by-tranche approach to enter the global market to procure LNG, with a competitive process to select the importer/importers with the most reliable and price-competitive supplies. The CLF offers flexibility, as the timing of purchases - taking into consideration prevailing global demand and supply conditions each time - would be a key factor affecting LNG contract pricing. Currently, for instance, it is a seller's market, with Asian demand far outstripping supply, especially with Japan and South Korea buying more LNG to make up for nuclear power losses. Furthermore, exports from US shale gas developments are not expected to begin till later this decade. Fortunately, as incremental gas demand here until 2018 is estimated to be \"not large\", Singapore, in the coming tranche, is looking for the next aggregator to import just an additional one million tpa, or for three years, whichever comes earlier.\n\nGas demand here is, however, expected to grow more rapidly after 2020, although again (thankfully) this will also coincide with new LNG exports from the US, indexed to Henry Hub gas pricing (versus just oil-indexed LNG pricing currently). New LNG supplies are also expected from Australia, Papua New Guinea, Russia and East Africa. However, there are already some market rumblings that the US LNG may not be all that much cheaper, after accounting for liquefaction and shipping costs. That is essentially why, on the gas front, Singapore needs to stay nimble and keep its options open - be it to new opportunities, or new suppliers who can offer cheaper gas.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will also be net cash to the tune of $384 million, from net borrowings of $1.5 billion before the spin-off and capital reduction.\n\n\"The company's financial position is expected to remain healthy, with a strong cash balance and healthy operating cashflow,\" it said. \"The continued cash flow generated from its operations and financial resources are able to support all of its foreseeable near-term investment and operational needs.\"\n\nThis is F&N's second capital reduction exercise after a $3.28 a share payout earlier this year following gains from the sale of its Asia Pacific Breweries stake to Heineken.\n\nThe bulk of the payout will again go to TCC Assets and Thai Beverage, companies linked to Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi that own 88 per cent of F&N.\n\nMr Charoen completed his F&N takeover in February after a six-month tussle with rival bidder Overseas Union Enterprise. He made a final offer that valued the company at $9.55 a share.\n\nBut he had racked up debt to fund his purchase. The proceeds of the earlier cash payout were used to reduce Thai Beverage's debt.\n\nEarlier this month, rating agency Standard & Poor's cut Thai Beverage's credit rating to below investment grade, citing TCC Assets' debt burden as a result of the F&N takeover.\n\nYesterday, F&N ended trading up 23 cents, or 3.9 per cent, at $6.20 a share on a cum dividend and cum entitlement (dividend in specie) basis, before the capital reduction was announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With an increased emphasis on preventive approaches to heart disease, physicians are being encouraged to use risk scoring systems (also termed global risk assessment) in an attempt to categorise patients into various risk levels for heart attack.\n\nGlobal risk assessment of heart artery disease is a calculation of the risk of having a heart attack over a determined period. If you are told by your physician that you have a 20 per cent risk of a heart attack over the next 10 years, does it really mean that you have a one-in-five chance of getting a heart attack within the next 10 years if you do not change your lifestyle? According to the 2013 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association Guideline on Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk, no one has 10 per cent or 20 per cent risk of a heart attack during a 10-year period.\n\nWhat a 20 per cent 10-year risk means is that within a group of individuals with the same risk profile, for every 100 individuals , there will be 20 individuals who will develop a heart attack within the 10-year period. Only those who are predestined to have a heart attack will be able to have the heart attack event prevented by preventive measures. Hence, the scoring system serves mainly as a wake-up call to those with multiple risk factors.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/a4e77a9436030bf41ff52103309491044e6c6627000cccea34a411aaa7481d35?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "TAKE HEED: Before you tuck into your favourite goodies during the upcoming festive period, you may want to know your risk of getting a heart attack or stroke. - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

It is carrying the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, scientists and tourists who are studying changes to the environment of East Antarctica in the century since the region was first explored.\n\nBy yesterday, the icebreaker, the Aurora Australis, was 11 nautical miles from the Shokalskiy, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is coordinating the rescue operation. Chris Turney, a leader of the research expedition, said from the ship: \"We've been in contact with them and we can see them.\"\n\nThe Australis is the second icebreaker to try to reach the ship. A Chinese vessel, the Xue Long, had tried early Saturday, but was stalled by the thick ice.\n\nProf Turney, who is a professor of climate change at the University of New South Wales, said that if the Australian ship was unable to clear a path to free the Shokalskiy, the Xue Long, which has remained in the area, had a helicopter that could be used to ferry people to the Australis. The Australis would take them to Casey Station, a base operated by the Australian Antarctic Division, and from there they would take other ships home. \"We've warned everyone on board that that's a possibility,\" Prof Turney said. All on board are well and morale is good, he said.\n\nThe expedition, with a multi-disciplinary team of about 25 professors and graduate students and 20 tourists, set sail from Bluff, New Zealand, on Dec 8 on what was to be a month-long voyage.\n\nThe expedition is retracing some of the travels, and replicating some of the studies, of Australian geologist Douglas Mawson, who first explored East Antarctica from 1911-14. The ship anchored at the edge of pack ice on Dec 18, and Prof Turney and others spent a day journeying about 72 kilometres across the ice to Mr Mawson's hut. The ship then headed east through open water. But as it began heading north, it \"ran afoul of very strong winds\" that pushed the loose ice in its way. \"It pegged us in,\" he said, and the frozen expanse quickly grew as more ice piled up. \"At first we were just two nautical miles from getting to open water, and now it's 20,\" he said.\n\nEven though it is summer in the Antarctic, waiting for the ice to break up on its own is not an option, Prof Turney said, because of the risk that the ship could drift along with the ice and collide with one of several icebergs in the area, which are drifting independently of the pack ice.\n\nSince the ship became stuck, Prof Turney and others have been a regular presence on Twitter and other social media sites. Some have made short videos describing their experiences. Prof Turney said that some of the people aboard had gone onto the ice to study birds and make other scientific observations, and that others had occupied themselves on board with ad-hoc classes in subjects such as knot tying. And a steady diet of films has been available to help pass the time, he said.\n\n\"At first, people were starting to watch disaster movies,\" Prof Turney added. \"But I had to stop that.\"\n\nNow, it is mostly comedies, although episodes of the hit series Breaking Bad have been popular, too. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a5ea0074d88547b566c1b1b4c0ee17d66d3d1834f90e16de99520b1dddf90e11?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Cold comfort: Some of the people aboard had gone onto the ice to study birds and make other scientific observations, while others had occupied themselves on board with classes on subjects such as knot tying. - PHOTO: AFP"}]}

In turn, they are focusing their attention on business apps that might have a transformational effect on the overall business instead, he noted.\n\nThis was one reason he gave for the uptick in data centre leasing activity in the second half of the year.

Not only can it automate tasks that now require painstaking programming - for example, moving a robot's arm smoothly and efficiently - but it can also sidestep and even tolerate errors, potentially making the term \"computer crash\" obsolete.\n\nThe new computing approach, already in use by some large technology companies, is based on the biological nervous system, specifically on how neurons react to stimuli and connect with other neurons to interpret information.

In the case of the STI, its 11.07-point rise to 3,127.29 cut its loss for the year to 40 points or 1.3 per cent.\n\nSince the US Federal Reserve surprised markets last Wednesday by saying it will be slicing US$10 billion per month off its US$85 billion per month QE3 monetary stimulus, the STI has risen 66 points or 2.2 per cent.\n\nTurnover over the past few weeks has been low, though this is to be expected during the holiday period. In yesterday's half-day session, 1.3 billion worth $442 million were traded. Excluding warrants, there were 234 rises versus 106 falls.\n\nOf the dollar business, $221 million or 50 per cent was done in the 30 STI components. The average unit value traded was 34 cents, not surprising given that of the 20 most active stocks, 18 were priced below 20 cents.\n\nCharisma Energy has been a penny segment leader for some days now. The counter rose 0.3 cent to 7.4 cents with 237.3 million units traded. Others which have become targets for punters, day traders and dealers trading on their own accounts include Albedo, HanKore, Oceanus and Otto Marine.\n\nWall Street's rise to all-time highs means the S&P 500 has risen almost 28 per cent this year. Some analysts are now recommending caution as upside next year could be limited.\n\nFor instance, US newspaper Barron's in its latest online edition quoted Merrill Lynch's Stephen Suttmeier as saying that when the S&P 500 is up two years in a row as it has been for 2012 and 2013, the following year is up 58 per cent of the time and has an average return of 3.3 per cent.\n\n\"This compares with an average annual return of 7.2 per cent and positive annual returns 66 per cent of the time going back to 1928,\" said Mr Suttmeier.\n\n\"Based on history, the S&P 500 could have difficulty matching the 2012 and 2013 (year-to-date) gains of 13.4 and 27.5 per cent, respectively, in 2014.\"\n\nIn its daily notes yesterday, financial research firm Ideaglobal said eurozone stocks have generally lagged the S&P 500 and the Nikkei because Europe was not seen as a recovery play but instead underwent a year in which event risk - namely a break-up of the eurozone - was reduced.\n\n\"The current vogue in the equity space for cyclically adjusted price-earnings (CAPE) models points to US over-valuation and under-valuation in Europe,\" said Ideaglobal.\n\n\"Unless a major negative European story develops, global asset allocators will continue to rotate from US to European equities.\"\n\nIn its \"Back to the Economy\" report yesterday, Rabobank said \"substantial progress\" had been made in the US after the Great Recession.\n\n\"The excess supply in the housing market has largely disappeared and house prices have been rising since February 2012. Residential investment has rebounded and is actually contributing to economic growth,\" said the bank.\n\n\"The US has also been very aggressive in recapitalising the banking system. Consumers have been deleveraging significantly and have benefited from rising house and stock prices. What's more, employment growth has picked up in recent months and that should ultimately lead to income gains.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This figure would be similar to each of the preceding three years.\n\nThe figures cover big-ticket items of at least $10 million. Investment sales reflect the confidence of major property players in the sector's mid to long-term prospects.\n\nProperty consultants expect next year's investment sales to be lower, on the back of a cutback in the Government Land Sales (GLS) Programme for the first half, among other factors. Savills Singapore predicts $20 billion-$25 billion, and CBRE, around $20 billion, in investment sales in 2014.\n\nOn the sharp contraction in the Q4 2013 investment sales number, Savills highlighted that this was from a high base in Q3, which was bolstered by three major real estate investment trust (Reit) flotations - SPH Reit, OUE Hospitality Trust and Soilbuild Business Space Reit - with a combined $5.7 billion initial property portfolio.\n\nAlso contributing to the Q4 decrease is the absence of big-ticket land parcels sold by the government. The third quarter had seen two big GLS transactions - a commercial site at Telok Ayer/Cecil streets and a mixed-use site in Yishun.\n\nHotel deals, which posted a stellar performance in Q3, have also dried up in Q4.\n\nJeremy Lake, executive director at CBRE, said the \"distraction\" of looking at overseas properties continued in Q4, in the absence of compelling deals in Singapore. \"Developers are less sanguine about the outlook for the local residential sector due to the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework and additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD). When sentiment is a bit lukewarm, people tend to look for excuses to kick the can further down the road - and look at the overseas market or go on holidays.\"\n\nSavills Singapore, citing statistics from Real Capital Analytics as at Dec 4, said Singapore buyers have invested about US$15.3 billion in overseas properties this year, up 24.4 per cent from US$12.3 billion in 2012. The US, UK and Malaysia were the top three markets, with US$3.5 billion, US$3.48 billion and US$2.1 billion respectively. Steven Ming, deputy managing director at Savills Singapore, said: \"In addition to providing local developers an opportunity to continue growing their business, spreading their wings overseas offers asset-risk diversification.\"\n\nNew foreign entrants, most notably from China, have also been making their presence felt here, sometimes giving strong competition to local players for residential sites at state land tenders. According to Savills, China players have in all bought nearly $3.3 billion of buildings and land parcels here this year - triple last year's figure of $1 billion. The figures exclude joint ventures with local/ other foreign investors and companies.\n\nCBRE highlighted that Reits were active buyers of Singapore real estate this year, investing around $7.2 billion (as at Dec 3), up around 70 per cent from $4.2 billion for 2012.\n\nGiving a segmental analysis of investment sales up to Dec 21 this year, Savills said the commercial (office and retail) sector, with $10.4 billion of transactions, has overtaken the residential sector ($8.4 billion). The year-to-date tally for the commercial segment is 30 per cent higher than the nearly $8 billion last year.\n\nA key source of commercial building transactions in 2013 has been asset divestments by foreign funds that had been big-time buyers in 2006-2008, as the fund-life approaches an end, noted Mr Ming. Examples include Goldman Sachs' sale of its remaining 51 per cent stake in 16 Collyer Quay and AEW's divestment of 2HR in Havelock Road. GLS sites also contributed to the strong numbers, as did collective sales of commercial buildings such as the $400 million sale of Serangoon Plaza.\n\nCBRE observed that resale activity of completed strata office and retail units has remained resilient post-TDSR. It highlighted SEB's sale of 12 floors in Springleaf Tower on Anson Road this year at $2,200-$2,400 psf to five China parties, an Indonesian party (all buying for own use) and two other parties purchasing for investment.\n\nThe residential sector saw a 36.1 per cent drop in investment sales to $8.4 billion this year from $13.2 billion in 2012. This was partly due to the government staggering the release of private housing sites on the confirmed list; the first sites in the H2 2013 slate were launched only in September. In all, only 17 private housing (including executive condo) sites totalling $5.54 billion have been transacted this year - against 35 sites totalling $8.64 billion in 2012, Savills noted.\n\nBuying activity of residential properties in the private sector was also lukewarm, due to the combination of ABSD and TDSR. Only 115 homes costing at least $10 million have been transacted this year, down from 170 in 2012.\n\nThe factors that will weigh down 2014's investment sales volume - besides the cutback in the GLS Programme - will include rule changes by JTC effective Nov 15, said Mr Ming. These entail a longer holding period for industrial properties on JTC-leased sites, and an extension of the minimum occupation period for anchor tenants.\n\nMr Ming envisages limited hotel transaction activity as the buyer-seller price gap has widened and cap rates softened. Furthermore, hotel assets are tightly held.\n\n\"On the positive side, transactions for prime residential properties, which have been languishing for the past few years, could kick-start in 2014 if prices undergo further adjustment or if, say, Chinese investors decide to accept paying ABSD and launch into this segment in a big way,\" Mr Ming said.\n\nMr Lake said the outlook for next year will depend partly on whether the scale of Reit flotations can match 2013's solid showing.\n\n\"The strata office market for completed properties will continue to remain healthy because there are end-users and more seasoned investors who still like this sector and by and large do not seem to be affected by TDSR. In view of the more positive outlook for the office rental/occu-pation market, we may also see a few more office-building transactions.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Q1 data from STB showed that while arrivals were 9 per cent higher at 3.9 million, spending slipped 6 per cent to $5.7 billion from the corresponding quarter a year ago on weaker gaming revenue and a 6 per cent drop in business travellers (BT) and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and events) arrivals. Spending by BTMICE visitors fell 20 per cent that quarter. Q2 and Q3 figures have yet to be released.\n\n\"Industry feedback indicated that businesses were cutting down on trips and associated budgets, which led to a drop in spend across all components (in Q1 2013), including accommodation, F&B and shopping,\" said STB communications director Oliver Chong, adding that other regional markets also suffered declines in BTMICE arrivals that quarter.\n\nLast year, Singapore attracted 14.4 million visitors who spent $23 billion in tourism receipts. STB is expecting tourism receipts to hit $23.5-24.5 billion this year.\n\nAfter a decade in which tourism growth shifted into high gear, the rate is expected to essentially halve over the next decade, the government said earlier this year. From 2002 to 2012, tourism receipts surged at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent while arrivals increased at a 6.6 per cent CAGR.\n\nStill, DBS Vickers analyst Derek Tan expects visitor arrivals to continue on an upward trend into next year, underpinned by a healthy outlook for travel in South- east Asia and a strong pipeline of MICE events which include the 2014 Singapore Airshow. For 2013 as a whole, he projects spending of $24 billion by a total of 15.5 million tourists.\n\n\"We expect visitor arrivals to grow 6 per cent year-on-year to 16.3 million in 2014,\" he said.\n\nThis year, the River Safari joined the growing list of tourist attractions which the Republic has to offer, while the Kallang Sports Hub will host a number of major sports events when it opens its doors next year.\n\nSince its soft opening in early April, more than 500,000 people have visited the River Safari, of which a third were tourists, though Wildlife Reserves Singapore expects the percentage of tourists to rise in coming months. The River Safari will have its official launch in Q1 next year, after the Amazon River Quest boat ride started operating this month.\n\n\"We targeted 600,000 visitors in the first year,\" said Lee Meng Tat, chief executive of Wildlife Reserves Singapore, adding that he expects higher visitor numbers next year.\n\nThe sixth edition of the Singapore Formula One (F1) Grand Prix in September also brought in more tourists this year. Race promoter Singapore GP (SGP) scored a ticket sales tally of some 87,500 - the highest since the inaugural race in 2008 when 100,000 tickets were snapped up - as more spectators travelled here for the night race.\n\n\"New attractions allow us to expand our offerings to inbound travellers, cater to various segments of the market, draw new and repeat travellers, move consumers up the value chain and reap in higher- yield travellers,\" said Chan Brothers spokeswoman Jane Chang, who estimates a 10 per cent increase in bookings for the travel agency this year over 2012. \"That said, there is also a ceiling to how long we can stretch a tourist's stay in Singapore despite the bells and whistles of the new attractions.\"\n\nHotel occupancies have more or less held firm this year, while a slight decrease in room rate translated to a corresponding decline in RevPAR.\n\nSTB's preliminary statistics for January to October showed occupancies at 87 per cent, while ARR dipped 1.1 per cent to $258 and RevPAR to $224. In segment terms, luxury hotels were the only category to post an increase in RevPAR, up 9 per cent. RevPar declines were seen in upscale (-12 per cent), mid-tier (-3 per cent) and economy (-8 per cent) hotels, likely caused by a double whammy of increased supply and weaker corporate travel demand.\n\nAccording to CBRE Hotels, the hospitality sector will end the year with an ARR of $255-260 and an average occupancy of 86 per cent, translating to a RevPAR of $220-225. This suggests rates and RevPAR could slip very slightly from the $257 and $222 respectively seen last year, while average occupancy will stay flat.\n\nSimilarly, Cushman & Wakefield estimates that rates and RevPAR will both dip 0.5 per cent year-on-year, while DBS Vickers projects ARR and RevPar at $254 and $221 this year.\n\n\"It's what we expected it to be - a little softer from last year,\" said CBRE executive director Robert McIntosh, noting that hoteliers are having a tough time pushing up room rates further.\n\nIn addition, the growth in visitor arrivals is outpacing the 4-5 per cent increase in the number of room nights sold, which suggests travellers could be staying shorter periods, possibly because of the strong Singapore dollar relative to regional currencies as well as the nation's push to position itself as a destination for quality tourism.\n\n\"Market-wide room rates experienced slight downward pressure year-to-date due to increasing competition from newly opened hotels which are offering preferential room rates,\" added Akshay Kulkarni, regional director (hospitality) at Cushman & Wakefield.\n\nProperties which came onstream this year include the Westin, Parkroyal@Pick- ering, the Ramada and Carlton City Hotel. New hotels opening in 2014 include Sofitel So, the Patina as well as the Holiday Inn Express at Havelock.\n\nBy CBRE Hotels' calculations, some 3,500 new rooms will have launched by year-end - adding to the industry's supply of 51,620 rooms as at end-2012 - with more than 1,000 from the economy segment, 1,400 from the mid-scale segment and the rest from the luxury segment.\n\nNext year, some 2,900 rooms will be added from largely the economy and mid-scale segments, which could put pressure on occupancies in these two categories, cautioned Mr McIntosh.\n\nDespite the stiffer competition from the supply injection, both CBRE Hotels and Cushman & Wakefield reckon the pipeline of rooms will be well absorbed and are unlikely to lead to a supply glut.\n\nSaid Mr Kulkarni: \"Although the 2013-14 increase in room supply is size- able at around 6,600, we think the pressure on room rates is going to be a short-term phenomenon and that rates will pick up in the second half of 2014.\"\n\nDBS Vickers' Mr Tan is similarly upbeat for next year, with projections of a modest improvement in performance to $260 for ARR and $226 for RevPAR.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It exposes a different target market to the nightlife scene, which helps to grow the market for everyone involved.\n\nMore radio stations are now playing songs that are popular in clubs and this accessibility to dance music has made the nightlife scene a lot more popular, resulting in larger crowds at the clubs and at music festivals not just in Singapore but around the world. However, the commercialisation of the scene has also resulted in nightlife concepts and music becoming increasingly predictable.\n\nAnother potential challenge is the cancellation and failure of a few music festivals and concerts that were supposed to be held earlier this year. This will hurt Singapore's credibility, and artistes and customers may become increasingly sceptical of future events.\n\nI hope the nightlife industry continues to re-invent itself in 2014.\n\nAs dance music becomes the new pop, emerging artistes will hopefully develop new styles instead of sticking to the tried and tested, and this will result in more clubs for different niches.\n\n\"Vibe dining\" - the concept where diners can have a drink at the bar, then have dinner with a DJ spinning in the background, before continuing the after-party at the club in the next room - is a trend that I see emerging in 2014. Bacchanalia, which opened this year, is a restaurant with the vibe dining concept, and a new restaurant that we're opening in Clarke Quay next year will have that element as well.\n\n2013 was an exciting year for us as we became a major shareholder of Lifebrandz and consequently gained a stronghold in Clarke Quay, the leading nightlife destination in Singapore. We opened new venues such as Dream, Fenix Room and Provocateur in Singapore and took over Rootz in Kuala Lumpur, as well as opened Providence, a nightclub, and Ohla tapas bar, also in KL.\n\nBesides tweaking some of Lifebrandz's existing concepts in 2014, we'll also be working with them to open a craft beer and gourmet hot dog spot in Clarke Quay, and a steak and grill restaurant. We are also working on a food delivery service, a cafe franchise, and exploring a few projects in the region.\n\nHowever, staffing will continue to be a major issue for us and the industry at large. We are highly dependent on labour at our outlets - you can't do VIP bottle service and have customers pick up their own bottles. If we are not able to hire staff, then we may have to curtail our expansion plans in Singapore and focus on opportunities in other countries. Rental costs, too, continue to rise and this ultimately get passed on to consumers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Writers featured in 2013 include Roald Dahl, Jane Austen Rynosuke Akutagawa and Phillip K Dick.\n\nFrame x Frame continues its efforts to promote local cinema as we present theatrical runs of works and films by Singaporean directors. Some works featured this year include Wong Chen-Hsi's Innocents and Amit Virmani's Menstrual Man, among others.\n\nWe also collaborated with the Singapore Film Society to bring SFS Talkies @ The Arts House to showcase independent films from around the world that are not typically available commercially in cinemas here. In 2013, films such as Ai Wei Wei: Never Sorry, Tyrannosaur and This Is Not A Film were featured. This will also continue into next year.\n\nIn an ongoing collaboration with NUS Middle East Institute, we will continue to show films with a focus on the Middle East in Middle East Movie Nights. Films featured this year include Monsieur Ibrahim and Grandma, A ThousandTimes.\n\nSCUM Cinema had its inaugural screening this month and the series will continue bi-monthly showing (good) B-rated movies.\n\n(On the festival front), this year, we hosted the inaugural Endeavours Documentary Film Festival, which will be returning next year as well. It's great because it pays homage to documentary filmmaking and it is a great platform for budding docu-filmmakers to submit their entries and have them debut locally.\n\nWe also co-hosted the inaugural Singapore Chinese Film Festival, held at Cathay and The Arts House, and organised by UniSIM Centre for Chinese Studies and Singapore Film Society. It's a film festival that focuses on Taiwanese/China films and it's one of the fastest-growing film industries in the world. It'll continue in 2014.\n\nBig Eyes Big Minds, a children's film festival, will also return for the fourth year in 2014.\n\nA number of embassies liked our cosy and intimate screening room, and have been approaching us for a number of embassy-presented film festivals. Significantly, the Slovak Film Festival was held in Singapore for the first time in April 2013, while the Czech film festival returned for the second season in October 2013. Other on-going partnerships include the Spanish and Taiwanese film festivals, which will return in 2014.\n\nMany of these film screenings (e.g. But Is The Book Better, Middle East Movie Nights, SCUM Cinema, embassy-presented films) are free, with post-show discussions.\n\nWhile there is an increasing number of patrons watching the films, we feel that more Singaporeans could take advantage of the free screenings. For this, we will continue to work with partners and the media to spread the word.\n\nIt's great for the Singapore film industry that the Singapore International Film Festival (SIFF) is making its long-awaited comeback. Its absence left a hole that no other film festival or programme could fully fill. We expect to see SIFF and festival director Yuni Hadi unearthing and showcasing Singapore gems and filmmakers.\n\nThere could be greater emphasis on independent South-east Asian films as well if Singapore wants to be a key player in the region.\n\nHopefully, buoyed by the success of Ilo Ilo, more filmmakers will be encouraged to make their own kind of films instead of following a formula. Also, they might be inspired to look for more Singapore stories to tell, be it from their own imagination, a Singapore novel or even a play.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The price is understood to be $970 million in a deal concluded over the weekend.\n\nThis is $10 million less than the $980 million amount that Perennial, headed by Pua Seck Guan, was earlier doing due diligence to buy the asset under a letter of intent granted by the building's owner, a fund managed by Pacific Star. However, in late September, Perennial aborted the proposed transaction after the fund raised the asking price to $1 billion.\n\nAt least one other potential buyer, Lend Lease, is understood to have been approached. The Australian property giant did due diligence but when no deal materialised, Perennial was brought back into the picture.\n\nThe $970 million transacted price for Triple One Somerset works out to about $1,714 psf on the property's net lettable area (NLA) of around 566,000 sq ft. This includes some 60,000 sq ft of retail space, with offices making up the rest. Formerly known as the Singapore Power Building, the 17-storey property is on a site with a balance lease term of about 61 years. It is located opposite Somerset MRT Station, Jones Lang LaSalle and CBRE brokered the transaction.\n\nSingapore-based Pacific Star's Asia Real Estate Income Fund (AREIF) paid $1.01 billion or $1,836 psf on NLA in early 2008 for the property, which it picked up from Singapore Power and Public Utilities Board. AREIF is said to have later invested about $80 million sprucing up the asset, including converting its first two levels to retail space and revamping the entrance and lobby.\n\nAREIF's investors are said to include Great Eastern, Qatar Investment Authority and German funds.\n\nTripleOne Somerset's office tenants include AXA Life Insurance, WorleyParsons, Parkway Group, International Air Transport Association and Petra Foods. Healthway Medical Group operates several clinics in the building.\n\nIts retailer tenants include NTUC FairPrice which runs gourmet supermarket FairPrice Finest, Chinese restaurant group Imperial Treasure, Atlas Sound and Vision, and The Orientalist Carpets.\n\nThe building has 403 basement carpark lots.\n\nBased on an earlier BT report, TripleOne Somerset generates annual net property income of around $40 million - which would translate to around 4 per cent net yield based on the $970 million.\n\nTalk in the market is that China interests are likely to take part in Mr Pua's consortium. It would also not be surprising if some of Perennial's familiar partners such as George Quek's BreadTalk Group and Ron Sim join forces with Perennial on its latest acquisition.\n\nMr Pua is also reported to be looking at further asset enhancement for TripleOne Somerset, including converting even more of the office space to higher-yielding retail space. Another possibility would be to lease out more office units as medical suites.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, he's creating sound sculptures by exposing such integrated circuits that are normally all closed up and tucked away unseen.\n\nFor his first solo exhibition in three years, and in a rare gallery show, Zulkifle is using wires like a sculptural form, while they are still functional as sound works. The additional touch is wiring them to light sensors for the interactive element.\n\n\"The approach is more sculptural and it's sound-based so what you'll see are metal pieces soldered carefully together,\" he explains. For his exhibition, he will have nine wall-hung sound reliefs, four standing sculptures, a sound installation and sketches.\n\nThe idea behind these sculptures is the rapid change of Singapore, indicating also the changing memories of the country. \"One day a bus stop could be here, and two weeks later somewhere else because of road works or diversion because of the MRT line,\" he relates. Not to mention the higher noise levels, from construction and the increase in population.\n\nAt the forefront of Singapore's sound-media artists in the country's contemporary art development, the 38-year-old was first introduced to soundwork in Norway in 2000, when the more common practice was computer or electronic music. The LaSalle-trained sculptor eventually focused solely on sound work - design and installation - from 2006 onwards.\n\n\"I first learnt about electrical circuits from toys. That was a good start because they won't be short-circuited,\" he quips, explaining how he'd open up a toy piano to see how the circuit worked. Most of his works in the past decade are big scale installations, like a dialogue or response to the space itself.\n\nHaving presented internationally, his overseas works include a sound art performance at Ogaki Biennale in 2006. He was the first Singaporean sound artist with an installation at the Singapore Pavilion in the 2007 Venice Biennale.\n\nFor this exhibition at The Private Museum, Sonically Exposed, Zulkifle returns to sculpture, similar to his first solo in 2000 after his art residency programme in Norway.\n\nWhile his early sound installations involved recordings and manipulating them, over the years, they have become more complex and now involve more components. He uses voices, vocals, mechanical sounds, and in sound sculptures like in Sonically Exposed, they are sculptural in their own right, and also with the light sensors, the sound can also be triggered by movement rather than just being static. \"So that there can be a variation of sound,\" he adds.\n\n\"The challenge was to work with all these exposed wires as they are sculptural and yet function. Then I have to also make sure they don't touch one another and thus run the risk of short-circuiting.\"\n\nSonically Exposed is an introduction of sound work to collectors and offers collectors a chance to appreciate yet another dimension of multi-media and visual art works.\n\nSonically Exposed will run from Jan 15-March 9, 2014, at The Private Museum, 51 Waterloo Street #02-06. The artist will give a talk on Jan 18, 3pm, at the gallery.\n\nPlease RSVP to mail@theprivatemuseum.org or call 6738 2872.

By Jan 15, 2014, he would know if Santa has granted his wish to be the new owner of Spanish League football club Valencia CF.\n\nIn a press conference held on Sunday afternoon before Valencia's match against Real Madrid, Valencia's president, Amadeo Salvo, announced that Mr Lim, the 10th richest man in Singapore according to Forbes, had agreed to invest an initial 400 million euros (S$692 million) in the financially stricken club. Mr Lim has also offered to erase Valencia's debt to Spanish bank Bankia.\n\nThe arrangement could see Mr Lim buy the 70 per cent share belonging to the Valencia Foundation.\n\nHowever, the agreement will not be official until Bankia, which holds the debt of the club, gives its approval. About 12 days ago, Bankia said it was putting Valencia up for sale.\n\nMr Lim has set the Jan 15 deadline for the offer to be accepted, so that the club can reinforce its squad in the January transfer window with the hope of challenging for Champions League places come the end of the season.\n\n\"Mr Lim's offer is amazing,\" Mr Salvo said.\n\n\"The club has to sell for a price between 200 and 250 million euros,\" he added. \"The new investor has to eliminate the debt we have with the bank, invest in players, promise to finish the new stadium and to let the club be run by the people of Valencia. Lim's offer meets all these requirements.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mr Lim declined to comment.\n\nValencia's fortunes on and off the field have suffered since a financial crisis struck Spain in 2009. The club has been unable to finish work on the Nou Mestalla stadium and has had to sell a number of its best players to raise capital.\n\nRecently, Valencia was named one of the seven Spanish clubs to be investigated by the European Commission for alleged illegal state aid in which local government played a role in guaranteeing the loans taken out by the club from Bankia.\n\nThe search for a new investor has not been easy. Mr Salvo has spent months searching for a big investor in Valencia and thanks to super-agent Jorges Mendes, he has found Mr Lim. The 60-year-old is an avid sports fan worth around US$2.05 billion. He has also shown interest in buying a stake in rival Spanish club, Atletico de Madrid.\n\nIn an effort to seek refinancing initially, Valencia travelled to Asia, including China and Singapore. On Nov 2, it met Mr Lim, who showed interest in the project.\n\nMr Salvo said: \"Lim is very passionate about football. In November, we opened advanced discussions about the future of Valencia. Upon our arrival back in Valencia, we came to the understanding that it would be difficult to refinance with Bankia.\n\n\"There is a multinational company that can guarantee 130 million euros to finish the Nou Mestalla stadium. It's a very real project and not fictitious. It's always been said that, if we needed to sell, it should be for around 200-300 million euros, which would eliminate our debt. I've always stated that this is wrong and it wouldn't work with a venture capital fund. We needed someone objective and not speculation.\"\n\nHe said following Bankia's statements, Mr Lim called the club and came to Valencia to meet the president of the board and vice- president of the foundation.\n\n\"Given this offer, which is one of two or three biggest deals in the world to purchase a club, we were obligated to present it to Bankia,\" Mr Salvo said.\n\nHe added that Bankia was impressed by Mr Lim's \"extraordinary offer\", but needs to review other offers before submitting a report to its board of directors.\n\n\"When Bankia gives the OK, Lim will come to Valencia to explain his project. Mr Lim wants to strengthen the team in January. He wants Valencia to play in the Champions League. This will be one of the biggest transactions in world football. It's a historic opportunity, it will solve all of Valencia's problems,\" Mr Salvo said.\n\nA fishmonger's son, Mr Lim made his fortune through holdings in palm oil producers. No stranger to the European football scene, he offered \u00a3320 million (S$661 million) to buy English Premier League soccer club Liverpool FC in 2010. But his all-cash offer for the club was eventually scuttled by an offer from New England Sports Ventures, owner of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nMr Lim is also reported to have shown interest in Rangers FC in Glasgow, Scotland. Mr Salvo confirmed that Mr Lim had tried to purchase Valencia under former president Manuel Llorente, but was turned down.\n\nMr Lim is not the only ultra-wealthy person in Asia interested in the top football clubs in Europe.\n\nIn 2011, Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes, founder of budget airline AirAsia and chief of Formula One Team Lotus, completed the takeover of English soccer team Queens Park Rangers. Another Malaysian tycoon, Vincent Tan, has been dominating soccer headlines of late, albeit for the wrong reasons, when he threatened to axe Malky Mackay, the boss of his newly acquired Welsh club, Cardiff City.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/f9d675e538da206a4b6c844207e081427794ec7ffe053ff4d1f01cd6e51ec913?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Angela Tan"}]}

The current No 5 campaign brought home US$32,161, while Singapore's top campaign Pirate3D snagged US$1.4 million.\n\nNuke Venom, a patent-pending eyewear system centred around a screwless hinge, allows users to interchange lenses, frames, side arms and colours to create a pair that fits their individual needs or simply tickles their fancy.\n\nUsers can even customise and see what their eyewear looks like on Nuke's website prior to purchase.\n\n\"There is quite simply no other brand in the world that allows users to choose from 108 parts and create over a million combinations of eyewear under a single system,\" Nuke's founder M Samy told BT.\n\n\"What we have done is bring the 'manufacturing' of the eyewear to the consumer and not sell them ready-made stocks usually based on a narrow product focus like safety, lifestyle or sports.\"\n\nHe added that as a result, each user's pair is a unique reflection of his or her own personality and freedom of choice.\n\nIssac Gunawan, a health, safety and environment coordinator on Jurong Island, told BT that Nuke's Beast series - which comprises eyewear built for maximum toughness and protection - is a hit among his colleagues in the safety industry. \"These are safety glasses that do not sacrifice style. The colours are amazing,\" he said.\n\nFellow Nuke user Mohamad Sufiyan Bin Jamal first heard of the brand from his brother who represented Singapore in a flowriding competition and was sponsored eyewear from Nuke. Mr Sufiyan then became a dealer for Nuke, and finally joined the company as sales in-charge.\n\n\"To us, Nuke is a tool for freedom. When you can make every single person experience that freedom, that's limitless,\" Mr Samy said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the issue is they have been underperforming for the last five years, with very few exceptions,\" he said.\n\nThe problem this year has centred on managers' inability to get ahead of central bank monetary action, which has driven markets, and the fact that asset prices have headed upwards almost continuously, leaving funds which \"hedge\" against downside risk left behind.\n\nHedge funds claim that they can make money in all markets and deliver returns with less volatility than traditional assets over the medium term, but this can be a hard sell when stock markets are rising so quickly.\n\n\"Arguably in the long term it's fine, but it doesn't feel good when equity markets are up 20 per cent or more,\" said Anthony Lawler, who invests in hedge funds at asset manager GAM.\n\nStill, some funds outperformed.\n\nLansdowne Partners' US$10 billion long-short equity fund was up 33.3 per cent by mid-December, helped by gains in one of its largest holdings, Lloyds Banking Group, while Egerton Capital's main fund was 23.5 per cent ahead.\n\nCredit-focused funds also beat traditional investments, with funds trading high-yield debt returning 8 to 10 per cent, investors familiar with the sector said.\n\nElsewhere, global macro managers, who bet on shifts in the global economy and are among the most-celebrated in the industry, struggled to get to grips with central bank policy.\n\nFunds who bet Japan's monetary stimulus would send the yen sliding, like those run by Caxton Associates and Moore Capital, generated double-digit gains, but others found it tough to make money from their usual bets on Treasuries as the US moved towards tapering its US$85 billion a month asset-buying programme.\n\nThe US$16 billion Blue-Crest Capital International fund is flat while Brevan Howard - the largest hedge fund manager in Europe - had only made 2.2 per cent in its Master fund by the end of November.\n\nMeanwhile computer-driven funds, staffed by mathematicians who employ complex algorithms to try and outwit markets, had another down year amid a lack of discernible trends in markets.\n\nBlueTrend - part of BlueCrest Capital - fell 8.7 per cent during the first 11 months of 2013. Aspect Capital lost out too and was down 6.5 per cent by mid-December, w hile Cantab Capital suffered a far-bigger 29 per cent plunge in its main fund.\n\nSaid Mr Botero: \"Hedge funds need a year when you get more differentiation across markets. Maybe next year will bring that, but if funds still can't perform better, then what can managers say?\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

Limak Holding AS, an Ankara-based builder, holds the remaining 40 per cent.\n\nSabiha Gokcen, located on the Asian side of Istanbul, is the smaller of the two airports serving Turkey's biggest city, handling 14.7 million passengers in 2012 compared with 45 million travellers using TAV's Ataturk Airport. Limak, Bangalore-based GMR and Malaysia Airports bought operational rights to Sabiha Gokcen for 20 years from the Turkish government for 1.93 billion euros in 2007.\n\nThe Indian financial newspaper Economic Times, without saying where it got the information, reported on Dec 13 that Istanbul-based TAV, an affiliate of Aeroports de Paris, reached an agreement to buy the GMR stake. Malaysia Airports said on Monday that it's exercising a right of first refusal to acquire the holding.\n\n\"This is negative for TAV,\" Efe Kalkandelen, an analyst at Istanbul-based Is Investment, said in an e-mailed report.\n\nDiscount carrier Pegasus Airlines is Sabiha Gokcen's biggest user, with Turkish Airlines expanding service at the airport. Charter carriers also serve Sabiha Gokcen. GMR is selling its stake as it awaits a final decision on an operating contract for Mactan-Cebu Airport in the Philippines that's scheduled to be awarded in January. Bloomberg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Estate agent Savills was quoted by the BBC as saying that up to 70 per cent of newly built properties in central London are bought by overseas investors.\n\nThat said, Tim Murphy, chief executive officer at IP Global, noted the overall foreign ownership of central London properties is around only 5 per cent.\n\nEven with the imposition of the tax, London and the UK should remain an attractive location for Singapore investors.\n\nChesterton's Mr Han said \"it' s easy to go in and it's easy to get out as well\" for established and liquid markets such as London.\n\nMr Bikhit from Kay & Co said the top rate of 28 per cent for the UK capital gains tax still compares favourably with other places such as New York and Paris, where it ranges from 35 to 50 per cent depending on the residency status of the owner.\n\nConsultants also emphasised that a capital gains tax is unlike a stamp duty or property tax.\n\n\"You are paying tax only if you make a profit on the asset when you sell it. So people need to remember that if you pay tax you have to make a bunch of money first,\" said IP Global's Mr Murphy.\n\nThe main group who will be hit by the new UK tax are speculators looking to turn a quick profit as their gains (being lower than what they would have for longer-term investors) would be notably lower, market watchers said.\n\nThey noted that Singapore investors are mainly middle-term to long-term investors looking for capital appreciation with some rental yield.\n\nGavin Sung, head of international property sales (Asia Pacific) at Savills, said there may be some who will head for the exit but the number is not likely to be significant.\n\n\"I don't think that it's going to be en masse,\" he said. For example, if there were 100 homes on the market now in London, it may edge up to 105-106 units, Mr Sung said.\n\nThe traditional favourites will still hold strong appeal for Singapore investors, analysts noted. For example, Malaysia has great development potential and relatively low taxes, while Australia remains a familiar market as many Singaporeans have studied there.\n\nMr Sung said the interventions by foreign governments should be seen as preventing local property markets from spiralling out of control.\n\n\"The worst thing you want is to keep having big booms and crashes, booms and crashes; what you want is long-term sustained growth because that benefits everybody,\" he said.\n\nUltimately, when a Singapore investor decides to venture abroad, he or she must look beyond these immediate measures, said Chesterton's Mr Han. Factors such as political stability, currency risks, supply and overall buoyancy of the market should all be considered.\n\n\"Don't go into a market where you are completely a greenhorn because you will be paying a premium to learn - they call it tuition fees,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Hyundai Merchant Marine Co, the biggest shareholder of Hyundai Securities, plans to sell stakes in its terminal business and restructure bulk carrier operations for about 1.5 trillion won.

Hyundai Merchant plans to sell a container box yard in South Korea as well as real estate that it owns in the US, China and Singapore.\n\nSouth Korean freight carriers are seeking to pare debt as an expansion after the 2008 global financial crisis pushed them into losses.

Chen Kenmin, a Chinese chef from Sichuan province, moves to Japan in the 1960s and opens a successful restaurant. He passes the business on to his eldest son - who has both a Japanese name and Iron Chef status. This son - Chen Kenichi - grows his father's Sichuan restaurant into a successful chain called Shisen Hanten, which he runs with his own son Kentaro. And now, the latter has been tasked by a local hotel to import Sichuan cooking from Tokyo, to serve to Singaporeans - who are mostly Chinese, rarely have Japanese names, and even more rarely make a beeline to Tokyo because it's, you know, so well known for its fantastic Chinese food.\n\nThat bit of head-scratching aside, this newest Nippon import couldn't have picked a nicer place to settle down in, as the former Pine Court at Mandarin Orchard Singapore has been turned into an elegant, chandeliered showpiece that's opulent without being in your face. With a 35th floor city view and efficient, mature staff who are attuned to your every need, the hardware has certainly been seen to. They should have saved a bit more scrutiny for the menu though, which sits on a shaky fence between familiar Cantonese favourites and a curated selection of Sichuan specialities as determined by consultant chef Chen Kentaro.\n\nIn the same way that you can't take the Chinese out of the Singaporean sushi chef, it's hard to get the Japanese influence out of Szechwan Fan Dian's cuisine even if chef Kentaro is ethnically Chinese. Not when you've spent your entire career cooking for a Japanese palate which tastes things a little differently - like their preference for non-spicy, starch-thickened curry, their un-Italian approach to pasta or their penchant for pickled ume plums and super-sweet confectionery. Which is why Szechwan Fan Dian's cuisine has a not-quite-there quality about it, with even its so-called signature dishes somehow just missing the sweet spot where authenticity and flavour conjoin. In fact, we would have happily forgone authenticity for just plain tasty food but the chefs somehow didn't get the memo on that.\n\nMaybe they were just taking their cue from the Cantonese side of the kitchen, which pushes out pedestrian dim sum and may have had a hand in the cold appetiser trio ($15) of century egg, cold shredded chicken in spicy peanut sauce and artificial-tasting jellyfish in a cloying sweet sour dressing.\n\nThe appetiser is also part of the $58 set lunch, which is a convenient, but bad choice. Apart from the middling appetiser, you get an almost inedible starchy corn soup (the ala carte hot and sour soup is almost as bad), skinny strips of stirfried beef hidden under a mountain of julienned green pepper and bamboo shoot or juicy fried pork chunks in a harsh, overly acidic black vinegar-sweet sauce, before ending off with the house special mapo dofu with Hokkaido rice.\n\nThe spicy dofu has heat but underwhelming flavour - that's assuming you were brave enough to dig beyond the thick layer of oil between you and the soft silken tofu. The Hokkaido rice it comes with reminds you of typical Japanese meals that end with gohan (rice), except there are no pickles here.\n\nOn a second visit to the restaurant - in case the set lunch was an anomaly - we're still left cold - literally, thanks to the icy dry chicken breast doused in chilli oil dressing ($26) that could have potential if they'd used thigh meat instead. Another house special - pork stir-fried with garlic leaves ($26) and special Sichuan sauce - turns out to be an average saute of pork belly with leeks and a peppery black bean sauce. We order the mapo dofu ($24) again but with less oil, which makes it a little more palatable if still pretty average.\n\nIronically, one dish we would return for would be the chef's special spicy noodle soup ($12 for a paltry portion), with its delicious chewy ramen-like noodles in a suitably tingly chilli-enhanced broth. It's far superior to the stodgy dry dan dan version. Order the noodle soup and the delicate almond pudding and you will have a pleasant light lunch that won't make you feel ripped off.\n\nIf that's not enough, then you take your chances with the rest of the menu. Maybe chef Kentaro needs to come to Singapore more often to oversee the cooking because right now, for all their efforts, something is lost in the translation.\n\nRating:\n\n6\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The 777X will be Boeing's first passenger jet of the next decade, and Hong Kong-based Cathay said that deliveries will run from 2021 through 2024.\n\nCathay's purchase pushed the value of 777X deals past US$100 billion at list prices with commitments since September from Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Persian Gulf carriers Emirates, Etihad Airways PJSC and Qatar Airways Ltd. Buyers typically get a discount.\n\nThe twin-engine 777X, which seats 400 people and aims to match payload capabilities of a four-engine 747 jumbo, boasts new General Electric Co GE9X turbines and the largest-ever wing for Chicago-based Boeing, with a fold to conserve airport space. GE, which has exclusivity on the model, said that the booked engine orders are valued at more than US$21 billion.\n\nBoeing formally introduced the upgraded plane in two variants at the Dubai Air Show last month, with the larger -9X due in 2020 and costing US$377.2 million. The smaller -8X will debut 18 months later and is priced at US$349.8 million.\n\nBoeing has long dominated the wide-body aircraft market and accounts for 55 per cent of the 2,352 global sales backlog, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Airbus has made inroads with its new A350, which tallied 814 orders through November and is targeted at the 300-seat segment once monopolised by the 777.\n\nThe original 777, which debuted in 1995, took six years to accumulate as many orders as the -X, Randy Tinseth, Boeing vice-president for marketing, said on Nov 26 in a blog. The new version's debut has been a boost for the company after setbacks earlier this year with the global grounding of the 787 Dreamliner fleet following a pair of battery meltdowns.\n\nBoeing is narrowing the list of sites where it's considering building the 777X, and a spokesman, Doug Alder, said on Friday that states that bid to play host to an assembly plant were being notified about whether they're still in the running.\n\nThe company touched off a nationwide competition to land the factory, lured by the prospect of thousands of jobs, after Machinists in its Seattle-area commercial hub rejected a contract extension with labour concessions that would have kept assembly of the jet in Washington state. Boeing expects to make a decision early next year on a factory site.\n\nCathay said that the order will replenish and expand capacity. Chief executive John Slosar has been seeking to replace a fleet of 747-400 jumbos with more fuel-efficient jets amid increased competition for business travellers with Dubai-based Emirates.\n\nEmirates, the largest international carrier, last month ordered 150 777X planes worth US$76 billion, with an option to buy 50 more. It's also the No 1 operator of the original 777.\n\nAt the end of June, Cathay had a fleet of 134 planes, excluding its Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Ltd and Air Hong Kong Ltd units, with 32 original 777-300ERs among them, according to an earnings report. It also had 81 aircraft on firm order.\n\nThe Asian carrier last year agreed to convert 16 orders for the Airbus A350-900 wide-body into A350-1000s, while also agreeing to add 10 more of the larger planes.\n\nCathay was assessing the 747-8 and A380 superjumbo, which also has four engines, Mr Slosar said in June. The decision signals that the models don't have a home there, said Will Horton, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Capa Centre for Aviation.\n\n\"The order shows Cathay does not want to fall behind on refleeting the way it did with 747s and A340s,\" Mr Horton said, referring to the jumbo and a four-engine Airbus model. \"The cost inefficiency of those aircraft has really pinched Cathay.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/6231d93cdb0be3ffe82eb81807da0d20e139f282d545d9329358c190f0299bb0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Buying spree: Emirates, the largest international carrier, last month ordered 150 777X planes worth US$76 billion, with an option to buy 50 more.

It echoed the video on the adjoining wall showing a scene from The Wizard of Oz when Dorothy and friends discover that the \"great and powerful wizard\" is just a man pulling levers behind a curtain.\n\nLost To The Future: Contemporary Art From Central Asia\n\nAt the Institute of Contemporary\n\nArts Singapore\n\nTHIS impressive survey of works from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan explored the complex transition Central Asia faced following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. Ranging from videos to sculpture and paintings, the strong artworks by 12 leading artists conveyed confusion, anger, humour, hope and hopelessness.\n\nPlunder\n\nBy Jakkai Siributr\n\nAt Yavuz Fine Art\n\nCURATED by Iola Lenzi, Thai artist Jakkai Siributr's astounding solo exhibition featured a room filled with more than two dozen military forms embroidered with faces of past and present Thai leaders. Against the country's history of political turmoil, they asked the viewer to contemplate what these leaders have really done for the country.\n\nGhost: The Body At The Turn Of The Century\n\nOn until Dec 31\n\nAt Sculpture Square\n\nGHOST boasts potent works by 13 artists that look at the human body as represented in contemporary art. They include almost 90 images of nude female bottoms shot by Amanda Heng, as well as Eric Khoo's artistic installation of Mee Pok Man, his breakthrough film about one man's obsession with a prostitute. But the show's coup is Loo Zihan's documentary installation on the Artists' General Assembly, which recounts in extensive detail the single most important traumatic event in Singapore's art history - Josef Ng's symbolic 1993 snipping of his pubic hair that led to a public uproar and the decade-long ban on performance art.\n\nMise-en-scene: Elysian Fields\n\nBy Ina Conradi Chavez\n\nAt the Substation\n\nTHIS ravishing, multi-sensory animation installation by Ina Conradi Chavez depicts a war pilot who enters a strange limbo after his plane is shot down. Beautifully illustrated and scored, few animations in this writer's memory have presented a more hypnotic meditation on mortality.\n\nEncounter: The Royal Academy In Asia\n\nAt the Institute of Contemporary\n\nArts Singapore\n\nWORKS by Tracey Emin, Antony Gormley, Sopheap Pich, Jose Legaspi, Ian Woo and 45 other artists were assembled for this first-in-Singapore exhibition by Britain's famous Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nThe End Of History\n\nAt an undisclosed location\n\nCURATOR Alan Oei delivered his swansong exhibition for Huang Wei, a fictional World War II era painter whose obsession with the Old Masters like Caravaggio and Velazquez inspired him to paint maimed children in eerie, chiaroscuro compositions. What makes the show especially memorable is its setting in a pre-war shophouse where various characters appear to recount the life of Huang.\n\nThe Collectors Show: Weight Of History\n\nAt the Singapore Art Museum\n\nTHE third edition of SAM's annual Collector Show was another knockout - assembling nothing but the best Asian art in private collections around the world. The spoils included works by Moontien Boonma, Zulkifli Yusoff and Sakshi Gupta.\n\nBlack Forest 2013: Han Sai Por\n\nAt Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts\n\nGalleries 1 and 2\n\nOn until Jan 12\n\nAT the age of 70, acclaimed sculptor Han Sai Por is still going strong, proving it with this exhibition of dark new works that reflect on man's reckless treatment of nature.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nNote: Unless stated, the shows have closed\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, Mersault (a quaint little town in the region) is known to take it so seriously that its annual celebrations have become world renowned. La Paulee de Mersault typically spans three days - known as Les Trois Glorieuses - of drinking and feasting among Burgundian winegrowers and their guests.\n\nBighearted wine lovers here can soon take part in the merrymaking, too, when the French fete manifests as the Paulee de Singapour next month.\n\nTo be held from Jan 24 to 26 at the Capella Hotel Singapore, the local homage to the Burgundian festival will have its own trois glorieuses. The festivities will kick off with a gala wine dinner and auction on the first day, where celebrity guest chefs Tetsuya Wakuda, Nam Quoc Nguyen, Beppe de Vito, Capella Hotel's David Senia and Chek Yong Sam, and event co-organiser Melina Yong will cook for over 360 guests with Ho Ching as the guest-of-honour.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": []}

It combines Japanese puppetry with live action to tell an unusual story of a blind shamisen player named Shun-kin and her sadomasochistic relationship with her humble manservant. Much of the stage is engulfed in darkness, forcing you to sometimes squint through penumbras to follow the tale. But its literal darkness adds to the play's enchantment, haunting you long after you leave the theatre.\n\nNext To Normal\n\nBy Pangdemonium\n\nNO other musical in 2013 came close to being this moving, exhilarating and entertaining. Pangdemonium's staging of Broadway hit Next To Normal was stunningly acted and sung, impeccably designed and sharply choreographed. It tells the story of a woman who suffers from bipolar disorder and the impact this has on her family when she decides to stop taking her meds. As the soundtrack bounces giddily from sad ballads to pulsating rock, songs to reflect her volatile state of mind, so do you.\n\nMusashi\n\nBy Ninagawa Company\n\nDEFTLY blending goofy comedy with heartrending drama, Musashi's story of duelling warriors is a profound meditation on the futility of war. Add to that Ninagawa Company's characteristically high production values and you get a first-rate theatrical treat.\n\n12 Angry Men\n\nBy Nine Years Theatre\n\nFORMED less than two years ago, Mandarin theatre company Nine Years Theatre has been bowling theatre lovers over with its fine staging of canonical works. Its 2013 triumph is its Mandarin adaptation of Reginald Rose's 12 Angry Men which boasted ferociously good performances and solid direction by artistic director Nelson Chia. The company is already starting 2014 with a bang - it is staging Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People in January, followed by Yasmina Reza's Art in February. Expect nothing less than perfectly-calibrated dramas.\n\nAsian Boys Vol 1: Dreamplay\n\nBy Wild Rice\n\nSTUFFED with impossibly funny gags and jokes, Wild Rice's Asian Boys Vol 1: Dreamplay takes you on a whirlwind ride through an imagined history of gay men in Singapore - from the early years of Chinese coolies living in packed quarters and exchanging glances to the present day where finger-snapping dancing queens populate the clubs. But the play's knee-slapping hilarity never attempts to mask its serious concerns - the legal and social discrimination the gay community still faces.\n\nGoing On The Way To Get Lost\n\nBy Gotanndadan\n\nHOW do you describe a story where nothing quite happens and nothing is what they seem - and yet remains thoroughly absorbing? This surreal play begins in a cafe where two women are talking about mundane subjects, before transforming unexpectedly into an existential search for meaning in the modern world. Absurd yet amazing, the productions by Japan's Gotanndadan are said to be among the most well-kept secrets in international theatre. But the good news is that the company is returning to Singapore next January to perform another one of its titles, Suteru Tabi. Buy your tickets now.\n\nMobile 2: Flat Cities\n\nBy The Necessary Stage\n\nMOBILE 2: Flat Cities - a collaboration of Japanese and Singapore theatre practitioners - is a complex and ambitious play that criss-crosses countries, languages, eras and realities. At the heart of the story is a war crime committed by a Japanese soldier during the Occupation that has a ripple effect decades on. It suggests that no one and no country should ever claim moral or cultural superiority, for we all have tainted pasts that catch up with us.\n\nKakak Kau Punya Laki\n\nBy Teater Ekamatra\n\nCAN 9/11, the Jema'ah Islamiyah arrests and the Malay-Muslim community's response to them be turned into a comedy? Yes, they can. In the hands of playwright Alfian Sa'at and director Fared Jainal, the story of four upwardly-mobile Selamat sisters and their black sheep of a sister - Maslindah Selamat, or Mas Selamat for short - becomes a hilarious yet humane allegory of post-9/11 Singapore.\n\nThe Rabbithole\n\nBy Pangdemonium\n\nACTRESS Janice Koh astounds with a fully- committed and wrenching performance of Becca, a woman coming to grips with the death of her son. Though cold and controlled at the start of the play, Koh slowly peels back layer after layer of Becca's personality to reveal a devastated core. Having watched the film version of the play with Nicole Kidman in the same role, one dare say Koh was more convincing.\n\nOthello\n\nBy Singapore Repertory Theatre\n\nALTHOUGH the lead actor was a letdown, the Singapore Repertory Theatre's production of Shakespeare's Othello was still a mightily theatrical treat, relocating the story of the jealous Moor general and his ill-fated wife to a modern-day army base complete with GIs, missiles and satellite dishes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Although this record is not without blemish, Mr Bernanke has, in particular, one towering achievement to his credit and for which he will be long remembered: he has successfully steered US monetary policy through arguably the most dangerous period since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nWhen he took over as Fed chairman in February 2006, the US economy was strong and its real estate and stock markets were roaring. Mr Bernanke initially underestimated the dangers that lay ahead. For instance, in March 2007 - just months before the global financial crisis erupted - he was telling the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress that the economic impact of the problems in the subprime mortgage market (which were already visible) \"seems likely to be contained\".\n\nAlthough he did not act in time to prevent the crisis, once it broke out, he dealt with it with courage and skill. He was willing to be aggressive and unconventional, which is what the situation demanded. He unleashed three rounds of quantitative easing (QE) in succession, and pushed the Fed Funds rate down from 5.25 per cent in June 2006 to 0-0.25 per cent by December 2008. During the worst of the crisis, he provided special emergency loans to US financial institutions, many of which would probably have gone bankrupt without them. In the process, he permitted the Fed's balance sheet to swell to record levels.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

According to the agreement, GLP and Haier will collaborate closely to develop and operate logistics facilities catering to Haier's requirements for logistics centres across China.\n\nBoth companies also agreed to integrate strategic resources, including capital, land sourcing and management expertise to build specialised parks for the home appliance industry in prime markets across China.\n\nGLP Park Liantang is located in Shanghai Qingpu Liantang Industrial Park, an important manufacturing base.\n\nThis is the second lease agreement between the two companies since they formed the strategic partnership.

Charter costs for all four of the vessel types making up the index are set for the best quarterly performances in two years.\n\nAustralia, the world's largest iron-ore exporter, raised its shipments of the steelmaking raw material to leading global importer China by 19 per cent in the first 10 months of 2013, government data show. The increase helps shipping because the cargo generates more demand than any other dry-bulk commodity and growth is taking place as the fleet's expansion slows.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

And his wife, as she does every morning, scolded him for needlessly using so much water.\n\n\"How can I justify the amount of time I'm taking?\" Mr Ng recalled thinking to himself. And while looking at the water running down the drain, he got an idea.\n\nWhy not harness that wasted water running down the drain? With Hong Kong's high concentration of skyscrapers, could gravity generate a considerable amount of electricity?\n\nFortunately, Mr Ng is the grandson of the founder of Sino Land, a Hong Kong property developer, and one of the company's executive directors. So he set up a prototype system in Olympian City, one of the company's shopping malls in Hong Kong.\n\nThe system uses excess pressure in the water system to spin a Swiss-built turbine, which generates electricity to power the lights in a back room. Mr Ng is also installing turbines in the company's newest apartment development, a multi-tower project up to 48 stories tall called The Avenue in Hong Kong's Wanchai neighbourhood, that should be able to power the lighting in entrances, elevator lobbies and other public areas of the building.\n\nThere are many reasons the novel idea might not work. Small-scale systems cannot easily generate enough power to justify their cost to large developers. The price per kilowatt-hour of generating power can be five times as high as simply buying it from the grid. And factors like simple geography - will water be flowing far enough down? - can derail plans for turbines built into municipal water infrastructure.\n\nNonetheless, the developer has pitched the concept to the governments of Beijing, Hong Kong and Singapore. He said the feedback from Hong Kong in particular had been very positive, with the city's new director of water supplies, Enoch Lam, expressing interest.\n\nHong Kong is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with about 23,000 people per square mile in its most crowded district. About 40 per cent of the city's territory is devoted to parkland, and Hong Kong crowds people into office towers and residential apartment blocks that often top 50 stories.\n\nEnergy-sucking monsters\n\n\"All these buildings are energy-sucking monsters,\" said Claude Touikan, a Hong Kong-based director at the architecture and engineering firm Benoy, which is not involved with Mr Ng's project. \"Of course there is potential.\"\n\nBut putting hydroelectric systems into new buildings is expensive. Mr Ng has hired Arup, the engineering and project management company, to design a \"plug and play\" turbine system that would be relatively cheap and easy to fit into a building's infrastructure. He has also asked the company to find a way to charge his electric car, a Renault Fluence, using the water in his office building while he is at work.\n\nHong Kong's water services department said it was pleased to see private developers taking the initiative. After five years of work, the department has also installed a turbine generator at the city's water treatment works in the Tuen Mun neighbourhood that started operation in July and should generate 1.5 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year. That would save 10 per cent of the plant's electricity bill and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 2,000 tonnes per year, the department said. It is working on installing a second generator in the same plant by 2015. The city's drainage services department is also exploring the system.\n\nArup estimates that turbines in the public water system in Hong Kong could power 6,000 households, or a population of about 24,000, which both the company and Mr Ng concede is a tiny fraction of a city of seven million. While Mr Ng is developing systems that could serve his buildings, he said he would be willing to turn over the technology \"at cost, or potentially for free\" to the government as well.\n\n\"I don't care if people copy this idea if it can help the planet,\" Mr Ng said. \"We have to think out of the box so we can maintain our modern consumer lifestyle.\"\n\nThis type of hydropower is used on a small scale in places like M\u00fchlau, Austria, where the drinking water network provides 34 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, and Rino di Sonico, Italy, where a reservoir network generates 14 gigawatt-hours a year, or enough to power 3,100 households. But in-building systems are rare.\n\n\"Today we don't have a product that is commercially available, so someone has to take ownership and understand the product,\" said Ravi Krishnaswamy, the vice-president of the energy and environment practice for Asia at Frost & Sullivan, the market research company. \"You can power a few light bulbs. The challenge is going to be commercial viability and the scale.\"\n\nExperts say it makes no sense to install generators in pipes if they create more resistance than is offset by the amount of power they create. Arup's engineers said turbines could be installed in water pipes to harness the water falling from reservoirs to water treatment sites for city-size systems, as well as in gravity-driven wastewater systems. This would regulate pressure and flow as well as generate electricity.\n\nIn skyscrapers, the water in pipes is put under high pressure to ensure consistent supply throughout the structure. The high pressure on the lower floors is released with valves, providing an opportunity to harness otherwise wasted energy by attaching a generator. For now, the amount of power generated would be nowhere close to the building's total energy consumption.\n\n\"In buildings, it's quite straightforward - as long as it's tall it will be viable,\" said Vincent Cheng, the director of building sustainability at Arup. In Hong Kong, the biggest advantages come in \"our buildings, which are tall\". In Beijing, many of the reservoirs are much higher than the city, meaning they have more potential for providing energy, Mr Cheng added.\n\nThe main issue is not the technology but the cost. For traditional generating methods, like coal-powered electric stations, the cost is around 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. Renewable energy sources like wind cost 20 to 40 cents, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency, while small-scale hydropower projects cost up to 50 cents per kilowatt-hour. That makes in-building hydropower less attractive.\n\nLooking for payback\n\n\"If you look seriously on the payback it would be 30 years or even longer with current technology,\" Mr Cheng said. \"If the question is whether it is commercially viable, people are looking for a payback of less than 10 years.\" The cost of installing generators in individual buildings is enough to deter most developers, analysts say.\n\n\"Most of the time it's a commercial decision with the client,\" said Benoy's Mr Touikan. \"They have to do a life-cycle cost examination. Most clients want to use something that they're comfortable with and that everyone else uses.\"\n\nMr Ng said he was spending all of his \"pocket money\" on his pet project, but believed it could serve as an important symbol to other developers and to owners and renters in Sino Land's buildings. He also hopes the Olympian City mall, which also has a Japanese-made composting system to reduce food waste, can draw shoppers who want to see how its green technology works.\n\nMr Cheng, who leads a team of about 100 people in Asia working on building sustainability for Arup, said his company could develop an easily replicable building-level system using water power that would be easy to deploy. The concept simply needs more time for testing and development, he said.\n\n\"If it proves to be reliable in generating electricity and there's no disruption in operating the building, the cost of this technology will be reduced, and it will help to make it popular,\" Mr Cheng said. \"If we can test it for two to three years and it is reliable, the market will catch up very soon.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

The theme park was initially expected to cost RM400 million but has since risen to RM1 billion, if not more.\n\nUpon completion of Phase 1, the gaming and leisure company expects to invest billions more in the second phase, which is likely to include a Genting Premium Outlet, its second after a maiden one in Iskandar Malaysia. Premium Outlets are popular for their heavily discounted end-season branded goods.\n\nAt the launch, Prime Minister Najib Razak said he saw GITP as \"the start of a new era for the tourism industry in Malaysia\".\n\nOn locating its first theme park in Genting, 20th Century Fox Consumer Products president Jeffrey Godsick observed: \"This is an extraordinary location.\"\n\nThe first phase will see five existing hotels refurbished; a new 1,300-room three-star hotel; a 10,000- seat show arena; 3,100 car park bays; and additional bus bays.\n\nMoreover, the current 100 gondolas will be doubled as a new cable car station/line will be built but with the capacity to transport 4,000 passengers per hour from mid-hill to the resort.\n\nFunding is currently expected from internal sources.\n\nNow one of the world's largest gaming groups, Genting will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2015 - at which time it hopes to launch the 20th Century Fox theme park. The production house yesterday aired a recording of its celebrities, including Ben Stiller and Ang Lee, speaking in support of the project.\n\nOn more gaming facilities, Mr Lim was vague, but said there would be \"some expansion\". \"Better facilities are needed to cater to the high rollers,\" he said, noting these include superior hotel rooms and villas.\n\nSome 20 million tourists visit the highland resort annually, about half being local visitors. Chinese nationals are the second largest group after Singaporeans.\n\n\"We probably get more than 60 per cent of all China tourists to Malaysia, but it used to be 90 per cent,\" Mr Lim said, attributing it to the shortage of rooms.\n\nGenting Malaysia president Lee Choong Yan said more than 3,000 rooms would be added over the coming decade.\n\nJust as the Chinese are a big market for Resorts World Genting (RWG), they are also crucial for Genting Singapore as the domestic market has reached a plateau, Mr Lim said, with the growth coming from the international business.\n\nWhile Macau would enjoy the bulk of the Chinese business, he expects part of it to flow into Singapore and RWG when the park is completed. He also sees Genting Singapore handling the Japanese business should the Japanese Diet legalise casinos in the country and the group succeed in landing a licence.\n\nMr Lim said that the Genting group was mulling a US$3-4 billion investment in a partially completed resort in Las Vegas, should it obtain a casino licence in the United States.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In November, NODX slipped back into the negative territory it has been mired in for most of this year. It slid 8.8 per cent year-on-year after a 2.8 per cent expansion in the previous month.\n\nNew owners plan overhaul of SMX\n\nTHE new owners of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange (SMX) are planning a major overhaul of the once struggling exchange.

One Bangladeshi and 52 Indian nationals will be repatriated and prohibited from returning to Singapore.\n\nDisclosure woes\n\nTHE push for more disclosure from companies has inevitably led to widespread complaints of information overload in financial reporting. But, while less disclosure is not necessarily the answer, better - i.e., more relevant - disclosure is.\n\nRobust showing by IPO market\n\nIT has been a robust year for initial public offerings, with 26 new offerings so far raising a total of $6.22 billion. That's 18 per cent more IPOs than the 22 last year, and a 28 per cent increase in value compared to the $4.86 billion raised in 2012.\n\nDBS Bank's non-conformist outlook\n\nDBS Bank economists have decided to be heretical in their 2014 outlook. The recovery of the advanced economies will falter next year rather than gather apace and the US will taper but U-turn with QE4 later in the year, it said yesterday.\n\nListing of home phones bowing out\n\nFIXED-LINE operators will no longer have to publish residential phone numbers in the White Pages from April 1.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Among these would be Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, though the latter is not as universally recommended as the others and could owe its inclusion in some \"buy\" lists to its traditional \"defensive\" reputation.\n\nRarely has there been such agreement among analysts with such certainty in forecasting. Investors, reading between the lines of these recommendations, should draw encouragement that in effect, analysts think that markets will revert to being driven by economics/fundamentals instead of being liquidity-driven as they have been for several years now.

The Swiss property market, fuelled by cheap mortgages, is experiencing its biggest boom in two decades.\n\nThe SNB, which delivers its quarterly decision today, has warned of overheating in the real estate market and earlier this year pushed the government to require banks to hold more capital to temper it.\n\nThat initial step on its own may not be enough to prevent a bubble from forming, say economists including Reto Huenerwadel at UBS in Zurich.\n\n\"There's a risk that they will add to their current macro-prudential measures,\" he said. \"The key is whether there will be a change in the language that they use. They're going to prepare people for something, and then go to the government.\"\n\nRaising interest rates isn't an option for the SNB as long as it wants to maintain the cap of 1.2 per euro, which has kept the Swiss franc at least two centimes below that level for almost eight months. All 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict no change in the SNB's benchmark interest rate. Officials will also maintain the cap at the current level, all respondents to that question said.\n\nThe SNB will publish the decision at 9.30 am in Bern today, along with new growth and inflation forecast. Mr Jordan will explain the outcome at a 10 am press conference.\n\nThe franc traded little changed at 1.2214 per euro at 7.56 am in Zurich yesterday. Against the dollar, it stood at 88.74 centimes.\n\nLast month, the SNB president termed the cap \"indispensable\", citing falling consumer prices and the risk of the euro area's debt crisis intensifying again. Even so, he said that the European Central Bank's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25 per cent created a \"complex situation\" for the SNB.\n\nSince 2008, mortgages outstanding to Swiss private households have increased 25 per cent and apartment prices have risen 27 per cent. The UBS Swiss Real Estate Bubble Index is at its highest level since 1991.\n\nThe boom is part of a wider European trend. Apartments in Germany's largest cities may be overvalued by as much as 20 per cent, the Bundesbank said in October. In the UK, Bank of England governor Mark Carney took action last month to restrain house prices by ending incentives for mortgage lending.\n\nIn Switzerland, the government-mandated buffer imposed at the SNB's request currently requires banks to hold one per cent extra capital on their mortgage-related assets, and can be increased to as much as 2.5 per cent. While SNB vice-president Jean-Pierre Danthine said last month that expectations of its effectiveness \"must stay realistic\", he wouldn't exclude additional steps.\n\n\"Further regulatory measures could become necessary,\" Mr Danthine wrote in an opinion piece in Die Volkswirtschaft magazine.\n\nThe number of apartments for sale for more than one million francs (S$1.4 million) has doubled since 2008, while the total amount on offer rose only 10 per cent, according to property consultancy Wueest & Partner.\n\nBuilding permits for new lodgings rose 20 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same period last year, government statistics show. The SNB says that this increase isn't justified by fundamentals. Private debt, primarily mortgage loans, stands at a record 170 per cent of annual output, according to the SNB, which wants to prevent a repeat of the property-market crisis of the 1990s. At the time, a collapse in house prices tipped the economy into recession and caused the failures of banks including Spar- und Leihkasse Thun and Solothurner Kantonalbank.\n\n\"Existing measures to restrict credit allocation are having some effect, but we think regulators will require even more steps,\" said Oliver Adler, head of economic research at Credit Suisse in Zurich. \"The SNB will ask the government to raise the buffer at the beginning of next year.\"\n\nDavid Marmet, economist at Zuercher Kantonalbank, also says that more regulation could lie in store. \"If the market doesn't cool further, then I think maybe in the spring they will take further steps,\" he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM", "images": []}

The robust economic activity in the individual Asean economies and the economic integration benefits from the creation of the Asean Economic Community (AEC) should create further momentum.\"\n\nGlobally, there were 864 IPO deals in 2013, up 3 per cent from 837 deals in 2012, while capital raised rose 27 per cent to US$163 billion.\n\nThese mark a \"solid full-year result\", and was much better than expected, given the suspension of IPO activity in China, EY said.\n\n\"In previous years, China would have been expected to account for around 17-25 per cent of IPO activity by value, and 6-25 per cent by number of deals, suggesting that 2013 would have been the strongest year since 2010 if Chinese exchanges had been open,\" it noted.\n\nOf the top 10 deals this year in terms of capital raised, three took place in Asia: Suntory Beverage & Food (US$3.9 billion) in Tokyo, China Cinda Asset Management (US$2.3 billion) in Hong Kong, and BTS Rail Mass Transit Growth Infrastructure Fund (US$2.1 billion) in Thailand. Five were in the US, while UK and Brazil had one each.\n\nThe top three sectors were real estate (15.7 per cent of global capital raised), financials (14.8 per cent) and energy (14 per cent).\n\nGoing forward, improving economic conditions and investor interest in developed market equities will support IPO activity in major markets including the US, UK and Europe, said EY.\n\nIn Asia, lifting of the IPO ban has resulted in a queue of more than 760 Chinese companies waiting to go public. This will \"act as a catalyst for further activity across the region\", said EY's global vice-chair of strategic growth markets, Maria Pinelli.\n\nThe report wrote: \"For firms getting ready to go public, the market window looks its best in several quarters for the start of 2014.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In addition to commanding top dollar for their services, they also dominate the top tier of public accounting services provided, - including international tax consulting, risk management and M&A advisory.\n\nThe small firms here - typically run by one or two partners - usually do the jobs that are too small for the Big Four. They focus on basic accounting, audit and tax compliance services for smaller clients who cannot afford the top rates of the Big Four.\n\nBut one small practice here has turned out to be quite the maverick in this landscape.\n\nThe Iyer Practice has cast off statutory audit services - the bread-and-butter of small accounting firms - to take up the top tier of accounting services, international tax, trusts and regulatory consulting. And, it has done so while keeping it all within the family.\n\nThe firm was started 20 years ago by chartered accountant Shanker Iyer, 62, who comes from a long line of chartered accountants. \"It's in the blood,\" he quips.\n\nMr Iyer gained experience in a wide range of public accounting services working as a partner for Moores Rowland in the United Kingdom and Singapore, and then as a finance director in an international trading group in the UK and the Middle East. He then decided to come home and landed up setting up his own firm.\n\nThe Iyer Practice for most of the past two decades, provided basic consultancy, audit, accountancy, taxation and corporate services. With Mr Iyer at the helm, it focused on international clients wishing to do business in Singapore.\n\nMr Iyer - who has served as chairman of the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce and chairman of the British Chambers of Commerce, a position which earned him an Order of the British Empire (OBE) - decided in recent years to alter the focus of his business; it was a decision motivated by two factors.\n\n\"In my view, the traditional accounting practice was getting commoditised and we needed to differentiate ourselves to succeed and grow,\" he said.\n\nThe other reason was that his two sons, having racked up years of experience - one in international tax and the other in financial services - in the UK, decided about a year and a half ago to come back home and join their dad's firm.\n\n\"Because they specialised in these areas, they're of the highest level, and we thought it was a great opportunity for us to grow the firm with their expertise in these areas; we thought it was logical to build two pillars of our firm along these services,\" he explained.\n\nHis elder son, Sunil, 34, an - Oxford University graduate, worked as a derivatives trader with Deutsche Bank and then with PwC's financial services group in the UK. He oversees the firm's financial services practice, serving the smaller clients that \"can't or don't want to afford the Big Four fees\", say Mr Iyer.\n\n\"Another area Sunil is specialising in is wealth management and trust. We have had a licence with MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) for the last five years - Singtrust. This fits in very nicely with our client base, because many of them are high net worth clients who want to think about asset protection and so on.\"\n\nThe firm is possibly the only certified public accounting firm here that has a commonly owned trust company licensed by the MAS.\n\nAs for what made Sunil give up a lucrative career in the UK for a place in his father's firm, Sunil said: \"The business is in a very exciting place, with lots of potential to grow further. It's rewarding to be part of that and working in a smaller business means that I have more input into the direction of the firm.\"\n\nYounger brother, Sanjay, 29, is the firm's international tax guru - and the reason The Iyer Practice now has an office in Hong Kong, where its international tax practice is headquartered.\n\nSanjay started his career with EY before getting a Masters in international tax. \"He is only in his 20s, but so strong in his field,\" his proud father says.\n\n\"Sanjay oversees the firm's international tax practice - he helps clients set up structuring and so on. He will bring in ideas about new things to look out for, new trends in tax; he makes sure our clients are aware of these issues and risks before they plan.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong office, where Sanjay is based, also offers private client services, HR and regulatory consulting.\n\nAs for why they decided to set up there, Mr Iyer explained that the Hong Kong market requires the same range of services his firm is providing in Singapore, and that Hong Kong is in a good space in the international tax arena, having also signed better tax treaties than Singapore. He feels it puts his firm in the unique position of being able to offer tax structuring and advisory for Hong Kong clients thinking of using Singapore as a base or one of their destinations.\n\nThe new businesses are rapidly contributing to the overall practice. \"When we divested our audit business to a long serving staff member in 2012, we probably lost about 20 to 30 per cent of our business. Our biggest fear then was, how soon can we recover this?

It was the first US airline accident to claim a passenger's life since 2009.\n\nWhile information released so far by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has focused on why the pilots allowed the plane to get almost 64 kph slower than their target approach speed, the hearing also will explore the design of Boeing's auto-throttle, according to the agency's agenda.\n\n\"There are a variety of ways things can go wrong that people can't anticipate,\" said David Woods, an engineering professor at Ohio State University who specialises in how humans interact with technology. He hasn't participated in the investigation.\n\nThe NTSB's two-day hearing, designed to probe broad safety issues raised by the accident without determining its cause, began here yesterday. The agency will vote on a cause next year.\n\nThe pilots believed they had set the auto-throttle system to hold their desired speed, NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman said in briefings after the accident. While she said the system was \"armed\", she hasn't said which of several available modes the pilots had set it to.\n\nAsiana has increased the hours of flight-simulation training its pilots receive and taken other steps to make a \"fundamental improvement\" in safety, Akiyoshi Yamamura, senior executive vice-president of safety and security management, said on Dec 3.\n\nThree former 777 pilots said in interviews that the plane's auto-throttle, which normally sets its speed, can at times become dormant, leaving a poorly trained or distracted pilot in trouble if it isn't noticed soon enough.\n\nPlanes landing on that runway in San Francisco on the day of the accident required a manual approach because the airport's instrument landing system was switched off during a construction project, according to the NTSB.\n\nThe interaction between pilots and cockpit automation has come up in several previous accident investigations involving planes made by different manufacturers. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

But it is clear from subsequent news reports that the air defence zone was discussed during the five-hour meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. In any event, the United States has made clear its own position on the issue by flying two B-52 bombers through the zone without seeking China's permission.\n\nBeijing has taken comfort from the fact that since the announcement of its East China Sea ADIZ, a majority of civil aviation companies with their air routes traversing the area have reported flight plans to China's civil aviation department. China's air force says it will conduct regular air patrols covering its zone and, more ominously, warned that combat aircraft would \"strengthen monitoring\" of the zone, whatever that means.\n\nAt the same time, Beijing disavows any intention to annex the air space (or the sea area within its demarcation) as Chinese territory. As well, it wants the US to act as an honest broker to make contributions to regional peace and stability, according to a report by Xinhua, China's official news agency. Clearly, the Xinhua report was a reaction to US Secretary of State John Kerry's accusation that China was attempting to change the status quo in the East China Sea.\n\nMore significantly, the reaction of China's eastern neighbours is telling. South Korea declared its own ADIZ, parts of which overlap China's, and has conducted naval and air defence exercises in the zone without informing Beijing. Indeed, it has since gone further to expand the size of its ADIZ. Japan has ordered its civilian airlines not to report their flight paths to the Chinese authorities. Tokyo has also its air force operating in the zone. In other words, both of China's closest neighbours to the east reject Beijing's right to impose new conditions on air traffic on what all sides other than China agree is international space.\n\nWhat is not clear is why China's leadership decided to announce a new ADIZ. One theory is it was motivated by domestic political concerns. There is a vocal nationalist faction among the ruling Communist Party elite that wants to see China restored to its historical greatness. Unfortunately, this misty-eyed vision of pre-eminence must contend with current geo-political realities. If the unilateral creation of an air defence zone was an attempt to pander to this faction, it was misconceived - the more so for the fact that the rapid and aggressive response from the US was unanticipated. It may also have ratcheted up tension among China's neighbours and has the potential for disastrous miscalculation on every side.\n\nChina should also be aware that some of its southern neighbours are now alert to the possibility that a similar ADIZ may be the next item on Beijing's agenda in the disputed areas of the South China Sea. That too, if it happens, would add to tensions in the region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is the simple equation confronting Singapore equities investors who this week watched the Straits Times Index fall four out of five days because the release of strong US economic data has led to worries that the US Federal Reserve might cut back its money printing sooner rather than later.\n\nOf course the logic of this argument may be questioned - if the US really is recovering, then it should take the global economy with it, in which case export-oriented economies like Singapore's should benefit. And if so, there's no good reason why the STI should have fallen as it has - yesterday's short-covering 6.98- point rise helping to limit the weekly loss to 48 points or 1.5 per cent at 3,066.02. It is now about 100 points or 3.2 per cent in the red for the year.\n\nQuestionable though the logic may be, when the market's behaviour is considered together with Hong Kong's parallel slide over the same period, it does suggest that equity performance in this part of the world has been largely due to the Fed's money printing and not superior fundamentals. Turn on the tap while depressing interest rates to zero and money will flow into \"higher risk\" emerging markets like Asean; turn off the tap and raise the spectre of higher interest rates and money will flow out.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Companies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

They were formally presented to union leaders on Monday and form part of a broad revamping announced last summer that refocuses the group's activities on its highly successful commercial jet business, which generates almost 70 per cent of its revenue and more than half of its profit.\n\nBeginning next year, the entire group is to be rebranded under the Airbus name, reflecting expectations that Airbus's explosive sales growth will continue to outpace its other major divisions, which will be renamed Airbus Defence and Space and Airbus Eurocopter, the group's helicopter business.\n\nThe anticipated staff reductions are expected to hit the hardest in Germany, where the bulk of EADS's underperforming military and electronics division, Cassidian, is. Cassidian employs about 23,000 people, of which around half are in Germany, particularly in and around Munich, the Bavarian capital.\n\n\"We need to improve our competitiveness in defence and space, and we need to do it now,\" EADS chief executive Thomas Enders said in a statement. \"With our traditional markets down, we urgently need to improve access to international customers, to growth markets.\"\n\nSeveral thousand EADS workers across Germany took to the streets late last month to protest the expected loss of well-paid technology jobs at a time when the German economy, which until now has weathered Europe's economic crisis better than most, is starting to show signs of slowing.\n\nHoping to minimise the impact, EADS said it planned to achieve the bulk of the staff reductions through a mix of voluntary departures, early retirements and the end of around 1,300 temporary work contracts. As many as 1,500 employees will be offered transfers to positions at the Airbus jet division or at Eurocopter.\n\nEADS said it had entered into negotiations with labour unions to find alternative ways to further reduce costs, but said it expected the final number of involuntary layoffs to be about 1,000-1,450.\n\nThe company declined to give estimates of the short-term costs of the restructuring or the amount of savings expected to be generated. According to German media reports, EADS's anticipated savings could be about 500 million euros (S$857 million) by the end of 2016.\n\nEADS said the planned staff reductions would be accompanied by the consolidation of about a dozen plants in Germany, France, Britain and Spain, as well as the sale of some buildings.\n\nMr Enders, who took over as chief executive 18 months ago, has made no secret of his desire to streamline EADS's sprawling European operations. The group was created in 2000 from the merger of the leading aerospace companies of France, Germany and Spain, leaving a legacy of industrial and administrative sites scattered across the region that have never been fully integrated. The governments of France and Germany were also given a veto over certain strategic decisions.\n\nMr Enders' longer-term ambitions to increase EADS's military business went awry in late 2012, when a proposed US$45 billion merger of EADS with the British military contractor BAE Systems foundered in the face of stiff political opposition from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. She feared it would give Germany too little weight in the group. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The most expensive was a three-bedroom unit on the 55th floor, which went for A$3.7 million to a Chinese buyer living in Australia, he said.\n\n\"We had enormous interest, about 4,000 in the four to five weeks leading up to it,\" Mr Milton said yesterday. \"This has been one of the most highly anticipated projects, with one of the highest level of inquiries that we've had.\"\n\nGreenland has invested more than A$1 billion on sites in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia's two most-populous cities and the areas that are seeing the highest level of demand from mainland buyers.

About a quarter were sold to overseas buyers, he said.\n\nA date hasn't been announced for the release of the second stage with 220 apartments, he said.\n\nThe start of construction depends on the development approval, which the company is in the process of obtaining, Sherwood Luo, managing director of Greenland Australia, the company's Sydney-based subsidiary, said last month.\n\nGreenland plans to build about 1,000 apartments on its first Melbourne site, which it agreed to buy last week from Racing Victoria.\n\nThe Shanghai-based company said in 2010 that it will invest 30 billion yuan (S$6.17 billion) to build a skyscraper in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nThe 660-metre Ping An Finance Center in the southern city of Shenzhen will be China's tallest building when it is completed 2016, according to the skyscraper centre database of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.

The theory was that a combination of US stocks and US bonds in a 60/40 proportion amounted to a balanced portfolio. The volatility of stocks was cushioned by traditional bonds in the belief that these two asset classes did not have significant correlation in up and down markets. The Global Financial Crisis changed all that: even quality corporate bonds and some sovereign bonds took a beating in 2008.\n\nFor moderate risk/return profile individual investors in Singapore, something similar to the 60/40 rule is being applied by bankers and advisers as part of the mandatory risk assessment prior to the sale of a product. When fixed income assets routinely returned 4 per cent per annum or more, this guideline was totally acceptable because it had a positive contribution to the total portfolio return. With global interest rates presently at very low levels, the signs are there for conservative and moderate risk investors to suffer potential capital losses in the coming years.

But lately we've seen external demand pick up. September was the turning point, where manufacturing indicators really did much better than expected.\"\n\nIndeed, surprise and hearty showings in key economic indicators - like the purchasing managers' index and industrial production - have laid the foundation for more sanguine expectations.\n\nJust last month, another double-digit (22.8 per cent) jump in electronics output boosted Singapore's manufacturing performance in October; this built upon September's robust showing, which had already exceeded expectations.\n\nSaid Barclays economist Joey Chew: \"Mathematically, forecasters are following in line with higher growth numbers that came out for Q3. Logically, as well, I think this is supported by the fact that global indicators have been holding up pretty well - especially the purchasing managers' index (PMI) in the US.\"\n\nThe forecasters' upgrade for 2013 was led by rosier outlooks for the manufacturing and the wholesale and retail trade sectors. The former is now expected to grow 1.4 per cent, up from just 0.2 per cent in the previous survey; the latter is expected to rise 5.3 per cent, higher than the 3.3 per cent in September's poll.\n\nNon-oil domestic exports (NODX), however, are expected to contract more sharply by 3.9 per cent this year, compared to a 0.7 per cent contraction in the previous poll.\n\nSluggish domestic exports for much of the year prompted a hefty downgrade last month in Singapore's official NODX growth forecast - a contraction of 4-5 per cent is now expected this year, from an earlier projection of a zero to 1 per cent fall.\n\nOn the inflation front, the 21 private-sector economists and analysts who responded to the central bank's quarterly survey believe headline inflation will edge down to 2.4 per cent this year, compared to the 2.5 per cent reported in the earlier poll.\n\n\"It's been a good year in that growth has surprised on the upside, while inflation has surprised on the downside,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin, noting that the 2.4 per cent figure is even lower than the official forecast range of 2.5-3 per cent.\n\nAdded Ms Chew: \"So far it's been more moderate than we expected, so it looks like inflation expectations have been pushed back for now. But it's only a matter of time (before inflation picks up), given (the economy's) stronger growth and tight labour market.\"\n\nIndeed, moving into 2014, forecasters expect headline inflation to head northwards to come in at 2.8 per cent, and core inflation at 2.3 per cent.\n\nAdded Mr Seah: \"I think inflation is going to pick up to above 3 per cent, and it's just a matter of how high it will be. March will also show us how the (new certificate of entitlement) recategorisation will affect (car) prices.\"\n\nAs for next year's growth prospects, forecasters expect the Singapore economy to expand by 3.9 per cent in 2014, even as they flag regional emerging market risks with the prospect of quantitative easing tapering off in the US.\n\nEconomists also pointed to ongoing shifts in neighbouring countries, such as the recent political unrest in Thailand, Indonesia's upcoming elections, and Malaysia's fiscal consolidation.\n\nSaid Mr Chua: \"Compared to where we were 12 months ago - when our neighbourhood was in a stronger place and countries outside Asean were softer - now Asean is a bit more sketchy while the US, Europe, and Japan are looking firmer.\"\n\nAn improvement in global sentiment may not automatically provide a substantial lift to Singapore, either: \"Even if global demand picks up, can Singapore capitalise on the upswing as it has historically? Given existing labour constraints, it's unclear whether firms will be able to take advantage of that, even if demand improves,\" added Mr Chua.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The contract also offers business potential for expansion to other transport modes and systems such as buses, toll roads and the state-run Philippine National Railway down the road.\n\nIn fact, under the terms of reference drawn up by Manila's Department of Transportation & Communications (DOTC), the winning bidder may also expand the contactless card system to businesses outside the transport sector, such as to retail transactions. It is a move that could change the payment landscape in the country.\n\nFirst Pacific managing director Manuel Pangilinan said: \"This strategic alliance will transform the Philippines' light rail transit system into a network very much like those in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other major cities in Asia.\"\n\nAyala chairman and chief executive Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala agreed, and noted that the group will leverage on the complementary strengths of each member of the consortium.\n\n\"We believe we can bring out the potential of the new system, not only as a transit fare collection method, but also as a broader and efficient payment ecosystem at par with global standards,\" he said.\n\nAF Consortium, Berjaya and Chinese-Filipino business tycoon Mr Sy were among five bid contenders pre-qualified by the government for their experience in ticketing technology, banking, transportation, and retail.\n\nPart of the government's public-private partnership programme, the fare collection system is expected to improve ridership of Metro Manila's light rail transit and Metro Rail Transit systems.\n\nThe DOTC will conduct its customary post-bid evaluation before it awards the project to the consortium on Dec 23.\n\nThe project is expected to be fully implemented by the third quarter of 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are driven largely by more companies starting to analyse the latent data currently generated by various sensors within their organisations' operations.\n\nDuring its annual Predictions briefing recently, Sandra Ng, group vice-president of IDC Asia-Pacific's practice group, said the coming year would mark the \"serious beginning\" of big data-as-a-service (BD-aaS).\n\nIDC defined BDaaS as the integration of four key offerings: non-transactional data; data storage services with adequate availability zones or clusters; compute resources offered by the same cloud provider that hosts the data storage; and analytics tools and products that run on the same cloud services as the compute resources.\n\nThis emergence is primarily due to the impetus from two groups - the vendor community and internal IT developments.\n\nFrom the vendor end, she said companies such as Amazon Web Services, SAP, Google and Microsoft, among others, have been introducing both public and private cloud-based analytics tools to allow companies to better make sense of their existing corporate data.\n\nThis, in turn, makes it more compelling for enterprises to mine their often-voluminous datasets in a more cost-effective manner, she explained.\n\nOn the other end, enterprises are also driving internal initiatives involving big data and analytics. These entities may have certain technologies in place and the right expertise to implement data mining, and are not just developing applications but methodologies and the right technology infrastructure to support such analytics projects, Ms Ng said.\n\nSome of the companies engaged in such projects include telcos Orange and SingTel, while Chinese Internet giant Alibaba.com was another firm identified by the analyst.\n\nIn terms of tech developments, Ms Ng said more companies will look to analyse non-transactional data, such as information generated via social media platforms and sensors embedded in automated machinery such as containers.\n\nAs a result of such analytics projects, the storage industry will see an uptick in business given that there is a need to store non-transactional data separately, the analyst added.\n\nFor companies which do not want to undertake such initiatives on their own, the demand for third-party services combining compute power for analytics and storage - also known as integration platform-as-a-service - will also increase in conjunction.\n\n\"IDC expects that in Australia and Singapore, just enough of the four key offerings will come together to allow more agile organisations to leverage BDaaS, and take those initiatives to production,\" the research firm stated in a separate press release.\n\nMs Ng pointed to the financial services industry as one vertical that is leading the way in terms of driving big-data analytics initiatives. DBS Bank and Citibank are among the institutions that have deployed such programmes.\n\nCraig Stires, research director of IDC Asia-Pacific for business analytics and channels, added during the panel session of the briefing that the emergence of analytics would inevitably have ramifications on data privacy regulations. He pointed to the revised Technology Risk Management guidelines issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for the financial industry as an example.\n\n\"As soon as any data 'touches' information deemed private or secure, then the highest standard (of compliance) must be achieved,\" Mr Stires advised.\n\nOn a regional level, big data, analytics and IoT initiatives will help push the Asia-Pacific ex-Japan region to rebound in terms of ICT spending for 2014. The research firm predicted that 2013's ICT spend would hit 6.6 per cent, but it would grow to 8.7 per cent the following year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Banks are increasing the loan-loss provisions as regulators step up their scrutiny of euro-area financial institutions and the European Central Bank prepares to assume the role of banking supervisor at the end of next year.\n\nThe shipping crisis has prompted Commerzbank and HSH Nordbank's inclusion in the group of about 130 banks deemed to pose a systemic risk to the European sector as a whole and selected to undergo an assessment by the ECB to measure the quality of their assets and the strength of their balance sheets in stress scenarios.\n\nThe ECB is running the three-stage review as a condition for taking over supervision of euro-area banks at the end of 2014.\n\nMoody's said it expects the ECB's review and new guidelines by the European Banking Authority, or EBA, to lead to increasing bad debt provisions.\n\n\"Restructured loans and loans where repayments have been postponed will have to be re-classified as non-performing and will thus require provisioning to cover the risk of losses,\" it said.\n\nGerman lenders had an almost 30 per cent share of the US$475 billion global ship finance market at the end of 2012, according to Moody's. \"While global ship lending declined by 9.5 per cent year-on-year in 2012, German banks' exposure declined by only 7 per cent,\" it said.\n\nWhile Moody's expects the shipping downturn to continue for several more years as new vessels exacerbate the chronic overcapacity, analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove see improvements ahead.\n\n\"Latest data suggest the shipping market is recovering as rates are improving, net demand is turning positive and vessel values are picking up, which should be positive for the banks with shipping exposure,\" they said on Tuesday.\n\nThe ClarkSea Index, a measure of earnings across the maritime industry, averaged US$12,318 a day so far this quarter, heading for the highest in two years, according to data from Clarkson plc, the biggest shipbroker.\n\nJPMorgan said it expects the improvement in the shipping market \"to translate into lower cost of risks\" particularly for the Nordic banks, including DNB ASA, Nordea Bank and Danske Bank.

The metal is mainly used for soldering in the electronics industry.\n\nDemand continues to outpace supply, and analysts are forecasting an average price of US$24,421 per tonne next year, CNMC said.\n\nMr Lim said the move into tin was not prompted by the weaker gold prices.\n\n\"At all-in costs at US$775 per ounce, we're still making good profit on gold,\" he said.\n\nThe firm sells its gold at a slight premium to the spot rate.\n\nCNMC recently recorded a surge in its third-quarter net profit to US$1.95 million, after contractor expenses fell from US$2.2 million to US$19,110. The firm had stopped export sales of ore and therefore did not incur ore processing expenses.\n\nShares for CNMC closed one cent, or 3.9 per cent, higher at 27 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We are constructing a high-quality living environment for our people . . . we are integrating ourselves with the region and the global economy,\" said Mr Lee at the event hosted by the Korean International Trade Association (Kita), the country's largest business association.\n\nMany of the other attendees at the lunch were from organisations such as the Korean Federation of Small Business, the Korea Chamber of Commerce & Industry, and the Federation of Korean Industries.\n\nMr Lee urged South Korean companies to use Singapore as a base to reach out to other key markets in South-east Asia, South Asia and Australia.\n\nHe recalled how one South Korean businessman had earlier shared with him his experience of being engaged in Singapore for the last 30-plus years.\n\n\"He told me how satisfied he has been that the projects in Singapore have done well and met their objectives, and that Singapore remains a good place for companies to do business,\" said the prime minister.\n\n\"He asked me to maintain these policies and consistencies over a long period of time, so that companies can have the confidence to invest and to help build our economy. And I said yes, of course, that's exactly what we're going to do, and that's my message to Korean businesspeople too,\" Mr Lee added.\n\nAccording to latest statistics, Singapore is currently South Korea's sixth largest trading partner, while South Korea is Singapore's seventh biggest trading partner. Total bilateral trade surpassed US$23 billion last year.\n\nSouth Korea's investments in Singapore amounted to US$5.8 billion in 2012 in fields such as shipping, logistics and construction, making Singapore its fourth largest destination for investments.\n\nSingapore, too, has invested heavily - over US$9 billion - in South Korea in areas like real estate, ports and pharmaceuticals.\n\nAfter lunch, Mr Lee and his delegation made the short journey from his hotel to the Blue House, the executive office and official residence of South Korean President Park Geun-hye.\n\nDuring their closed-door meeting, they agreed that there was much scope for both countries to pool their strengths in areas like research and development, science and technology, and the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nAccording to the Singapore Foreign Affairs Ministry, the two leaders noted that bilateral ties had grown significantly under the Korea-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (KSFTA), which came into force seven years ago. They looked forward to a \"substantive review\" that would encourage further two-way trade and investment.\n\nSeparately, Mr Lee called on South Korean Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Strategy and Finance Hyun Oh-seok.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr Lee also visited the Seoul National Cemetery, the final resting place for some 165,000 Koreans including Ms Park's father, former president Park Chung-hee.\n\nMr Lee leaves for Tokyo later today to attend a special summit marking 40 years of Japan-Asean relations.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The second is to decide on the sub-asset classes for effective portfolio construction.\n\nThe chart (right) illustrates how a 60:40 split between equities and bonds can deliver a range of returns depending on the composition of the assets.\n\nThe US portfolio is based on S&P 500 Stock Index and the Ryan Labs 10-year Treasury Yields.\n\nThe global portfolio comprises MSCI AC World and JPM Global Bond Aggregate.\n\nThe Asian portfolio consists of MSCI AC Asia ex-Japan and JPM Asia Credit Index. All three composite portfolios are denominated in Singapore dollars for easy comparison.\n\nThe Asian portfolio suffered the most in 2008. Surprisingly, the US portfolio incurred the smallest loss, even though the global credit crisis was precipitated by the US sub-prime fiasco. As a result of the recovery in 2009, the Asian portfolio was in first place. Only the US portfolio had positive returns in 2011. Last year was a banner year for the Asian portfolio. The charge in 2013 through November was led by the US and global portfolios.\n\nClearly, there is no way of predicting next year's winning combination. Sticking with a generic 60:40 asset allocation in itself is inadequate to generate adequate returns for a given level of risk and volatility.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The entire number was sung only in French, but Leong's innocent tone, coupled with his candy-coloured dress and pigtails as he gleefully accepted lollipops from three \"strange men\", had the audience in stitches.\n\nAnother unforgettable moment was when the crowd went silent during a solo written by Brel, titled If You Go Away (Ne Me Quitte Pas). The song was first performed in Singapore at the 2008 staging of Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris by the late theatre actress Emma Yong, who died of stomach cancer last year.\n\nNo one had expected it to turn out to be a touching tribute to Yong, which was done gracefully with a spotlight shining on a single chair on the stage, while the three local actors stood solemnly around it, while a haunting recording of her voice played in the background. And, of course, credit must also be given to newcomer Furnell, who successfully held his own alongside his more experienced co-stars, especially when donning a long dark-haired wig and twirling a paper umbrella during Lonely Singing Doll (Poupee de cire, poupee de son).\n\nHis antics, and those of his fellow actors, are what make A French Kiss in Singapore so appealing, such that you might actually want to watch it again, to make sure nothing is lost in the translation.\n\nA French Kiss in Singapore continues tonight at 8pm, and tomorrow at 4pm and 8pm.

If convicted, the 24 men face a maximum penalty of seven years' jail and caning.\n\nBusiness leaders, activists and observers BT spoke to agree that employers should not, and cannot, be held responsible for their employees' actions outside of work hours - albeit for different reasons.\n\nSome said such an expectation would be \"onerous\" and \"unreasonable\", while others point out that it would be downright \"disrespectful\" to even suggest such a framework.\n\nSaid Zainudin Nordin, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Manpower: \"Currently, employers are responsible for their workers during work hours, but there is no such policy for employers to be responsible for them after work hours. It would be unrealistic to put this responsibility on the employer as they cannot monitor what their workers are doing after work hours.\"\n\nBeyond being infeasible, this would also be \"unfair\" to employers, said construction company bosses such as Excel Precast CEO Tan Bian Tiong, and Tat Hong Holdings CEO Roland Ng.\n\n\"What employees choose to do after the work day has nothing to do with the employer. If MOM puts the burden on us, it's very unfair - we can't restrict their movements, we're not the police,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nAdded Expand Construction chairman Von Lee: \"Every person in Singapore . . . whether you're a citizen, foreign worker, or even a tourist . . . (is) still (governed) under the same laws. We shouldn't be treating foreign workers differently, each individual has to answer for their own actions.\"\n\nMigrant Workers' Centre executive director, Bernard Menon, believes companies should be made accountable for their workers' actions only if they arise because of the employer's direct instructions.\n\nFor \"workers' misdemeanours committed in their personal capacity\", however, Mr Menon said \"it would not be reasonable\" to expect companies to take responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Au, vice-president of migrant worker group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), said that \"to discuss the subject with such a perspective is to deny (foreign workers') agency as humans\".\n\n\"TWC2's position is that migrant workers are adults and should be given due respect for their freedoms as adults. No other person or body corporate should be 'responsible' for them whether during work or off work,\" said Mr Au.\n\nHe also said that migrant workers \"should not be treated like children or like household pets\", where one speaks of responsible parties.\n\nConstruction company bosses seem to agree.\n\nSaid Mr Lee of Expand Construction: \"We should treat all foreign workers with due respect as well (because they are fellow) members of our society. We cannot presume that everybody will not behave properly. I don't think we should even think in that manner for a start.\"\n\nAdded Excel Precast's Mr Tan: \"(Foreign workers) have the right to move around freely. If we employers restrict their behaviour after work, people will criticise us and that will cause even more problems.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It fell 11 per cent last month, but was still in the plus territory year-to-date.\n\nS&P cut its long-term corporate credit rating on the company to BB+, below investment grade, with a stable outlook.\n\nThe rating agency also said in its statement that it was withdrawing all the ratings on ThaiBev at the company's request.\n\n\"We lowered the rating on ThaiBev because we now view the company as a 'core' member of a corporate group that we assess as having weaker credit characteristics than those of ThaiBev as a stand-alone entity,\" said S&P credit analyst Xavier Jean in the statement.\n\nThe group, which consists of ThaiBev, Fraser and Neave and investment holding company TCC Assets (TCCA), has become highly leveraged.\n\n\"We believe that TCCA's likely high debt burden and the subordinated nature of its debt has the potential to lead to more aggressive financial policies at ThaiBev and influence ThaiBev's financial performance, debt-servicing capacity, and financial policies to an extent,\" Mr Jean said.\n\nF&N shares closed unchanged at $5.71.\n\nThe benchmark Straits Times Index eased 1.03 per cent to 3,081.72, close to a near three-month low of 3,098.80 hit last week.\n\nBlumont Group was among the most traded stock on the Singapore Exchange, with almost 140 million shares changing hands, about two times the average daily turnover in the past 30 days.

Sanofi in Paris is among about 25 new stocks added by Timothy Ghriskey's Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. Overseas companies that get most of their sales from within the US are favourites of Paul Zemsky, the head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management.\n\nThe allure of European stocks is drawing managers with almost US$5 trillion under management after US$13 trillion was added to US equity prices since March 2009 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index capped its best stretch of gains since 2004. While investors predict the Federal Reserve will cut stimulus in March, they are betting the European Central Bank will keep economic measures for longer. Europe's economy is forecast to return to growth next year.\n\n\"This is a good time to be trimming back now and increasing the international allocation,\" Russ Koesterich, the San Francisco-based chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc, said last week. BlackRock is the world's largest money manager with US$4.1 trillion as at Sept 30.\n\nEquities around the world fell last week as investors speculated when the Fed will reduce stimulus. The S&P 500 declined less than 0.1 per cent to 1,805.09, the first weekly drop since Oct 4, curbing the 2013 gain to 27 per cent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 2.7 per cent, bringing the year to 13 per cent. The 1.8 per cent drop in the Topix Index trimmed this year's rally in Japanese stocks to 44 per cent. The S&P 500 gained 0.2 per cent to a record 1,808.37 at 4 pm New York time on Monday.\n\nThe S&P 500 has risen 167 per cent since March 2009 and surpassed the record high set in October 2007 by as much as 15 per cent. The bull market has lasted 57 months, about nine more than the average since World War II, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and Birinyi Associates. With this year's 27 per cent gain on track for the best annual return in 15 years and pushing valuations to the highest in almost four years, some investors are going outside the US to pick stocks.\n\n\"Companies in Europe that are exposed to Germany or the United States are going to do better because they are still trucking along,\" Mr Zemsky, whose firm oversees US$190 billion, said last week. \"There's definitely a globally synchronised recovery going on and at the same time, you have a situation where central banks aren't trying to stop it. They're actually trying to encourage it.\"\n\nPioneer Investments is recommending that investors prune their holdings of US equities, saying that the improving economy has reduced the scope for Fed stimulus to propel further gains in stocks. Chief investment officer Giordano Lombardo, who oversees about US$228 billion of investments globally, said in Paris last week he recommends having an underweight position in US equities and an overweight position in European, Japanese and Chinese shares.\n\nCompanies with lower-than-average valuations and high dividend payouts are the most attractive, according to Mr Pursche, who manages about US$800 million as president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services. Shares of Paris-based Total, Europe's third-biggest oil producer, trade at about 8.7 times projected earnings and Shell at about 9.4, compared with 15 for the Stoxx 600, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\nTotal, which agreed to buy a stake in InterOil Corp's assets in Papua New Guinea last week, has a dividend yield of 5.5 per cent, and The Hague-based Shell pays out 5.5 per cent, Bloomberg data show. Both are twice the 2.5 per cent dividend yield of Exxon Mobile and more than Chevron's 3.1 per cent. Shell, Europe's largest oil company, plans to cut net spending next year by increasing the pace of asset sales, according to chief executive officer Peter Voser.\n\nMr Pursche said he's also buying Kit Kat bar-maker Nestle SA in Vevey, Switzerland, and Novartis AG, Europe's biggest drugmaker by sales.\n\nSanofi, the largest drugmaker in France, is poised for a rebound, according to Mr Ghriskey, who manages about US$1.5 billion. The company will return to earnings growth this quarter, CEO Chris Viehbacher said in an Oct 7 Bloomberg TV interview. Its multiple sclerosis pill Aubagio was cleared by the UK's health-cost regulator last week. The drugmaker, which gets about 76 per cent of sales from outside Western Europe, will boost income 13 per cent next year, following three years of declines after losing patent protection on nine products, analyst estimates show.\n\n\"The issues have become totally resolved,\" Mr Ghriskey, who is also buying shares of Seadrill Ltd for its dividend, said of Sanofi.The stock trades at 13 times estimated earnings, 19 per cent less than the average price-earnings ratio of health care stocks in the Stoxx 600. Sanofi shares are up 4.2 per cent in 2013, versus 18 per cent for its peers in Europe.\n\nValuations for European equities climbed 8.6 per cent this year, according to Bloomberg data. The expansion wasn't enough to make shares too expensive, said Mr Zemsky.\n\nEurope's increase in valuations compares with a 19 per cent rise for US shares and 35 per cent drop in Japan, according to Bloomberg data. Even with the American multiple expansion this year, US stocks can rally more, according to Wells Fargo Funds Management's John Manley.\n\nThe euro area's gross domestic product will expand one per cent next year after two years of contraction, according to 47 economist forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. The US, the world's biggest economy, is projected to grow 2.6 per cent. Japan ( third largest), will increase 1.5 per cent.\n\nGlobal growth means more opportunities for stock investors still looking for bargains, as they can benefit from a pickup in those economies without having to buy US-based companies only, according to Mark Luschini at Janney Montgomery Scott, which oversees US$60 billion. He's buying Continental AG, the German car-parts maker, as well as London-based Vodafone Group, the second-largest wireless company, and the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund.\n\nEuropean banks trade at about 14.2 times projected earnings, compared with 16.1 for the region's healthcare stocks and 27.6 for technology companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. To David Herro at Harris Associates, relatively low valuations at companies such as Credit Suisse Group, the second-biggest Swiss bank, make them buys after the global equity-market rally this year.\n\nThe Zurich-based company, whose sales are split almost evenly between the Americas, Switzerland and the rest of the world, has a price-earnings ratio of 9.4, based on estimates.\n\nCredit Suisse, forecast to boost earnings 25 per cent next year, says it has already met a core equity capital ratio requirement before a 2019 deadline. It reported a common equity ratio of 10.2 per cent under Basel III rules. That was the sixth-highest ratio among 14 global investment banks, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nContinental, based in Hannover, Germany, has a price-earnings ratio of 12, even after it rallied 72 per cent this year, more than five times the Stoxx 600.\n\nThe manufacturer has sidestepped the effects of the region's car-market contraction by adding sales to customers including Volkswagen and Bayerische Motoren Werke in growing markets such as China and the US. Continental gets 27 per cent of its revenue from Europe outside Germany, 16 per cent from North America and 14 per cent from Asia, according to Bloomberg data.\n\n\"They have a good balance of exposure, so in essence you're not betting on any one company or area,\" James Moffett, who oversees US$10 billion in international assets at Scout Investments in Kansas City, Missouri, said. \"It's both the earnings and the market pricing, which helps with the question of how do you try to play with what can be a tricky market next year.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit, SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years, closes flat on debut\n\n3\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\n4\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\n5\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/da9a625f2e5ad3fda4e728fe06f42bb4564df071a7643e498c43d99ffc93b834?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Among the attractions: Shell pays out 5.5% dividend yield as does Total.

This agenda has shifted quite dramatically in recent weeks from the promotion of Abenomics to something much more political than even the most sensitive of Mr Abe's proposed economic reforms.\n\nHis Liberal Democratic Party has pushed through Parliament a Bill to create a US-style National Security Council that will coordinate Japan's reactions in case of military emergencies and other emergencies and also a secrecy law whose reach appears to go beyond strict security issues.\n\nThere are various theories advanced as to why Mr Abe is behaving \"like a man possessed\". One is that he is afraid of a flare up of the problems that drove him from office after a brief first term as leader in 2006. He must do what he can while he can, according to this theory. Another is that he wants to reassert the principle of strong leadership or the \"smack of firm government\" in Japan. The nationalist agenda which Mr Abe is pursuing, in everything from stressing the importance of patriotism and military preparedness to requiring school textbooks to adopt a less self-condemnatory view of Japanese history, is seen by some as being merely a sop to right wingers. But the rest of Asia, and the world at large, should not assume that this is so and that all is sweetness and light in Japan. Nor is it right to think that the only problems the region faces are an \"over-assertive\" China or a \"rogue regime\" in North Korea.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

WE Holdings will issue vendor Lin Zhijiong 287.6 million new ordinary shares (about 14.12 per cent of the enlarged capital) at 2.57 US cents (3.18 Singapore cents) a share. Mr Lin, a Chinese citizen, was a former accountant with Bank of China who founded Everbest in 2005.\n\nWE Holdings said late Tuesday night that the proposed acquisition was in line with its intention to expand its electronic and system business to achieve economies of scale and broaden its revenue stream.\n\n\"There is also a synergy between the company and Everbest as both parties are competitors engaging in the same business,\" it said.\n\n\"Through the company's presence in China, we can enter into the fast-growing electronics and components industry in the country, while cross-selling our electronics and components products using their network of customers and distribution channels.\n\n\"We envisage demand for Everbest's products to grow in tandem with China's industry growth, thereby enhancing the overall performance for the group.\"\n\nThe purchase amount was arrived at based on the net tangible assets of Everbest at end-October of US$1.8 million and 5.6 times Everbest's expected net profit of US$1 million for the next financial year from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015.\n\nEverbest reported a net profit of HK$2.4 million (S$0.39 million) for its last financial year ended March 31, 2013.\n\nFor the seven months to end-October this year, net profit was HK$3.9 million.\n\nIt mainly distributes, in China, electronic components of New York Stock Exchange-listed company Kemet Corporation.\n\nMr Lin has also undertaken to provide a net profit guarantee of US$1 million each for its next three financial years.\n\nThis is subject to Mr Lin being entitled to half of excess profit above US$1 million each year, and for at least half of the first US$1 million of net profit for the next two financial years to be retained for working capital purposes.\n\nSeparately, the company announced last month that the cut-off date for its proposed acquisition of shares in Myanmar's Dragon Cement has been extended to Feb 20 next year.\n\nWE Holdings closed unchanged yesterday at 3.4 cents a share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Monetary easing \"has steadily produced the anticipated effects so far\", he said at the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy.\n\n\"Favourable turns have been observed in the financial market, economic activity and prices, as well as in the public's (inflation) expectations. With this QE, I believe that Japan can overcome deflation.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Asean Four - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand - are forecast to grow an average 4.6 per cent, similar to this year.\n\nIt's not for nothing that banks are seen as economic proxies; looking back this year, their performance pretty much mirrored that of the Singapore economy.\n\nWhat stood out in each quarter was how the three banks managed to surprise on the upside when it came to reporting their earnings.\n\nIt was a similar pattern when it came to Singapore GDP announcements, usually 2-3 weeks after the banks released their numbers. All three quarters' final GDP figures were better than the government's flash estimates and exceeded market forecasts.\n\nLast month, the government raised its full-year growth forecast to 3.5-4 per cent - not the narrowed forecast range typical for this time of year but a hike that implied growth of no less than the top end of its earlier 2.5-3.5 per cent forecast range.\n\nThe year started on a moderately sanguine note, as Singapore had narrowly dodged a recession after recording 1.3 per cent growth in 2012.\n\nNotwithstanding this, the three banks had an amazing 2012. Their combined net profits jumped 40 per cent to $10.6 billion from 2011's $7.6 billion, boosted by one-off gains. Excluding one-offs, the core banking business still performed pretty well, bolstered by buoyant bond markets amid record-low interest rates and strong credit demand from robust regional economies.\n\n2013 is unlikely to be a repeat of last year given the lack of one-offs, but earnings from the core banking business have performed well despite market volatility in Q3, a slowdown in mortgages and contraction in auto loans.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2013, each bank posted profits in excess of $2 billion. DBS led the pack with $2.7 billion, up 4 per cent; OCBC Bank was down 38 per cent at $2.1 billion because of the absence of a one-off; and UOB had $2.2 billion, up 6.1 per cent.\n\nDespite wobbly markets between end-May and September, the banks sold more business loans here and abroad, reaping the benefits of their overseas expansion and from marketing to foreign corporates based in Singapore.\n\nDBS chief executive Piyush Gupta noted earlier in the year that the Republic's position as a financial centre meant that banks sell loans not just to the domestic economy.\n\nA strong driver of earnings comes from the banks' aggressive push into the global transaction services space that offers cash management and trade finance to multinationals, a business that used to be dominated by the international banks.\n\nIn particular, the trade finance business to China has fuelled loans growth.\n\nChina now represents 9.2 per cent of total loans made by local and foreign banks based here, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Financial Stability Review 2013 said last week.\n\nIn September, trade bills accounted for about 65 per cent of total loans from Singapore to China, with the local banks accounting for the lion's share of the business.\n\nForty per cent of DBS's business is outside of Singapore while at OCBC, overseas profit contribution makes up 41 per cent. For UOB, overseas profit accounts for 38.2 per cent of group earnings, up from 36.7 per cent a year ago.\n\n\"Most of the pick-up in the banks' earnings was from very strong gains in fee income and trading gains in the first half, strong loan volumes and overseas loans,\" said Harsh Modi, bank analyst at JPMorgan.\n\nEven slowing mortgage sales as policy restraints to cool the property market kicked in were mitigated by robust commercial lending.\n\nOfficial data showed that October credit growth slowed slightly, increasing 15.6 per cent to $554.3 billion, compared with 15.7 per cent in September.\n\nBusiness loans grew 2 per cent in October, after rising 1.4 per cent in September. Year-on-year growth was a faster 19.4 per cent in October, compared with 18.6 per cent the previous month. In contrast, consumer loans growth slowed to 10.4 per cent year-on-year, from September's 11.7 per cent.\n\nThe local banks, with their bigger branch networks, also grew their loans faster than the industry as a whole.\n\nUp to end-September, DBS's total loans expanded 19 per cent year-on-year and its Singapore loans rose 18 per cent. UOB said total loans gained 15.8 per cent while its Singapore loans rose a faster 18.4 per cent. At OCBC, total loans were up 16 per cent year- on-year but Singapore loans were up a slower 11 per cent.\n\nForeign banks, with their smaller branch and ATM networks, are struggling to expand their customer bases.\n\nStandard Chartered said its Singapore business registered a slight drop in first-half profit, owing to margin compression and higher investment spending.\n\nStill, StanChart, which locally incorporated its consumer bank here in October, believes that Singapore is a very important market for the group. The UK-based bank pumped in $2.4 billion for the local incorporation, above the minimum $1.5 billion, because the bank's \"balance sheet is bigger than the minimum required\", said StanChart Singapore's chief executive Ray Ferguson.\n\nThe Republic is a pivotal market for the group and the second-largest contributor for StanChart in terms of income and profit, he said at the bank's local incorporation celebrations.\n\nRetail banking is not only a very competitive market here, but a \"profitable\" one where \"credit standards are good\", said Mr Ferguson.\n\nThe bank, which is 18 per cent owned by Temasek Holdings, gets almost three-quarters of its earnings from Asia. Hong Kong accounts for 20 per cent of the group's total income, while Singapore makes up 11 per cent.\n\nPollie Sim, chief executive of Maybank Singapore, said the low-interest-rate environment continued to weigh on its Q3 income - a trend seen as common to both local and foreign banks.\n\n\"However,\" Ms Sim noted, \"two key advantages that local banks have are their vast networks - across branches, ATMs and NETS facilities - and greater mindshare with customers. These increase their deposit stickiness and in turn enable them to enjoy a wider interest margin.\"\n\nMaybank Singapore loans grew 5.6 per cent on an annualised basis in the first nine months of the year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bank's London-listed shares tumbled 7.1 per cent to \u00a313.30 by 0937 GMT yesterday. This was their lowest level since August 2012, when the shares were hit by concerns about a fine from US authorities for breaking sanctions on Iran.\n\nAnalysts said the concern now is the bank's growth prospects.\n\nTop-line growth is the key issue, Shore Capital analyst Gary Greenwood said, adding that potentially higher capital requirements mean that it will be difficult for the company to make short-term headway on its return on equity.\n\nIncome for the full year is likely to be \"broadly flat\" from 2012, the bank said, against analysts' expectations for a rise of about 4 per cent.\n\nAfter a slowdown in financial markets that began in August, Mr Meddings said the fourth quarter had been weaker than the third quarter. Particularly hard hit was its rates business, where activity had been sapped by uncertainty over the direction of interest rates.\n\nThe bank said it is keeping a \"tight rein\" on costs but they would be slightly higher than 2012 because of higher compliance spending and a rise in a British bank levy, while losses from bad debts are also expected to rise, mainly in Korea.\n\nStandard Chartered has reported 10 consecutive years of record income and profits but last month scaled back its income growth target for the next couple of years as slower economic growth and tougher regulations bite.\n\nThe bank expects its Korean consumer banking arm to lose US$200 million this year, with income down 15 per cent. The bank wrote down the value of its Korean business by US$1 billion in August and is restructuring its operations there.\n\nIts businesses in Hong Kong and Africa continue to perform well, but growth in Singapore has slowed.\n\nThe bank has been taking action to reduce spending and streamline operations in the face of what it described as near-term problems and said it remains confident in its long-term growth prospects.\n\nStandard Chartered has cut about 2,000 jobs in the past year, halting a hiring spree over the past decade that has trebled its workforce to 89,000.\n\nThe bank had been expected to make a pre-tax profit of US$7.4 billion for 2013, up 8 per cent from last year's US$6.9 billion, according to the average forecast from 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nZuckerberg says Meta will invest hundreds of billions in superintelligence\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:48 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLinkedIn settles antitrust lawsuit, agrees to contracting changes\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:12 PM\n\nUS: Wall Street opens mixed as investors digest fresh tariff threats\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:43 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nUS dollar steadies amid muted reaction to Trump\u2019s 30% tariff threat to EU and Mexico\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:36 PM\n\nBOJ finishes offloading bank stocks, bringing focus to ETFs\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:54 PM\n\nBRC Asia secures contracts for Changi Airport Terminal 5 project worth S$570 million\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:04 PM", "images": []}

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific ended 16 Hong Kong cents lower at HK$16.24, down from its peak of HK$16.80 on Nov 28.\n\nQantas's share price has suffered one of the biggest drops among the Asia-Pacific carriers. Its counter closed at A$1.03 yesterday, its lowest level this year, after the airline flagged possible losses of A$250 million to A$300 million for the six months ending Dec 31, 2013. The stock was trading at a high of A$1.90 as at end-April.\n\nIATA noted that Q3 earnings from a sample of 57 airlines across the world showed continued improvement in financial performance, with overall operating profit and net profit both up from the corresponding quarter a year ago.\n\nBut this was not the case for Asia-Pacific airlines. The 18 Asia-Pacific carriers studied - IATA did not reveal which ones - reported a net (post-tax) profit of US$2.7 billion in Q3, down from US$3.32 billion a year earlier.\n\nSimilarly, operating profit fell to US$3.18 billion from US$4.7 billion.\n\nJet fuel prices climbed to US$126 per barrel in November, up 4 per cent from October's lowest point, which was just under the average price for the last 32 months.\n\nFrom January to October, passenger traffic rose 5.2 per cent as mature economies such as Europe and North America start to pick up, outpacing capacity growth, which is up 4.6 per cent. This translates to a passenger load factor of 79.9 per cent.\n\nThe cargo market has had an even tougher year. Freight traffic inched up 0.8 per cent while capacity expanded 2.2 per cent, partly due to additional belly capacity from the passenger fleet. Freight load factor remained depressed at 44.8 per cent, though the trend in recent months has hinted at signs of bottoming out.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Thus, it is working closely with neighbouring countries as it views cruising as a regional product and not one it should do alone.\n\nConsequently, Singapore led a regional effort, jointly with Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, in September this year to improve the awareness the cruise lines have of the region through a familiarisation tour of these countries for 10 cruise executives who are responsible for shore excursions.\n\nBesides this, Neeta Lachmandas, assistant chief executive of the STB, told The Business Times that cruise also features high on the Asean platform, as well as bilaterally with Indonesia and Thailand, with a view to working with these governments in the grouping to develop port infrastructure suitable for cruising.\n\nSTB also has been leading the drive in the region to work with travel and tour operators in improving awareness of cruising in the region as well as to offer an enhanced on-shore experience for passengers.\n\nTo build demand and awareness of cruising within the region, STB has been working with the cruise lines to understand the needs and preferences of consumers in the Asian source markets and tailoring products and services accordingly.\n\nIn addition, it also works with the Asian Cruise Association to educate travel agents on the cruise product, with three workshops this year alone for operators in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. \"The cruise market is still very travel-agent centric as the cruise product is relatively more complex than buying a point-to-point air ticket because of the different permutations. Since people are still unfamiliar the travel agent becomes an important intermediary in all of this,\" explained Ms Lachmandas.\n\nFurther, in addition to port infrastructure, countries also need to have tourism infrastructure as well in the form of an adequate supply of tour guides, coaches and enough attractions to have a good quality on-shore programme. STB is thus exploring how it can develop this infrastructure in Singapore and the region.\n\nTo offer a more enhanced cruising product, STB is also in exploratory discussions with airlines to broaden the cruise-fly service. Currently, Singapore is the only port in the world to offer cruise-fly services for international passengers cruising out of Singapore to a destination from where they would then fly back to their home country. Other ports only offer such services to their domestic passengers. The seamless service allows international passengers to check in their luggage all the way to a final destination.\n\nThe airlines currently offering the cruise-fly service in Singapore are Singapore Airlines, SilkAir, Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines and Jet Airways, but STB is in talks to bring more airlines on board this service in a bid to attract more international passengers to cruise out of Singapore.\n\nBased on STB data, the cruise industry in Singapore created about $800 million of impact to the domestic economy in 2010, of which $520 million is attributed to direct spending, which included expenditure by cruise lines, passengers and crew. Of this direct spending amount, international passengers in Singapore spent a total of about $208 million on accommodation, shopping, dining and other expenses.\n\nThis spending has since grown incrementally as the total cruise passenger spending in Singapore last year amounted to $220 million. But the opening of the Marina Bay Cruise Centre has had a catalytic impact in changing that, according to STB. \"That is still a relatively small market, but if you look at the way the big maiden ships are coming in (into Singapore) now, that number (passenger spending) will go up,\" Ms Lachmandas said.\n\nThe ability of the Marina Bay Cruise Centre to accommodate these large ships, which carry more than 2,500 passengers each, is a critical factor behind more of these \"technical\" vessels steaming into Singapore. This year has seen an unprecedented number of maiden calls from these technical ships.\n\nMoreover, Ms Lachmandas believes that the opening of the Marina Bay Cruise Centre has also led to big-name cruise groups - namely, Carnival and Celebrity Cruises - setting up in Singapore.\n\nIndustry observers see significant potential for the cruise industry to grow in the region, as the market penetration rate in Asia, at 0.1 per cent, pales in comparison to the 3.3 per cent in the US. Asian cruise passengers, which numbered 1.3 million in 2012, could grow to 3.8 million in 2020, according to the Asian Cruise Association.\n\nWith a tropical climate and cultural diversity in the region, South-east Asia stands to gain a large portion of this pie - and STB aims to place Singapore at the heart of this boom.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China is Asean's largest trading partner, while the bloc ranks third on China's list.\n\nTrade between the two sides went up by 10.2 per cent between 2011 and last year, when it hit a record high of US$400.9 billion.\n\nMr Bocker said: \"That is creating the natural flow-through here - not just financial or capital flows.\"\n\nHe played down the traditional rivalry between the two exchanges, apparent especially in races for big-name listings. He said the rivalry might be there on a national level, but not for the exchanges themselves, because the success of one is beneficial for the other.\n\n\"Are you friends? We're more than friends. We're even putting rings on the finger,\" he quipped.\n\nThe SGX has been building its derivatives business, even as revenue from its equity division has remained under pressure from low trading volumes.\n\nBloomberg reported that SGX's revenue from derivatives rose 50 per cent over five years through June to $234.5 million, while its equity trading climbed only 4.4 per cent to $469.50 million.\n\nThe exchange is gunning for a wide range of products as it would facilitate margin offsets among users, and also increase its odds of success.\n\n\"You never know which would be the ones that would take off,\" said Mr Bocker.\n\nYesterday's announcement follows a raft of agreements that the SGX has signed this year, with its sights set firmly on the vast China derivatives market.\n\nIn April, it said it would work with China Financial Futures Exchange to cooperate especially in index futures and options contracts; in May, it agreed to cooperate with China's physical iron ore trading platform China Beijing International Mining Exchange; in October, it said it is partnering the Shanghai Futures Exchange to explore developing commodity derivatives; and then just this week, it signed a deal with China Futures Association, which it said would strengthen its ties with the brokerage industry in China.\n\nIllustrating the vast potential in the derivatives market in Asia, Mr Bocker said: \"We are today somewhere between 1/10 or 1/20 in the use of derivatives in Asia, compared to the US.\" Some 90 per cent of these are not cleared, he added.\n\nAt the same time, however, competition has become keener.\n\nDomestic exchanges in China - where hedging knowledge remains weak despite the country being the largest consumer of commodities ranging from soybean to iron ore - have launched six futures contracts this year for products including coking and thermal coal and iron ore.\n\nThe Shanghai Futures Exchange has also announced plans to introduce contracts for crude oil delivered to China.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, US-based Intercontinental Exchange Group announced that it would buy Singapore Mercantile Exchange for US$150 million to expand its customer base in Asia.\n\nThe world's largest futures exchange operator, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), meanwhile, is not sitting idle either. It told The Business Times earlier this year that it was expanding headcount and adding functions in the region as Asia becomes a large revenue driver.\n\nThe exchange behind the pricing benchmarks for commodities ranging from corn and soybean to WTI sweet crude oil reopened its Hong Kong office last year and added a Beijing office this year.\n\nIn an interview with BT yesterday, its chief executive Phupinder Gill said that revenue growth in Asia has averaged 35 per cent each year in the past three years.\n\nThe exchange, which last month added its third Chinese clearing member, China Merchants Futures, continues to work in educating the Chinese market, he added.\n\n\"The best CME can do is to have a potential client base that is educated, to ensure that risk management issues are resolved, and, most importantly, to support the Chinese government in what they're concerned about.\"\n\nSGX's Mr Bocker welcomed the increased competition: \"There's nothing that grows and builds the market stronger and faster than having more exchanges here.\n\n\"If we're the only ones educating and promoting, it will take forever to get four billion people to understand what it means to use capital markets.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Rather than sitting unused, lawmakers say they'd rather it go for high-definition televisions and free snacks for veterans at airport lounges.\n\n\"Travellers' lost change is unappropriated dollars that should be put to good use,\" Florida Republican Jeff Miller said at a House Homeland Security Committee meeting in October.\n\nThe TSA would be required to give future unclaimed cash to groups that run airport lounges dedicated to active-duty US military personnel, veterans and their families under Mr Miller's bill that the House is scheduled to vote on this week.\n\nThe USO, by running airport lounges, is the only organisation that currently would qualify for the funds set aside in the legislation. The TSA estimates that passengers have left behind US$2.2 million in change in the past five years.\n\nMr Miller, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, is also co-chairman of the USO Congressional Caucus.\n\nThe United Service Organizations is best known for sending celebrities such as comedian Bob Hope and World Wrestling Entertainment Inc wrestler John Cena to far-flung military bases to entertain US troops. Its main service is supporting and encouraging uniformed troops while aiding military families.\n\nThe non-profit group operates lounges in 45 US airports, the largest at international facilities such as Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson, Dallas/Fort Worth and Baltimore-Washington.\n\nThose USO rooms are similar to the airport lounges operated by airlines including United Continental Holdings' United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. The USO boasts more camouflage fatigues and fewer three-piece suits.\n\nThe military centre at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, a frequent stop for service members heading home from Afghanistan, is typical. A 72-inch flat-panel television sits in front of rows of plush blue chairs.\n\nThe lounge has a free snack bar with coffee, soda and candy bars and frozen treats. Many items, such as ice cream bars from Nestle SA, are donated. Most centers have free Internet service and phones to call home.\n\nThere's even a room set up where service members can pick out a children's book, read it aloud while being recorded, and then have the DVD recording sent home to their kids.\n\nFor some jet-lagged service-members, BWI Airport in Maryland is the second or third layover from Afghanistan on their way home. The lounge has a sleeping room with chairs that recline flat and a free wake-up call so they don't miss their connecting flights.\n\nBWI's 5,000-square foot USO lounge, the third-largest in the US, costs about US$228,000 a year to operate, according to USO officials at the airport. After hosting about 82,000 travellers last year, the BWI centre may serve 85,000 this year, said John Falin, who manages the BWI site and four other USO centres in the region.\n\n\"What our service members do is so important and we just want to honour them and make them feel important,\" he said in an interview at the airport.\n\nThe TSA collects about US$500,000 a year in coins that travellers empty from their pockets into bins and buckets then forget to reclaim after walking through security screening. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

I asked myself what more can we do apart from the Merlion and keychains,\" says Mr Low. \"I don't want Singapore to be represented by shabbily produced keychains and fridge magnets.\"\n\nHe picked five designers for the project: James Teo from design firm ampulets, Mark De Win from Relay Room, Fion Lum from Quiet Studio, Melvin Ong of Desinere and Chang Shian Wei.\n\n\"No designer can understand our local context more than Singapore designers,\" says Mr Low, a design masters graduate from National University of Singapore. His brief to the five designers was to identify, research and create visuals that best represents the country. \"The selected icons must be based on real objects, and actual context. They cannot include the Merlion as it is not a real animal,\" Mr Low explains.\n\nHis role in Singapore Icons is as producer, rather than designer. \"Design, at the most misunderstood level is purely execution - sketching, creating artwork and so on. However, to me, it is about putting things together, making the smartest decisions from constraints. This is the exciting part and the true pivotal point of design.\"\n\nThe porcelain ware is produced by Kihara, a Japanese ceramic brand with 400 years of porcelain making experience. Mr Low, who doesn't speak Japanese, worked with a Japanese partner for the project.\n\nSingapore Icons forms the first collection for Democratic Society, a range of products which Mr Low is producing under his company Supermama. Other items under the Democratic Society label include From Another Time, a series of porcelain cups with illustrations of Singapore's history on them; Good Morning tea towels and placemats designed in Singapore but made in Japan; and Familiar Objects, a range of paper weights.\n\nThe former design lecturer at Singapore Polytechnic started Supermama with his wife - who inspired the name - in 2011. It is an artist residence studio and a space for designers to hang out at its Seah Street office, while its retail outlet is located in Singapore Art Museum @ 8Q.\n\nUp next for Mr Low is a collection with Japanese companies Shotoku Glass Co and Nousaku, which he hopes will be ready by March. \"I try to work with designers to launch a small collection every March and September,\" he says. \"I also test out random pieces with different craftsman to gain better understanding of how different craft facilities work now that many are knocking at my door.\"\n\nDarren Yeo | QQQ\n\nBESIDES waiting for a bus or an ever-elusive taxis, waiting to see the doctor comes close to being one of the biggest annoyances that we all have to put up with.\n\nDarren Yeo often visited Singapore General Hospital, not to see a doctor, but rather to wait for his wife, a pharmacist, to finish work. \"At the hospital, I noticed many others waiting as well, except they were waiting for more urgent reasons,\" says Mr Yeo, 26. \"I realised that most patients would queue half a day in hospitals, travelling across many different departments before getting what they need.\" This led him to think of ways of using technology to shorten the waiting time.\n\nMr Yeo, who had previously worked at design consultancy firm Orcadesign and is currently pursuing a masters degree at Imperial College London, came up with the idea of QQQ, which won him a prize at this year's Red Dot Award: Design Concept competition.\n\nThe former industrial design graduate from National University of Singapore explains that QQQ is a mobile phone application that will attempt to make queuing less of a hassle.\n\nAs the appointment time approaches, an alert notification will sound through the app. Users can then assess the situation - whether to stay in the queue or to reschedule it for another time. An approximate waiting time, which factors time required to get to the hospital, is shown to the patients.\n\nShould they decide to go ahead with the appointment, the app will show the user how to get to the appointment using GPS technology.\n\nEven as patients are waiting at the waiting room, QQQ acts as a reward system that generate credits for every minute waiting. These credits are later exchangeable for a gift voucher found within the hospital premises.\n\nMr Yeo spent a year developing QQQ, doing research, interviews and by observing the daily operations at three local hospitals. He declines to name the hospitals but said there were mixed reviews of the concept. \"One hospital shared with me the complexity of their current setup, and the restrictions that were in place to introduce a new system,\" says Mr Yeo. \"The other two are more receptive to the idea, one of them even adopting part of the concept to test it immediately on one of their clinics.\"\n\nMr Yeo adds that the app would work not only in hospitals but in clinics too. \"With the growing use of smartphones, patients can have direct access to QQQ with their devices,\" he says.\n\nHe has named the app QQQ because Q and queue have similar intonations and each letter Q represents a person lining up in a straight line. \"People are obsessed with waiting in queues, so repeating the letter Q three times brings out the emphasis of queuing,\" he adds.\n\nQQQ is now a concept plan, and will require a later stage of programming and testing for it to be fully developed.\n\nAlong Lee, Lin Shini and Eunsung Park | ECO-FLIP\n\nWITH plastic bottles coming under fire for being environmentally unfriendly or unhealthy because of its chemical content, what other alternatives are there?\n\nApart from stainless steel or tempered glass bottles, there is the newly launched Snapware Eco Flip bottle in fun colours like green, cyan and tangerine, with a white bottle cap.\n\nWith its chic, minimalist design, Eco Flip looks like something a Nordic designer came up with. But surprisingly, the glass drinking bottle was designed in Singapore, at an office in Clementi, to be precise.\n\nThe Snapware Eco Flip bottle was named a Design of the Year winner at this year's President's Design Award. It's the brainchild of Along Lee, Lin Shini and Eunsung Park, designers at World Kitchen. The American company is the world leader in kitchenware. Apart from Snapware, its Asia Pacific office in Singapore markets well known brands such as Corelle, Corningware and Pyrex.\n\nThe three designers work at World Kitchen's Asian Design & Innovation Centre (ADIC), set up in 2010, to create innovative products that specifically meet the houseware needs of the Asian consumer.\n\nMr Park, 35, a Seoul University design graduate, points out the differences between Asian and American consumers. \"Kitchens in Asian homes tend to be smaller, and Asians have smaller hands, so when we design products for the Asian market, we keep these factors in mind,\" says the Korean.\n\nThe team also designed a rice and soup bowl for Corelle, designed for the Korean market.\n\n\"Eco Flip is about bringing healthy hydration to consumers and at the same time, inspire and motivate them to pursue an eco-friendly lifestyle,\" says Mr Lee, 42, a Singapore PR and an industrial design graduate from University Malaysia Sarawak. Mr Lee previously worked in the design departments of Motorola and Osim before joining World Kitchen.\n\nThe Eco Flip bottle is made from 100 per cent pure and natural borosilicate glass, a non-porous, non-toxic and natural degradable material that allows both hot and cold beverages to be kept hygienically. A flip top bottle cap allows it to be opened with one hand. Eco Flip is designed such that users drink from the glass bottle rather than from the cap, which is more reassuring from a hygiene point of view. It also comes fitted with a silicone jacket, which not only protects the glass from damage but also provides better grip.\n\nThe bottle took a year to design. Singaporean Ms Lin, 35, says, the biggest challenge of designing Eco Flip was \"the height of the glass spout. It had to be at a comfortable height but at the same time, ensuring that the user's lips would not touch the plastic cap.\" The former Nanyang Technological University student studied mechanical engineering but ended up designing consumer products as \"it gives me more direct interaction with users\".\n\nEven though Eco Flip was designed for the Asian market, World Kitchen's headquarters in Chicago is so impressed with the design, that the bottle is now sold in the US too.\n\nDuane Lye | OI\n\nWATCHING a stroke patient struggle with a simple task such as eating can be a heartbreaking affair, more so when it is someone close to you.\n\nDuane Lye's mother suffered a stroke last year and lost control of one side of her body. \"To see Mum lose her independence and needing help with every little thing is really heart-wrenching,\" says Mr Lye, 25, a third-year product design student at Nanyang Technological University. \"Mum can only use one hand to eat, and she would end up pushing food off the plate and onto the table or floor.\"\n\nHe came up with the idea of a plate that would allow people with the use of only one hand to eat independently.\n\nMr Lye worked on the design of the plate for four months, before coming up with its final design. Calling it Oi, the plate has an extended curvature on one side that pushes food unto the spoon, allowing the user to use just one hand to eat.\n\nA counterweight on the opposite side of the base prevents the plate from tipping over as force is applied to one side when scooping food.\n\n\"Oi is targeted at anyone who has difficulty using both their hands to eat their meals. My mum being a stroke patient is only one of the possible users who can use this product,\" says Mr Lye. \"This product could do well in hospitals too.\"\n\nFor his idea, Mr Lye won at this year's Red Dot Award: Design Concept competition.\n\nMr Lye calls his plate Oi, because the alphabets resemble a plate and spoon respectively. Even though it is just in its conceptual stage, Mr Lye says coming up with the ideal design was a challenge itself.\n\n\"I wanted to be able to combine form and function seamlessly into one product, to maintain normality while dining,\" he says, adding that he wanted Oi to look as elegant as the other plates on the market, but with a hidden function to help people with disabilities.\n\n\"I designed the plate to be minimalist looking, so that people with disabilities can regain their confidence and with a chance to integrate back into society while not being ostracised.\"\n\nMr Lye says that he is currently not in talks with any companies to manufacture Oi. \"But it would be ideal if there are companies who may show interest as I believe Oi can really help people, which is why I designed it.\"\n\nThis is his second time taking part in an international design competition. He had previously submitted another design for Red Dot but did not win.\n\n\"Winning the Red Dot award is the first step towards my career as a product designer and a testament of my design's quality,\" says Mr Lye, who hopes to work as a designer after graduation. \"I want to design products that can help change the way people live.\"\n\nEugene Wang | SOUNDBRACE\n\nWHAT fun is there in playing air guitar when you can only pretend to play but not make actual music?\n\nEugene Wang, 25, a product design student at Nanyang Technological University wants to change that with SoundBrace, a wearable device that uses motion capture and gesture technology to transform the user's arms and fingers into musical instruments.\n\nFor now, SoundBrace is just a conceptual idea, but it won Mr Wang a prize at this year's Red Dot Award: Design Concept competition.\n\nThe idea for SoundBrace came to Mr Wang when he was on a bus listening to music. \"Often, there would be a riff of a song that I wanted to play along to but couldn't,\" says Mr Wang, who plays the guitar and bass at his church.\n\n\"I always wished that music would just come out magically of my fingers when I was pretending to play guitar.\"\n\nSoundBrace works by using a combination of motion capture and gesture technology. SoundBrace comes in two pieces, to be worn on each wrist. Each brace detects the position of the user's hands and fingers with two cameras.\n\nEach brace also measures electrical signals generated from the wrist to further determine the different finger gestures. To set up, musicians first calibrate by playing an actual guitar to determine baseline measurements for different chords.\n\nMr Wang designed SoundBrace to be attached with a headphone jack so that users can listen to what they're playing without disturbing others. \"An added USB jack allows the user to further tweak various settings by plugging it into a computer,\" says Mr Wang.\n\nIt took him about a month to develop the idea for SoundBrace. \"The challenge was mostly aesthetics. How would I design it to look good and intuitive for users,\" says Mr Wang, who adds that SoundBrace is for \"anyone who loves to listen and play music\".\n\nThis is his first time participating in an international design award, and he almost did not take part, because \"the entry fees were not cheap\", says Mr Wang. \"But my friends encouraged me so I decided to try. It'll be a great boost for my resume if I win.\"\n\nMr Wang has no plans to take SoundBrace to production stage for now. \"The concept definitely has much more potential than just playing music. But being a student, my resources and expertise to develop this are very limited, so it is on hold right now.\"\n\nThe third-year design student enjoyed drawing and making things as a child, which was why he embarked on an education in design.\n\n\"After graduation, I hope to find work, preferably designing consumer electronics or home appliances. That is where my design interests have been for a long time,\" he says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nPresident's Design Award\n\nSingapore's highest honour accorded to designers and designs from all design disciplines has been handed out annually since 2006\n\nThere are two categories: Designer of the Year and Design of the Year. The Designer of the Year award is given to designers or design teams for creativity and achievements in any design disciplines. The Design of the Year award recognises national significance and creative value to Singapore for projects of products in any design discipline.\n\n2013 Designers of the Year\n\n2013 Designs of the Year\n\nAn exhibition featuring this year's winners is now on till Jan 22 at the National Design Centre at 111 Middle Road. It then moves to URA Centre at 45 Maxwell Road from Jan 24 to Feb 27, and back to the National Design Centre from March 3 to 16.\n\nRed Dot Award: Design Concept\n\nStarted by the Singapore arm of Red Dot in 2005, this annual competition is all about design concepts, prototypes, ideas and visions that are new, creative and exciting. Winning is based solely on the merits of the concept. Entries are submitted anonymously and participants can be individuals or from professional organisations.\n\nAccording to Red Dot, the odds of winning a Red Dot award are only 4.6 per cent, making it the toughest to win, compared with other design competitions. That has not deterred participants. This year saw a record 4,394 entries from 57 countries, with three winners from Singapore.\n\nSome Red Dot Award winners continue refining their concepts while others are now available as a full fledged product. An example is Lenovo's Yoga ThinkPad which was recently launched. It won a luminary Red Dot award in 2005.\n\nAn exhibition of this year's winners is now on till October next year at the Red Dot Design Museum, 28 Maxwell Road.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's still between Malaysia and Singapore,\" said one source familiar with the deliberations.\n\nReuters, citing sources, reported on Friday that Cardiff's listing plans in Malaysia could be hampered by weak cash flow.\n\nQuestions sent to Mr Tan through his spokesmen were not answered.\n\nMr Tan, who once led the Berjaya Group conglomerate, has been known to be planning to list Cardiff since May this year, with Malaysia reported to be the initial plan. Singapore emerged as a possible destination around October.\n\nCardiff won promotion to the Premier League, England's top football division, this year after winning the second-tier English Football League in the 2012 season.\n\nThe team is currently in 15th place in the Premier League standings - six behind Manchester United.\n\nTotal match attendance so far this year is 193,192, or about 27,598 per match, according to statistics compiled by ESPN.\n\nThe possibility of a Cardiff listing was met with a mix of cautious curiosity.\n\n\"You don't want any trophy projects,\" DMG & Partners head of research Terence Wong said, adding that there were shades of \"selling to the fans\" with Manchester United. \"We were talking about tremendous multiples.\"\n\nInvestors in Singapore will have to think like investors, and not fans, and go back to basics to assess a Cardiff initial public offering, he said.\n\n\"You can look at attendance and all these things, and it all boils down to how you manage costs and how well you can grow revenue,\" he added.\n\nMaybank Kim Eng Research analyst James Koh thought that a quality football club listing would add positive variety to the market.\n\n\"I think that's good,\" he said.\n\nInvestors will need to understand how Cardiff turns popularity into profit, Mr Koh said.\n\n\"Obviously everything is about the bottom line, but in the meantime you also must understand a lot of things like how strong the fan base is, what's the potential for monetising the fan base, what's the kind of costs to be expected going forward,\" he said.\n\nSome cyclicality should also be expected.\n\n\"You cannot expect that a company makes money every year,\" Mr Koh said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

North Asian economies, such as China, Taiwan and South Korea, which have substantial exports to Europe, are expected to perform better as developed countries begin to recover, Goldman economist Mark Tan said.\n\nGrowth in South-east Asia is forecast at 5 per cent. Thailand's outlook was adjusted lower amid ongoing political unrest in the country, while India and Indonesia face some uncertainties as elections approach in the middle of 2014.\n\nAlthough Singapore is also seen to be a beneficiary of a developed-market growth, Goldman downgraded the Republic to \"market weight\" from \"overweight\" because the firm saw better value in North Asia. Goldman expects real GDP growth to be 3.8 per cent in 2014 in US dollar terms, with the Singapore dollar strengthening to $1.15 for every US$1.\n\nThe bank expects the US Federal Reserve to begin tapering quantitative easing in March.\n\nThe developed world's recovery and tapering are common themes among analysts.\n\nIn a report, UBS described 2014 as a year of modest economic growth for Singapore, forecasting 4.5 per cent GDP improvement next year.\n\nUBS noted that tapering will keep short-term Singapore dollar rates low while steepening the yield curve.\n\n\"We think banks could continue to do well in this environment,\" UBS wrote. \"We are selective on real estate investment trusts, preferring those where tapering is priced in, and that provide potential dividends per unit upside from a cyclical recover.\"\n\nUBS is overweight banks, industrials and commercial real estate, but underweight residential real estate, and industrial and hospitality Reits.\n\nIts top picks are CapitaCommercial Trust, CapitaMalls Asia, DBS Group, Genting Singapore, Keppel Corp, Mapletree Logistics Trust, Noble Group, OSIM International, Sembcorp Industries, StarHub and United Overseas Bank.\n\n\"Stocks we like have business models leveraged to the recovery and a significant proportion of earnings generated outside Singapore,\" UBS wrote.\n\nUBS expects the Straits Times Index to hit 3,460 by end-2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Mr Ong Han Boon is a director of ERC Holdings and GCM, while Mr Ho is the sole director of Gryphon Real Estate Investment Corp (GREIC).\n\nThe suit alleges, among other things, that the monies were used by ERC group to fund the purchase of the House of Tan Yeok Nee, a gazetted national monument along Penang Road, and Big Hotel.\n\nIn one instance, GREIH monies were allegedly diverted to GCM and then assigned to DBS so that ERC International, a former subsidiary of ERC Holdings, could obtain a $48.6 million loan to partially fund the purchase of the House of Tan Yeok Nee, the suit said.\n\nTo obtain the $48.6 million loan, GCM's rights to receive management fees from GREIH were allegedly assigned to DBS, the suit said.\n\n\"Such conduct is oppressive to Sakae and is in disregard of Sakae's interests as a minority shareholder of GREIH,\" Sakae said in a 131-page suit filed on its behalf by Senior Counsel Davinder Singh and Jaikanth Shankar of Drew & Napier LLC. Sakae is a 24.69 per cent shareholder of GREIH.\n\nMr Andy Ong had bought the two-storey freehold property at slightly over $60 million in September 2012 from German fund manager Union Investment Real Estate AG, and sold it three months ago to Pua Seck Guan's Perennial Real Estate Holdings for under $90 million.\n\nERC International was recently renamed TYN Investment after ERC Holdings sold all of its shares in the unit to TYN Investment Group, whose directors include Perennial's Mr Pua, Tong Ka-Pin and Goh Hwee Peng.\n\nAnother $16 million of GREIH monies are believed to have been diverted to the ERC group of companies for the purchase of the House of Tan Yeok Nee, the suit said. The defendants, purportedly acting on behalf of GREIH, agreed to pay a $16 million compensation fee for early termination of a lease agreement with ERC Institute - a lease that was not approved by GREIH's board, according to the suit.\n\nThe suit added that Mr Andy Ong, Mr Ong Han Boon and Mr Ho were in breach of their fiduciary duties to GREIH when they allegedly diverted the business opportunity to buy the House of Tan Yeok Nee to ERC International.\n\nIn addition, a $10 million loan from UOB that was meant for GREIH's working capital requirements was used, allegedly at Mr Andy Ong and Mr Ong Han Boon's directions, to fund ERC Unicampus's purchase of Prime Centre, now known as Big Hotel, at 200 Middle Road.\n\nThe suit cited media reports as saying that Big Hotel has been placed for sale on a tender basis, and that offers for its purchase have been invited.\n\nBut Mr Andy Ong disputed the allegations. In a statement to BT yesterday, he said: \"All the allegations are baseless and are subject matter of two previous suits that have already been withdrawn by Sakae, and costs were paid to me. We will study the two suits before making an appropriate response.\"\n\nMr Ong Han Boon and Mr Ho did not return calls for comment.\n\nIn a previous round, Sakae dropped the two suits it filed earlier this year against Mr Andy Ong after it secured rights to jointly control a special bank account holding tens of millions of dollars in proceeds from the sale of Bugis Cube.\n\nIt also settled a defamation case against his public relations firm, Financial PR, but is proceeding with one other suit against him for breach of fiduciary duties when he was Sakae's independent director.\n\nAmong reliefs sought in the new suits, Sakae is seeking a declaration that the ERC group of companies are liable to account to GREIH for the proceeds from the sale of the two properties and other monies as a constructive trustee.\n\nOther reliefs sought include declarations that certain agreements and transactions are void, repayment of various monies to GREIH and GCM, an account of all unauthorised profits and gains the defendants have made as a result of a number of transactions Sakae said were \"not properly authorised\", according to the SGX statement.\n\nSakae is also seeking an order that GREIC and ERC Holdings buy Sakae's entire shareholding in GREIH at a price to be fixed by a court-appointed independent expert, or alternatively, for GREIH to be wound up.\n\nSakae also wants an order for ERC Holdings to buy Sakae's 20 per cent stake in GCM at a price fixed by a court-appointed expert, or alternatively, for GCM to be wound up.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But with daily losses of 700,000 euros and net debt of more than 800 million euros, analysts said that within six months it may again have to ground its fleet when the cash runs out.\n\nEven the Rome government sees the cash call as a stop-gap measure until a strong strategic partner can be found, but candidates are few and far between.\n\nOver the years various major airlines including Air France-KLM, Lufthansa and British Airways have flirted with partnering the carrier that offers access to Europe's fourth-largest travel market and flies 25 million passengers a year.\n\nIn the end they decided Alitalia was too much of a gamble.\n\nToday's Alitalia is much leaner than the group that was rescued and privatised in 2008. It has a younger fleet, its cost base is better than that of Air France and long gone are the perks its staff enjoyed such as being picked up by taxi from home.\n\nBut a misguided focus on the domestic and regional markets has left the airline vulnerable to competition from low-cost carriers and from high-speed trains on the Milan-Rome route.\n\nOnly last month Dublin-based Ryanair and Spanish low-cost carrier Vueling heavily increased their presence at Rome's main Fiumicino airport, the hub of Alitalia's operations.\n\nMeanwhile Alitalia's management now realises that it needs to invest in more lucrative long-haul markets to compete, but lacks the finances to acquire the necessary planes.\n\nAir France-KLM, in the midst of its own restructuring, is seen as the only viable saviour and analysts said it could offer to buy Alitalia next year, but it has said it will only do so if Alitalia can be relieved of its burdensome debt. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/64964e3d5f74f8b6de5f2ea10eb7d9e89b1d01fa10a7854bd5b6bb95619ed531?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Too much of a gamble: The airline has so far raised less than two-thirds of the 300 million euros wanted from the share sale and will rely on Italy's state-owned postal service and other investors for the rest. - PHOTO: REUTERS"}]}

But a number of banks are branching out to offer a range of platform services to other financial intermediaries as well, such as independent asset managers, smaller banks and family offices.\n\nUBS managing director Karin Oertli Kung, who is also head of the global financial intermediaries (FIM) business, says the FIM market will grow. But she also expects consolidation or a trend towards larger firms.\n\n\"We believe that growth will happen and we will capture a decent share . . . But you can't afford to run a very small company. There is a big trend globally towards larger set-ups which can afford to invest in a decent set-up to respond to regulatory requirements.\"\n\nIn Asia, FIMs account for 2-3 per cent of the wealth management market, compared to 15-20 per cent in more mature markets such as Europe, she says.\n\n\"In Asia, it's still a very young industry unlike in Europe and Switzerland, but we believe it's a growing market because first-generation private bankers are starting their own businesses, and the multi-family office concept has become more popular.\"\n\nThe FIM market has partly grown out of wealthy clients' demand for independent advice. A number of independent asset management firms, for instance, have been set up by former private bankers in the years since the 2008 crisis. Wealthy families may also choose to set up their own family office, or tap the services of a multi-family office, which in turn will need platform services.\n\nBased on a Bloomberg report in October, the assets under advisory among independent asset managers in Asia is expected to grow from about US$20 billion currently to US$70 billion by 2017. This was based on estimates by Mandeep Nalwa, chief executive of Taurus and a founding member of the Association of Independent Asset Managers in Singapore.\n\nThe Boston Consulting Group's global wealth report 2012 said that established wealth managers can respond to external asset managers in two ways. One is to compete with them. The other is to \"view them as attractive business-to-business clients and find better ways of collaboration\".\n\nUBS's FIM platform offers intermediaries a range of services including custody and reporting, access to funds and products on an open architecture basis, access to research and an IT infrastructure.\n\nGlobally, FIMs account for about 10 per cent of UBS's invested assets, which at end-September came to 871 billion Swiss francs (S$1.2 trillion) in the wealth management business. The growth rate of the Asian FIM business at 50 per cent per annum far surpasses the global average growth of 30 per cent, says UBS.\n\nOne of the major challenges among intermediaries today is compliance with regulatory demands. The bank itself does due diligence on the intermediaries before taking them on the platform. They need to be licensed, for instance.\n\n\"It's so important to do proper due diligence on the FIM so that we have confidence that we are working with a trusted counterparty. That's why we have confidence in Singapore because the regulator is much stricter than in other parts of the world. Here, I think you have a high quality (FIM) segment,\" says Ms Kung.\n\nMeanwhile, the fee model among FIMs is understood to be mixed. Reto Marx, UBS regional head of financial intermediaries (Apac), sees a trend towards advisory fees.\n\nCurrently, many FIMs earn through \"retrocessions\" or a kickback or trail fee paid by underlying product providers.\n\n\"You have to create a business model that adds value to clients and goes into advice and not just transactions . . . More and more, you want to avoid conflicts of interest and that should push you away from the financial institution remunerating you on a retrocession basis. In Europe, a lot of FIMs charge flat fees. In the UK, you can't have any retrocessions. We see that as a global trend.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/food-thought2", "site_title": "Food for thought", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFood for thought\n\nGlobal chefs give their take on what's in and what's out for the new year. By Debbie Yong and Jaime Ee\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 27, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAlvin Leung\n\nBo Innovation, Hong Kong\n\n\"SPANISH and South American cuisine such as Peruvian cuisine has been quite a strong trend in Asia in the last two years. The poor economy in Europe is driving Spanish chefs to Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Shanghai, and the tapas concept has caught on quickly as it is quite similar to dim sum. I don't think it is a trend that is here to stay, however. We are beginning to see it dying down because there are too many that have opened in a short span of time, and the markets have become too saturated.\n\n\"Modern takes on street food is an emerging trend in the West, where you have plenty of pan-Asian creations, and I would like to see more of it in Asia in 2014. Together with Willin Low, I am a judge on Wokstars, a new reality TV show where contestants compete to run their own hawker businesses, and I hope this show will inspire more young people to go into the hawker trade with new ideas.\n\n\"Singapore street food has a long history, and there are arguments on both sides on whether to keep it classic or re-invent the wheel, but I personally think it has to adapt - because people get upset when you say 'change' - with the times.\n\n\"Though many people say that molecular gastronomy and scientific cooking are no longer in fashion, the upside of that trend is that the chefs of today are more creative and courageous than the chefs of yesteryear. We need more people in the food industry with the vision of people such as Bill Gates and Steve Jobs to create new products and new lifestyles.\n\n\"Getting three Michelin stars for Bo Innovation this year is only half the journey. Giving people the experience that they feel that they should have when they come will be our target for 2014, and I am also working on a new health food concept for Hong Kong.\"\n\nGaston Acurio\n\nAstrid Y Gaston, Peru\n\n\"THERE are many trends that I think will take off in 2014. Firstly, I believe that there will be an explosion of farmers' markets around the world. People will finally appreciate that behind every ingredient is a farmer and they'll want to meet them and buy from them directly. We have around two million small farmers in Peru and chefs in my country work really closely with them. We exist thanks to them so we must support them.\n\n\"This curiosity towards food will also spark a slow evolution of small food shops. In a world where everybody wants new experiences every day, and where customers increasingly know more about food, small food shops will be back and reloaded. Food sellers will also become chefs; butchers who sell meat in the morning, for instance, will also make great tasting meat menus at lunch and dinner, fish vendors will become ceviche or sushi chefs at lunch, and the same with bakers, farmers and so on.\n\n\"This will then lead to great restaurants inside neighbourhood markets. In most countries, street food vendors were considered a problem before but now is the time for street food chefs to be recognised and respected . The reign of fine dining is over, it is now time for 'fun dining'.\n\n\"Besides, restaurants in markets give young chefs a chance to have their own place without spending too much money, and for people with not much money to enjoy their food. The recognition for creative street food has arrived and it is now the time for them to innovate freely without limits.\n\n\"However, one innovation I didn't agree with this year was the US$150,000 burger made with laboratory-made beef that did not contain any real beef. I love innovation but I'm not really prepared for that.\n\n\"Besides opening a new restaurant, La Mar at the Mandarin Oriental Miami in January, I am also working on adding a new wing to Astrid Y Gaston the following month. Peruvian restaurants are inspiring more raw food eateries and bars around the world, and it is time for our native ingredients to take the spotlight.\"\n\nDavid Thompson\n\nNahm, Bangkok\n\n\"CHEFS are now more aware of the politics of food, and the provenance of ingredients will become a focus in 2014. Cooks now understand the importance of judicious consideration when sourcing and selecting ingredients, and are aware of its environmental impact. More cooks are realising that their industry is partially responsible for the depletion of world food stocks.\n\n\"When I was cooking Thai food in Australia many years ago, there was a wealth of locally produced Thai ingredients which I thought were wonderful. But when I started cooking and tasting ingredients that were grown in Thailand, it made me aware of the importance of the soil and the environment. Even if you have the same varieties of fruits and vegetables, they taste different from one country to the next.\n\n\"I think in the next five years, Bangkok restaurants will help to flag the city as an important destination on the global culinary circuit. Bangkok always had a strong street food culture, but now its restaurant culture is blossoming. There is more talent moving into the region, not just expat talent but local talent. Chefs are becoming a lot younger and that's encouraging more creativity.\n\n\"The rise of the celebrity chef was one of the worst food trends for me in recent years. It does not represent the most irksome - but yet the most crucial part of the job - that is cooking in the kitchen. The glamour that is attached to celebrity does not in any way equate people with the hard work that is required to achieve any degree of success. To be honest, a successful cook isn't necessarily a well-known cook. Customers also now expect their cooks to be entertainers or clowns - and I don't think that's a good thing.\"\n\nVirgilio Martinez\n\nCentral Restaurant, Peru; Lima, London\n\n\"ALTHOUGH it's not a new trend, I believe the concept of 'eating locally and thinking globally' is an important concept and will be the driving force for future trends. Sustainability is also being talked about a lot as more consumers realise its importance and impact on future generations, and that will also drive new trends.\n\n\"More consumers are questioning what they eat and are demanding more information. I believe more people will turn to whole and raw foods, and as a result, we will see a reduction of industrial production of our foods.\n\n\"The best food trend in 2013 for me was the growing popularity of locavorism - or the concept of eating ingredients as close to their source as possible - and the worst was the increasing propensity of people commenting about molecular cuisine without really understanding what it is about. In the right hands, it is really something good.\n\n\"Some trends, unfortunately, are based on little research or knowledge, and are purely the result of good marketing.\n\n\"In 2014, I will be working on the launch of the Mater Iniciativa Foundation, which investigates and registers unknown Peruvian produce such as vegetables and herbs. We will continue to use London as a place for debuting new ideas and will be opening our second concept there. Central will continue to be and always will be my base of research, and the fruits of Mater Iniciativa's research will serve as the inspiration for new menu items and experiences for those who come to Central.\n\n\"I've also talked with my business partners in London about the possibility of a restaurant in Singapore, and at this point, I would say that a Lima Singapore is a definite possibility.\"\n\nJoan Roca\n\nEl Cellar de Can Roca, Girona, Spain\n\n\"THE best thing for me this year was to see how cooks have gained a deeper and shared awareness of how we can help to make a more sustainable planet from our kitchens. And that we have accepted this role and the responsibility that goes with it. The worst, especially here in Spain, has been to witness the economic crisis which has forced the interruption of many interesting gastronomic projects.\n\n\"To me, what's over-rated is cooking that is more performance-oriented - which doesn't have a direct impact on flavour or function. Chefs forget that above everything, flavour is the key point.\n\n\"For 2014, Peruvian cuisine in particular, and Latin American food in general, are enjoying their moment of gastronomic effervescence, and they will have a bigger platform. We can also expect in the next few years that China will see exponential growth in terms of culinary influence. But whatever global flavours take centrestage, what I would like to see is for the concept of health to be given more attention - from both the human and environmental point of view.\n\n\"I'm also happy to say that in spite of the economic crisis, Spanish gastronomy is still committed to excellence and creativity. So we are optimistic that if the situation improves, our gastronomy will get an even bigger boost.\"\n\nPaul Pairet\n\nMr & Mrs Bund and Ultraviolet, Shanghai\n\n\"HIGH-end restaurants used to set the trends, as food fads usually pass from the top end of the scale to the bottom, such as the creme brulee fascination that spread from three Michelin stars restaurants to supermarkets, for instance.\n\n\"Today, however, leaders of food opinion are no longer the omnipotent chefs or restaurateurs of the 1990s. Instead, trendsetters can come from everywhere: street food vendors, food truck operators and self-made foodies. What is important is their genuine dedication to executing an idea in its best form. With that, anything can be the next trend.\n\n\"I foresee that restaurants serving only chefs' menus will become a bigger trend in 2014. It is not only an economical way to dine, but the best way for chefs to deliver their creations at their best. The shift of power in decision-making from the guests to the chefs is a force that I think will be even bigger than the 'bistronomy' phenomenon. Ultraviolet can be considered as extreme in this field, as our guests cannot choose either the menu or the duration of the meal they will have. But it does not need to be extreme: Parisian restaurants such as Sergeant Recruiter, Septime and Saturne are paving the way for this movement with their fantastic sourcing of produce and plenty of their chefs' personality and style apparent in their cooking.\n\n\"Other global trends that I foresee growing bigger this year is nose-to-tail cooking, sharing concept restaurants, and 'upper-class fast food', that is, fast food stalls or food trucks run by cooks and bakers who specialise in mastering a basic food and offering a higher quality spin on it.\n\n\"We may increasingly see more partnerships between restaurants and commercial brands, which can produce some interesting synergies, and of course, more focus on green and healthy eating and sustainability. The latter, I think, is fine as long as it is honest and not simply used as a marketing trait.\n\n\"I might open a new space in 2014. It will be something simple, as I have all I need in terms of creative outlets with Ultraviolet and Mr & Mrs Bund, but nothing is set at this stage. My dream would be to open something in the Bar & Billiard Room of the Raffles Hotel in Singapore - it is such an iconic space.\"\n\nIan Kittichai\n\nJum Mum and Spot Dessert Bar, New York; Hyde & Seek Gastro Bar and Issaya Siamese Club, Bangkok\n\n\"THE concept and practice of knowing where your food comes from, and the responsible and sustainable production of our food is something that has been gaining more visibility in the past few years and I believe it will continue to become a more visible force in how we choose to eat.\n\n\"On the other hand, I really disliked the whole frenzy that was embodied in the cronut craze. It wasn't that I disliked it or its creator, but the mass commercialisation and almost fanatical obsession and rush to copy was something that I found distasteful. It became a status symbol and psychological phenomenon rather than a process of culinary discovery, learning and enjoyment. This extends to the whole ramen burger craze and such as well.\n\n\"In 2014 I will be releasing my second cookbook in English, the Issaya Siamese Club Pastries & Dessert Cookbook, and I will also be opening the Issaya Cooking Studio on the lower level of the about-to-be-opened Central Embassy complex in central Bangkok in March.\n\n\"I will also be opening a second branch of Hyde & Seek Gastro Bar in Bangkok in 2014 called Hyde & Seek Peek-A-Boo, as well as more outlets of Spot Dessert Bar in New York, including a location in the new Freedom Tower complex in downtown Manhattan.\"\n\nAlbert Adria\n\nPakta, Barcelona\n\n\"WE'VE been so busy this year with the opening of restaurants (including Pakta) that I'm not the best person to ask about 2013's best and worst food trends. Suffice to say that fashions come and go but in the end, what wins is the kitchen, or rather, good food. Therefore, the ingredients, dishes and styles that prevail over time are always those that emphasise quality and flavour.\n\n\"About Peruvian cuisine being the next big thing, well, one cuisine doesn't dominate the world in two years. But the response to Pakta (a Japanese-Peruvian eatery) has been very positive so we're very happy. But having said that, I can see that Japanese, Chinese and Italian will continue to be the dominant cuisines. But what I also hope to see happen in 2014 is for chefs to focus more on the nutritional and health value of their ingredients and cooking.\n\n\"Meanwhile, Spain has been going through a hard time economically and unfortunately, the crisis is going to last a few more years. Therefore, we have to first find new ways to create restaurant concepts that are economically viable and secondly, we need to go to other countries to popularise Spanish food as well.\"\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These are predominantly traditional long-only funds invested in equities, and hence do not involve credit intermediation.\"\n\nPotential shadow banking entities in Singapore include the following non-bank financial intermediaries: money market funds, exchange traded funds, structured finance vehicles, hedge funds, private equity funds, other investment funds and broker-dealers.\n\nThe MAS survey of selected OIFs that had the largest exposures to credit intermediation instruments as at end-2012 showed that their short-term assets far exceeded long-term liabilities.\n\n\"Their assets were also generally more liquid than their redemption obligations - about 80 per cent of OIFs' assets could be liquidated within a week while only about 70 per cent of their net asset values could be redeemed by investors within the same period.\n\n\"Maturity and liquidity transformation for other entities are insignificant as well,\" it said.\n\nFunds managed in Singapore generally take on little leverage, investing using mainly the monies raised from investors. For example, based on the survey, the leverage ratio of OIFs was only 1.5 per cent as at end-2012.\n\nThe MAS survey also indicates that links between non-bank financial intermediaries and Singapore's banking system are insignificant, at 2.4 per cent of banks' total non-bank deposits, and 1.7 per cent of their non-bank loans. Non-bank financial intermediaries account for only 1.2 per cent of banks' total derivative transactions. Banks' guarantees to and investments in non-bank financial intermediaries are also insignificant.\n\n\"Nevertheless, MAS will continue to monitor the size of shadow banking activities in Singapore and the risks these activities pose.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ninety-five, or 57 per cent, of the 167 regional equity long-short hedge funds which began trading with less than US$50 million still manage less than that amount after an average of 5.3 years in existence, it added, citing data from Singapore-based Eurekahedge Pte.\n\n\"A critical success factor in the launch of a hedge fund is the size of assets under management at launch,\" Citigroup said in the regional supplement to its Business Expense Benchmark Survey. \"Small fund launches in Asia have demonstrated a statistically reduced chance of accelerated assets under management growth.\"\n\nThe US$2.5 trillion global hedge-fund industry is facing pressure to cut fees to attract investors amid rising costs of complying with regulations and client demand. The average Asian hedge-fund startup raised US$8 million this year, down from US$25 million seven years ago before the 2008 global financial crisis dented investor interest, according to Eurekahedge data provided in early November.\n\nManagement fees charged by hedge funds globally have fallen to as low as 1.58 per cent for all but the largest companies, from the previous standard of 2 per cent, as startup managers have been pressed to offer discounts to early investors. A hedge fund on average needs to manage at least US$300 million to break even, the Citigroup global survey released on Monday found.\n\nIn Asia, operating expenses of a US$100 million hedge fund are 20 per cent lower than in the US and Europe. The gap widens to 42 per cent for a hedge fund managing US$500 million and 39 per cent for those with assets of US$1.5 billion, it added.\n\nAsian hedge funds may break even at US$135 million, relying solely on a 1.5 per cent management fee, Citigroup estimated.\n\n\"It is likely that, initially, any excess cash may need to be reinvested into the business to ensure an institutional-grade infrastructure is in place\" to help expand assets, the survey said.\n\nThe survey sampled 124 hedge-fund managers in North America, Europe and Asia with combined assets of US$465 billion. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nIndonesia looking at levy on coal exports to boost state coffers\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:03 PM\n\nAsia: Markets mixed as China\u2019s economy meets forecasts\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:49 AM\n\nDespite tariffs, it\u2019s still America first for Asia\u2019s legacy automakers\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:05 AM\n\nFCT extends Northpoint City South Wing management by a year\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:28 AM\n\nChina\u2019s quant funds boost US recruiting after Trump\u2019s visa curbs\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nGold holds ground with spotlight on US inflation data\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:51 AM\n\nChina Medical System shares surge 11% with its secondary listing on SGX\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:30 AM", "images": []}

My family would start dinner around 11pm on Christmas Eve. We always keep to a very traditional menu, with dishes such as embutidos (cured sausages), langotinos (lobsters), esparagos (asparagus), and sopa de marisco (seafood soup). Depending on the mood of the chef of the night - usually one of my uncles or my grandmother - there would also be seabass, cochinillo (suckling pig) or cordero (suckling lamb) asado, and a traditional Christmas salad of oranges, black olives and pomegranate. After dinner, we'll stay around the table, talking and playing cards. A spread of turrones, postres and chocolates from dinner will stay on the table until the early morning, when the piping hot churros arrive.\n\n\"On Christmas Day, we would go to church, followed by some vermouth - a quick drink before lunch with few light tapas - and then lunch at home. In Spain, you'd traditionally receive your Christmas present from the Three Kings on Jan 6 rather than from Santa. You'd get a gift if you have been nice over the year. If not, they would bring you a piece of carbon (a piece of hard candy dyed black) instead. The tradition at our home was that my younger brother and I would always get the present along with a piece of carbon to remind us that we have not always been good.\n\n\"When it comes to my family these days, I tend to mix my Spanish traditions with the traditions of the countries where I have been living since I left Spain many years ago. My two children, Marc and Marie-Luce, still have their presents at Christmas, but for a long time they have also been receiving a small present on Three Kings Day. We try as best as we can to stay close to the family even though we are living far from home.\"\n\nFlambeed lobster with tomato sauce\n\n(serves 2)\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 lobsters 500g to 700g\n\n6 tablespoons of olive oil\n\n4 tablespoons of butter (50g)\n\n12 ml of brandy\n\n12 ml of white wine\n\none small red onion\n\n300 g of ripe tomatoes\n\none garlic clove\n\nMixed herbs\n\nSalt\n\nBlack Pepper\n\nCayenne pepper (depending on taste)\n\nMethod:\n\n1.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/trending-now", "site_title": "Trending now", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTrending now\n\nYou aren't truly a foodie unless you've queued with the masses, knocked one back in a (literally) underground restaurant or lamented the loss of an iconic dining destination in 2013. Debbie Yong looks back at the food trends that got Singapore talking this year\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Dec 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGrow Your Own\n\nALREADY standard practice among top chefs in France and the United States, the farm-to-table movement is rapidly taking root across Singapore. Local restaurants Artichoke and Morsels have been flying the flag in partnership with urban farmer Bjorn Low's consultancy, Edible Gardens, but the roster of locavore advocates expanded this year to include cocktail bars such as 28 Hong Kong Street, The Green Door and Maison Ikkoku, which have all sprouted petite herb gardens in their backyards and rooftops. Ann Siang Hill watering hole Oxwell and Co has talked of further plans to start farming bees for honey on its terrace, and even top brands such as the W Hotel and the Swissotel have carved out plots for edible gardens on their premises. Top chef Andre Chiang, too, started his own 1.5ha farm in his native Taiwan this year, which has just started to yield bounty such as carrots, leeks and baby corn for use at Restaurant Andre.\n\nGoing gaga\n\nYou can't be taken seriously as a foodie unless you've had to bite the bullet and rough it out in line outside an overseas food franchise this year. French macaron specialist Laduree, Michelin-starred Hong Kong dim sum chain Tim Ho Wan, American donut brand Krispy Kreme and British television chef Jamie Oliver's Jamie's Italian all sparked off snaking long queues when they unveiled their first Singapore outposts earlier this year, with some relentless fans even staking out overnight for first-bite bragging rights.\n\nNot quite a franchise but an undeniable product of successful branding, British chef Gordon Ramsay, too, spurred some ardent overnight campers when he came to town in July to challenge our local hawker heroes to a cooking showdown. Funny though, that while Singaporeans think nothing of enduring long hours for food, we'll sooner throw a tantrum if we have to queue for more than 10 minutes for a taxi.\n\nPairing up\n\nWith rents on the up and up in Singapore, it increasingly makes sense for F&B businesses to cosy up in the same space, nevermind if their concepts are as different as chalk and cheese. Traditional bao shop Choon Ming Bao Dian and artisan bakery, The Bread Table, sit happily side-by-side in an Upper Thomson Road shophouse unit; five-month-old Take 2 Cafe in Novena is a hair salon and a cheap-and-cheery eatery conjoined by a sliding glass door; and a tiny corridor at the back of traditional Chinese medicine bakery, Dough and Grains, leads to the Backdoor Bar, a two-table drinking joint that regularly screens football matches.\n\nOthers such as Two Face Pizza and Alibabar split the space by day and night use, and morph from grubby dayime kopi tiams to craft beer bars after-hours. The latest to join this wave is F&B stalwart Loh Lik Peng, whose Bincho at Hua Bee is a mee pok stall by day and industrial chic Japanese yakitori bar by night that has created a buzz among Tiong Bahru's retiree residents and fashionable tipplers alike.\n\nBlink and you'll miss it\n\nA restaurant with an unfashionable postal code or with no street-facing access used to be a sure-fire recipe for failure, but basement venues and offbeat locations are now standard modus operandi. Basement nightclub Kyo packs them in weekly while The Black Swan's best-kept secret is its private room squirrelled in the former basement vault of the space's early bank tenants.\n\nBellwethers in sin-riddled Desker Road is an unexpectedly mod operation, and bike shop-cum-vintage furniture store-cum-cafe Wheeler's Yard is a hipster-magnet despite (or perhaps as a result of) being plugged in a warehouse that looks perpetually shut in industrial Balestier. Rooftop bar Mad Men and local musicians Jack and Rai's first F&B venture, The Flying Squirrel, both have their entrances on blink-and-you'll-miss-it side alleys in the CBD and the latter's new outlet, Workshop, is tucked away in a nondescript Bukit Merah HDB block. Like seeking an oasis in the middle of the desert, perhaps the idea is that drinks taste better when you've had to work to find them.\n\nPop-ups going permanent\n\nAnother pop-up restaurant? Been there, done that. 2013 belongs to the pop-ups who dared to venture forth with a brick-and-mortar space to call their own. Fat Duck chef-backed restaurant-lounge Bacchanalia was launched to immediate aplomb in April after the concept had been test-driven as a series of lavish pop-up Saturday brunches for a year, and The Naked Finn finally secured its permanent berth in Gillman Barracks after a long hiatus from its three-month pop-up within now-defunct boutique, A Curious TeePee. Similarly, Keong Saik Road eatery Burnt Ends is a manifestation of pop-up barbecue restaurant Burnt Enz that Australia head chef David Pynt ran in London last summer, while 8-month-old cooking studio My Private Pantry doubles as a homebase for Crystal Chua and Stephan Zoisl's two-year-old private cheffing outfit, My Private Chef. Now a popular Ann Siang Hill fixture, small plates restaurant Lolla, too, was initially gestated as underground supperclub, Lolla's Secret Suppers.\n\nHawkerpreneurs\n\nWith 10 new hawker centres on the blueprint, and a whole generation of hawkers soon headed for retirement, the issue of continuity for the hawker trade has come under the direct spotlight this year - so much so that a global conference, The World Street Food Congress, was even inaugurated around the theme of preservation and professionalisation in June. A new breed of \"hawkerpreneurs\" behind new modern food stalls such as Nicher and A Noodle Story and the success stories of earlier ventures such as Saveur and Le Cuisson make the idea of running a start-up in a sweaty environment seem sexy again, but the push for renewal recently took a step back with the October closure of Kampung@Simpang Bedok, Singapore's first hawker centre run as a social enterprise.\n\nOff the radar\n\nSignboards: so last season. Everyone likes to feel like only they have privileged insider's access to the latest hotspots, and speakeasies Jekyll and Hye, The Powder Room, Cache, the Spiffy Dapper and House of Dandy are the latest to get onto the burgeoning bandwagon of covert drinking destinations. But that privilege comes at a price, that is, the inconvenience of having to constantly get up mid-cocktail to flag misguided friends in the right direction.\n\nHybrid eats\n\nFirst came Da Paolo Gastronomia's cronut, a local rendition of the croissant-donut that New York patissier Dominique Ansel created to a rabid following in the US; then came Shangri-La Hotel's croffle, or croissant-meets-waffle; and now we have food truck The Travelling Cow's ramen burger. What will they think of next?\n\nOld is gold\n\nVintage never seems to get old in modern Singapore. But while the vintage influence was largely cosmetic before, restaurants rocking the retro vibe in 2013 work in recipes from Singapore's golden past as well. Amid 1970s knick-knacks, Sinpopo and Dong Po Colonial Cafe serve up sweet treats of yore - such as the ais bor and long cup butter cakes respectively - while newcomer bars Zui Hong Lou and Ding Dong, offer modern interpretations on Malacca chendol and chrysanthemum-infused cocktails in neon-lit Wong Kar Wai meets Suzy Wong artsy/sleazy surrounds. Nearby, Teochew restaurant Cheng Hoo Tian revives recipes dating back to its original founding in Ellenborough Market in the 1930s. Don't reminisce too fondly about the classroom tables and stringy chairs at The Tuckshop or at the plastic green tau huay trough that doubles as a punchbowl at Ah Sam Cold Drink Store though - you might just reveal your age.\n\nIndie no more\n\nThe storm over speciality coffee is still brewing strong. In fact, most of the little indie joints java junkies have been rooting for since 2011 have done well enough to expand into multi-outlet operations with a heavier food focus this year. Strangers' Reunion expanded into an adjacent unit in April; Group Therapy Cafe spawned its second branch in Katong lst month; Smitten Coffee spun off sister brand, Necessary Provisions, in June; and Jewel Coffee at Shenton Way upsized with an 80-seater Jewel Cafe and Bar sophomore effort in Rangoon Road in March. Also new in Jalan Besar is five-month-old The Bravery by folks behind The Plain, who proved they are truly on a roll by going on to open Ronin in Hong Kong Street last month.\n\nSpa Esprit and Harry Grover's 40 Hands Coffee, meanwhile, spun off coffee-takeaway counter, Kiasu Espresso, in Tanjong Pagar mid-year and later teamed up with Australia's Five Senses group to launch specialty coffee monolith, Common Man Coffee Roasters, in August.\n\nLatin American fever\n\nThe Peruvian craze that has gripped food capitals worldwide finally hit town when South American restaurant Sur Nuevo Latino Kitchen opened at the cusp of the new year, and was followed swiftly by Colombian restaurant La Barra and Cuban eatery Ocio. These were followed by a string of by-now ubiquitous Mexican eateries such as the no-frills Pistola, Guzman Y Gomez, Mex-Out, and Muchachos, and trendy, tequila-centric watering holes such as Lucha Loco, Lower East Side, and Hombre Cantina. Too bad though that the wave seems to be crashing as quickly as it crested: Sur, La Barra and Ocio have since shuttered.\n\nBetter burgers\n\nLast year's cupcake epidemic finally started to decline this year, but not before we saw a new rash of gourmet burger shops by everyone from former investment bankers and social entrepreneurs to local musicians and radio DJs. This year, guitarist Keith Tan's Meatpacking District, and Fast Food for Thought joined the ranks of relatively new homegrown burger joints such as Two Blur Guys, Omakase Burger and Do-It-Yourself Burger . Australian chain Charlie & Co recently got the memo too, and expanded here in January to jostle among existing overseas brands such Tokyo's Freshness Burger and R Burger, Canada's Triple O's, and Kraze burger from Seoul.\n\nDownscaling\n\nLes Amis shut high-end Vietnamese restaurant, Annam, to focus on taking chef Nam Quoc Nguyen's mid-tier chain Nam Nam across the region, and it will be also shutting fine-dining grand dame Au Jardin in April. Italian restaurant Gattopardo recently opened casual winebar Morsi and Sorsi; Il Lido went downstream with &Sons, a wine bar modelled after the Venetian bacaro; while Osvaldo Forlino's No Menu Bar doubles as a Chinese economy rice stall at lunch. Does this spell the end of the era of fine dining? We shudder to think so.\n\nBowing out\n\nIt's a dog-eat-dog business out there in the restaurant universe, and 2013 proved that even trophied front-runners can sometimes lose their footing. Some close because of rental hikes and management issues, others because their owners have had a change in priorities. Hong Kong-based local restaurateur Yenn Wong, for instance, will close her trio of restaurants, Bomba, Kha and Graze by January 2014 to focus on her family and her growing stable of restaurants there. Likewise, the owners of Preparazzi and Le Saint Julien closed their dine-in outlets to focus on their growing catering businesses (though Jeremy Nguee now runs temporary laksa bar Rakusaba at The U Factory, and veteran chef Julien Bompard still cooks on a referrals-only basis at three-month-old private dining outfit, Scotts 27). One on the Bund will shut early next year and La Cicala, Keystone, La Villa and Foodbar Dada all threw in the towel in recent months (but the latter's Josper oven-cooking can still be had at month-old 63 Celsius by the same owner) and Chef Willin Low's flagship Wild Rocket on Mount Emily shut earlier this month, too, for a three-month hiatus.\n\nServe-it-yourself\n\nThe tightening of foreign labour quotas and consequent manpower shortage that have hit the F&B industry hard in 2013 also mean that restaurant owners have to rely ever more on technology to get by. IPad menus are now popping up in trendy nosh spots such as The Fat Boy's Burger Bar to more traditional settings such as Tunglok's Xihe Peking Duck Restaurant. Popular newcomers such as Grub and Symmetry have built in fully automated SMS-based queueing systems while DIY Enomatic wine dispensers are now staple fixtures at wine bars such as Napoleon, Les Amis' winebar Caveau, Praelum and Cook & Brew in the brand new Westin Hotel - a clever way of reducing their reliance on labour and letting wine newbies sample a wider range at the same time.\n\nEthical eating\n\nSustainability has yet to become a common dinner topic in Asia, but going by the look of things, it will soon be. Recently opened restaurant Wolf trumpets the nose-to-tail philosophy of thoughtful meat use to reduce wastage, while sustainably sourced seafood will feature in at least 80 per cent of Gattopardo's new menu when the Sicilian restaurant relocates to Tras Street in January. Sustainability will also be a major theme for the series of workshops surrounding the Asia's 50 Best Restaurants Awards next February.

Here are some ideas.\n\nHunting with the Bushmen\n\nWHAT'S next after seeing the Big 5 at an African safari? Perhaps a hunting expedition.\n\nThis eight-day exotic holiday begins with a two-day initiation into the San Bushmen community in Botswana.\n\nDay three marks the start of the hunt for an eland with the Bushmen. In the event that the hunt for the eland is unsuccessful, the Bushmen will switch to gemsbuck, wildebeest or kudu. It is a physically demanding hunt, so you have to be fit.\n\nWhile the location is remote, you will still be able to dine on excellent food and stay in luxurious mobile tents. There are no rain showers though, what you get are bucket baths - the only concession to the reality of being in the remote bushes of Botswana.\n\nPriced at US$11,440, excluding flights. Urbane Nomads,\n\nwww.urbanenomads.com\n\nSouth American Journey\n\nTHE continent continues to be a hot destination next year, especially with Brazil hosting the World Cup in June.\n\nIt is impossible to visit all the South American countries in one holiday, but going on a 16-day tour gives you a fairly good picture of the continent. The tour starts and ends in Sao Paulo, so if you are heading to Brazil to catch the World Cup, you could join the tour either before or after catching the matches.\n\nThe journey will take you to popular sites such as Christ the Redeemer statue and Iguazu Falls in Brazil. Then move onto Buenos Aires in Argentina, where you will be part of a Gaucho party at the famed Pampas grasslands. The tour then goes to Santiago, Chile, with a stop at a Maipo Valley and a visit to the Statue of the Virgin Mary. Besides Santiago, you alsostop at Valparaiso town which was declared a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2003.\n\nOf course, no trip to South America would be complete without a visit to Machu Picchu in Peru.\n\nPriced from S$12,288. Chan Brothers,\n\ntours.chanbrothers.com\n\nThe Balkans and Venice\n\nMOST people have visited Western Europe, but the Balkans in Eastern Europe offer just as much charm and cultural heritage as well.\n\nTrafalgar's 13-day tour will take you to cities including Zagreb, Sarajevo, Dubrovnik and Split. There is also an insider tour of the Sarajevo war tunnels.\n\nOther highlights include a visit to the mediaeval city of Dubrovnik as well as a stop at the waterfalls in Plitvice National Park, which link the park's 16 crystal-clear lakes.\n\nAfter a round trip in the Balkans, the tour ends with two nights in Venice.\n\nPriced from US$3,135, excluding flights. Trafalgar,\n\nwww.trafalgar.com\n\nLong Live Okinawa\n\nIf you like Japan but have been to Tokyo countless times, perhaps a trip to Okinawa is next. The island has a more laid-back atmosphere, but still has that efficient and polite service that the country is famed for.\n\nSome of the stops on this five-day tour include Churaumi Aquarium, one of the world's largest aquariums, and Shuri Castle, a palace of the Ryukyu Kingdom.\n\nOkinawa is also renowned as the island of longevity. You will get to visit a longevity village, home to several youthful looking centenarians. Food plays a big part in keeping these centenarians healthy, so you will be able to sample a meal, such as the famed Okinawan dish, goya champuru, or stir-fried bittergourd and egg.\n\nPriced from S$1,298 CTC Travel,\n\nwww.ctc.com.sg\n\nDesert Holiday in Oman\n\nA HOLIDAY to the Middle East usually means either Jordan, Egypt or to the United Arab Emirates.

With the new self-boarding gates, the boarding process will be streamlined at the gatehold rooms and passengers will scan their boarding passes themselves using the barcode readers before they board the plane. However, ground staff will also be on hand to help those who need assistance.\n\nSecurity checks will remain in place at these self-boarding gates to verify the passenger's identity and ensure that prohibited items are not taken onboard the plane.\n\nChangi Airport Group (CAG) and Lufthansa airline embarked on a trial at Changi's Terminal 2 in May with \"encouraging\" results so far, the airport operator said.\n\nBoarding time for an Airbus A380 aircraft with a load of 500 passengers can take place in 15 minutes, down from about 30 minutes previously, making the boarding experience both quicker and smoother for passengers.\n\nFor airlines and ground-handlers, this will also mean staff can be freed to perform other duties such as providing customer service.\n\nCAG said that the self-boarding gates are a part of a larger push to implement automated airport processes which the airport operator will be introducing across its terminals at Changi. Aside from fast and seamless travel, it will help the airport and its partners tackle the existing manpower crunch in Singapore even as passenger traffic continues on an upward trend.\n\nThe upcoming Terminal 4 is expected to leverage on more self-service options, from check-in to baggage drop off to automated immigration clearance, CAG has said previously. T4 will open its doors in 2017.\n\nOther airports are also looking for ways to improve the passenger experience and effectively use resources without compromising safety and security. London's Heathrow and Amsterdam's Schiphol will take part in Smart Security pilots next year to test first-generation check-points, together with the International Air Transport Association and Airports Council International. This will include integrating technology to improve security screening as well as putting in place new procedures to facilitate risk-based screening.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We'll apply fresh coats of paint, buy new curtains and a vast array of new knick-knacks for the house. This is a topsy-turvy process that somehow only miraculously gets sorted out on Christmas Eve itself. This is also why the deepest Christmas memories from my childhood is of waking up to a myriad aromas wafting around the house.\n\n\"Before I get out of bed, I'll be greeted by the smell of fresh paint and newly bought household items. Then, once I step out of my room, the aroma of freshly baked ham, black (rum-soaked fruit) cake, sweet bread and pastelles (a Latin cornmeal pastry) take over.\n\n\"Christmas dinners are always a large affair in my family, with more than 15 people involved. Besides the ham and pastries, the menu will include Christmas festive rice, calalloo stewed pigeon and peas, macaroni pie, roasted Caribbean root vegetables, honey-glazed turkey, Punch de Creme (the Caribbean version of eggnog) and ginger beer. Throughout the whole evening, parang music (traditional Christmas music brought to Trinidad by Venezuelan migrants) would fill the house with a joyous atmosphere. I was always literally dancing around the kitchen.\n\n\"Among all the scents of Christmas in the Caribbean, that of the sorrel - a hibiscus flower known as roselle in Singapore - remains the most distinctive for me. Sorrel is mainly consumed at Christmas time as a drink in the Caribbean. The sorrel is pitted and the petals are boiled with spices to make a wonderful drink, which can be turned into a delightful cocktail with some rum and Angostura bitters.\"\n\nSorrel drink\n\nIngredients:\n\n500g fresh sorrel petals (ask for Roselle at local wet markets)\n\n2 cinnamon sticks\n\n6 cloves\n\n10-12 cups of water\n\n2 bay leaves\n\n2 cups of sugar (or more to taste)\n\n2 inches orange peel\n\nGrated ginger to taste (optional)\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place water, sorrel, cinnamon, cloves, and orange peel in a pot and bring it to a boil.\n\n2. Leave it to boil for 10 minutes.\n\n3. Set aside after boiling to cool and allow the aromas to mingle.\n\n4. Add sugar and taste for strength. This is a personal preference as some like the tang and others like it sweet.\n\n5. Add ginger if desired (as they do in Jamaica).\n\n6. Strain the liquid and store in a glass bottle.\n\n7. For the adult version, add your favourite rum to the mix.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The bill also proposed pardoning, among others, soldiers responsible for the killings of demonstrators in the 2010 anti-government protests.\n\nThe bill passed the lower house of the Thai parliament, but was rejected by the Senate and therefore cannot become law. It was clearly ill-timed and poorly crafted; its main aim appeared to be to clear the path for Mr Thaksin's return to Thailand.

US homes as a whole lost US$6.3 trillion in value from 2007 through 2011 and have recovered 44 per cent of that, according to the Seattle- based property-data firm.\n\nHome prices are rising across the US as investors drain markets of inventory and improving employment brings in more buyers.\n\nAlmost 90 per cent of the 485 metropolitan areas analysed by Zillow had price gains this year. The total value of the nation's housing stock jumped about 7.9 per cent from 2012, the second straight annual increase, according to the report.\n\n\"The housing market continued to build on the positive momentum that began in 2012,\" Stan Humphries, Zillow's chief economist, said in the statement. \"Low mortgage rates and an improving economy helped bring buyers into the market.\"\n\nPrice increases will slow next year to a pace closer to the historic norm of 3 per cent to 5 per cent, according to Mr Humphries.\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it will scale back asset purchases that have bolstered housing demand by keeping interest rates low.\n\nImprovements in the job market spurred the decision to cut spending on Treasuries and mortgage bonds to US$75 billion from US$85 billion starting in January, the Federal Open Market Committee said at the end of a two-day meeting in Washington.\n\n\"The housing market is transitioning away from the robust bounce off the bottom we've been seeing, towards a more sustainable, healthier market,\" Mr Humphries said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nChina home prices fall at fastest pace in eight months, stimulus calls rise\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:34 AM\n\n24 law firms probed for conveyancing of properties seized from money launderers, two to pay penalties\n\nJul 15, 2025 10:50 AM\n\nLuxury development boom stokes jump in Indian real-estate shares\n\nJul 15, 2025 09:04 AM\n\nChina Vanke says first half loss may widen to US$1.67 billion\n\nJul 15, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nBuilders\u2019 mortgage aid lifts home prices, Morgan Stanley says\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:14 AM\n\nIOI offers \u2018special preview prices\u2019 for limited units at about S$3,200 psf for W Residences Marina View\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:16 PM\n\nTwo River Valley area projects \u2013 River Green and Promenade Peak \u2013 begin previews this week\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:01 PM\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM", "images": []}

He shares a limo ride with JEREMY HART as he muses about his career, charity work and pledging allegiance to China\n\nPublished Thu, Dec 5, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nPASSING the Bird's Nest - the most iconic of Beijing's Olympic legacies - Jackie Chan was hunkered down in the back of a blacked-out Bentley Mulsanne. His handmade green velvet Mao suit seemed to be in a tactile tug-of-war with acres of hand-stitched black leather upholstery. It was how one might expect the most famous man on the planet to travel to a charity auction.\n\nHis No 1 spot in global recognition was not his claim. It came from US talk show legend Jay Leno. \"I was in Jay Leno's show,\" Chan recalled in his unique style of English. \"He say, now - ladies and gentleman, the most famous star in the world: Jackie Chan. Then I come out, I say no, no, no, no, no. Jay, I'm not the most famous. There's so many famous stars in America. He said Jackie, you're wrong.\"\n\nLeno was right. Presidents Obama and Hu Jintao famously locked words over Chan at the White House when both tried to claim his fame for their own. Chan had been invited to Washington for a Chinese state visit, but ended up in a cultural claim of ownership instead.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These traders who make money on a falling stock price are betting against what they see is an epic bubble covering the global equity markets as the Dow Jones Industrial Average flirts with the 16,000 mark.\n\nShort-selling allows an investor to make money on borrowed scrips in anticipation of the stock price falling. However, if the price rises, they will incur a loss as they would have to buy the shares they do not own at the prevailing market price in order to return them.\n\nSome market experts believe the markets are at historic highs. Potential upsides would be spurred by hints of further government support through reduced rates and quantitative easing (QE) rather than positive fundamental economic data.\n\nBut George Rippon, a director at fee-based financial advisory group THG Select, said this was hardly a scenario that will secure long-term growth. \"In fact, it's a scenario that could see a dramatic drop instead.\"\n\nMr Rippon is concerned that too much growth has been generated by intervention and that when this support is withdrawn, the drop could be significant.\"However, if tapering represents only a small drop in QE, then markets could yet still continue to rally as a result of investors feeling comfortable that despite a slight reduction QE will continue apace. This could see the bubble get bigger.\"\n\nHe cautioned: \"However, beware of the sand that this rally is based upon - a false environment created by politicians to prevent the full failures of the economic model pre-2008 being truly felt . . . yet.\"\n\nAs for 2013, Singapore-listed LionGold Corp, one of the stocks caught in the infamous penny stock saga this year, has been given the dubious honour of being the second best short of 2013 in Asia, even as the local authorities are investigating the trading activities surrounding the gold miner.\n\n\". . . Singapore-listed LionGold Corp topped the list having seen its share price tumble in October, erasing nearly 90 per cent of its market value,\" Markit analyst Simon Colvin said in his \"Top Asian Shorts\" report.\n\nLionGold, together with Asiasons Capital and Blumont Group, was declared a \"designated\" security in October as the authorities slapped on trading restrictions that were subsequently lifted. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange have been conducting an extensive review of the trading activities of these stocks.\n\nTheir meltdown has hurt many retail investors, remisiers and brokerages.\n\nAmFraser Securities, for one, faced a potential loss of up to RM120 million (S$47 million) over the three stocks. Global broking giant Interactive Brokers has launched the largest legal action so far in the wake of the October penny stock saga, taking aim at at least 10 clients as it seeks to recover about US$68 million of losses.\n\nAlthough eight materials stocks made Markit's list of most successful shorts in Asia, the region's tech companies also proved profitable for short-sellers.\n\nTaiwan provided the most fertile ground for tech short-sellers, accounting for 10 of the 11 top Asian tech shorts of the year.\n\nOf this group, TPK Holding was the best-performing short, having seen its share price fall by 71 per cent since short-sellers started to target the company in May. Short-selling activity was particularly well timed in TPK, avoiding the bull run at the start of the year and focused on the second half during which TPK's shares fell by more than 70 per cent.\n\nThe top short in Asia was struggling Australian drug company, Pharmaxis. Those who have shorted Pharmaxis would have made a tidy profit as the stock has seen its share price fall a massive 91 per cent over the last year as the US Food and Drug Administration rejected its application to market its cystic fibrosis treatment. Short-sellers were well positioned ahead of these developments with the company seeing a fresh annual high in demand to borrow in January, just prior to the FDA decision.\n\nMarkit looked at the performance of companies since they recorded a fresh annual high in short interest to the beginning of December, above a threshold of 3 per cent of shares on loan.\n\n\"We find that shorts have been able to uncover plenty of underperforming shares over the last 12 months. Taking a look at the shares which tumbled by more than 30 per cent since posting a fresh annual high in demand to borrow, we uncovered 39 top shorts in Asia and 15 in Europe,\" Mr Colvin said.\n\nIn Europe, materials companies dominated the list, after being hit by fluctuating metal prices and concerns about the health of the global economy. Seven of the top 15 shorts were materials stocks, with gold miner Petropavlosk coming in at No 3. The company's battle with falling gold prices saw its share price fall 61 per cent after short-sellers started to target the company, said Markit.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The changes took effect on Nov 15. The move is aimed at safeguarding Singapore's scarce industrial land resources for optimal use by genuine industrialists and dampening property speculation.\n\nContacted by BT, JTC said the changes aimed to \"ensure the lessees allocated our limited industrial land in their lease contract based on their proposed business plans remain committed to them for a sustained and reasonable period of time\". The changes also discourage speculation and promote price stability in the industrial property market, it added.\n\nThe statutory board reckons its policy strikes a \"reasonable balance\" between facilitating a lessee's need to sell its industrial premises in the secondary market and ensuring the lessee deploys the land towards the purpose that JTC allocated it for.\n\nIndustry players believe the move will dampen secondary market transactions for landed factories on JTC-leased sites and thus hit industrial property brokers.\n\nJTC leases land chiefly to end-user industrialists to build their facilities. After a lease assignment prohibition period, the industrialist may sell the property to either another end-user; or a third-party facility provider, subject to the industrialist leasing back the property as an anchor tenant for a minimum occupation period (MOP).\n\nThis Sale and Leaseback Scheme is one of the schemes under which JTC allows a third-party facility provider to be its lessee. Another is the Third-Party Build and Lease Scheme, where a property fund or developer agrees to build a customised facility for an end-user, to whom it leases the building for an MOP. Both schemes are aimed at helping industrialists to offload assets and lighten their balance sheets.\n\nBefore Nov 15, new JTC lessees (both industrialists and third-party facility providers) were not allowed to assign (sell) their premises until they had fulfilled the investment period (the duration of construction of the industrial facility and installation of plant and machinery). Typically, the investment period spans three years.\n\nFollowing the policy revision, JTC has lengthened this \"assignment prohibition period\" by five years.\n\nAs for those buying JTC facilities from the secondary market, the ban on selling the property used to be three years from the date of assignment previously. Effective Nov 15, the sale-ban period is five years in the case of properties with up to 30 years' remaining lease, and 10 years for properties that have more than 30 years' balance lease.\n\nHowever, an industrialist that needs to offload its property may still do so under the Sale and Leaseback Scheme, subject to fulfilling an MOP. This used to be three years from the assignment date. From Nov 15, this period has been lengthened to five years from the assignment date in the case of properties on sites with up to 30 years' balance lease, and to 10 years from the assignment date for properties with more than 30 years' remaining lease.\n\nJTC has also increased the MOP for new anchor tenants in the Third-Party Build and Lease Scheme. Before Nov 15, this was three years following the issue of the Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) of the building. With the revised policy, JTC has lengthened the MOP to five years after the investment period.\n\nThe revisions in the assignment prohibition period and MOP are applicable to all new and renewed contracts for JTC facilities on lease, as well as new assignments, issued from Nov 15. Existing contracts will not be affected.\n\nAnother change is that all owners of industrial premises on JTC-leased sites with less than five years' balance lease are no longer allowed to sell them. Previously, the sale ban applied to leases below three years.\n\nJTC said that based on its engagement with third-party facility providers, they are generally receptive of the longer prohibition period for lease assignments as well as the longer MOP for anchor tenants. \"Third-party facility providers such as Reits are long-term investors, and hence the extended prohibition period is not an issue with them,\" it added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The acquisition of Gloria Jean's Coffees is an exciting opportunity for GYP to acquire a leading global coffee business with tremendous growth potential,\" said Mah Bow Tan, non-executive chairman of GYP.\n\n\"The coffee-drinking culture is growing fast in many Asian countries and we believe that this acquisition will provide GYP with a platform to tap into this growing trend in Asia, especially China.\"\n\nThe proposed acquisition and the rights issue are subject to GYP shareholders' approval at a general meeting to be convened.\n\nGYP's counter closed half a cent higher at 9.4 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
