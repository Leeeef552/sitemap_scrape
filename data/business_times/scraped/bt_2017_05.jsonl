We have many different options to do this,\" Mr Hoettges told investors. \"We decide what, when, and how.\" The comments are the clearest assertion yet that Deutsche Telekom is no seller and prefers to use T-Mobile US as a launchpad to grow its US presence in any deal negotiations. T-Mobile US has become the key growth driver for the Bonn-based carrier, and Mr Hoettges recently called it his \"kingmaker asset.\" Deutsche Telekom rose as much as 1.1 per cent Thursday in Frankfurt, and was up 0.3 per cent to 17.84 euros in afternoon trading. T-Mobile US declined 0.3 per cent to $66.9 a share, as of 11.16 pm in New York. Shares of the U. carrier, about 64 per cent owned by Deutsche Telekom, have more than doubled since the start of 2015, giving it a market value of about US$55.6 billion.\n\nT-Mobile executives have talked up possibilities of merging with Sprint Corp, which is controlled by Japan's SoftbankGroup Corp, to create a stronger competitor to Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. Analysts have also pointed to potential coalitions with cable companies or even larger technology players such as Amazon.com Inc that may want to control distribution as the internet becomes more mobile.\n\nIn the UK, things are going less smoothly with Deutsche Telekom's 12 per cent stake in BT Group Plc losing 2.2 billion euros (S$3.42 billion) in value last year. Shares of the British carrier have declined 31 per cent in the past year after it got entangled in an accounting scandal in Italy, leading to a writedown and contributing to a reduced profit outlook. The company is also struggling with a pension shortfall and deteriorating IT-services business.\n\nMr Hoettges said BT was hurt by the UK's decision to leave the European Union and a resulting drop in the pound. He reiterated Deutsche Telekom's commitment to the carrier, saying the financial stake \"is the right strategic step\" because of the British company's leading position when it comes to wireless, business customers and TV.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

A break of US$0.7370 would test a trough of US$0.7329 touched last month.\n\nThe Aussie dropped around half a US cent after a disappointing economic report from China, Australia's top export market.\n\nA private survey of China's manufacturing activity contracted in May for the first time in nearly a year. That contrasted with an official survey released on Wednesday showing activity remained in expansionary territory.\n\n\"AUD was enjoying a surprise rebound from retail sales today, for all of a couple of minutes before China's manufacturing PMI spoiled the party,\" said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at ThinkMarkets.\n\nEarlier in the session, domestic retail sales posted their best monthly sales in nearly three years in April with a rise of one per cent, versus forecasts of a gain of 0.3 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the euro extended its rise, scaling a one-year high of A$1.5225. The common currency clocked a gain of more than 4 per cent in May for the second consecutive month. A break of A$1.5363 would target the May 2016 high of A$1.5644.\n\nThe Aussie fell hard against the safe-haven Swiss franc to stand near one-year lows.\n\nAcross the Tasman sea, the New Zealand dollar slipped to US$0.7076, away from a three-month high of US$0.7124 hit overnight.\n\nIt also lost ground against a sturdy euro which bounced to NZ$1.5916, from Wednesday's low just under NZ$1.5700.\n\nData at home showed terms of trade jumped 5.1 per cent to the highest level since June 1973.\n\nNew Zealand government bonds gained, sending yields 2.5 basis points lower at the long end of the curve.\n\nAustralian government bond futures held firm near six-month highs, with the three-year bond contract unchanged at 98.330.

Mr Loh said a poll of the accredited companies found that four or five are considering exit options, which could include IPOs.\n\nGiving the exchange and industry players a channel to tech companies will keep Singapore on the radar when these companies think about listing, said OCBC head of corporate finance David Cheng. \"The partnership gives Singapore home-grown companies or appropriate regional companies more impetus to list in Singapore, where investors are more familiar with their name, product and business model, rather than having to venture overseas for an IPO,\" he said.\n\nThe initiative is part of SGX's broader technology-sector strategy, which chief executive Loh Boon Chye highlighted as an area of priority shortly after taking over the reins in 2015. SGX head of equities and fixed income Chew Sutat noted that SGX has run a series of investor-education workshops on the tech sector, and has invested in early-stage equity raising platform CapBridge and supported crowdfinancing platform FundedHere. It is considering allowing the listing of dual-class share structures.\n\nIn the recommendations of Singapore's Committee on the Future Economy, SGX is also part of an industry group looking into the possibility of creating a private market platform; industry sources say more tie-ups with other government agencies could be in the works.\n\nThe strategy is bearing some early fruit. Already, US-based biotech Liquidia Technologies is believed to be seeking a Singapore listing this year, and more tech companies are in the pipeline. Mr Chew said: \"We have a healthy pipeline of IPOs that will come onstream in the coming months, including listings from the tech sector - in the data analytics and fintech space.\"\n\nObservers believe SGX is moving in the right general direction, although they say actually sealing the deal will be difficult.\n\nPeng T Ong, managing director of venture fund Monk's Hill Ventures, said New York has such a stranglehold on tech IPOs that every other exchange may as well just throw in the towel when it comes to the public arena. \"Almost all Chinese companies look at Nasdaq and the NYSE. The reason is very simple. The expertise on tech is there, the analysts, the coverage, the valuations . . . Is there room for more than one public market for the large-scale companies? Right now the answer looks like 'No'.\"\n\nStart-up stock exchanges outside of the US are thus experiencing high volatility as investors struggle to understand new-economy businesses, he said. Even Hong Kong is struggling to break into the tech space - and its market capitalisation is many times larger than that of Singapore's.\n\nMr Ong suggested that Singapore may have more success in the private market, but the challenge there is in identifying the right problem and creating the right solution. He said he would benefit from having more liquidity in the private markets, but was struggling to see out how that liquidity could be achieved without having a detrimental rise in volatility.\n\nCIMB analyst Jessalynn Chen described the strategy as one that may take time to fully develop. She said that SGX's competition is vying for a slice of the same pie, and while capturing tech IPOs will boost liquidity, SGX has a host of other challenges it must also address. \"They need to employ more strategies than just IPO, but at least this is a step in the right direction,\" she said.\n\nDBS Bank head of capital markets Tan Jeh Wuan said SGX will also have to fight off well-endowed private equity and wealthy individuals, who increasingly offer funding without the need to list. All of those challenges notwithstanding, the tech space is one that SGX cannot afford to neglect, Mr Tan said. \"It is a sector that SGX cannot ignore, given that the number and size of tech start-ups are growing rapidly,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Close to 700 architects and professional engineers attended the event.\n\nHe explained that most of Singapore's contractual arrangements reflect current work processes, where the risks are passed down the chain from developer to consultants and then to the contractors.\n\n\"Other countries are trying out different models; in the US, we see examples of integrated project delivery where all parties come together at the start to conceptualise the project,\" he said.\n\nHe added that a more collaborative approach to construction was needed. \"There is a risk of working in silos and not coordinating effectively,\" he said.\n\nIf the plans are not specified properly or if work needs to be aborted, it could lead to inefficiencies, duplication of effort and wastage, he added.\n\nThis was among the ideas that Mr Wong highlighted on Wednesday as the government studies how to transform the built environment sector.\n\nHe added that the government is also looking at how to place greater emphasis on quality assessments and productivity instead of price for tenders and it will look at penalising firms with a record of poor performance and disqualify them from participating in tenders.\n\n\"We want to have a more balanced quality and provide greater rewards for firms that deliver higher quality work... These ideas will not be implemented so quickly as the agencies still need some time, but I want to share with the industry so you know we are taking this seriously,\" said Mr Wong.\n\nAnother plan is for the use of digital building tools such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) to facilitate collaboration. Using BIM, all stakeholders, including contractors, can access a digital simulation of the project and flag design problems earlier.\n\nThe conference was held in reaction to recent challenges faced by the construction consultancy sector, including the current trough in the property market, the manpower crunch and the growing need for consultants to be multi-disciplinary, said BOA president Mr Tan Shao Yen.\n\nSaid Mr Tan: \"Industry stakeholders must be prepared to unlearn the way they have been doing things and start to understand the world of technology and IT, developing them into our core competencies.\" STONLINE\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Proceeds will benefit victims of last week's suicide bombing at Grande's show at another venue in the northern English city, the Manchester Arena.\n\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for the bombing, which killed 22 people and took place moments after Grande finished playing.\n\nAll proceeds from Sunday's One Love Manchester concert will go to the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund which was set up by the Manchester City Council in partnership with the British Red Cross.\n\nThe fund has already raised more than \u00a35 million (S$8.9 million), organisers say.\n\nGrande, 23, is offering free tickets to the charity concert to all of those who were at her Manchester show on May 22. The suicide bombing injured more than 100, many of them members of Grande's large, young female fan base. Grande was unharmed but she later cancelled several concerts scheduled in London and Europe till June 5.\n\nSunday's show will be broadcast live by BBC television and radio, Tuesday's statement said.\n\nGrande said in an open letter on her social media accounts last week that: \"There is nothing I or anyone can do to take away the pain you (her fans) are feeling or to make this better.\n\n\"However, I extend my hand and heart and everything I possibly can give to you and yours, should you want or need my help in any way. We will not quit or operate in fear. We won't let this divide us. We won't let hate win,\" she added.\n\nTickets for Sunday's concert will go on sale on Thursday.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/sti-etf-possible-springboard-starter-investors", "site_title": "STI ETF a possible springboard for starter investors", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSTI ETF a possible springboard for starter investors\n\nPublished Wed, May 31, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nStocks\n\nFollow\n\n15-year % returns\n\nPASSIVE investors, in their search for equity investment ideas, are often led to this instrument known as the exchange traded fund (ETF), an open-ended investment fund that aims to replicate the performance of a published market index.\n\nSingapore Exchange (SGX) defines an ETF this way: It is listed and traded on a stock exchange, and investors may buy or sell ETF units to participate in the performance of the underlying index which tracks equities, fixed income, commodities or money market instruments.\n\nOn SGX, some 80 ETFs are listed, quite a maze to go through for the starter investor.\n\nFor the passive investor who has decided to give ETFs a shot, a possible good starting point is the SPDR STI ETF.\n\nSPDR is a trademark standing for Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts but often conveniently read as Spider. STI ETF stands for Straits Times Index Exchange Traded Fund.\n\nThe name STI ETF indicates that this ETF is aimed at mirroring the performance of the underlying STI, the benchmark barometer of the Singapore stock market. The STI comprises 30 components representing the top stocks on SGX by market capitalisation.\n\nSo why STI ETF for a start?\n\nFirst, it offers risk diversification - in business sector and geographic terms. Among the STI's current components are Singapore's three banking groups, property heavyweights and Jardine companies. There are also three real estate investment trusts (Reits).\n\nThe breakdown of STI's constituents shows that 34 per cent are banks, 18 per cent are real estate and 14 per cent are capital goods. Also included are consumer staples, telecommunication services and transportation. Unless there is a systemic risk affecting all the sectors at the same time, the advantage of industry diversification is a protection against the cyclical nature of some sectors, such as oil & marine.\n\nIn terms of free-float weighted revenue reach, the bulk comes from Singapore (46 per cent) and the Asia Pacific ex-Singapore (47 per cent).\n\nSecondly, the STI ETF makes it affordable for one to buy into 30 companies representing a broad cross section of business sectors. To buy the 30 stocks individually will mean a big investment outlay.\n\nIn \"Heritage & Highlights of the Straits Times Index\" published on May 15 on SGX's website, it said that the STI ETF yielded a dividend-inclusive return of 190 per cent in Singapore dollar terms over the 15 years since its listing in 2002. The figure was just five percentage points less than that of the STI, which generated a 195 per cent total return (also in Singapore dollar terms) over the same period.\n\nThe SPDR STI ETF beat Japan's Nikkei 225 Index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which yielded a 15-year dividend-inclusive return of 87 per cent and 176 per cent respectively.\n\nPast performances are not necessarily indication of future performances. So it must be noted that the STI ETF, like individual stocks, is subject to the vagaries of market forces. There will inevitably be ups and downs along the way.\n\nFor further protection, the starter passive investor can employ dollar-cost averaging, an investment technique involving buying a fixed dollar amount of a particular investment on a regular schedule, regardless of the share price. The investor purchases more units when prices are low and fewer units when prices are high, resulting in a lower average cost over time. This means the investor is diversified across time as well.\n\nTo quote an example from the SGX, applying month-end STI ETF prices, and a fixed investment of S$1,000 every month, the investor would have purchased 373 units of the STI ETF in January 2016 when the units were priced at S$2.68.\n\nConversely, when the STI ETF units were priced at S$3.57 in April 2015, the investor would have purchased 280 units. Since January 2016 is near market lows, this means that the investor purchased one-third more units. The example is for education purposes only and does not include transaction costs, said SGX.\n\nSome banks and stockbrokers in Singapore have regular shares savings plans starting from S$100 a month. There is also another STI-based ETF known as the Nikko AM Singapore STI ETF, which was listed on SGX in 2009.\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett once said: \"By periodically investing in an index fund . . . the know-nothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals.\"\n\nNo one knows for sure how it will pan out in the case of STI ETFs. Although there are reasonable yields from dividends in the short term, the STI ETF is an instrument for potential long term gains, which may suit passive investors with little time to do their investment homework.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But Mr Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist in 1995 and another, far more violent intifada broke out in 2000.\n\nMr Netanyahu's current government is seen as the most right-wing in Israel's history, and the influence of the country's pro-peace camp has severely waned.\n\nOn the Palestinian side, Mr Abbas is 82 and unpopular. His rival Hamas has sought to soften its image but remains firm in its position that it will not recognise Israel.\n\nPeace efforts have meanwhile gone nowhere since a US-led initiative collapsed in April 2014.\n\nA recent survey said 78 per cent of Israelis think there is no chance of a peace agreement in the foreseeable future.\n\nAnother poll found 60 per cent of Palestinians believe the two-state solution is no longer viable.

The transactions involved affiliates in Europe that failed to provide \"accurate and complete information\", the regulator added.\n\nWhile the Fed didn't disclose any specific transactions that were improper, Deutsche Bank has faced multiple investigations by various regulators into whether it allowed customers to engage in illicit trades.\n\nDeutsche Bank has recently reached settlements with the UK and New York State's Department of Financial Services over trades that allegedly helped wealthy Russians move some US$10 billion out of the country. The settlements involved what are known as \"mirror trades\", in which bankers purchased Russian stocks in roubles while selling the same amount of shares in London.\n\nThe trades effectively converted roubles to dollars, and the cash flowed from the UK through Cyprus, Estonia and the US, investigators say. The deficiencies cited by the Fed include controls over transactions like mirror trades, said one person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nIn its settlement with the Fed, Deutsche Bank agreed to enlist an outside monitor to review transactions with international banks in the second half of 2016 - a time frame that could expand depending on the monitor's findings. The bank also agreed for the outside monitor to review its compliance with anti-money laundering laws.

According to previous government estimates, the sale may raise about 3 billion euros (S$4.65 billion).\n\n\"The strong progress made by AIB and current market conditions mean that now is the right time to commence this process,\" Irish Finance Minister Michael Noonan said in the statement. \"Today's decision is a significant step in the continued normalization of the state's involvement in Ireland's banking system.\" The state, which spent 21 billion euros bailing out the bank following the 2008 financial crisis, is seeking to recoup part of its investment in the first of a series of stake sales. The offering will likely be London's largest IPO so far this year. Ireland's government owns 99.9 per cent of AIB, and Noonan has said it may take a decade to fully privatize the lender.\n\nThe agency that manages the government's shareholding, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, valued AIB at 11.3 billion euros in February. Government officials now expect the bank to be worth more than that after the lender released its 2016 results, including a pretax profit of 1.7 billion euros and a reinstated dividend.\n\nA valuation at 12 billion euros would suggest a price of about 4.50 euros per share. The pricing will be finalized after the UK's election on June 8. Including the so-called greenshoe option, about 27 per cent of the lender could be sold.

The port authority finally authorised the ship's departure on May 26.\n\nKorean Register, the agency responsible for regularly surveying the Stellar Queen, said last week that the ship underwent a survey and was being repaired in Brazil at the request of the owner. Vale declined to comment on the delays.\n\nA third vessel carrying Vale iron ore, the Stellar Unicorn, was also forced to have repairs after a crack was discovered on the outer hull of a tank in April, its owner said at the time. That vessel was surveyed before moving on to China for discharge, according to Korean Register.\n\nAll three vessels are more than 20-year-old dry-bulk carriers owned and operated by Polaris Shipping Co and all were converted from crude-oil tankers. Seoul-based Polaris didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Stellar Daisy went missing about 2,700 kilometres off the coast of Uruguay while carrying 260,000 tonnes of iron ore, Polaris said in a statement on April 7. All but two members of the crew are presumed dead. Polaris hasn't officially said what caused the accident.\n\n\"Two crew members who are confirmed to be Philippine nationals have safely been recovered and are being repatriated to their families,\" Polaris said in the statement.\n\nThe survivors told the authorities that the vessel had broken in two, according to reports in April.\n\nThe Stellar ships are so-called Very Large Ore Carriers, or VLOCs, that were converted from crude-oil carriers. Polaris, which calls itself the largest VLOC company, said in April that it had initiated an internal inspection of all 18 VLOC vessels in its fleet, and would subject each to an independent inspection.\n\n\"Polaris Shipping is fully committed to ensuring the safety of its VLOC converted fleet and their crews following the loss of the Stellar Daisy,\" the company said on its website.\n\nThe press office from Vale, which also uses giant so-called Valemax ships to transport ore, said that investigations into the Stellar Daisy's sinking are being conducted by the competent authorities.\n\nThe conversion of single-hull crude carriers into VLOCs \"was an attractive option as it extended the assets' life by at least 10 years, especially during the mid to late-2000s, when dry bulk rates were elevated\", according to BI senior analyst Lee Klaskow.\n\n\"A number of issues with Polaris Shipping's fleet could have a ripple effect on dry-bulk rates if not swiftly rectified,\" he said in a May 14 note.\n\nPolaris was reportedly planning an initial public offering this year, Mr Klaskow said, but now \"any offering will likely be pushed out until the issues facing its fleet are addressed\". The company didn't respond to a request for comment on IPO plans.\n\nThe disappearance of the Stellar Daisy and news reports of inspections on other VLOCs has raised concerns about similar ships.\n\n\"It's my opinion that all converted VLOCs, regardless of owner, should not be used until a very thorough examination of all of these vessels in circulation is first completed,\" Jeffrey Landsberg, a dry-bulk shipping researcher and consultant for Commodore Research, said last week by e-mail.

They insist that at the minimum, the White House should revoke Mr Kushner's top security clearance and ask him to take leave of absence from his job until the ongoing investigations of the Russian connection issue reach their conclusion, which could take months or maybe even years.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/3e86f319ff08467c13d0a1f0598d2e1b784f559e307970c8ed6be33c71a5943b?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Some of Mr Trump's critics are raising accusations of \"treason\" against Mr Kushner and are calling for his firing."}]}

According to the model, the Conservatives could lose 20 seats to 310 MPs and Labour could gain 28 when the election takes place on June 8. The pound which has also weakened against the euro and Singapore dollar in recent days, recovered slightly from its day lows, because YouGov executives admitted that the result allowed for a wide margin of error.\n\nThe projection allows for big variations and suggests that the Tories could get as many as 345 seats on a reasonable result, 15 more than at present, and as few as 274 seats on a bad night.\n\nSterling is still higher than its 2017 low of US$1.20 against the US dollar, since other pollsters' surveys still indicate that premier Theresa May and her party will still achieve big gains.\n\nComRes forecasts a 100-seat Conservative majority; an ICM poll released yesterday forecast a Tory majority of 76 and the spread-betting company IG Index suggested that the Tories would win 378 seats.\n\nRegardless of the election results, currency forecasters believe that the pound will remain depressed because the coming Brexit negotiations will be uncertain.\n\nSterling has devalued considerably since the June 2016 Brexit referendum and is down by 12 per cent against the US dollar and Singapore dollar and by 10 per cent against the euro.\n\nSince a large proportion of companies in the FTSE 100 index earn a sizeable proportion of their earnings in dollars and other foreign currencies and are also exporters, the index traded at 7,545 points, up 6.2 per cent this year.\n\nThe FTSE 250 mid cap index of mainly local companies, however, also ignored the YouGov poll.\n\nAnalysts say that this indicates that investors believe that voters will reject the extreme-left high corporate and individual taxation policies of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nMarket bulls also note that the polls are saying that voters are more confident about Mrs May's security policies than those of Mr Corbyn's. Since the beginning of 2017, the FTSE 250 index has risen by 11.1 per cent.\n\nCautious analysts caution that the London stock market is not reflecting relatively slack performance of the UK economy. First quarter UK economic growth dipped more than expected, decelerating sharply to a quarterly pace of 0.2 per cent from 0.7 per cent at the start of the year. This is the worst quarterly reading in 12 months.\n\nDespite the pound devaluation, Britain's month on month industrial production fell by 0.5 per cent in March, with manufacturing slipping by 0.6 per cent. This was worse than forecasts and the third consecutive month of declines in both sectors.\n\nThe economy is also weaker because highly indebted consumers are cutting back on spending.\n\nDisposable income has fallen as income increases aren't matching consumer price inflation of 2.7 per cent, economists say. Wages are still 2.3 per cent lower on average than last year after a weak 12 months, according to official figures for March.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/a7549ebe4db1d2e4a69c434978fd8cbb73f20a84ca632259e4fb34815d16888c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Analysts say that investors believe that voters will reject the extreme-left high corporate and individual taxation policies of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn (above).

Other Chinese investments included Kweichow Moutai, which makes high-end spirits, and India's Eicher Motors, owner of the Royal Enfield motorcycle brand.\n\nMr Speetjens shared his views in an interview on a trip to Singapore this month.\n\nWhat is your current investment strategy?\n\n\"We have identified three main longer-term trends: digital consumption, spending money on strong brands, and the rising emerging-market middle class. We tend to look for the structural winners, the best-positioned companies within their industries. Especially in consumer industries, you do see that normally the No. 1 and No. 2 players take the majority of the profits or the value creation.''\n\nThe ways to approach these trends differ over time, Mr Speetjens said. \"In digital consumption, the best way to benefit from that trend five years ago was buying the hardware companies. As this market has become fully mature and commoditised, most of the money, incrementally, is now being made by the software or internet providers.\"\n\nAround 20 to 25 per cent of Robeco's consumer fund is invested in emerging markets, with almost all of that in Asia, Mr Speetjens said.\n\nThe fund has further exposure to the region as some of its US holdings have significant sales there. It has no investments in Southeast Asia because of a lack of liquidity in that area's consumer stocks.\n\nWhat types of companies do you like in Asia at the moment?\n\nIn China, Robeco likes branded companies within the local market that have good differentiated products.\n\n\"You can see this in businesses like kitchen appliances, where people are really starting with a basic oven and are trading up to a more premium brand. Five to 10 years ago, people just bought what was necessary - now they want to have a good brand as well.\"\n\nIn South Korea, one of the sectors Robeco has always liked is cosmetics.\n\n\"You do see that there are a couple of companies that have strong brand appeal, which have been doing really well in the travel market, but the recent tension between China and Korea has hurt sentiment around these stocks, and also sales as well. These are companies with strong brands, high returns and high free cash flows.\"\n\nIn India, \"one of the things we really like a lot is the motorcycle market. You do see the motorcycle market is much bigger than the car market because of infrastructure. And also there you see there's a strong move toward premiumization.\"\n\nOther Asian holdings in Robeco's consumer fund at the end of March included: Ctrip.com International, a Chinese travel company listed in the US, casino operator Sands China, Yunnan Baiyao Group, which makes traditional Chinese medicines, and Hangzhou Robam Appliances.\n\nWhat's different about the Asian consumer landscape?\n\n\"Where Asia, and especially China, is really leading, is in the whole online adoption. If you look at e-commerce penetration in China, that's ahead of many western markets. The same holds true for Korea because of the high-speed internet being available. That has a major impact on the distribution of products.''\n\n\"There's a lot of talk about what's the next big thing after social media and internet. And of course we're all looking at augmented reality, virtual reality. What really strikes me is the Chinese are leading the world here. If you look at artificial intelligence patents being filed, Beijing is really leading Silicon Valley at this point.''\n\n\"What's really different, but it's more political or structural, especially in the internet space, you have very dominant players. In the past, the western players had the best brands, and now the locals are fighting back.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

He says smaller firms that become tax-compliant due to the levy, scheduled for implementation on July 1, will be more inclined to go public because they'll no longer have anything to hide. Some 1,000 companies will list on his bourse over the next four years, he estimates.\n\n\"We have only scratched the surface,\" the head of the Deutsche Boerse AG-backed BSE said in an interview in the old business district of Mumbai. Some 74 companies raised 276 billion rupees (S$5.9 billion) through first-time share sales on the BSE in the year ended March, the highest since 2010, according to the exchange. \"We expect a huge spurt in listings.\" Investors and analysts have been debating how the country's biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947 will impact the country's markets, with some predicting that the GST will face teething problems. While the levy is widely projected to boost government revenue and increase the ease of doing business in the world's largest democracy, attention is also focusing on less obvious outcomes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's policy.\n\n\"A lot of things are going to happen - we don't know what,\" Raamdeo Agrawal, joint managing director at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said in an interview in Mumbai. \"But it is a huge positive development. It will have short-term hiccups for six months or so. But once it is done and people have accepted it, then the control of the economy will become far better.\" The company's money-management unit has $3.6 billion in assets.\n\nOnce the landmark tax takes effect, an estimated 51 million smaller firms that currently do much of their business in cash will have to keep digital records, making it harder for them to under-report revenue. That means there will no longer be an incentive for them to avoid listing, Mr Chauhan said.\n\nBSE aims to help companies raise US$100 billion annually over the next four years from initial and secondary offerings of stocks and bonds, up from the present US$30 billion a year, Mr Chauhan, 49, said. The exchange, which traces its roots to the 1850s, is also seeking to increase its registered investor base to 100 million people in five years from the present 34 million, he said.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/23bef0c4cdb7b3c3522190be76931a27e040bd66806b880904165676ecdae63b?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "India's introduction of a single nationwide goods and services tax may have an unexpected consequence: prompting more companies to sell shares to the public."}]}

M1 shares have risen 14 per cent this year, giving the company a market value of about S$2.1 billion.\n\nWarburg Pincus had earlier expressed interest in M1, though the private equity firm is no longer pursuing a deal, the people said. Shanxi Meijin Energy Co and China Broadband Capital also submitted first-round offers for Singapore's third-largest carrier, people with knowledge of the matter said last month.\n\nThere's no certainty the deliberations will result in a transaction, and M1's major shareholders may decide not to sell their stakes if the offers aren't satisfactory, according to the people.\n\nMyRepublic, led by former StarHub Ltd. executive Malcolm Rodrigues, sought last year to become Singapore's fourth wireless carrier with a pledge to offer unlimited data plans. At the time, it had hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc and DBS Group Holdings Ltd to help raise S$250 million for its bid. TPG Telecom Ltd eventually won the spectrum auction in December with a S$105 million offer, entering a market that has one of the world's deepest penetration rates.\n\nM1's largest owners Axiata Group Bhd, Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation Ltd and Singapore Press Holdings Ltd said in March they appointed Morgan Stanley for a strategic review of their stakes in the company.

But then on Saturday morning, a brief power surge knocked out British Airways' communications systems, grounding the carrier's entire London operations, leading to days of chaos and putting the new chief executive officer in the hot seat. A full flight schedule was expected to resume on Tuesday.\n\nWith nearly 600 flights cancelled and luggage unable to be dispersed, images and horror stories quickly coursed through social media. Damages for rebooking and compensating customers is estimated at about 100 million euros (S$154.67 million), or about 3 per cent of the annual operating profit of parent IAG SA.\n\nThe image damage could be even greater as British Airways appears to have no idea how it all happened. \"We're absolutely committed to finding out the root causes of this particular event,\" a grim looking Alex Cruz, the airlines' CEO, told Sky Television. He did, however, rule out a cyberattack, which suggests the faults are homegrown.\n\nThe airline's communications systems were working again and British Airways would run full flight schedules at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports on May 30, it said in an e-mailed statement.\n\n\"It is tempting but increasingly questionable to view this as a one-off,\" said Damian Brewer, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. \"Coming after a spate of other issues, the bad PR and potential reputational aftermath will likely hit future revenues beyond the likely material impact.\"\n\nThe UK carrier is still processing thousands of passengers who missed flights or lost their luggage. The airline said that about 75,000 people were affected, while analysts said the number was likely to be closer to 170,000.\n\nAbout 95 per cent of flights were running, and more than two-thirds of the 75,000 affected passengers would reach their final destination by the end of the day, Mr Cruz said in a YouTube message posted on Mon-day.\n\nThe crisis puts the spotlight on Mr Cruz, who took charge a year ago after running IAG's Spanish budget unit Vueling for more than nine years. While Mr Cruz helped Vueling to expand into Spain's second-biggest airline, the airline suffered repeated flight cancellations and delays last summer due to a lack of available aircraft and crews. Vueling was the only airline in IAG's portfolio where profit declined last year.\n\nHis four-year cost-cutting programme at BA includes eliminating almost 700 back-office jobs, outsourcing some technology operations and switching to paid-for food on short-haul flights. The excessive focus on costs is to blame for the latest mess, according to the GMB union.\n\n\"They started on this journey to outsource and offshore this work and there have been a number of incidents now that have culminated in what has taken place this weekend,\" Mick Rix, national officer for civil aviation at GMB, said on Monday.\n\nFor passengers, workers and tabloids that have criticised the industry's ruthless cost reductions for years, the disruptions seemed to prove that airlines have gone too far.\n\nThe Daily Mail blamed Mr Cruz and chastised his methods at Vueling, where he outlawed colour printing, banned paper towels from washrooms and offered visitors to business meetings only tap water. Critics on social media, meanwhile, questioned whether British Airways deserved to claim itself as the UK's flag carrier after the perpetual cutbacks.\n\nMr Cruz and the airline were keen to distance themselves from any notion that penny pinching led to the meltdown, saying instead that the outage was caused by damage at UK data centres, where work wasn't outsourced.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/ex-ubs-bankers-parents-bought-china-ipos-he-helped-arrange", "site_title": "Ex-UBS banker's parents bought into China IPOs he helped arrange", "publish_date": null, "content": "Ex-UBS banker's parents bought into China IPOs he helped arrange\n\nPublished\n\nWed, May 31, 2017 \u00b7 01:18 AM\n\nUBS\n\nFollow\n\n[HONG KONG] A former UBS Group AG investment banker was linked to several Hong Kong initial public offerings over the past two years in which his parents featured as investors.\n\nThe banker is Calvin Choi, who left his job as a managing director at UBS in January 2016 to become chief executive of boutique advisory firm AMTD Group Co. UBS has reported one such case to Hong Kong's securities regulator after determining that Choi may have breached internal compliance rules, a person with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nIn 2015, Choi was the lead banker for UBS on an IPO by Xinte Energy Co, two people familiar with the deal said.\n\nA company in which his father was a shareholder invested in Xinte before its IPO, the people said, asking not to be named discussing private information.\n\nA firm linked to his mother was a cornerstone investor, documents examined by Bloomberg show. After Choi joined AMTD, it worked on at least two other IPOs where one or both firms linked to Choi's parents were investors. Shares in the companies are trading below their offer prices.\n\nHong Kong listing rules don't bar investment bankers from working on IPOs of companies in which family members own stakes or plan to invest in, or require them to report such relationships.\n\nNEGATIVE CONFIRMATION\n\nYet omitting such information from share-sale prospectuses means other investors aren't \"getting the full picture\" of the company's dealings, said David Webb, a former elected independent director of Hong Kong's stock exchange's owner. Mr Webb, who spoke in general terms, said cornerstone investors should be asked to sign assurances that they're not related to anyone involved in the deal - a safeguard known as negative confirmation.\n\nMost banks require employees to disclose such ties internally in order to avoid potential conflicts of interest.\n\nIn the Xinte Energy case, Choi didn't report his parents' involvement to UBS, something its compliance rules required him to do, one of the people said. AMTD, the firm Choi joined after leaving UBS, also worked on the Xinte Energy sale.\n\nChoi didn't reply to phone calls, text messages and an email seeking comment, and his parents couldn't be reached. A spokesman for UBS declined to comment. A spokesman for Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission declined to comment on whether the regulator is investigating.\n\nCornerstone Mother Choi's father, Choi Kwok Kei, held a stake in Cayman Islands-registered LR Capital Management Co, which through a wholly owned unit invested 500 million yuan (S$110.9 million at the time) in Xinte Energy a few months before its December 2015 IPO, according to the people.\n\nIn addition, a firm linked to Choi's mother bought US$30 million of stock in the Chinese maker of solar grade polysilicon as a cornerstone investor, share-sale documents show. The IPO prospectus lists Chan Mei Ching as a 47 per cent owner of the firm that controlled the cornerstone buyer, Cayman Islands-registered LRC. Belt and Road Investment Ltd.\n\nChoi's birth certificate lists a Chan Mei Ching as his mother and a Choi Kwok Kei as his father.\n\nHong Kong-based AMTD, founded in 2003, is controlled by L.R. Capital, the firm Choi's father has owned a stake in. AMTD representatives weren't available to comment on the firm's policies.\n\nAMTD's Backers A Morgan Stanley private equity fund, China Minsheng Investment Group and billionaire Li Ka-shing's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. are also investors in AMTD, according to a bond sale prospectus from March 2016. Morgan Stanley sold most of its stake to LR Capital in 2015.\n\nAMTD deals linked to Choi's parents: China Logistics Property Holdings Co (July 2016): Belt and Road was one of four cornerstone investors, buying US$20 million of stock. Another cornerstone investor was China Fintech Investment Co., a company in which LR Capital owns a stake.\n\nBank of Tianjin Co (March 2016): Belt and Road was an \"anchor investor\" in the Chinese lender's US$990 million IPO, according to AMTD's website. The website doesn't say how much Belt and Road invested, and the investment wasn't mentioned in Bank of Tianjin's IPO prospectus.\n\nCornerstone investors receive early guaranteed allocations in Hong Kong IPOs and typically agree to hold the shares for at least six months, while anchor investors generally buy smaller stakes and aren't subject to a lockup.\n\nIt wasn't clear whether Choi, 38, directly worked on the China Logistics and Bank of Tianjin offerings. AMTD had 147 employees at the end of 2015. It managed four IPOs in Hong Kong last year. LR Capital has also invested in other Hong Kong IPOs which neither AMTD or UBS managed.\n\nSHARES FALL\n\nChoi joined UBS in October 2010. At the time of Xinte's IPO, he was a China-focused coverage investment banker. The role entails advising companies on a range of different transactions, from fundraising to acquisitions.\n\nUBS discovered Choi Kwok Kei's ownership in LR Capital by early 2016 when the Zurich-based bank helped arrange a US$500 million bond sale for AMTD, people with knowledge of the matter said. Choi Kwok Kei owned all of MNP P Corp (HK), which held 29 per cent of LR Capital, according to the people. A December filing by MNP with Hong Kong's Companies Registry lists him as a director. The filing doesn't mention his ownership.\n\nThis year, as UBS gathered more information on Calvin Choi's connection with Choi Kwok Kei, the bank decided to report the issue to the SFC to be as transparent as possible, even though it's not required to do so, one of the people said. The person declined to say whether UBS reported Choi's mother's involvement in the Xinte Energy IPO to the regulator.\n\nXinte Energy shares closed at HK$6.80 on Monday, below its HK$8.80 IPO price. Bank of Tianjin and China Logistics have also fallen below their offer prices.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/60bb682e73f25cdf196784d5ef54ea0ef154b950ef058e5edff9b8e2b0568671?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A former UBS Group AG investment banker was linked to several Hong Kong initial public offerings over the past two years in which his parents featured as investors."}]}

Chinese companies poured a record US$14.6 billion of foreign direct investment into South-east Asia in 2015, almost double from the previous year and a gargantuan leap from US$156 million a decade ago, according to Maybank Kim Eng Holdings Ltd.\n\nThey're also diversifying from manufacturing, mining and agriculture into financial and commercial services, such as advertising and travel.\n\nArmed with trillions of dollars of savings, China is rapidly accumulating foreign assets as it transforms into a global power. China is turning its eye to South-east Asia in part to source cheaper manufacturing and partly through President Xi Jinping's plans to recreate the ancient Silk Road trading routes between Asia and Europe.\n\n\"South-east Asia is an attractive FDI destination for China because of its fast-growing and large domestic market,\" Lee Ju Ye, a Maybank economist at Singapore, said in an interview.\n\n\"Countries in this region also need foreign capital to help fund their fiscal and infrastructure investment needs. China brings ready capital and expertise and China's investment will continue growing, boosted by the 'One Belt One Road' initiatives.\"\n\nJust this month, Mr Xi pledged 540 billion yuan (S$109 billion) in financing and encouraged state-run banks to contribute another 300 billion yuan in overseas capital to support his Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nCredit Suisse Group AG estimates the plan could funnel investments worth as much as US$502 billion into 62 countries, including those in South-east Asia, over five years. In the region, China's top investment destination is Singapore.\n\nChina is making inroads on its rivals too. Citigroup Inc research shows Chinese investment into the five largest South-east Asian nations - Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines - climbed to US$13.5 billion last year, exceeding flows from Japan for the first time. In the 10-member Association of South-east Asian Nations, China still has some way to go. The largest source of FDI into Asean in 2015 was South-east Asian countries themselves, according to Maybank.

null, "content": "China to launch cybersecurity law despite concerns\n\nPublished\n\nTue, May 30, 2017 \u00b7 05:11 AM\n\nChina\n\nFollow\n\n[BEIJING] China will implement a controversial cybersecurity law Thursday despite concerns from foreign firms worried about its impact on their ability to do business in the world's second largest economy.\n\nPassed last November, the law is largely aimed at protecting China's networks and private user information at a time when the recent WannaCry ransomware attack showed any country can be vulnerable to cyber threats.\n\nBut companies have pleaded with the government to delay the legislation's implementation amid concerns about unclear provisions and how the law would affect personal information and cloud computing.\n\nThe government appears to still be scrambling to finalise the rules.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Zhao Zeliang, director of the cybersecurity bureau, gathered some 200 representatives from foreign and domestic companies and industry associations at the new headquarters of the Cybersecurity Administration of China (CAC) in Beijing.\n\nThe May 19 discussion centred on a draft of the rules for transferring personal data overseas, participants told AFP.\n\nAttendees received an updated version of the document, as well as Mr Zhao's assurance that regulators would remove some of the language that had received strong objections, they said.\n\nThe new document, obtained by AFP, removed a contentious requirement for companies to store customers' personal data in China.\n\n'Headaches for companies'\n\nBut concerns remain.\n\n\"The regulator is unprepared to enforce the law\" and it is \"very unlikely\" anything will happen on June 1, said one participant, who asked for anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue.\n\nThat impression was only strengthened a few days after the meeting, when authorities issued 21 new draft documents describing national standards on topics from cloud computing to financial data, noting they would be available for public comment until July 7.\n\nMore new drafts, including detailed guidelines on cross-border data transfers, were published Saturday.\n\nIt is \"crystal clear that the regulatory regime is evolving and does not simply switch on like a light June 1\", said Graham Webster, an expert on Sino-US relations at Yale Law School.\n\nBeijing, he said, is \"wrestling with legitimate challenges that every country faces, and... much of the caution and ambiguity comes from a desire to get things right.\"\n\nBut the process is causing \"headaches for companies, Chinese and foreign alike\".\n\nProtecting 'national honour'\n\nChina already has some of the world's tightest controls over web content, protected by what is called \"The Great Firewall\", but even some of its universities and petrol stations were hit by the global ransomware attack in May.\n\nThe draft cybersecurity rules provided at the CAC meeting address only one part of the sweeping law.\n\nThe legislation also bans internet users from publishing a wide variety of information, including anything that damages \"national honour\", \"disturbs economic or social order\" or is aimed at \"overthrowing the socialist system\".\n\nCompanies are worried that the new law could lock them out of the market.\n\nPaul Triolo, a cybersecurity expert at the Eurasia Group, wrote in a research note that regulators will likely introduce \"new hurdles for foreign company compliance and operations\" in industries, such as cloud computing, where China is actively seeking a competitive advantage.\n\nAs a result, \"companies with politically well-connected competitors could see their profile raised for things such as cybersecurity reviews\".\n\nThe European Union Chamber of Commerce, among other groups, has urged Beijing to \"delay the implementation of either the law or its relevant articles\".\n\nIt \"will impose substantial compliance obligations on industry\" and \"cautious, sound, consistent and fully reasoned supporting mechanisms related to its implementation are essential,\" the group said in a statement last week.\n\nThe chamber called on policymakers to follow a \"transparent\" process that will help eliminate \"discriminatory market access barriers\".\n\nWhile there is no indication the law itself will be pushed back, the draft rules distributed at the CAC meeting says companies will have until Dec 31, 2018 to implement some of its requirements.\n\n\"It's been enormously difficult for our companies to prepare for the implementation of the cybersecurity law, because there are so many aspects of the law that are still unclear,\" said Jake Parker, vice-president of the US-China Business Council.\n\n\"There's not enough information for companies to be able to develop internal compliance practices.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore

Twenty assembly members voted against Mr Lee's nomination, two abstained and two votes were disqualified.\n\nA simple majority of votes is required to approve a prime minister designate.\n\nThe presidential Blue House said shortly after the vote that Mr Moon would formally appoint Mr Lee as prime minister later on Wednesday but did not offer any other immediate response to the vote after the results were announced.\n\nMr Lee faced some criticism from lawmakers during his confirmation hearings over residence registration documents that were considered to be intentionally inaccurate. Lawmakers from the opposition Liberty Korea Party had demanded Mr Lee withdraw his name over other allegations, which included tax evasion.\n\nMr Lee denied the allegations.\n\nThe vote was delayed for more than an hour when the ruling party failed to persuade the main opposition party to participate. Such actions are not unusual in South Korea's parliament.\n\nThe Liberty Korea Party eventually boycotted the vote.\n\nThe role of prime minister is largely ceremonial in South Korea, although Mr Moon has vowed to share more power with Mr Lee.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c47dd3d58517c1b9c618ec6556fc2ba5be996686a6178d1c8e1fa1286c12fdc9?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "South Korea's parliament approved President Moon Jae In's selection of Lee Nak Yon as prime minister on Wednesday, backing the former lawmaker and governor of South Jeolla Province to become the first confirmed cabinet nominee under the new leader."}]}

This exceeds the group's 2020 reduction targets of 23 per cent and 20 per cent.\n\nIn its eighth Global Sustainability Report, CapitaLand also said that this amounted to utilities cost avoidance of more than S$108 million for the group since 2009, and helped it to mitigate fluctuations in global utility costs and resource scarcity.\n\nBy end-2016, the group also installed over 80 electric vehicle charging stations in 30 of its properties in Singapore, China, Belgium, Germany and Japan. The total electricity charged at these stations by electric vehicles exceeded 130 megawatt hours, which can be translated to more than 613,000 km travelled by electric vehicles.\n\nIn addition, it has also diverted 4,700 tonnes of recyclable waste from landfills.\n\nOf its buildings, 12 of its Singapore developments have received the Universal Design Mark from Singapore's Building and Construction Authority for their accessible features, with five of its properties receiving the highest accolade of Universal Design Mark Platinum.\n\nOn the human resource front, CapitaLand offers its staff three days of paid volunteer service leave each year, and encourages them to use up all their volunteer leave with a donation to a charity of their choice. In 2016, more than 2,100 employees in CapitaLand properties contributed more than 16,000 volunteer hours.\n\nLim Ming Yan, president & group CEO of CapitaLand, said in his message to stakeholders in the report: \"As a sustainable real estate developer, we want to build a lasting company that adds value to our stakeholders across our diversified global real estate portfolio of integrated developments, shopping malls, serviced residences, offices and homes.\n\n\"Such global developments will spur us to continually strive for operational efficiency, and leverage on innovation to build resilient and sustainable real estate of the future.\"\n\nThe group continued to do well financially even with these investments and efforts, he said.\n\n\"Despite the challenging environment, we continued to deliver a set of resilient and healthy financial results of S$5.3 billion of total revenue and S$2.4 billion of earnings before interest and tax from our continuing operations. The group's return on equity improved to 6.6 per cent, up from 6.1 per cent in 2015.\"\n\nIt cited the challenges that it faces as \"continued geo-political uncertainties and economic headwinds in our core markets Singapore and China\".\n\nThe developer's counter ended two Singapore cents lower at S$3.51 on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Some still have pedals and are propelled by physical force, but the majority are equipped with electric or gas engines.\n\nThe drivers must be licensed and operate within government-defined zones, mainly around scenic downtown lakes.\n\nBut others tinker with their own vehicles and work illegally, without licenses. They are targeted by police officers who accuse them of dangerous driving, traffic disruptions, and tourist scams.\n\nLi Wei is among them. A young father hailing from the impoverished central Henan province, he drives from 8.00 pm until dawn.\n\nWorking in constant fear of being caught by the traffic police, Li speeds up when he sees a uniformed officer.\n\nThe 29-year-old has been caught six times in four years, each time having to pay a fine of 1,000 yuan ($145).\n\nUnlicensed work also carries the risk of having the rickshaw - worth 2,000 yuan ($290)- confiscated.\n\nBut for Li the rewards are worth the gamble. On weekends, he takes home partygoers spilling out of bars, earning 500 yuan ($73) a night.\n\nThough this is a hefty sum in China and his wife also works - she is an assistant at a clothing store - but they can still only afford a tiny, dilapidated apartment in Beijing.\n\nHis father, also a rickshaw driver, lives with them.\n\nIt has been four years since Li first took the job, and he confesses he is already tired of earning a living this way.\n\nBut having worked in factories and restaurants in Shanghai, he concedes that driving for a living is far better.\n\nAsked what he would do instead, if he could, he shrugs his shoulders in defeat.\n\nHe explains: \"I have no idea how I would make a living otherwise.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/48ebea846adc5166e6adbbabe88cbc213e2b23ec2d79cb6207a0e96ae3b5f714?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The makeshift red-canopied vehicles are ubiquitous in Beijing: rickshaws traversing narrow alleyways and skyscraper-lined avenues alike."}]}

That of course is a drag for the euro.\"\n\nItalian banks and blue chip shares fell sharply for a second day before recovering as US and UK investors returned after Monday's holiday.\n\nOther major markets were also deeply in the red, with French shares sinking almost one per cent, prodding investors towards the traditional security of the yen, which gained around 0.3 per cent against the dollar and 0.4 per cent against the euro.\n\nSterling recovered from some early losses to trade 0.2 per cent higher at US$1.2868.\n\nSterling bulls have been unnerved by the shrinking in some polls of Prime Minister Theresa May's lead to as low as 5-6 percentage points, suggesting the landslide she targeted a month ago may now be out of reach.\n\nAnalysts say that will weaken her ability to face down hard line Brexiteers in her Conservative Party. But the prospect of a Labour Party-led government is also creeping onto the agenda.\n\nA left-leaning administration led Jeremy Corbyn might worry debt markets by borrowing and spending more on public finances, but it could also spell a softer Brexit approach.\n\n\"The main reason for the falls is that (with a smaller majority) there would be more political infighting. Maybe May would have to listen to the more extreme views on Brexit,\" said Commerzbank strategist Thu Lan Nguyen.\n\n\"If there really was a good chance that Labour was going to win, I think this could turn around. At this point does Labour have a smarter Brexit plan? I'm not entirely sure.

They will be forced to balance profitability with how much more value they can extract from hiring labour.\n\n\"We were coming into the 2016 slowdown from a relatively weak position already with the restructuring that's going on, so this compounded wage growth pressures\" said Nomura economist Brian Tan. \"Moving into 2017, I won't be too optimistic either.\"\n\nEconomists' comments come after the Ministry of Manpower's (MOM) Manpower Research and Statistics Department released its Report on Wage Practices 2016 on Tuesday. Findings came from a sampling methodology that yielded an effective sample of 4,800 private establishments with at least 10 employees. Together, they employed 1.2 million employees.\n\nJudging from the report findings, 2016 was a year of superlatives - not in a good way. Total wages, including employer CPF, of private-sector employees last year grew at its slowest pace since the financial crisis. It was up by 3.1 per cent in 2016, compared with the 4.9 per cent increase in 2015. The last time the increase was smaller was in 2009 when it actually shrank by 0.4 per cent.\n\nBut these nominal figures do not factor in cost of living, which can eat into the nominal value of paychecks. With overall prices dipping by 0.5 per cent last year, real total wage growth was higher at 3.6 per cent. Yet this was still lower than the 5.4 per cent in 2015, and 3.9 per cent in 2014.\n\n2016's real total wage growth, however, was better than 2013's 2.9 per cent, when prices rose by 2.4 per cent. Even as workers took home more value with their paychecks last year, firms were feeling the squeeze.\n\nFor much of 2016, the economy risked clocking a slower pace of growth than an already subdued 2015.\n\nAs a result, firms saw their margins being squeezed. The proportion of profitable companies dipped to their lowest in more than a decade, according to MOM's report.\n\nSome 75.7 per cent were profitable, while the share was at 79.4 per cent in the throes of the 2009 financial crisis, and at 81.4 per cent in 2006.\n\nOnly 58 per cent of all firms raised total wages last year, down from 64 per cent in 2015.\n\nFor workers, 75 per cent of them saw increase in wages in 2016, down from 77 per cent in 2015.\n\nBut the increase in value derived from each actual hour worked last year did not meet the pace of wage increases. Labour productivity rose by 1.4 per cent in 2016, according to previous data released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).\n\nThis gap crimps companies' profit margins, said ANZ economist Ng Weiwen. \"And in a bad economic climate, businesses will close, workers will get laid off.\"\n\nMoving into 2017, early productivity gains may provide some reprieve to halt the slide in wage growth. First-quarter data showed that labour productivity, when measured as value-added per worker, grew by 2.7 per cent year-on-year, MTI data showed.\n\nBut this may not translate into stronger wage growth this year.\n\nMost of that increase in productivity was driven by gains in the manufacturing sector, said economists. Factories had automated more processes, or deployed advanced technologies to lessen their reliance on labour.\n\n\"It's easier for them to raise productivity because we're talking about advanced manfuacturing - more big machines, technology. Other sectors? I'm not so sure,\" said Nomura's Mr Tan.\n\nAnd as Singapore continues to grind the wheels of economic restructuring to lessen its reliance on labour, economists think that the brakes on wage growth may exacerbate before the transformation is complete.\n\n\"With foreign labour restrictions in place, until the day when the local workforce becomes more productive or there is more automation, there will not be much room for wages to grow,\" said ANZ's Mr Ng.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As key export iron ore tumbles at the fastest pace since 2008, swaps traders have switched from betting the Reserve Bank will raise interest rates by year's end to pricing in about a one in five chance for a cut.\n\nSure, the world's 13th-largest economy hasn't had a recession since 1991. But with interest rates forecast to climb across much of the globe, the prospects for a rate reduction Down Under have fuelled the strongest bond gains among the world's biggest government debt markets. Flagging consumer demand is denting retail stocks and weaker iron ore prices may complicate the government's efforts to boost infrastructure spending.\n\n\"Australia is desynchronising from the global growth uplift,\" said Daniel Blake, Sydney-based strategist at Morgan Stanley.\n\nEquities are lagging behind the rest of the world. The ratio between the S&P/ASX 200 Index and the S&P 500 Index dropped to the lowest since the start of this century. The Australia benchmark is flat this year, compared with a 7.9 per cent gain for the US equities measure. Only shares in Israel have performed worse than Australia among developed markets this year.\n\nThe outlook for the Aussie dollar is worsening and economists are dialling back expectations for growth. Chances are now skewed towards a rate cut, just five months into a year that began with traders inclined to bet on an increase.\n\nThe rally in Australian sovereign debt sent 10-year yields down by 31 basis points over the past three months, the steepest drop among government bond markets of US$500 billion or more. That's weighing on the Aussie as the 10-year yield premium the South Pacific nation's notes offer over similar-dated Treasuries shrank last week to just 16 basis points, near the lowest since 2001. And back then, the currency crashed to an unprecedented 47.76 US cents.\n\nAs consumer sentiment wanes, equities exposed to the sector are getting punished with the purveyors of everything from TVs to home-improvement goods and flights all taking it on the nose.\n\nShort sellers are doubling down on JB Hi-Fi Ltd, a music and electronics goods retailer. Bearish bets have surged tenfold to the highest level since the start of last year. They now stand at about 10 per cent of its shares outstanding.\n\nAnd then there's China, Australia's biggest trading partner and the key consumer for iron ore, the South Pacific nation's largest export. Data this week is forecast to signal Chinese manufacturing weakened for a second month. Optimism that the economy is regaining momentum has faltered as the government moves to curb leverage and Moody's Investors Service cut its rating on China's debt for the first time since 1989. Iron ore prices have displayed a similar trajectory, tumbling from a 21/2-year high of US$95 per tonne reached in February. Prices are down 36 per cent since Feb 28, set for the steepest three-month drop since a 58 per cent collapse through November 2008.\n\nFor all this, the Aussie dollar remains above 74 US cents. Money managers at BlackRock Inc and AMP Capital Investors Ltd agree it should be trading closer to 70 US cents, but that's still significantly higher than when the gap in Australian and US bond yields was last this tight, back in 2001.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/singapore-can-lead-way-chinas-bond-opportunity", "site_title": "Singapore can lead way into China's bond opportunity", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSingapore can lead way into China's bond opportunity\n\nPublished\n\nTue, May 30, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nWITH some markets in a negative interest rate environment amid an uncertain global economy, investors are casting their nets wide in search of ever-elusive yields.\n\nOne asset class gaining significant investor interest is China's US$9 trillion bond market, the world's third largest. Still, of the US$5 trillion in outstanding bond issues, only 3 per cent of onshore bonds are currently owned by foreigners.\n\nBeijing has been keen to tackle this ownership asymmetry as it continues to introduce a broad swathe of structural reforms across asset classes to open up its capital markets. This includes measures aimed specifically at its onshore bond market, which today remains substantially larger than its offshore market.\n\nOnce largely overlooked for fear of market opacity, this investment opportunity is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.\n\nEven as international fund managers weigh the risks of dipping their toes in, Singapore's portfolio managers may have a chance at a jumpstart.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nSingapore's prescience is consistent with its long-standing track record of being a first-mover into China's economy. This has been true since it first established ties in the 1990s and is true now. It has been China's top Foreign Direct Investor for two consecutive years in 2013 and 2014 - reflecting Singapore's role as a hub nation for investment into other Asian markets.\n\nIts status as a financial hub also lends itself to this. Singapore is one of the largest fund management centers in the region reaching a high of S$2.6 trillion in assets under management as at 2015. It is also a major foreign exchange and treasury centre, and today is the third largest offshore renminbi clearing centre in the world.\n\nThe upside potential in China's bond market is manifold.\n\nCompared to developed market government bonds, Chinese government bonds continue to consistently provide better yields with an approximate 100 basis point spread over Singapore government bonds, 100-200bps over US and UK government bonds, and close to 300bps over Japanese and German government bonds.\n\nAnother positive offshoot of this is that Chinese onshore bonds are less closely tied to price movements in other asset classes, including other fixed income instruments in the US and Europe. This potentially provides a good hedge against volatility.\n\nChinese onshore bonds also have good liquidity, which contrary to common misconception, is on par with global peers. While volumes remain lower than in the US, Japan and the eurozone, turnover ratios for government and corporate bonds are healthy.\n\nWhile there are significant opportunities, there are also counter-balancing risks - both real and perceived. When we spoke to market participants in Singapore last year, many remain concerned about the ability to achieve accurate pricing in China's bond market, as well as the true level of credit being created in the market.\n\nIn March this year however, it was revealing that the majority (59 per cent) of offshore market participants in Singapore we surveyed at the Bloomberg 2017 Buy-side Forum say they are actively exploring to invest in China's bond market, while 29 per cent say they are already invested in the market.\n\nTransparency and liberalisation\n\nTechnology could, in part, help allay these long-standing concerns.\n\nAs China's burgeoning interbank bond market continues to open up to foreign participation, global investors need an increasingly sophisticated set of tools to help them gain deeper insight and an edge into its market opportunities. Robust trading workflows, transparent onshore data and sophisticated analytical tools will help buy-side participants determine market risks and opportunities.\n\nIn respond to this need, we recently launched the Bloomberg RMB Bond Suite, giving investors around the world the gold standard in China fixed income trading and investing. We believe the RMB Bond Suite is the industry's most advanced set of fixed income tools for onshore and offshore investors tracking China's bond markets.\n\nHaving the right technology and analytics can contribute to improved market transparency and efficiency in bond pricing for global investors.\n\nMarket pundits are increasingly persuaded by Beijing's commitment to open up its financial markets and address concerns on market transparency. Access to China's bond markets is no longer a barrier and over time, data transparency is not an obstacle.\n\nOver the medium to long term, China's onshore debt will inevitably become a significant part of global fixed income portfolios. As Beijing continues to take concrete steps to create more vibrant, open and transparent bond markets, more international investors are likely to follow Singapore's lead as China's bond market increasingly becomes too big, liquid and important to ignore.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/perpetual-issuance-asia-ex-japan-surges-amid-hot-bond-market", "site_title": "Perpetual issuance in Asia ex-Japan surges amid hot bond market", "publish_date": null, "content": "Perpetual issuance in Asia ex-Japan surges amid hot bond market\n\nPublished\n\nMon, May 29, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nPerpetuals\n\nFollow\n\nIn demand\n\nSingapore\n\nPERPETUALS or bonds with no fixed maturity are going gangbusters amid an overall hot bond market as institutional investors join in the fray.\n\nHistorically, investors in perpetuals were mainly private-bank customers chasing yields, but of late more institutional investors such as fund managers and insurers are willing to buy these hybrid capital instruments, said Clifford Lee, DBS Bank head of fixed income.\n\nBond sales in Asia excluding-Japan year to May 24 at US$125.7 billion are almost double the US$64.5 billion sold in the same period last year. Sales of perpetuals have also surged as demand continues to outstrip supply, notwithstanding the jump in issuance, said Mr Lee. Corporations in Asia excluding-Japan have raised perpetuals worth US$7.36 billion this year (as at May 22), according to Dealogic data, closing in on the US$7.82 billion they issued throughout 2016.\n\nIn the first five months of 2017, Singapore companies have sold perpetuals worth S$2.77 billion, 73 per cent more than the S$1.6 billion in the same 2016 period.\n\nSaid Todd Schubert, Bank of Singapore head of fixed income research: \"For the issuer, the impetus to issue perpetual bonds is the ability to lock in cheap funding for long periods of time (conceptually forever) in the early period of what is expected to be a prolonged cycle of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.\"\n\n\"For investors, perpetual bonds provide some incremental yield in a low-spread environment,\" said Mr Schubert.\n\nPrivate bank customers hungry for yield in the past have accounted for as much as 90 per cent of a perpetual issue.\n\nPerpetuals offer higher yield, or a richer coupon, because they may never be redeemed by the issuer. Most do contain a call date though, where the issuer has the option to redeem the issue. Perpetuals are also often unrated.\n\nCompanies sell perpetuals even though they have to offer higher yield because they qualify as equity; this means the issuers are able to take on more gearing without straining their debt ratios, explained Mr Lee.\n\nAnd with long-term interest rates seen as benign amid a healthy liquidity situation, institutional investors are featuring more in perpetual sales.\n\n\"As the market deepens, institutional investors are beginning to invest quite meaningfully in the perpetual space,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nMapletree Investments sold two perpetuals - S$625 million in January and and S$700 million in May - and allocations to institutional investors were 44 per cent and 32 per cent respectively.\n\nInstitutional investors took 55 per cent of Trafigura Group's US$600 million perpetual in March while they accounted also for 55 per cent of Hotel Properties' S$150 million perpetual in May.\n\n\"Investors are looking at perpetuals as higher-yielding instruments from an issuer they are already comfortable with - credit-wise,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nAaron Gwak, Standard Chartered Bank head of capital markets, Asean, noted that the recent rate hikes have affected only short-term rates.\n\nFollowing the March rate hike, the market continues to expect another rate hike in June, with current probability at 77 per cent but the recent rate hike trends have affected only short-term rates, he said.\n\n\"Long-term rates, however, have remained range-bound over the course of the last two rate hikes,\" he said. Ten-year US Treasuries are at 2.235 per cent overnight (May 24), which is comparable to where they were right after the US elections last November, at 2.151 per cent, said Mr Gwak.\n\n\"This is the main reason why investors are in favour of perpetual instruments. They view that long-term rates will continue to be range-bound in spite of rate hikes to come,\" he said. \"This is pushing investors to deploy the accumulated capital in their arsenal. And given the yield proposition set forth by perpetual, it is unsurprising that this asset class is doing well.\"\n\nRated perpetuals, in particular, are gaining a lot of favour as they provide the added comfort of rating agencies' review on the issuer and the structure, he said.\n\nDevinda Paranathanthri, UBS Asia credit strategist, said he sees value in corporate perpetuals, but is very selective depending on their coupon features.\n\n\"We prefer structures where there is a coupon step-up or a reset at the call dates. These offer some protection against rising interest rates, in our view. When rates are rising, fixed-for-life structures will likely be affected the most,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Setting aside the questions swirling around the bidding process, summer temperatures regularly hit 50 degrees Celsius, which even Fifa's experts said posed health risks for the world's best players and the millions of fans expected to travel to the 32-team event.\n\nBy picking the Gulf state, Fifa set in motion a series of tortured decisions, solving one problem only to create another - and leading to an unintended windfall for broadcasters Fox and Telemundo that could be worth as much as $500 million.\n\nBecause of the extreme Qatari temperatures, the governing body of global soccer wanted to reschedule for the cooler autumn months. But Fox and Telemundo had already agreed to pay US$1.1 billion to air the 2018 and 2022 World Cup. That price assumed the traditional June-July schedule, which gives the broadcasters a tremendously popular sporting event at a time when there's little else going on.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

It plans to connect 65 countries across Asia, and the Middle East to Europe by land along the historic Silk Route and another maritime route, down the Pacific and Indian Ocean and up the Mediterranean Sea. It is arguably the most ambitious economic project in the 21st century in terms of physical and economic scale and geographic spread.\n\nThe 65 countries make up 65 per cent of the world population, one third of the world's GDP (gross domestic product), 40 per cent of global trade and one quarter of all goods and services the world moves.\n\nIn September last year, I mentioned at a conference that, amid the then pessimistic world economic outlook, there were only two possible major stimuli or drivers that could reignite global growth, namely the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the One Belt One Road (OBOR) programme. The TPP is now as good as dead, although there have been recent attempts to revive it. The world is now left with BRI as the only potential global collaborative vision that can be the engine of the world's economic growth. This BRI programme is sometimes likened to the US' Marshall Plan, except that the BRI is 12 times larger.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/82316585845ec115359d4eb5797ce85443ea86cf6c1f130cff2dbfd06778f6a3?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "For the host countries, the potential direct and indirect benefits of the BRI will likely outweigh any concerns of China's global dominance, political or otherwise."}]}

The UK was first with US$484 billion followed by Japan with US$484 billion.\n\nEmployment\n\nGerman companies are the third largest foreign employer in the United States, with over 670,000 workers, nearly half of which are employed in manufacturing.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/1a0f115d0dd5b7b0de1cfb10da6399a98afa1e0f49d41cf11fc6ba105ba43365?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A brewing diplomatic crisis between the United States and Germany has its roots in President Donald Trump's frequent criticism of the large US trade deficit with the European economic powerhouse."}]}

We'll be trying to lift people. Otherwise the poor kids who died at the gig have died in vain,\" he told the Manchester Evening News.\n\nAs life in Britain's third-largest city resumed a semblance of normality, the train station next to the attack site reopened earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\"There's still a weird feeling, you know, armed police, a lot of unease,\" said 59-year-old David Keys as he got off a train at Manchester Victoria.\n\nTroops were deployed at key public sites last week as Britain's national terror threat was raised to maximum, and police hunted suspected accomplices of bomber Salman Abedi.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who was born in Manchester to Libyan parents, was killed in the attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.\n\nBritain's threat level was reduced back from \"critical\" to \"severe\" on Saturday, and the army has been stood down.\n\nPolice on Tuesday released three men who had been arrested as part of the terror probe, while 11 people remain in custody in Britain.\n\nAbedi's brother Hashem and father Ramadan have also been arrested in Libya, where authorities say the two brothers were both IS jihadists.\n\nSearch for a suitcase\n\nQuestions are growing over whether intelligence services missed any vital clues, after a report in the Mail on Sunday that US authorities had previously warned Britain's MI5 intelligence service about Abedi.\n\nBritish police revealed Tuesday that Abedi had appeared in police records over theft, receiving stolen goods and assault in 2012 but was never flagged up for any radical views.\n\n\"He was known to the police for some relatively minor matters,\" Manchester police chief Ian Hopkins told BBC radio, adding: \"I am not privy to what the security service did or didn't know about the individual at this time.\"\n\nAbedi reportedly fought in the Libyan conflict to topple former dictator Moamer Kadhafi.\n\nPolice released a security camera image of Abedi carrying a large blue suitcase, appealing for any information about where he might have been.\n\n\"We are just trying to make sure we capture everything that he has discarded so we can then see what the significance is,\" police chief Mr Hopkins said.\n\n\"Has it (the suitcase) got DNA on it of people that may have helped him?

He said no decision had been made as to the timing of any ban. \"We are still following the intelligence,\" he said, \"and are in the process of defining this, but we're going to raise the bar generally speaking for aviation much higher than it is now.\"\n\nAirlines are concerned that a broad ban on laptops may erode customer demand. But none wants an incident aboard one of its airplanes.\n\n\"Whatever comes out, we'll have to comply with,\" Oscar Munoz, chief executive officer of United Airlines, told the company's annual meeting last week.\n\nAirlines were blindsided in January when President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days to citizens from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, sending airlines scrambling to determine who could board and who could not.

Delta Air Lines said in a statement that it \"continues to be in close contact with the US Department of Homeland Security\", while Mr Munoz applauded the administration for giving the company a \"heads up\". \"We've had constant updates on the subject,\" he said. \"We know more than most.

The cases include investigating allegations regarding buying planes for US$10.8 billion, the CBI said. The acquisition allegedly caused a financial loss to the \"already stressed\" national carrier, it said.\n\nAir India spokesman Dhananjay Kumar and a spokeswoman for Boeing in India declined to comment. Praful Patel, who was India's civil aviation minister at the time of the purchases, and an Airbus spokesman in India didn't immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment.\n\nIn December 2005, India's cabinet gave an approval to the national carrier to buy 68 aircraft from Boeing Co. In 2006, state-owned Indian Airlines Ltd. inked an agreement to buy 43 planes from Airbus SE. While the aircraft orders were made separately, the two national carriers were later merged by 2007 into the National Aviation Co of India Ltd, which operated under the brand Air India.\n\nThe CBI said it's also investigating allegations of leasing of a large number of aircraft \"without due consideration.\" Also part of the probe will be allegations about giving up profit-making routes by Air India in favor of national and international private airlines, which caused a \"huge loss\" to the national carrier, it said.\n\nAir India's aircraft deal was controversial at the time of the purchase itself. A day after the Mumbai-based carrier chose to buy 23 Boeing 777 aircraft and 27 Dreamliners, Nigel Harwood, Airbus's then vice president of sales for India, said in an interview that the European company wasn't given a \"fair chance.\" Air India denied that, saying it took \"strong exception\" to the claims.\n\nIndia is considering selling a majority stake in Air India to a strategic partner after a US$3.6 billion bailout failed to turn around the loss making national carrier, Bloomberg News reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The proposal includes reviving Air India within five years of selling a 51 per cent stake, they said.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": []}

The carrier said it's in talks with Boeing Co to add two or three more jets to its existing delivery schedule while extending 10 of the company's planned lease returns through 2019.\n\nWhile Ryanair has cut costs and slashed prices to undercut rivals and maintain market share amid a glut of capacity on European routes, the slide in fares should ease as supply better matches demand. That will spur an increase in earnings of 8 per cent to between 1.4 billion euros and 1.45 billion euros in fiscal 2018, the Dublin-based company said.\n\nThe discounter will accelerate its growth in Italy, Germany, Poland and Romania to take advantage of restructuring by carriers in those countries, including Air Berlin Plc and Alitalia SpA.\n\n\"We continue to juggle more opportunities for 2018 and 2019 than our existing fleet growth can accommodate,\" the company said. \"As competitor airlines undergo deep restructuring, we are aware of the need to have additional short haul aircraft to respond quickly as these unique growth opportunities arise.\" Ryanair also announced plans to buy back 600 million euros of outstanding shares, bringing the total returned to shareholders since 2008 to more than 5.4 billion euros.\n\nThe discount giant carried 120 million travelers last year, a 13 per cent jump, at a load factor or seat-occupancy level of 94 per cent. Customers will increase 8 per cent to 130 million in the current year, while the slide in fares will ease to a decline of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent, following at 13 per cent drop in fiscal 2017.\n\nChief Executive Officer Michael O'Leary cut Ryanair's 2017 earnings forecast to between 1.3 billion euros and 1.35 billion euros last year amid concern that demand would dip following the UK's vote to quit the European Union. The company had earlier forecast net income would be in a range of 1.375 billion euros to 1.425 billion euros.\n\nLack of clarity on whether the U.K. will opt to remain in Europe's Open Skies could cause \"significant disruption\" of flights between the two regions for months after Brexit takes effect in March 2019, the company said.\n\n\"In the absence of such certainty, or direction, we will continue to pivot our growth away from the UK in 2017 and 2018 to capitalize on the many growth opportunities elsewhere in Europe,\" it said.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f7a847115dc51838dbcbdc543e9f41973d62a94b30634acc31b28a71a93caa4d?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Ryanair Holdings Plc reported a 6 per cent gain in annual earnings with moves by rivals to scale back capacity growth set to stem a slide in fares this year."}]}

Shareholders lost around 80 per cent of their investments.\n\nSources familiar with the case said some shareholders within the group wanted to pursue the case against the bank, if they could find funding. But the letter indicated that investors representing the necessary threshold of 70 per cent of the value of the claim for acceptance had been reached, one source said.\n\nA formal announcement on behalf of the group, which includes around 9,000 retail and 20 institutional investors and has been beset by internal wrangles, changing legal teams and questions over its funding and management structure, is expected later on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nRBS declined to comment.\n\nInvestors representing 87 per cent of the claim had already settled their case after RBS put around \u00a3800 million on the table last year.\n\nIn a bid to avoid a trial, Edinburgh-based RBS almost doubled its initial offer to 82 pence per share, from 43.1 pence per share, last weekend.\n\nA deal had been expected. Jonathan Nash, a lawyer for the claimant group, told London's High Court last week that the majority of shareholders were willing to accept RBS's offer and there was a \"good prospect\" of a final settlement.\n\nRBS's final offer remains a fraction of the 200 to 230 pence per share that shareholders bought RBS shares at in 2008 and denies investors the prospect of seeing Goodwin cross-examined in court. Mr Goodwin, who left RBS a wealthy man, became a symbol of banker recklessness and greed during the credit crisis.\n\nBut lawyers have said the case could have dragged on for years before a court established both whether RBS was liable for investor losses and subsequently quantified any damages.\n\nThe RBoS Shareholder Action Group also confirmed that a claimant funding the case had accepted the offer and was no longer willing to pay for further litigation. All institutional investors are also backing the offer, which would raise the costs for remaining claimants if they were to proceed, it said.\n\nShareholders were told that around 40-45 per cent of the proceeds of the settlement would be deducted for legal and other costs. But the group added in the letter there were \"many variables which may impact the level of the costs\".\n\nRBS investors, including thousands of current and former RBS employees, had alleged the bank's former executives deliberately hid its over-stretched finances and failed to disclose that the regulator had ordered it to raise cash when asking investors to stump up a then-record \u00a312 billion in 2008.\n\nJust months later, the government was forced to step in with a \u00a345.8 billion taxpayer-funded bailout.\n\nRBS, which remains more than 70 per cent state-owned, denies any wrongdoing and said its former bosses did not act illegally.\n\nThe bank has racked up nine consecutive years of losses totalling \u00a358 billion since the credit crisis, largely blaming \"legacy issues\" during Mr Goodwin's tenure.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

It roared back even after Mr Guo, a 63-year-old real estate developer, endured surgery, chemotherapy and radiation at two hospitals.\n\nThen his son-in-law discovered online that - for a price - companies were willing to help critically ill Chinese people seek treatment abroad. Soon Mr Guo was at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, receiving a new immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, which is not available in China. In April, nearly four months later, his tumour has shrunk and his weight has gone up.\n\n\"When I arrived, I could feel how large the gap was,\" said Mr Guo of the difference in care.\n\nThe cost: about US$220,000 - all paid out of pocket.\n\nChina's nearly 1.4 billion people depend on a strained and struggling health care system that belies the country's rise as an increasingly wealthy global power. But more and more, the rich are finding a way out.\n\nWestern hospitals and a new group of well-connected companies are reaching for well-heeled Chinese patients who need lifesaving treatments unavailable at home. The trend is a twist on the perception of medical tourism as a way to save money, often on noncritical procedures like dental work and face-lifts. For these customers, getting out of China is a matter of life or death.\n\nMedical care is just one manifestation of China's wide wealth disparity. A new generation of affluent Chinese can seek help at private hospitals or go abroad, even as the rest endure long waits and find their treatment falling short.\n\nChinese people took an estimated 500,000 outbound medical trips last year, a fivefold increase from a year earlier, according to Ctrip.com International, a Chinese travel booking company, which offers medical travel on its website. While the bulk of that is focused on plastic surgery and routine examinations, medical travel agencies say the number of critically ill Chinese patients leaving the country for medical treatment is growing.\n\n\"China is among the countries where we have seen the greatest growth in recent years,\" Dr Stephanie L Hines, chairwoman of executive health and international medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said.\n\nAt Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, employees help patients with travel and lodging. Mass General, Mayo Clinic and Boston Children's Hospital provide interpreters.\n\nMr Guo is one of more than 1,000 patients that one company based in Beijing, Hope Noah Health Co, says it helped last year - a number it says was double that of the year before.\n\nUpon arriving in the United States or Japan, the two countries to which Hope Noah sends people, patients are greeted at the airports by Hope Noah employees and whisked off to a rented apartment. When they head to the hospital, a Hope Noah translator is by their side.\n\nAs recently as the 1970s, China's health care system provided cradle-to-grave medical support. But despite a huge health care reform plan, its public hospitals are overburdened, with too few beds and doctors to deliver the kind of care that many in the West take for granted. A 2015 study by The Lancet based on United Nations criteria found that China ranked 92 out of 188 countries, after Cuba and Mexico.\n\nThe government has increased spending and encouraged private investors to address the problem. A total of about 4.3 million cancer cases were diagnosed in China in 2015, or almost 12,000 cases a day, compared with 2.4 million in 2010, according to the state-run news media. The five-year survival rate of Chinese cancer patients is around 30 per cent, compared with about 70 per cent in the United States, according to China's National Cancer Prevention and Research Center.\n\nPatients often have to travel to Hong Kong and Macau - regions of China governed by their own laws - to buy foreign drugs, which on the mainland face an approval process that takes three to five years.\n\nThe drug that Mr Guo is using, Keytruda, was approved for use only last year in a medical tourism pilot zone in the southern Chinese island of Hainan.

For the 12 months ended March 31, Tat Hong's net loss was a narrower S$38 million compared to FY16's S$39.3 million.\n\nNo dividend was declared.\n\nTat Hong's year-ago loss was weighed by S$40.9 million in other operating expenses, when the company incurred goodwill and impairment charges worth S$32.6 million. Impairment losses on assets and investments during the latest quarter was a more modest S$3.8 million.\n\nThe reduced operating expenses helped the bottom line to show a narrower loss even though revenue fell 13 per cent to S$110.2 million during the quarter.\n\nThe core crane rental division saw a 32 per cent drop in sales, to S$30.6 million, as completed projects in Australia and Singapore led to lower utilisation rates. Rental rates were also under pressure, while the Australian specialised transport business shut down in April 2016.\n\nProject delays and a weaker yuan dragged tower crane rental revenue lower by 11 per cent to S$20.8 million. Looking ahead, however, the company expects tower crane rentals in China to be a bright spot over the next 12 months.\n\nDistribution revenue eased one per cent to S$47.7 million in the fourth quarter, with higher sales in Thailand but lower sales in Malaysia and overseas markets like Japan.\n\nNet asset value per share stood at 78 Singapore cents, down from a year-ago 93 Singapore cents.\n\nLooking ahead, Tat Hong predicted \"challenging\" trading conditions in most of its key markets for the year ending March 2018. The company's shares closed at 36 Singapore cents on Tuesday, lower by 1.4 per cent or half a cent, before the results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

His comments led to a selloff in Italian government debt on Monday.\n\n\"The euro is under downward pressure following Renzi's comment that he would favour snap elections,\" as well as proportional representation that could lead to a hung parliament, said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\n\"It seems the market has begun to realise there's political uncertainty in Italy,\" he said.\n\n\"The dollar/yen, meanwhile, is waiting for clarification on balance sheet reduction by the Fed.\"\n\nMarkets are mostly pricing in the possibility that the US central bank will hike interest rates by a quarter point to one to 1.25 per cent at its June 13-14 policy meeting, with attention turning to clues on the timing of when the Federal Reserve intends to begin paring its US$4.5 trillion balance sheet.\n\nThe US dollar edged down 0.1 per cent against its Japanese counterpart to 111.17 yen, but remained solidly mired in its recent narrow range between last week's high of 112.13 and May 18's low of 110.24.\n\nThe euro slipped 0.3 per cent to 123.82 yen after drifting as low as 123.71, its weakest since May 19.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/4a81b4c43bacdd7c2fdd76f5c691db10f0037a1a185ed56af37dfd50f0fefca6?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The US dollar firmed on Tuesday, taking back ground against the euro and sterling which were pressured by political uncertainties in the UK and eurozone."}]}

The changes, announced on Tuesday, are part of a company-wide initiative to reduce sodium, saturated fat and sugar.\n\n\"Maggi will push the envelope to certainly be ahead of our commitments,\" Wayne England, the head of Nestle's food business, said in an interview, adding that he expected the brand's sales to increase as a result.\n\nThe move comes at a time when big food companies such as Mondelez International Inc and Unilever try to introduce healthier products as governments implement sugar taxes and seek to cap sodium levels. The industry has struggled with slowing sales as consumers increasingly shun packaged food they perceive as unhealthy and laden with artificial ingredients.\n\nMillennials, attracted to organic produce and food from local sources, are accelerating the shift.\n\nWhile the salt reductions for Maggi are in line with Nestle's broader targets, the change in one of its biggest and saltiest ranges deepens the company's commitment to meeting them. Maggi generated sales of about three billion francs (S$4.3 billion) to four billion francs last year, estimates Jean-Philippe Bertschy, an analyst at Bank Vontobel AG. Noodles and bouillon cubes are the brand's best-selling products, he added.\n\nIn Switzerland, one serving of Maggi beef broth cubes contains 3.1 grams of salt. The World Health Organization recommends a daily intake of no more than five grams, as elevated intake raises the risk of stroke. Most people consume about twice that amount.\n\nFood companies revamped about 180,000 products worldwide in 2016, up from some 23,000 in 2014, according to a Consumer Goods Forum survey released last year. Nestle has been adapting about 8,000 products a year. Balancing demands for healthier food with consumer tastes can be tricky.\n\n\"Companies don't want to do anything that might cause customers to stop buying products,\" said Marion Nestle, a nutrition professor at New York University who isn't linked to the maker of Maggi. \"If they make changes too quickly, customers might notice. Most companies are reducing salt and sugar slowly and invisibly, but at least they're doing it.\"\n\nThe revamp, which also includes selling more Maggi products with extra iodine, iron and vitamin A, will probably spur demand, Mr England said. With some reformulated items already being rolled out, the brand's sales are increasing at a rate of more than 3 per cent, he noted. Going forward, the company expects growth of as much as 5 per cent.\n\nStill, the industry could be more aggressive because consumers will probably accept even bigger cuts in salt, according to Leith Greenslade, head of JustActions, a group that campaigns on health and other issues. She cited a study showing a 70 per cent cut in processed meat didn't lead to any significant backlash from shoppers.

But the lurch down in inflation it helped trigger is not.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's preferred price measure rose 1.7 per cent in April from a year ago, down from 1.9 per cent in March and 2.1 per cent in February, Commerce Department figures showed Tuesday. Core inflation - which strips out volatile oil and food costs - also slowed to the weakest annual pace since 2015.\n\nA rebound anytime soon looks unlikely, with prices kept in check by an ongoing oil glut, an overstocked auto market and a rising supply of apartments to rent.\n\n\"The weakness isn't so transitory,\" said Omair Sharif, senior US economist at Societe Generale in New York.\n\n\"There's a lot of stuff underneath the hood that's cooling off.\"\n\nThe result: Inflation looks likely to end the year shy of the Fed's forecast.\n\nWhile the shortfall isn't expected to prevent central bankers from raising interest rates next month, a sustained stall would make it more difficult for Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues to follow through with another hike later in the year, as their March projections indicated.\n\n\"The data introduce a seed of doubt, even for an inflation hawk like me,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC in New York, although he sees the recent price softness as just a blip rather than a change in the underlying trend.\n\nFed policy makers forecast in March that inflation would end the year at 1.9 per cent, just below their two per cent goal for the personal consumption expenditure price index. That now looks out of reach, and Mr Sharif said he expects officials to lower their expectations in new forecasts released after their June 13-14 meeting.\n\nCentral bankers had been hoping that the ebbing of inflation in March would be temporary, largely the effect of a record 7 per cent monthly plunge in wireless-service costs, according to separate figures from the Labor Department. While those prices slipped further in April, there's more at work than just cell phones.\n\nOpec oil producers and their allies are struggling to reduce a supply glut that's depressed crude and gasoline prices and inflation. The group's decision last week to extend output cuts through March failed to lift the energy market.\n\nThere is also downward pressure on core inflation, which eased to 1.5 per cent in April from 1.6 per cent in March in spite of a slightly bigger-than-expected 0.2 per cent month-over-month rise.\n\nThe car market seems in oversupply as cooling sales have left auto dealers saddled with bloated stockpiles that will take time - and even lower prices - to clear.\n\n\"The new-vehicle market remains in a plateau phase with elevated inventories\" and \"rising incentives\" for car buyers, Mike Jackson, chief executive officer of AutoNation Inc, told analysts on April 25. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company is the largest auto dealership group in the US.\n\nThe balance between supply and demand of apartments is also beginning to tilt. As a boom in construction brings more stock on to the market, the relentless rise in rents is showing signs of running out of steam. Rather than continuing to accelerate, rental inflation may level off in the second half of this year, some analysts said.\n\nTo be sure, there are forces pushing consumer prices in the other direction, including rising labor costs on the back of a tighter jobs market and a weaker dollar.\n\nAt 4.4 per cent in April, the unemployment rate was below the level that Fed officials calculate is sustainable in the long term. And the same report on Tuesday showed consumer spending is on track to rebound after a weak first quarter.\n\nThose are big reasons why policy makers are widely expected to raise interest rates next month in spite of the ebbing price pressures.\n\nOther indicators on Tuesday showed the housing market remains tight and consumer sentiment is relatively strong. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities rose 5.9 per cent in March from a year earlier, matching the biggest gain since July 2014. The Conference Board's gauge of consumer confidence slipped slightly in May, though it's still well above pre-election levels.\n\nAnother year of undershooting the Fed's inflation target could be troublesome, however, said Michael Gapen, chief US economist at Barclays Plc and a former central bank official. Consumers, businesses and investors might then be more inclined to believe prices will stay low for a long time.\n\nThe risk is \"market expectations begin to get centered around that,\" said Mr Gapen, who sees headline PCE inflation averaging around 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"Then you set yourself up for permanently missing the two per cent inflation goal, always on the downside. The miss could get calcified.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

Low leverage and strong revenue generation by these firms enable them to withstand external shocks - possibly even better than their China counterparts.\n\nAlicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said that there is only so much Asean corporates can leverage on, as there are more financial constraints in Asean corporates than Chinese corporates because the Asean domestic financial sector - bond and stock markets - are so much smaller.\n\nAs the level of interest rate is high, \"you can expect these corporates to have a harder time in leveraging because the interest expense is going to be larger\", noted Ms Herrero.\n\nBut the good thing is that the banks tend to be relatively healthy because they have high net interest margin (NIM), said Ms Herrero, noting that the NIM on average in Asean is literally nearly double the global average.\n\nShe said: \"That interest margin is feeding the profitability and we find that that gives us some hope that this is quite stable compared to other places in the world, China being one of them.\"\n\nThe Natixis Asean Corporate Monitor 2017 employed a bottom-up analysis of 1,200 listed non-financial institutions in the region and compares them to a similar global universe. The study was done based on publicly available company data for the third quarter of 2016, and it evaluated how these corporates performed on key debt and revenue stream metrics.\n\nThai corporates emerged the healthiest among six Asean countries - Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The debt repayment ability of Thai firms is best due to the second lowest interest rate across Asean while tax rate are the lowest, supporting the third best profit margin. Thai operating income growth is also the best.\n\nBut behind that robustness in Thai firms, corporates are not investing due to poor prospects politically and demographically, leading to weak demand for loans. Capital expenditure is also very low, noted Ms Herrero.\n\nVietnam corporates were ranked the worst in the region due to their poor ability to repay debt, high leverage and dependency on short-term funding. But high interest rates and limited access to long term funding have not deterred Vietnamese firms from rapidly growing their investment in the face of weak global demand in Q3 2016, it said.\n\nMs Herrero said the question thus lies in whether the capex is directed towards more efficient and profitable projects, which would warrant the trade-off of poor corporate health in the short-term for higher growth potential in the medium term.\n\nSingapore came third behind Thailand and the Philippines, with good debt sustainability but weak growth. The report said repayment ability of Singapore firms is weak but interest expense is the least in Asean. Tax rates are also low in Singapore, supporting the second best profit margin. Operating income growth is the second worst and investment is worsening due to the economic downturn.\n\nThe study also found that Asean corporates are more exposed to domestic-oriented industries, sectorial wise. Renewable and environment, airlines and utilities performed the best in Asean economies. But Asean corporates in externally-exposed sectors performed worst, due to weak global conditions back in Q3 2016.\n\nMs Herrero said: \"Given the recovery in the external environment in 2017, externally-driven sectors, especially those less leveraged, are expected to perform better.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's a call that's already being answered by the continent's richest region.\n\nSweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway have over the past two years been deepening their military cooperation to counter a deteriorating security situation in the Baltic and the Arctic. They are also forging closer ties on softer issues, presenting this week a joint initiative to meet sustainability goals, promoting the 20 million-person region's shared values on social equality, and discussing joint interaction with China.\n\n\"There's no doubt that Europe needs to take bigger responsibility, we have to spend more on defense and security,\" Erna Solberg, Norway's prime minister, said in an interview on Monday as Nordic leaders start a two-day summit in Bergen.\n\nNorway will ensure good cooperation \"with its closest allies, and some are in the EU and some are on the other side of the Atlantic\", she said.\n\nThe Nordic summit started a day after Merkel said reliable relationships forged in Europe since the end of World War II \"are to some extent over\".\n\nThe German chancellor made those comments after meeting with US President Donald Trump in Brussels and Sicily over the past week.\n\nBoth Ms Solberg and Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipila cautioned against interpreting Ms Merkel's remarks as a major shift.\n\nThe comments were mainly about the economic side, \"that European countries should take more responsibility on the Nato budget,\" Mr Sipila said.\n\n\"This message has been quite clear all the time. At the same time this means that we can cooperate more inside the European Union\" and that \"the window is open for defense cooperation\", he said.\n\nThe broadest shifts in policy in the region have been seen in Finland and Sweden, which unlike Denmark and Norway aren't members of Nato. The two neighbours have intensified military cooperation and also forged closer ties with the military alliance without outright joining Nato.\n\nFinland's proximity to Russia has excluded it from becoming a full-fledged member, while Sweden has a long-held belief that official neutrality serves it best.\n\nAll four countries have been boosting spending, with Denmark and Norway now working toward meeting the two per cent spending goal that Nato members have been lambasted by Mr Trump for not meeting.\n\nBecause of the different security alliances, Ms Solberg said that closer Nordic cooperation will likely center around economic questions.\n\n\"European cooperation will become stronger going forward and then we will cooperate with those that are our closest allies, but Sweden and Finland are also close partners,\" she said.\n\nBut even now Sweden is in \"grave difficulties\" after disarming since the end of the cold-war, according to Finnish diplomat Ren\u00e9 Nyberg, who has served as Finland's ambassador to both Moscow and Berlin.\n\n\"There are many building blocks, which are quite solid,\" Mr Nyberg said in an interview in Helsinki May 24.\n\n\"Finland's military cooperation with Sweden has proceeded at an incredible pace, and it's a great success. Sweden needs it - it's not just Finland that does.\"\n\nMr Sipila said the cooperation \"is very important for both countries.\"\n\nMr Trump's talk on raising trade barriers, and the UK's decision to exit the European Union, have also jolted the trade-dependent region. The UK was seen as a key ally within the bloc by Sweden and Denmark, two other countries that have chosen not to adopt the euro. Norway, flush with oil wealth, has rejected joining the EU altogether.\n\nMr Sipila said there are \"a lot\" of possibilities to strengthen economic ties across the region, including setting up a single \"digital market\" and a bio-fuels market.\n\nThe Nordic leaders also discussed more joint cooperation in dealing with China, albeit on an \"ad-hoc\" basis, as well as combating climate change, according to Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven.\n\nMr Lofven said given the mixed messages and uncertainty from the US administration on issues such as Nato and the Paris climate accord, it's \"not strange that Merkel is starting to wonder what's what\".\n\n\"The Nordic cooperation is easy to understand for the people in our countries and we want to develop it more,\" he said.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

After years of fighting wars in the Middle East, Washington would shift its attention to the military and economic challenges it was facing in East Asia, including a more assertive China.\n\nIn reality, the \"pivot\" didn't amount to a dramatic transformation of American foreign policy. The Obama administration did strengthen US military presence in Asia while highlighting its growing trade and investment engagement there. But the continuing instability in the Middle East and the security threats emanating from there - including Iran's nuclear military programme, the civil war in Syria, the rise of the Islamic State and more terrorist acts inspired by radical Islamist groups - forced the Obama administration to continue shifting diplomatic and military resources to that part of the world. At the same time, a more self-confident Russia under President Vladimir Putin was defying Western interests in Eastern Europe and is seen now by many in Washington as threat to American interests and values following the allegations that the Russians interfered in last year's presidential election campaign.\n\nMoreover, the Obama administration was facing domestic opposition as it tried to win congressional approval for its policy centrepiece, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade accord, which embodied its reorientation towards the Pacific. The TPP became central to the election campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He had pledged to not only end US participation in the treaty, but also impose huge tariffs on imports from China and other emerging economies in Asia. Bye, bye, \"pivot\". Hello, trade wars.\n\nMr Trump did fulfil his commitment to revoke the TPP, while refraining, at least for now, from launching a trade war against China or advancing a full-blown set of protectionist policies. The problem isn't that the Trump administration has no plans to continue pursuing a re-balancing policy towards Asia. What is raising concerns among Asia watchers in Washington and among US military allies and trade partners in the region is the lack of any effort by the new administration to come up with a coherent strategy towards the region.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration has engaged in a series of ad hoc responses to developments in Asia. For example: threatening military action against North Korea if it doesn't end its nuclear programme and then subcontracting the diplomacy with Pyongyang to China. Or calling on China to seek peaceful settlement of the territorial disputes in the South China Sea without explaining what it would do if Beijing doesn't heed US advice.\n\nMoreover, Mr Trump's recent trip to the Middle East, including his commitment to cooperate with the Arab-Sunni states in containing Iran, suggests that his administration may actually intensify US military and diplomatic involvement in the region. And then there is Russia, which will also consume much of the Trump administration's attention. Mr Trump now has the obligation to reassure America's friends in Asia that his administration remains committed to working with them to protect their security as well as to maintaining liberal trade and investment. That wouldn't amount to a \"pivot\", but it would be reassuring nevertheless.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will result in more competition as these newcomers would be able to work side-by-side with the incumbents. Ushering in competition in the market was also the main reason behind the government's earlier decision to invite a fourth telco to operate in Singapore and to reserve 60 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum for it at a relatively cheaper price point. Eventually, Australian telco operator TPG Telecom won the right to become Singapore's fourth telco. It paid S$105 million for 60 MHz of what is widely considered good-quality spectrum.

While we were spared a GST rate increase in the Budget this year, the government (for the very first time) hinted at the possibility of introducing new rules to apply GST to cross-border digital transactions.\n\nThe introduction of these rules may be the most monumental change made to the scope of the GST net for a system which has remained largely unchanged since its inception in 1994.\n\nThe proposal to impose GST on digital supplies from outside Singapore was nonetheless widely anticipated. After all, countries in the region had already implemented or are in the process of introducing such rules in the light of the burgeoning digital economy. The public announcement in the Budget indicates that it is just a matter of time (sooner rather than later) when such rules will be introduced in Singapore.\n\nWhat was not anticipated, though, was the proposed introduction of rules to impose the obligation to charge and account for the GST on the customer instead of the supplier. This is a departure from the long-standing principle that the GST-registered supplier (being the tax-collecting agent on behalf of the government) is the one to collect the tax.\n\nThe proposed rules - known as \"Customer Accounting\" - were introduced by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) in a draft circular dated April 24, 2017, (for public consultation), followed by the draft GST (Amendment) Bill 2017 released on May 12. Such rules would necessitate changes to the processes and systems of affected businesses which are transacting in prescribed goods (covering mobile phones, memory cards and off-the-shelf software) exceeding S$5,000 (before GST).\n\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of such goods (especially mobile phones), the impact of the proposed rules is widespread. The impact would be felt not only by the obvious target group (that is, manufacturers, telcos and distributors), but also by businesses that purchase such goods in bulk - for instance, a business purchasing mobile phones for its sales department. The relatively short lead time (Jan 1, 2018, being proposed as the effective start date) would also leave businesses with only a small window to consider the impact on their processes and systems and to make the relevant changes, if required.\n\nWhile the proposed rules came as a surprise, it is not difficult to see the rationale. Customer Accounting is often the weapon of choice for the tax authorities to combat GST/VAT (value-added tax) carousel fraud (or \"missing trader fraud\" as it is more commonly known as in Europe). Such fraud generally lends itself to small, high-value items such as mobile phones, computer chips and electronic devices based on cases uncovered by the tax authorities globally.\n\nREVENUE LOSSES\n\nThe problem is a serious one and has resulted in alarming tax losses to governments. Estimates by the European Union put the lost VAT (equivalent to GST) revenue on cross-border VAT fraud alone at a staggering sum of 50 billion euros (S$77.4 billion) a year. In August last year, a GST carousel fraud case made the headlines when the IRAS announced that it was investigating 43 individuals for suspected GST fraud. While the IRAS had not released further details, the amounts have to be big enough to warrant an immediate legislative response.\n\nA carousel fraud hits the heart of the GST system and the principles on which it operates. Being a self-assessed tax, the system relies on every GST-registered business to act in a bona fide manner and hand over the GST that it collects (net of any input tax claims) over to the government.\n\nWhile the IRAS relies on a system of tax audits and penalties to ensure compliance, there will always be perpetrators who never had the intention of handing over the GST collected (whether in part or in full) in the first place. The fact that the goods pass through large numbers of middlemen (some of whom are legitimate businesses which are unknowing parties in the supply chain) lowers the risk of detection by the authorities.\n\nWhat can the authorities do to combat such fraud?\n\nThe weapon of choice is often a \"reverse charge\" mechanism or \"customer accounting\" (as the government calls it) where the onus is shifted onto the customer to pay the tax to the government. While this eliminates the opportunity for the supplier to abscond with the GST collected from the customer, it represents a fundamental change to the system with widespread repercussions on business processes and systems.\n\nThese repercussions would invariably impose unnecessary costs on businesses, most of which are inherently honest taxpayers. Another concern for businesses is the impact of such rules on existing contracts where there are clauses governing the liability of the GST.\n\nAn alternative is to exempt \"high-risk\" goods from the scope of GST. However, this approach goes against the principles on which our GST system is built upon and renowned for - a broad-based consumption tax with minimal exemptions and zero rating.\n\nThe loss of revenue as a result of the exemption approach would also make this option an unattractive one. While we may easily think that the proposed measures are burdensome, we would hesitate to label the new rules as akin to swatting a fly with a sledgehammer.\n\nShort of an overhaul of the tax system, there appears to be no other practical alternatives. The proposed rules do bring us down a slippery slope. Are we going to see customer accounting being applied to other goods in the future as fraudsters engage in a cat-and-mouse game with the tax authorities?\n\nTaking a step back, we do not disagree that such measures are necessary for the protection of revenue. The best way to stop a crime is to ensure that it does not happen in the first place. For a start, better intelligence/fraud detection capabilities and cross-border cooperation and sharing of information with international authorities are essential.\n\nWhile the government deliberates over the tweaks to the GST system to widen the tax net to meet future needs, it is also important to ensure that GST fraud is properly kept under control, lest it results in revenue leakage at a time when social spending is expected to increase.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Number of local outlets has grown in the 4.0 per cent to 4.5 per cent annual range - a net increase of two stores a year - over the last three years and management sounded an upbeat tone on accelerating the pace of new store openings from here on. We continue to hold our forecast of a conservative net increase of three new stores a year in our base case assumptions for now. . . Japan Foods remains relatively undervalued below its peers and continues to offer an appealing dividend yield of 4.6 per cent.\n\nSingapore property sector | POSITIVE\n\nM\n\naybank Kim Eng Research, May 29\n\nWe turn \"positive\" on property developers, expecting catalysts from a potential rebound in property prices. Strong home-buying interest could drive a sharp decline in unsold stock and allow developers to raise prices. Hence, we believe home prices can pick up even without further policy easing. And while the occupier market remains soft, keen interest in commercial assets has led to record prices in recent transactions. We believe developers will increasingly be valued for their investment properties. We raise target prices by 12 per cent and upgrade Cambridge Industrial Trust and Ho Bee Land to \"buys\" from \"holds\". With the largest local exposure in our coverage, UOL remains our top pick as we deem it the best proxy for a price rebound in Singapore. Maintain \"hold\" on CapitaLand. Risks to our positive view include a surprise tightening of policy measures and a sharp spike in interest rates.\n\nSembcorp Industries | ACCUMULATE Target price: S$3.50 May 29 close: S$3.18\n\nP\n\nhillip Securities Research, May 29\n\nDuring Q1 FY17 results briefing, the new CEO of Sembcorp Industries (SCI) signalled that a strategic review will be underway over six months to improve the growth of the group. We believe SCI's valuation is suppressed due to Sembcorp Marine's (SMM) underperformance and volatile earnings. If the marine business is stripped off, the valuation of the rest of the businesses of the group will be freed up. Therefore, the market is looking forward to the review and contingent corresponding restructuring. It could be the catalyst to favour higher valuation of the group.\n\nCompiled by Kenneth Lim\n\nDisclaimer: All analyses, recommendations and other information herein are published for general information.

Mr Lim is applying for a position as a copywriter, and is asking for S$2,500 although his seniors were known to start at S$3,000.\n\nSalary expectations among fresh graduates have fallen to a range of S$2,000 to S$3,499 per month, down from the high of S$3,000 to S$3,999 which majority have expressed in 2013 (43.9 per cent) and 2014 (36.9 per cent), based on statistics drawn from JobsCentral Employer Of Choice surveys from 2013 to 2016.\n\nThis could be attributed to the intense competition for jobs among fellow job seekers who possess similar educational qualifications, leading to some individuals opting for a lower salary to persuade employers to hire them on the basis of lower costs, said Sam Ng, managing director of JobsCentral.\n\n\"Most importantly, important economic sectors - such as the energy, manufacturing and financial services - have all suffered a decline in their business performance over the past few years, contributing to a slowdown in the economy on a macro level. As a result, Most employers now face a tightening of their operational budgets, reducing the actual salaries they are willing to offer. Recognising this, job seekers therefore adjust their salary expectations accordingly,\" added Mr Ng.\n\nCiting the decrease in manpower demand as rationale for more realistic expectations, the AYP Group said that candidates now place a higher emphasis on other factors like company background, career progression, benefits and stability.\n\nThe trend appeared to have spilled over from the experiences of last year's fresh graduates.\n\nAccording to a joint graduate employment survey by National University of Singapore (NUS), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and Singapore Management University (SMU) released in February this year, last year's graduating cohort have found it harder to land full-time jobs. A smaller proportion of fresh graduates from NUS, NTU and SMU landed permanent full-time jobs within six months of graduation: 80.2 per cent in 2016, compared to 83.1 per cent in 2015.\n\nThe banking industry, always popular with business students, males in particular, has lost some of its lustre in the past five years.\n\n\"The banking industry might have experienced a drop in popularity because the markets for finance are already saturated, and because they are very regimented in nature. Also, having done internships, it becomes apparent that the banking industry is not quite as glamorous as it's portrayed to be,\" said Lisa Goh, a third-year business student at Singapore Management University.\n\nThe observation was reflected in a recent Universum study as well.\n\nBanks have dropped 25 ranks in terms of attractiveness perceived by business students on average, from 15th in 2012 to 40th in 2017.\n\nThe energy industry's average ranking declined by 13 ranks from last year, with companies like Schlumberger and BP dropping in attractiveness as perceived by employees.\n\nThis can be attributed to freeze in hiring, global uncertainty and large-scale retrenchment drives which signal low levels of job security to job applicants, thus instilling low confidence in both sectors, noted Mr Ng.\n\nJobTech recorded a 27 per cent increase in Singapore online job postings in the first quarter 2017 for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, a rise of more than 700 unique job listings from the previous quarter's capture of over 2,600 unique postings.\n\n\"Its popularity might be explained by the news flow in areas like digital, data, and fintech, and the evergreen nature of tech multinationals,\" said Femke Hellemons, country manager of Adecco Personnel (Singapore).\n\nIncreasingly, startups have gained popularity amongst graduates for their flexibility and wide exposure to varying job roles.\n\n\"The number of startups that we've been working with have more than doubled in the past two years,\" said Jaya Dass, country director of Randstad Singapore.\n\nTraditionally viewed as high-risk, low-stability employment areas, greater public interest in startups has led to STJobs' introduction of its new niche startups category in March this year.\n\n\"Growing cultural acceptance of a riskier career path, fuelled by the media and celebrity entrepreneurs, coupled with a global economic climate that rewards innovations, especially in tech, have assuaged many doubts graduates might have about startups,\" said Roslyn Yi, a third-year student at Yale-NUS College and co-founder of Made Real, a subscription lifestyle service.\n\nLast year, 58.9 per cent of potential applicants indicated interest in working for a start-up company, according to JobsCentral Employer of Choice survey 2016.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Australian dollar touched a four-month lows against its kiwi neighbour earlier in the session to be last at NZ$1.0558. It dropped 2 per cent last week in the largest such decrease in more than a year.\n\nThe losses are due in part to a diverging commodity outlook with prices of iron ore, Australia's top export earner, off 27 per cent since mid-April.\n\n\"It's all about the commodity plays these days and with the markets growing increasingly concerned about demand for iron ore, the Aussie could continue to struggle - more so if both the Fed and ECB point to a more hawkish shift in forward guidance,\" said Stephen Innes, a senior trader at Oanda.\n\nIn contrast, the outlook for New Zealand's dairy products, its largest export, is promising.\n\nGlobal dairy prices have risen five times in a row in the past two months while cooperative giant Fonterra lifted its forecast milk payout for the 2016/17 last week.\n\nThe New Zealand dollar rose over the weekend, touching a two-month high of US$0.7077 before retracing slightly to trade around US$0.7050 on Monday.\n\nInvestors are waiting for Wednesday's central bank financial stability report which is expected to flag ongoing risks in the housing sector, but an improved outlook for dairy.\n\nNew Zealand government bonds eased, sending yields three basis points higher at the long end of the curve.\n\nAustralian government bond futures edged off six-month highs, with the three-year bond contract down one tick at 98.290. The 10-year contract shed half a tick to 97.5545, while the 20-year contract lost one tick to 96.9700.\n\nThe spread between Australian and US two-year government bonds inched up to 29 basis points, having plumbed 28 basis points on Friday, the smallest since 2001.\n\nLikewise, the 10-year bond spread stood at 19 basis points, from 16 basis points last week, which was the slimmest since November.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/us-pullout-wont-sound-death-knell-paris-climate-deal", "site_title": "US pullout won't sound death knell for Paris climate deal", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nUS pullout won't sound death knell for Paris climate deal\n\nPublished\n\nMon, May 29, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nUS President Donald Trump will decide this week whether to maintain US support for the 2015 Paris climate change deal. While the choice is a big one that will either bolster or retard international efforts to tackle global warming, the Paris agreement is a flexible, resilient one that could potentially withstand US withdrawal.\n\nThe reason for this is not just that the Paris deal retains significant support across the world, including China and the 28-member European Union (EU). In addition, the landmark agreement intentionally has a flexible, \"bottom-up\" approach - compared to the previous Kyoto Protocol - and this greater decentralisation and suppleness means that US withdrawal would not necessarily be fatal.\n\nWhile the wisdom of this flexible architecture appears obvious, it represents a breakthrough from the more rigid \"top-down\" Kyoto framework. While Kyoto worked in 1997 for the 37 developed countries and the EU states which agreed it, a different way of working was needed for the much more complex Paris deal, which involves more than 170 diverse developing and developed states which agreed to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.\n\nIt is in this context that Mr Trump makes his decision after being lobbied heavily by fellow G-7 leaders at the summit in Sicily last weekend to maintain US support for the Paris deal. The US president has previously asserted that \"the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive\", and also received a letter last week from more than 20 Republican Senators urging him to quit the 2015 agreement.\n\nThe group of Republican legislators, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, used the letter to applaud Mr Trump for moving away from former president Barack Obama's Clean Power Act regulations, and asserted this stance will not be wholly effective unless he also withdraws from the Paris deal. This stance is supported by key members of the Trump team, including Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt.\n\nYet, the administration is divided on this issue with, for instance, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson favouring continued US support for Paris. Moreover, there is also significant support for this stance from the Democratic Party, and also within the nation's business community. Many US multinational corporations - including in the energy sector - argue that it is better for the United States to keep a seat at the table and influence an accord that big US businesses are ultimately likely to have to abide by in coming years.\n\nGiven these conflicting pressures, it is possible that Mr Trump might seek a third pathway that could see the US remaining in the Paris framework, but potentially re-examining US objectives within it. Such a stance could allow Washington to keep a seat at the table, but allow Mr Trump to signal a partial break with the Obama administration to save political face.\n\nThe reason why this option could contain much utility for Mr Trump is that it would not forgo the option of him potentially later deciding to pull out of the agreement, thus keeping his options open. Mr Trump's decision is being closely watched internationally given the head of steam that is currently behind the Paris deal. There is significant concern that if the US (the world's second-largest greenhouse gas polluter) withdraws, this will undermine the agreement.\n\nAt the 2016 annual UN climate conference, which concluded after Mr Trump's election in November, there was a strong reaffirmation by nearly 200 countries of their \"highest political commitment\" to combating global warming. However, there was also realism that Mr Trump could well seek to leave Paris, potentially by removing the US from the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\nYet, while US departure from the deal would be a body blow for international efforts to tackle climate change, this would by no means sound a death knell for the deal. By design, the deal is a flexible, \"bottom-up\" approach whereby countries develop bespoke plans to realise emissions targets with national and sub-national governments working in partnership with business. In other words, while Paris created a global architecture for tackling global warming, it recognises that diverse, often decentralised, policies are required by different types of economies to meet climate commitments.\n\nThat this approach makes sense is reflected in the diversity of climate measures that countries, pre-Paris, had started to make in response to global warming. This was illustrated in a major report by the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics which focused on 98 countries plus the EU, together accounting for 93 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and revealed there are more than 800 climate-change laws and policies in place across the world, rising from 54 in 1997.\n\nAround half of these (398) were legislative measures, and half (408) executive actions (for example, decrees). And 46 new laws and policies were passed in the 12 months prior alone - highlighting that domestic measures to address global warming are being approved at an increasing rate. Some 45 countries, including the 28 EU members as a bloc, have economy-wide targets to reduce their emissions. Together, they account for over 75 per cent of global emissions.\n\nIn addition, 41 states have economy-wide targets up to 2020, and 22 have targets beyond 2020. Moreover, 86 countries have specific targets for renewable energy, energy demand, transportation or land-use, land-use change and forestry, while some 80 per cent of countries have renewable targets; the majority of them are executive policies.\n\nCollectively, what this underlines is that the best way to tackle climate change, going forward, is a decentralised approach with nations meeting their target commitments in innovative and effective ways that builds on this momentum. Even if Mr Trump pulls the US out of the deal, Paris could therefore still provide a resilient, flexible framework for climate action that potentially becomes a key foundation stone of future sustainable development for billions across the world.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One anonymous Indian hacker - \"Geekboy\" - has found more than 700 vulnerabilities for companies like Yahoo, Uber and Rockstar Games.\n\nMost are young \"techies\" - software engineers swelling the ranks of India's US$154-billion IT outsourcing sector whose skill set makes them uniquely gifted at cracking cyber systems.\n\n\"People who build software in many cases also understand how it can be broken,\" HackerOne co-founder Michiel Prins told AFP by email.\n\nBut while technology behemoths and multinationals are increasingly reliant on this world-class hacking talent, just a handful of Indian firms run bug bounty programmes.\n\nInformation volunteered by these cyber samaritans is often treated with indifference or suspicion, hackers and tech industry observers told AFP.\n\nAnand Prakash, a 23-year-old security engineer who has earned US$350,000 in bug bounties, said Facebook replied almost immediately when he notified them of a glitch allowing him to post from anyone's account.\n\n\"But here in India, the email is ignored most of the time,\" Mr Prakash told AFP from Bangalore where he runs his own cyber security firm AppSecure India.\n\n\"I have experienced situations many times where I have a threatening email from a legal team saying 'What are you doing hacking into our site?'\" Mr Sajnani, who has hacked around a dozen Indian companies, said he was once offered a reward by a company that dropped off the radar once the bugs were fixed.\n\n\"Not getting properly acknowledged, or companies not showing any gratitude after you tried to help them, that is very annoying,\" the 21-year-old told AFP from Ahmedabad, where he hunts for software glitches in between his computer engineering studies.\n\nATTITUDES CHANGING\n\nAn unwillingness to engage its homegrown hackers has backfired spectacularly for a number of Indian startups, forcing a long-overdue rethink of attitudes toward cyber security.\n\nIn 2015, Uber-rival Ola launched what it called a \"first of its kind\" bounty program in India after hackers repeatedly exposed vulnerabilities in the hugely-popular app.\n\nThis month Zomato, a food and restaurant guide operating in 23 countries, suffered an embarrassing breach when a hacker stole 17 million user records from its supposedly secure database.\n\nThe hacker \"nclay\" threatened to sell the information unless Zomato, valued at hundreds of millions of dollars, offered bug hunters more than just certificates of appreciation for their honesty.\n\n\"If they were paying money to the good guys, maybe 'nclay' would have reported the vulnerability and made the money the right way,\" Waqas Amir, founder of cyber security website HackRead, told AFP by email.\n\nThe incident was especially galling for Mr Prakash. He had hacked Zomato's database just two years earlier, and said if they listened to him then \"they would never have been breached in 2017.\"\n\nIn a mea culpa rare for an Indian tech company, Zomato agreed to launch a \"healthy\" bounty programme and encourage other firms to work with ethical hackers.\n\n\"We should have taken this more seriously earlier,\" a Zomato spokeswoman said in a statement to AFP.\n\nThe Zomato hack, and panic surrounding this month's global WannaCry cyber attack, comes as the Indian government aggressively denies suggestions its massive biometric identification program is susceptible to leaks.\n\nThe government has staunchly defended its \"Aadhaar\" programme, which stores the fingerprints and iris scans of more than one billion Indians on a national database, and has accused those who have raised concerns of illegal hacking.\n\nMr Prakash said it was vital the government embrace its own through a programme like the \"Hack the Pentagon\" initiative, which last year saw 1,400 security engineers invited to poke holes in the US Department of Defence's cyber fortifications.\n\n\"The Indian government definitely needs a bounty programme to make their system more secure,\" Mr Prakash said.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

Billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott wants an independent review of BHP's oil unit and claims the miner has destroyed about US$31 billion in value through its foray into US shale and failed petroleum exploration.\n\nMr Mackenzie's message to investors on shale is \"they want to try and extract maximum value out of the business and there's a lot of different options,\" said Andy Forster, a Sydney-based senior investment officer at Argo Investments Ltd, which owns BHP shares, and who attended a meeting. \"They still seem pretty wedded to the rest of the petroleum business.\" BHP declined to comment on details of talks between Mr Mackenzie and shareholders. The producer said in an e-mailed statement this month the executive was scheduled to hold investor talks to outline the Melbourne-based company's growth plans.\n\n\"They want to be seen as being pro-active\" on addressing the future of the shale unit, \"but don't want to be seen as being reactionary to Elliott,\" Argo's Forster said by phone.\n\nElliott, which has made two sets of proposals for a corporate overhaul of BHP since April, claims to have found a \"groundswell of dissatisfaction\" in talks over recent weeks with investors holding tens of billions of dollars of the company's shares. The fund and its associates hold an interest in about 4.1 per cent of BHP's London-listed shares, Elliott said in an April 10 statement.\n\nAny piecemeal sales of shale operations in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana risk being the \"commercial equivalent of death by a thousand cuts,\" Elliott, which favors a spin off of all US oil assets, warned in a May 16 presentation. The shale unit is worth about US$6.3 billion, according to Deutsche Bank AG.\n\nPressure from Elliott may have provided an impetus to BHP to publicly address the future shale operations, says Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, the second-largest holder of BHP's London-listed shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"It sounds like they're getting on with reviewing shale gas,\" Robert Penaloza, Aberdeen's head of Australian equities, said by phone from Sydney. \"For all the issues that Elliott's brought up, maybe it's just made it more urgent for BHP to get on with these things.\" Since acquiring the U.S. onshore assets in about US$20 billion of deals earlier this decade, BHP has written off more than half their value and acknowledged this month the deals were poorly timed and too expensive. BHP said in April it is seeking to sell parts of a Texas gas field and considering an exit from the Fayetteville shale gas assets in Arkansas.\n\nMr Mackenzie raised the prospect of further sales of shale assets in a May 16 speech in Barcelona, flagging the company's transition to focus more closely on conventional petroleum.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": []}

In March, Airbus SE signed an agreement with Thai Airways International Pcl to evaluate the development of MRO facilities at the civil-military airport near Bangkok.\n\n\"Singapore is quite tight right now,\" Ms Ajarin said in an interview at Bloomberg's Toronto office on May 25, during a visit to Canada to woo investment. \"To catch up with the demand of airlines in the region - especially new demand from Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia - and given that we have existing strengths with automotives and engineering, Thailand will be the second choice to be the MRO hub.\" The airport project is part of junta leader Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha's goal of boosting the economy, whose expansion has lagged behind neighbors since the military seized power three years ago. It's also a key component of a plan to invest 1.5 trillion baht ($60.9 billion) between 2017-2021 to develop the country's eastern seaboard.\n\nApart from the airport in the Eastern Economic Corridor, the plan calls for US$4.5 billion investment in high-speed rail, US$11.5 billion for new cities and US$14 billion for industry. The government will control and maintain the airport and a port. Other projects will be public-private-partnerships or privately held.\n\n\"I am confident we can make it,\" Ms Ajarin said, referring to raising the funds. The government has already allocated its budget for 2017, she said, declining to provide a figure for the administration's outlay on the corridor or an estimate of the MRO business Thailand is targeting.\n\nForeign-direct investment has revived after sliding following the coup, especially in digital and high-technology sectors, Ms Ajarin said.\n\nShe gave as an example Toronto-based Canadian Solar Inc, which applied for a license in 2015 and opened its Thai factory two years later. Among electric vehicles, a \"big player - but not Tesla - is waiting to come in,\" Ms Ajarin said.\n\nFDI increased to US$8.6 billion in 2016 from US$2.7 billion in 2015, according to data provided by the Board of Investment.\n\nWhile the board offers incentives to foreign companies such as tax sops, it remains unclear how quickly the Thai government can implement its ambitious vision for the eastern seaboard given the scale of the project.\n\nChallenges include a shortage of skilled workers, as well as concern that Thailand is prone to harmful episodes of political volatility.\n\nAjarin acknowledged that the risk of political turmoil is a worry for new investors, but argued that companies have weathered past such bouts.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

The world's second-biggest sugar producer can switch between exporter and importer depending on the monsoon. Precipitation in June and July is critical and any deficit in the early part of the season could delay sowing and hurt crops, even if the monsoon gathers pace later.\n\nThe weather office had forecast precipitation this year at 96 per cent of a 50-year average. The country saw normal rainfall last year after two consecutive years of drought.\u00a0Private forecaster Skymet Weather Services Pvt in March predicted the monsoon would be 95 per cent of the long-term average, meeting its definition of a below-normal season, citing concerns about the possible development of an El Nino weather pattern.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department said in April that a weak El Nino may only develop in the later part of the rainy season, with a less than 50 per cent chance of it developing before August. In 34 per cent of El Nino years, monsoon rainfall was normal or above normal, it has said. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology also said in May that while there is a 50 per cent chance of the event this year, it may be weak.\n\nThe annual monsoon waters about half of India's crops, with agriculture accounting for about 14 per cent of the economy.

It's also a key component of a plan to invest 1.5 trillion baht (S$60.8 billion) between 2017-2021 to develop the country's eastern seaboard.\n\nApart from the airport in the Eastern Economic Corridor, the plan calls for US$4.5 billion investment in high-speed rail, US$11.5 billion for new cities and US$14 billion for industry.\n\nThe government will control and maintain the airport and a port. Other projects will be public-private-partnerships or privately held.\n\n\"I am confident we can make it,\" Ms Ajarin said, referring to raising the funds. The government has already allocated its budget for 2017, she said, declining to provide a figure for the administration's outlay on the corridor or an estimate of the MRO business Thailand is targeting.\n\nForeign-direct investment has revived after sliding following the coup, especially in digital and high-technology sectors, Ms Ajarin said.\n\nShe gave as an example Toronto-based Canadian Solar Inc, which applied for a licence in 2015 and opened its Thai factory two years later. Among electric vehicles, a \"big player - but not Tesla - is waiting to come in,\" Ms Ajarin said.\n\nFDI increased to US$8.6 billion in 2016 from US$2.7 billion in 2015, according to data provided by the Board of Investment.\n\nWhile the board offers incentives to foreign companies such as tax sops, it remains unclear how quickly the Thai government can implement its ambitious vision for the eastern seaboard given the scale of the project.\n\nChallenges include a shortage of skilled workers, as well as concern that Thailand is prone to harmful episodes of political volatility.\n\nMs Ajarin acknowledged that the risk of political turmoil is a worry for new investors, but argued that companies have weathered in the past such bouts.

The telco said the speeds that customers will get would be among the \"fastest in the world\" for 4G networks.\n\nStarHub will deploy this upgrade by installing equipment for what is known as 2.5 GHz (gigahertz) LTE TDD technology in the CBD (central business district) area, Orchard Road, Changi airport, Marina Bay and the transport hubs. Other parts of the country would be progressively covered. The telco will use the 2.5 GHz spectrum band that it bid for in the recent auction conducted by IMDA (Infocomm Media Development Authority) of Singapore. It will be eligible to start using this band from July 1.\n\nTan Tong Hai, StarHub CEO, told The Business Times that LTE TDD technology increased network capacity which resulted in an increase in the average throughput that individual users got in congested localities, irrespective of how many people were accessing the same base station.\n\nFor LTE, there are two standards in use. One is the European developed standard called FDD (frequency-division duplexing) which is the most commonly used standard in Singapore. The other is what is known as TDD (time-division duplexing) which is used in China. According to Mr Tan, the use of TDD allows for better use of bandwidth since it was more \"spectrum-friendly\" and dramatically increased the spectrum utilisation.\n\n\"If you look at a mobile network, you need to look at both speed and capacity. Speed is usually measured on a single person on the network scenario,\" Mr Tan said. He added: \"LTE FDD is rated to give a download speed of 300 Mbps (megabytes per second). However, in a real-life scenario, especially in busy areas, you'd have more than 1,000 people accessing the same base station at any given time and capacity becomes more important than speed.\n\n\"As a result, you would most probably get a 10-20 Mbps download speed over FDD in a congested locality. StarHub's existing network can give between 20-30 Mbps in best- case scenarios. With TDD deployment, we would increase that to around 30-40 Mbps. We have hit this speed consistently in our trials and this is already among the fastest 4G speeds in the world.\"\n\nMr Tan added that all major smartphones used in Singapore have TDD capability built into them. \"More than 50 per cent of our phones are currently TDD-enabled because every phone manufactured must have TDD as China is using this standard.\n\n\"You can feel the increased capacity only in congested areas like at the National Day parade when you download and upload. If you are using FDD, you will find the network congested. However, if your phone is TDD-enabled, it would switch to TDD and you would automatically find that your data packets are going through the less congested route, improving the speed on account of better network capacity,\" he said. He added that enterprise customers in perpetually congested areas like the CBD would feel a significant improvement in network capacity.\n\nStarHub would need to add an additional card to a base station and change the antenna. Mr Tan reckoned it would take one day per base station to make the modifications. Currently, the telco uses the 2.5 GHz band to provide its 3G services. The additional card and new antenna would allow the telco to provide both 3G and 4G services through the same base station.\n\nStarHub's spectrum bidding strategy took into consideration the use of TDD technology. As result, StarHub bagged four lots of five Megahertz (MHz) of the 2.5 GHz spectrum compared to three lots bought by Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) and two lots by new entrant, Australian telco TPG. M1 did not secure any lots in this spectrum band.\n\nA StarHub spokeswoman told BT that the telco's 20 MHz falls in the middle portion of the 2.5 GHz spectrum band that was up for bidding. \"As a result, our alloted spectrum will not suffer from any interference from the adjoining 2.6 GHz and 2.4 GHz spectrum bands and we don't need to install costly filters to eliminate interference... we can start using it immediately from July 1.\"\n\nBy using both FDD and TDD, we are able to tap into both European and Chinese technology and \"we don't lose out by just tapping one technology\", Mr Tan said. \"TDD allows us to take advantage of a lot of innovation that has been happening in China,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He works as a \"local community revitalisation corps\" member promoting tourism in the city in the northwestern part of the Kofu basin.\n\nNakazawa's parents hail from Hokuto and he often visited his grandparents when he was growing up. He has been drawn to the area's magnificent mountains and highlands since childhood.\n\nAlthough Nakazawa had hoped to live in the area someday, he joined a construction firm in Kanagawa Prefecture after graduating from university.\n\nBut the death of his maternal grandfather in August last year prompted him to make the move sooner rather than later. \"I thought it would be better to move while my (paternal) grandparents are still healthy,\" Nakazawa said.\n\nHis income is lower than what he earned in Kanagawa, but Nakazawa said: \"I don't have to ride a packed train. I work less overtime. I feel like my life has become richer.\" Nakazawa's paternal grandfather, Kenichi Nakazawa, 89, lives with his grandson and said, \"I'm enjoying (living with him) because he makes our home lively.\" Nakazawa's grandmother Kesae, 84, said her grandson \"helps me with heavy work. I really appreciate it.\"\n\nNaoko Sakaguchi, 36, a coffee shop owner in Asahi, Toyama Prefecture, moved from Tokyo's Edogawa Ward in 2007 to take care of her grandparents. Her coffee shop, Hygge, is housed in an old renovated residential building.\n\n\"At first, I was worried about whether I could be comfortable living here. But people in the neighbourhood were very kind - they welcomed me as the granddaughter of 'Mr and Mrs Sakaguchi,' \" she recalled.\n\nWith the support of her relatives living nearby and newfound friends, Sakaguchi opened a coffee shop in 2015, fulfilling a long-held dream.\n\nDuring the period of high economic growth in Japan, young people moved to urban areas to seek jobs. In contrast, their children are doing the opposite. Tokyo-based nonprofit organisation Furusato Kaiki Shien Center (Hometown relocation support centre) advises people who are considering relocating to rural areas by offering consultations and sharing relevant information. The NPO's deputy executive director Kazuo Kasami refers to the phenomenon as mago-turn.\n\nAfter the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, the organisation began receiving an increasing number of consultations from the younger generations. Kasami realised there were a number of people choosing to live in the same town as their grandparents.\n\n\"I thought this was a new style of migration, different from U-turn or I-turn,\" Kasami said.\n\nThere is no nationwide data on mago-turn. Even so, a survey conducted by the town among people who moved to Suo-Oshima in Yamaguchi Prefecture in fiscal 2015 found that nine people, or 8 per cent of the 116 respondents, said they moved to the town because their grandparents lived there. The local government is known for encouraging people to move there.\n\nAccording to Kasami, young people from urban areas don't consider the rural areas where their grandparents live to be inconvenient. The towns often hold a lot of memories for them, such as family visits and nature excursions.\n\nSome people are hesitant to give up city life, despite their ambitions to live in rural areas, because of job, housing or relationship concerns.\n\nMeiji University Professor Tokumi Odagiri, an expert in rural policy and familiar with issues relating to provincial flight, said: \"With mago-turn, people are likely to have fewer concerns about such issues.\" Taking advantage of family connections makes it easier for people to find work or a place to live and assimilate into a community. If grandparents own agricultural land that has been passed down for generations, farming could be an option for their grandchildren.\n\n\"If mago-turn results in more young people moving to rural areas, the areas will be rejuvenated and the wave could attract other young people without family ties to the region,\" said Odagiri. \"Mago-turn could become a major pillar of future migration policy.\" Facing declining populations, some local governments have recently introduced measures to support people who migrate to the areas where their grandparents live to attract more young people.\n\nIn April 2016, the local government of Bungotakada in Oita Prefecture began offering a financial incentive of 100,000 yen (S$1,244) to people who move there if their grandparents live in the city. Other criteria must also be met to receive the reward. The city hopes to promote more migration by young people.\n\nOther local governments have adopted different measures to encourage mago turn, including offering academic scholarships to households with children, as well as subsidising events that will help people to settle down in their hometowns.\n\nHowever, migrating to provincial areas is never easy, in spite of the various incentives available. \"Migration, including mago turn, requires meticulous preparation,\" stressed Koichi Hayashi, general manager of Iju Koryu Joho Garden (Migration, exchange, information garden), which offers consultations near JR Tokyo Station for those who are considering a move.\n\nIn consultations, Hayashi tells people who are thinking about leaving the city to write down the reasons why they would like to live in the countryside and what kind of lifestyle they hope to have. It is also important to visit prospective areas several times and speak with local residents before deciding to move, according to Hayashi.

In this case, the risks that could dampen deal flow, according to Mr Whitchelo, is largely political - rising nationalism, protectionism, increased restrictions on global trade and cross-border economic integration and the potential for a conflict involving the US, Russia or China in one or more of the geopolitical hotspots of Syria, the Ukraine, the Korean peninsula or the South China Sea.\n\nFor one, US President Donald Trump's \"America First\" agenda and its perceived threats on free trade policies could impact deal activity in the Asia-Pacific which very much relies on cross border M&As, economic integration and free trade.\n\n\"At the moment, however, we are not seeing this as a dampener. I'm simply flagging it as a potential risk if the rhetoric translates into action. There's a wall of worry on the impact of inward looking policies affecting global trade and by extension, M&A deals,\" he said.\n\nBrexit fears have also curtailed deal making in the UK which has seen a volatile trend since last June's referendum when the country voted to leave the European Union.\n\n\"Many companies are certainly holding back on very large transactions in the UK until they know what is the shape of the final outcome or whether there is going to be a deal at all. There has definitely been a decrease in inbound activity there,\" said Mr Whitchelo.\n\nIntralinks' data includes the sell-side M&A transactions that are in preparation stage or have reached due diligence stage which are, on average, six months away from being publicly announced. The focus is on deal volume versus value, a better gauge, he said, as at least half of the deals announcements do not disclose their value.\n\n\"We have built a model that can very accurately predict future deals to be announced in terms of volumes and the sectors. By the time the data comes to us, between 85-90 per cent of the deals are likely to be closed or announced,\" said Mr Whitchelo.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This comes not just because of its historical ties - in 1995, UOB was the first Singapore bank to open a foreign bank branch in Vietnam - but also on the back of its network of foreign direct investment (FDI) advisory units across Asia, including one such office in Vietnam.\n\nThe FDI advisory units offer a one-stop shop for customers in various parts of Asean and Asia seeking advice on challenges in expanding into those markets. The unit ties up with the local government agencies as well as trade and industry associations, which can help address regulatory queries from clients.\n\nAs it is, UOB said earlier this year that its network has brought in more than S$27 billion in business flows into Asean in 2016, doubling from a year ago. In arriving at this figure, UOB looked at deposits, trade and capital flows that has flowed through the bank, through its FDI advisory unit that was set up in 2011.\n\nIts peer, OCBC, is taking a different tack, banking on the expected increase in onshore wealth in Indonesia, with Capgemini's 2016 report estimating at least 48,000 high net worth individuals with a total wealth of US$161 billion in Indonesia. OCBC launched in May its onshore private banking in Indonesia through its subsidiary OCBC NISP.\n\nThis move is well-timed, following the headline tax amnesty programme in Indonesia that led to a total repatriation of 84.5 trillion rupiah (S$8.8 billion) from Singapore to Indonesia this year. OCBC NISP was appointed as a gateway bank authorised to receive and manage repatriated funds under Indonesia's tax amnesty programme.\n\nFunds from Singapore repatriated by Indonesians are reported to have accounted for more than half of the total amount of funds that returned to Indonesia, and that creates \"many new opportunities in the high net worth segment\" for domestic Indonesian banks, said Parwati Surjaudaja, president director of OCBC NISP in a statement.\n\nDBS is still using its advantage as Singapore's largest bank to capture flows going into Asean, through the city-state. It has just partnered with Nishi-Nippon City Bank to support Japanese small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that are expanding into Asean. DBS cited a white paper published by Japan's SME agency that showed 42.8 per cent of Japanese SMEs have raised their presence overseas in this region in 2013, up from 25.5 per cent in 2010.\n\nAgainst DBS's peers' more direct push into the region, the market is still watching for DBS's digibank move in Indonesia. DBS's digibank offering in India crossed its one-year mark in April, and has brought in one million customers. Investors may be eager to see if the same can be replicated in Indonesia.\n\nTo be sure, analysts have warned that local banks in each Asean country are so deeply rooted there - and backed by more protectionist regulations - that it is costly for multi-national banks to truly gain a strong foothold onshore. But regional banks that focus on regional flows alone may also have an advantage in expanding into Asean, as compared to global banks that may boast an international network, but run the risk of bloated operations that become too big to manage, especially at a time of higher scrutiny against illicit financing.\n\nFor the burgeoning intra-Asean flows present opportunities in themselves, with intra-Asean FDI making up the highest source of the total US$120 billion of FDI in 2015, data from the Asean Secretariat showed.\n\nIntra-Asean trade also made up the highest share of Asean's total trade by partner in 2015, at 24 per cent. This was higher than the 15 per cent share between Asean and China, and the 11 per cent share of trade between Asean and Japan. Swift data showed as well that Singapore is at the centre of payments flowing through to Asean, with nearly 90 per cent of flows originating from Singapore, or having a beneficiary in the city-state.\n\nSingapore banks still have a good shot at capturing the flows by deepening their regional presence. No doubt, they'd be watching costs from operating in these Asean markets, which can run on average higher than that in the home market.\n\nBut they are likely assessing risks of higher costs against the larger opportunities abroad, especially as the home market undergoes restructuring that will create some pain, but will also prompt more Singapore clients to venture into Asean, creating opportunities for Singapore banks to follow their clients out, together.\n\nGiven these dynamics, expect Singapore banks to edge deeper into Asean over the next few years, creating a more diversified income base that should be welcomed by their shareholders.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Many of his policies strike me as undesirable, some in the extreme. His background and temperament have not prepared him for the presidency. He is largely ignorant of many issues he must face. And yet, for all this, the idea of impeaching him and removing him from office, which inspires much loose chatter, makes me extraordinarily uneasy.\n\nWe Americans take enormous pride in our political system, even while we disparage and distrust our politicians. One hallmark of this veneration is the peaceful transfer of power every four years when we acknowledge and respect the outcome of the presidential election. We assume that the \"people have spoken\", that the process is sufficiently honest to be accepted and that, therefore, the verdict receives widespread support, even if it isn't to our liking.\n\nNot for us are military coups or - with the one tragic exception - civil wars. Presidents of both parties enjoy the presumption of legitimacy. Americans respect their political system even when it doesn't produce what many thought the country needed. We live to fight another day.\n\nSo goes the standard praise of American democracy. The trouble is that it no longer describes actual experience, assuming that it once did. Sometimes, the transfer of power is not orderly. More common, the presumption of legitimacy is absent. All presidents are supposed to have honeymoons, but the honeymoons seem to be shortening to the point that Mr Trump's has disappeared altogether.\n\nSince World War II, the textbook model has gone into eclipse. John Kennedy (JFK) was assassinated. Richard Nixon faced impeachment by the House and resigned rather than be convicted by the Senate. Ronald Reagan was threatened with impeachment over his role in the Iran-contra affair. Bill Clinton was impeached but not convicted. George W Bush's triumph in 2000 was seen as illegitimate by many because it depended on disputed votes in Florida.\n\nWe view these episodes in isolation. After all, what does JFK's assassination have to do with Watergate? Not much, except for the traumas inflicted on the nation. In addition, some pre-World War II presidents suffered mightily. Three were assassinated: Garfield, Lincoln and McKinley. Corruption stalked the Grant and Harding presidencies. Still, something new and disturbing is happening.\n\nOne mark of a successful democracy is the willingness of the losers to accept election results without questioning the system's moral foundations. Their allegiance to the system - their belief in its essential fairness and desirability - exceeds their unhappiness with the immediate election results. Among both parties, this sense of self-restraint is weakening. There's a growing tendency to want to replay elections by transforming ordinary political disagreements into impeachable offences. This is a new norm.\n\nWe should be wary, because if the power to impeach is abused, it threatens to weaken or shatter the bipartisan loyalty that now exists towards the larger political system. To overturn the results of an election is bound to alienate most, if not all, of the voters whose winner was repudiated - and perhaps many on the other side who recognise that, under different circumstances, the same might happen to them.\n\nThis does not mean we can or should turn a blind eye towards genuine crimes (Watergate) or potential threats to the nation's security and political independence (Russia's tampering with our elections). But before we start reversing elections, the wrongdoing should be serious and the evidence of the president's complicity should be obvious and overwhelming. This is a high hurdle, and it should be. It should be high enough so that the president's own party spontaneously becomes the instrument of resolution.\n\nWith Mr Trump and the election, we are not there yet - at least in my opinion. His shortcomings and mistakes as the leader of government and the nation's chief policymaker remain. But using impeachment as a corrective to Mr Trump's unfitness to govern risks damaging the integrity of the ballot. There is a real conflict here, and barring major disclosures of election fraud or coordination with foreign entities, I don't see how it can be resolved.

I am doing this business for more than 35 years but I have never experienced losing 10 per cent in volume in one year,\" said Mr Koizumi, a career insider who took the top job at the company in 2012.\n\nDemand for traditional cigarettes may come under further pressure given the prospect of tougher regulations as Japan tries to introduce an anti-smoking law ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo.\n\nMr Koizumi said he expects vaping products, including Ploom Tech and IQOS, to grab as much as 25 per cent of Japan's cigarette market by the end of 2018.\n\nPhilip Morris' IQOS is a battery-powered device that heats cigarette-shaped sticks packed with tobacco leaves. Ploom Tech, also a battery-powered device, generates vapour that goes through a capsule packed with tobacco leaves.\n\nMr Koizumi said his company was aiming for the top share of Japan's vaping market in three years.\n\nJapan Tobacco plans to ramp up the annual output capacity of tobacco capsules used for Ploom Tech to the equivalent of 20 billion cigarette sticks in 2018, from 5 billion planned at the end of this year, the CEO said, adding the company was also developing other tobacco vaping products.\n\nThe former state monopoly - still a third owned by the government and whose top brands include Winston, Mevius and Camel - last week announced it would start selling Ploom Tech in Tokyo on June 29, later than initially expected.\n\nThere has been speculation Japan Tobacco, which has a market capitalisation of 8.4 trillion yen (S$104.40 billion), is ripe for major M&A, especially after British American Tobacco agreed a US$49.4 billion takeover of US rival Reynolds American Inc, creating the world's biggest listed tobacco firm.\n\nSome analysts speculate Japan Tobacco could even potentially acquire Britain's Imperial Brands. But Mr Koizumi said the BAT-Reynolds deal was unlikely to have a direct impact on his company's business and that Japan Tobacco was not interested in large-scale acquisitions.\n\n\"Specific names aside, deals that would be potentially problematic in terms of anti-monopoly regulation are not realistic,\" he added.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

Meet the \"influencers\", the most famous people you've never heard of.\n\nFor 70 years, the Cannes film festival has been a key event on any A-lister's calendar. But move over Nicole Kidman, there's a new breed of stars in town: social media personalities invited purely on the grounds of their huge Instagram or YouTube followings.\n\nSharing the red carpet with Kidman and Will Smith last week have been beauty bloggers such as 17- year-old Amanda Steele (2.8 million YouTube subscribers) and Swiss Instagrammer Kristina Bazan (2.4 million followers).\n\nMaja Malnar, who makes a living from her blog and 264,000-strong Instagram following, admits she's struggled to explain her job as a \"social media influencer\" to her mother back in Slovenia.\n\nYears ago, she started posting snaps of her daily outfits on the photo app and blogging about her travels. These days she's part of a growing industry known as \"influencer marketing\", whereby brands seek to harness the power of powerful web-users by slipping their products into their posts.\n\n\"It's a good business, I can't complain,\" Malnar told AFP.\n\nThe petite blonde, who is in her twenties but declined to give her age, walked the red carpet on Friday in a tie-up with MasterCard and the designer who provided her dress. She'll then have to post about it.\n\n\"We're entrepreneurs. We saw a gap in the market and we capitalised on it,\" says her friend Lorna Andrews, a British ex-air hostess who modestly calls herself a \"mid-tier influencer\" with 464,000 Instagram followers.\n\nCannes is no stranger to those famous for being famous - socialites like Paris Hilton have been turning up for years - and brands have long recognised the festival's power as a marketing opportunity.\n\nTop-end labels and jewellers have for decades dressed the stars for free at Cannes, knowing they will be snapped there by the waiting paparazzi.\n\nBut the arrival of the \"influencer\" at the world's biggest film festival - and at international fashion weeks - is a new phenomenon.\n\nAbout 18 months ago Edouard Hausseguy, a 27-year-old Frenchman, realised the money-making potential of people whose photos, restaurant tips and beauty tutorials are followed by millions online, even though most would not recognise them on the street.\n\nHe set up his agency Hemblem to represent anyone with a following of 30,000 and up - negotiating deals with brands, and then taking a cut.\n\n\"Those people are people like us, but they speak to millions of people with one picture,\" he told AFP in an interview on a yacht moored at Cannes, where he's hoping his influencers will benefit from the presence of top brands and the media.

Chinese coworking operator Distrii will launch a space at Republic Plaza in 2018 in what is its first international foray.\n\nThe growth is in line with a marked rise in \"flexible working environments\" in the Asia-Pacific, a region where demand for coworking spaces will expand at an average rate of 10 to 15 per cent annually, according to an April coworking report by Cushman & Wakefield and CoreNet Global.\n\nObservers said that this demand is fuelled by an increased appetite from companies for workspaces that offer speed and flexibility in a time of global economic uncertainty, and that will allow them to grow or downsize as needed without being locked down by long-term rent.\n\nChris Browne, head of global occupier services (Asia-Pacific) at Cushman & Wakefield, said: \"Traditionally, businesses were constrained by the time and cost of acquiring and fitting out new premises.\n\n\"The shorter leases and competitive costs of these spaces provide options for businesses wishing to scale up either at speed, on a project basis, or for a temporary period.\"\n\nCoworking spaces are typically 10 to 30 per cent cheaper than traditional office spaces; they are also well-designed, close to amenities and attractive to the millennial workforce, according to the same report by Cushman & Wakefield and CoreNet Global.\n\nIn another study, millennials are found to make up 75 per cent of the global workforce by 2025.\n\nTurochas Fuad, chief executive officer of Spacemob, one of the latest entrants to the Singapore coworking market, said that millennials seek colourful, creative spaces that encompass a wide range of work philosophies and talent, from which they can draw inspiration and learn.\n\nHe told BT: \"Coworking spaces deliver well on these promises, and will be a mainstay in the years ahead.\"\n\nJen Lee, marketing executive of Collision 8, a coworking space that launched last July, added that such spaces are no longer just for startups and small businesses. \"Corporates, investors and non-profits are looking to engage in coworking as they see the benefits of being connected to a larger community.\"\n\nBut medium-sized companies or firms that require a high degree of client confidentiality (such as those in the finance and legal sectors) may be less keen on such spaces.\n\nChristine Li, research director at Cushman & Wakefield, said this could be due to an absence of corporate branding and lack of privacy in coworking spaces compared to traditional offices.\n\nThat said, Singapore's Smart Nation initiative and its ambition to create an innovation-based entrepreneurial ecosystem may continue to drive demand and the proliferation of coworking spaces in the coming years, Ms Li noted.\n\nThe coworking sector has attracted deep financing - said to be in the millions of dollars - from venture capitalists and investors. Spacemob in November raised US$5.5 million in seed funding, believed to be the largest such round in South-east Asia.\n\nJaelle Ang, co-founder of The Great Room Offices, a hospitality-inspired coworking space, told BT: \"Coworking spaces will establish itself as a rising real estate asset class, just like hotels and serviced apartments did, if it hasn't already.\"\n\nNot all coworking spaces are the same. To stand out from the pack, operators are differentiating beyond splashy interiors, a variety of workstations and well-stocked pantries.\n\nSpacemob uses a technology-first approach: it has developed a proprietary \"operating system\" that allows it to run and manage a coworking space and connect with its members.\n\nThe Working Capitol holds educational and networking events to create a \"community experience\" for its members, while Impact Hub, a pioneer of coworking in Singapore, has a S$1 million fund to invest in early-stage startups.\n\nThe Work Project says it is the only company that offers unlimited 24/7 use of its spaces (including small meeting rooms) under its basic membership package.\n\nDavid Wong, CEO of Booqed, an app that lets users book work spaces across Asia, said that coworking spaces are increasingly \"designed to address different niche users\". While some are great for creative professionals or tech startups, there are those that cater to parents who want their children nearby and taken care of while they work in the adjacent room.\n\nHe said: \"Space is no longer just a venue; it actively contributes to the (work) experience.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A successful sale is critical to Toshiba's recovery after massive cost overruns at nuclear unit Westinghouse plunged it into crisis.\n\nWestern Digital, which jointly operates Toshiba's main flash memory chip plant, has sought arbitration, arguing that the Japanese conglomerate is violating their joint venture contract and demanding exclusive negotiating rights.\n\nThe California-based firm had told Toshiba it needed a stake of at least 51 per cent for the chip unit to be competitive but it was not seen as a strong bidder after submitting one of the lowest bids in the first round of offers, sources have said previously.\n\nThe sources speaking on Monday said Western Digital is now open to being a minority investor for the time being and plans to increase its stake to more than half when INCJ and KKR seek an exit from their investment.\n\nBut it is not clear whether the trade ministry would allow such a move, they said, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media on the matter.\n\nThe ministry has insisted that the chip unit should not fall under the control of a foreign manufacturer as semiconductors are important from the standpoint of national security, the sources said.\n\nToshiba declined to comment on the specifics of the sale process. Western Digital, KKR and DBJ also declined to comment.\n\nA representative for the trade ministry was not immediately available for comment. An INCJ spokeswoman said the fund would not comment on speculation.\n\nOther suitors for the chip business include US chipmaker Broadcom Ltd which has teamed up with private equity firm Silver Lake, and Bain Capital which has partnered with South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix, sources have said.\n\nTaiwan's Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, also formed a consortium with its Japanese unit Sharp Corp to bid in the second round, they said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

There shouldn't be a reason to postpone the election,\" Mr Chavalit said.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Prayuth asked viewers four questions for which he said he wanted feedback, including whether it was right to hold an election \"without considering the country's future\".\n\n\"These are questions with political implications, showing that the prime minister isn't confident about an elected government,\" Ongart Klampaiboon, secretary-general of the Democrat Party, told Reuters.\n\n\"I think it could be a preliminary signal of a plan to stay in power.\"\n\nOn Monday, a poll by independent Bangkok University, which surveyed 1,269 people, showed 52.8 per cent of respondents would vote to elect Prayuth if he were to run for office.\n\nFollowing an explosion at a Bangkok hospital last week, which the military blamed on anti-junta groups, Mr Prayuth questioned whether the country was ready to hold an election.\n\nThe army seized power after months of unrest saying it needed to restore order and rid Thai politics of corruption and nepotism. The junta promised to enact political reforms.\n\nBut despite growing pressure at home and from abroad to restore democracy, a general election initially promised for 2015 has been repeatedly pushed back.\n\nThe timeline for an election is now tentatively set for late 2018.\n\nOn Monday, Mr Prayuth said the election was still on track.\n\n\"I didn't ask whether we should hold an election,\" Me Prayuth said.\n\n\"I was only asking what is to be done if the same kinds of people are elected again.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, Thailand has been locked in a bitter conflict between the Bangkok-based royalist-military establishment and supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister, former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, and their Phea Thai Party.\n\nParties led by the Shinawatras have won Thailand's last three elections.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/ddfdd1d5c51d18ea62bcdccad9dac5bb27bd9328d0d8dfe95ea6f74138de72d0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "During his weekly televised speech on Friday, junta chief Prayuth Chanocha questioned whether an election would install a government that practices \"good governance\"."}]}

Ms Thao said she will meet exchange officials in New York later this week.\n\nThe plan for the 41 trillion-dong (S$2.489 billion) low-cost carrier comes amid the government's easing of rules to allow more foreign investment in one of the fastest-growing aviation markets. Hanoi-based VietJet, known for a marketing stunt featuring bikini-clad service crew, received shareholder approval in April to boost its foreign ownership limit to 49 per cent from 30 per cent.\n\n\"Listing overseas on big markets will help increase our access to more fund sources, boost the trading of our stock and expand the list of our investors,\" said Ms Thao, a self-made billionaire.\n\n\"We don't want to hide our hope to become the first Vietnamese company to list shares overseas.\"\n\nShares of VietJet rose 0.8 per cent to 127,800 dong at the close in Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest gain in more than two weeks. The stock has surged about 51 per cent since it started trading three months ago, compared with a 6.4 per cent increase in the Bloomberg Asia Pacific Airlines Index. The overseas listing plan would make VietJet the first Vietnamese company to officially trade overseas, according to Tran Anh Dao, deputy chief executive of the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange.\n\nWhile VietJet has done well in Vietnam, it faces tougher competition against entrenched players such as low-cost carrier AirAsia Bhd, as well as Cathay Pacific's regional unit, Cathay Dragon, as it expands in Asia, said Tyler Cheung, director of institutional clients at ACB Securities Co in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\"They have been able to accomplish something impressive in a relatively small period of time,\" Mr Cheung said.\n\n\"The question is whether their business model and corporate strategy can transfer to a regional play.\"\n\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd doesn't comment on individual companies, a spokeswoman said in an email. Singapore Exchange Ltd declined in an email to comment.\n\nVietJet, which began operating six years ago, has 136 foreign investors who own 26 per cent of the company, Ms Thao, 46, said in April. She owns more than 60 per cent of the airline directly and through holding companies and other entities, according to filings.\n\nThe increase in foreign ownership will need to be approved by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc because aviation is considered a restricted industry, with the limit currently capped at 30 per cent. The airline has filed paperwork requesting the increase, Ms Thao said.\n\nRaising the limit isn't aimed at attracting a strategic investor, although the company is open to one, she said.\n\n\"We always wanted to be the pioneer,\" Ms Thao said.\n\n\"We want to increase our stock value and to boost the ability to mobilise capital with more participation of investors.\"\n\nMs Thao made her first million dollars at age 21 selling fax machines and latex rubber. Almost a quarter of a century later, the executive became South-east Asia's first self-made woman billionaire with the listing of VietJet.\n\nMs Thao engages in round-the-clock negotiations with plane and engine makers by herself, surviving on as little as three hours of sleep a night, said VietJet Managing Director Luu Duc Khanh.\n\nIn May last year, she sealed a US$11.3 billion deal with Boeing Co to buy 100 737 Max 200 aircraft just in time to have it announced during then-President Barack Obama's visit to Vietnam.\n\nThe carrier agreed to buy 30 A320neos valued at US$3.6 billion at list price in 2015, adding to an order for as many as 100 Airbus planes a year earlier.\n\nThe budget airline forecasts profit will rise 36 per cent this year from 2.5 trillion dong in 2016. VietJet expects to serve 17 million passengers this year, after carrying about 15 million travellers in 2016.\n\nIts biggest competitor is Vietnam Airlines. The national carrier owns 70 percent of low-cost operator Jetstar Pacific Airlines Aviation JSC, with Qantas Airways Ltd holding the remaining 30 per cent. Vietnam Airlines also owns Vietnam Air Services Co, known as Vasco.\n\nVietJet and Vietnam Airlines each have a 42 per cent share of the domestic aviation, said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based analyst at Capa Centre for Aviation.

The founder and CEO of Active8me, a digital health business, is out to convince the average office-bound - most likely overweight - urban Asian who loves food, to eat healthier and exercise more.\n\nMr Rolleston, 44, was working for one of Australia's largest early-stage venture capitalists when he noticed the success of digital fitness and health companies in Australia, US and Europe. \"But there was nothing of that sort in Asia,\" he says.\n\nHe did see a growing interest in fitness, health and wellness in the region - salad bars, cold-pressed juices, activewear labels, gym subscriptions, fun runs and races, for example. But then he was also aware of an epidemic-scale rise in obesity and diabetes in Asia, fuelled by \"bad eating habits, poor food choices, inactivity, urbanisation and stressful lifestyles\", he says.\n\nThe International Diabetes Federation estimates that about 60 per cent of the number of people with diabetes worldwide (to reach 380 million by 2025) are in Asia. Obesity also plays a role in the development of Type 2 diabetes, and it's growing at an alarming rate with the rise in online activity and decline in physical mobility.\n\nMeanwhile, only about 2 per cent of Asians are members of gyms. \"So what happens to the other 98 per cent who want to get fit and healthy?\" he asks. Seeing potential, he quit his venture capitalist job and moved to Singapore early last year, to set up a fitness platform that includes an integrated mobile solution like Active8me.\n\nWith recipes, exercise plans for the outdoors, gym or home, and even motivational messages, Active8me integrates exercise, nutrition and mindsets for holistic health. \"This is important in design, because to see real change, you need to address all of these elements,\" he says.\n\nThe information is designed by a team of experts he has pooled together - athletes, fitness experts and dietitians - to make Active8me practical and achievable. The Asian recipes are a big plus while the video workouts make home workouts a cinch.\n\nActive8me is now available on Android and IOS. After a three-week free trial, you can choose the monthly, three-monthly (recommended to see results) or annual subscriptions from S$28.98 to S$268.98 to use the app. More information at\n\nwww.active8me.com\n\n.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be much smaller than today.\"\n\nPolicy makers are coalescing around a plan for gradually reducing the central bank's US$4.5 trillion in assets with a predictable process aimed at minimizing market reactions.\n\nThe concern is to avoid a repeat of the so-called \"taper tantrum\" of 2013, when then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke sent shock waves rippling through global markets with a mere suggestion that the central bank would taper asset purchases.\n\nMr Williams, who does not vote on monetary policy this year, said the downsizing will be \"boring\" and take place \"in the background\". It will leave the Fed with assets that will still be significantly larger than they were before the crisis.\n\n\"It's not a question of are we going to reduce the balance sheet significantly,\" he said.\n\n\"It's really like at the end, is that balance sheet going to have something like two trillion or two and a half trillion or something like that. I'm not making decisions. We haven't made decisions.\"\n\nHis views echo those of Cleveland Fed's Loretta Mester, also a non-voter this year. In an interview with Germany's Handelsblatt she called for balance-sheet unwinding to start this year and to be communicated \"at the right time\".\n\nIn a speech in Singapore earlier on Monday, Mr Williams reaffirmed his view that a total of three interest-rate increases this year make sense in light of \"very good\" data from the US economy. The Fed raised rates in March.\n\nUnemployment is expected to keep falling throughout the year and recent somewhat weak inflation numbers in March should not lead to a change in the Fed strategy if they remain temporary blips, he said.\n\n\"The economy is doing well, with good momentum,\" he said in the Bloomberg TV interview.\n\n\"We have a way to go on inflation goals but I am optimistic about the economy.\"\n\nThe policy tightening aims to avoid letting the economy run \"too hot for too long,\" Mr Williams added.\n\nThe San Francisco Fed president also said he is not overly concerned over China's slower growth but rather about the long-term sustainability of its financial system.\n\n\"What worries me in China is not this year or next year,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the pretty significant build-up of debt and risk in their financial system, which poses more of a risk over the next five years or so.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/1fc099b774ef75c6873ed5ba1dbb155bb4a3503e08aaebe16bb607fb52d27959?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams sees a \"much smaller\" Fed balance sheet in about five years, at the end of an unwinding process that could start with a \"baby step\" later this year."}]}

Analysts said the change would give authorities more control over the fixing and restrain the influence of market pricing.\n\nWhile a more tightly managed currency could give China breathing room to push forward with a deleveraging campaign that is popular among Western investors, it would mark a step back from President Xi Jinping's 2013 pledge to give markets a central role. The central bank's existing fixing system won international plaudits for being more market-oriented and helped the yuan win a spot in the IMF's basket of reserve currencies.\n\n\"The counter-cyclical adjustment factor sounds like an increased role for the fixing to be nudged away from where markets would set it,\" said Sean Callow, a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking Corp in Sydney. \"The authorities' actions give the impression that they are more worried about yuan stability than declared in their public statements.\"\n\nPropping up the yuan has been a policy priority this year as Chinese authorities try to stem capital outflows and prevent financial shocks before an important leadership reshuffle in the ruling Communist Party at the end of 2017. The stakes have increased in recent weeks after the regulatory clampdown on leverage roiled domestic bond and equity markets.\n\nUnder the new reference rate formula communicated to len-ders by the People's Bank of China this week, institutions that provide quotes for the fixing will add a counter-cyclical factor to their existing models, which take into account the previous day's official closing price at 4.30 pm local time and changes in baskets of currencies, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. Banks are currently tweaking and testing their models and will start providing quotes using the new system soon, the people said.\n\nChina's foreign exchange market can be driven by irrational expectations, resulting in \"unreal\" supply and demand that increases the risk of overshooting, according to an official statement on Chinamoney.com, which is run by China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The counter-cyclical factor may ease \"herd actions\" and help guide investors to pay more attention to economic fundamentals, according to the statement.\n\nThe yuan is restricted to moves of no more than 2 per cent on either side of the reference rate.\n\nFor China's government, the existing market-based fixing system's downside is that it makes the exchange rate more difficult to control. The yuan's 6.5 per cent slide in 2016 created a vicious circle of capital outflows and currency weakness, prompting officials to burn through more than US$300 billion of foreign exchange reserves and introduce tighter capital controls.\n\nAuthorities may see the new fixing formula as a cheaper way to stabilise the yuan. Officials have already used the reference rate to guide the currency higher in recent weeks, setting the fixing at levels that were consistently stronger than analysts predicted.\n\n\"The PBOC has been fixing with a major dose of discretion,\" said Sue Trinh, head of Asia foreign exchange strategy at RBC Capital Markets in Hong Kong. \"We can consider this 'counter-cyclical adjustment factor' as using that discretion.\"\n\nWhile the yuan has fluctuated in a narrow band around 6.9 per US dollar for most of this year, the currency strengthened out of that trading range over the past two days amid suspected government intervention. The yuan gained 0.1 per cent to 6.8622 per US dollar as of 5.57 pm local time on Friday, heading for the biggest two-day advance since late March.\n\nBy taking steps to scale back the market's role in the fixing formula, authorities may undermine efforts to make the currency more freely traded, according to Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING Groep NV in Singapore.\n\n\"If the yuan endgame is a free float like the other major currencies, refining the PBOC fixing mechanism is a retrograde step,\" he said.

In Singapore today, we have a 65-per-cent consumer brand awareness. Listing in Singapore has a very strong attraction for us.\"\n\nChew Sutat, head of equities and fixed income at SGX, added that there is liquidity in the local bourse, as well as sufficient investor appetite here for growth or \"disruptive\" companies.\n\n\"Hong Kong (Stock Exchange) has a market cap - in terms of listed companies - about eight times the size of Singapore. But the overall market trades about six times the size of Singapore. From a relative liquidity basis, Singapore is more liquid.\"\n\nHe said that Singapore has a relatively global investor base, and institutional investors \"who like growth stories\" and are keen to bet on startups.\n\nThe country's compactness makes it a good destination for IPOs, added Greg Mittman, chief operating officer of Internet service provider MyRepublic. \"It's nice to know that if there is a problem, you can take a taxi and go across town (to resolve it).\"\n\nHe pointed to Singapore as a launchpad for tech businesses, for it is one of the most advanced markets in terms of regulations, and its consumer tech-savviness is \"24 months ahead of New Zealand and Australia\".\n\nMyRepublic is currently exploring an IPO, from which it is about 18 months away, Mr Mittman revealed. \"We've started the process to look at exchanges. It's frustrating because there is no perfect venue. It's literally a process of deciding which poison you want to drink.\"\n\nWhile Nasdaq presents \"size issues\" and is \"very far away\" for a firm that is based in Asia, Hong Kong \"has an issue with being very Chinese-centric, so you run the risk of getting lost\".\n\nMr Mittman added: \"Singapore is not perfect - it has well-known issues. But again, there is no silver bullet.\"\n\nEric Loh, CEO of Trendlines Medical Singapore (TMS), acknowledged that a challenge faced by \"disruptive\" companies here is an absence of research coverage. But he said that the onus is on such companies to articulate their growth and business models to investors and research houses.\n\nTMS is a medical technology (medtech) startup incubator of The Trendlines Group, an Israel-based, Catalist-listed incubator and the first such company to be listed on SGX.\n\nAsked why Trendlines chose Singapore as a listing destination, Mr Loh said: \"We look for fertile ground for innovation and at the overall environment. Singapore has the critical infrastructure (for medtech).\"\n\nRobert Lempka, CEO of online social trading platform Ayondo, said an IPO is about timing and sentiment. Of his fintech company (which is currently eyeing a listing on SGX), Mr Lempka said: \"Clearly, there is a big drive in Singapore for fintech. There is no fintech listing (on SGX) for the time being ... and it can only be good for the stock if you are the first one.\"\n\nMalcolm Koo, head of institutional equities sales (Asean markets) at CIMB Securities, said that it all boils down to IPO price. \"If the price is right, there will be demand.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In order to deter North Korea, we will take concrete action with the United States,\" he said.\n\nIn Washington, a National Security Council spokesman said Trump had been briefed on the launch.\n\nSouth Korea's new president, Moon Jae In, ordered a meeting of the national security council to assess the launch, which came a day after North Korea said leader Kim Jong Un had overseen a test of a new anti-aircraft weapons system.\n\nICBM GOAL\n\nThe isolated regime has been stepping up efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can deliver a nuclear warhead to the continental United States.\n\nThe missile launches, and Pyongyang's threat to stage its sixth nuclear test, have prompted calls for tougher UN sanctions and a warning from Trump that military intervention was an option under consideration.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday's missile had a flight range of about 450km.\n\nJapan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters the missile appeared to have fallen into the country's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) - waters extending 200 nautical miles from its coast.\n\nThe regime has carried out two atomic tests and dozens of missile launches since the beginning of last year, with multiple sets of UN sanctions failing to halt its weapons push.\n\nFollowing North Korea's test-firing of what analysts said was its longest-range rocket yet earlier this month, the UN Security Council vowed to push all countries to tighten sanctions against Pyongyang.\n\nBut China, the North's main trade partner and ally, has made it clear that the push for diplomatic talks - not imposing more sanctions - was the priority.\n\nThe United States has said it is willing to enter into talks with North Korea - but only if it halts its missile and nuclear tests.\n\nKim Jong Un has sought to ramp up North Korea's nuclear programme under his rule, saying the regime needs atomic weapons to defend itself against the threat of invasion.\n\nThe UN Security Council adopted two sanctions resolutions last year to pile pressure on Pyongyang and deny the regime the hard currency needed to fund its military programmes.\n\nIn all, six sets of sanctions have been imposed on North Korea since it first tested an atomic device in 2006.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

I can't imagine how it's going to be,\" Sato, winner of just one prior IndyCar race, said of the likely reaction in his homeland.\n\nSato shouted into his radio and punched the air after denying Brazil's Castroneves in his bid to become just the fourth driver to win the Indy 500 four times.\n\n\"He drove unbelievable,\" Andretti said of his least-heralded driver's performance in a thriller that saw pole-sitter Scott Dixon of New Zealand escape serious injury in a spectacular crash and Formula One star Fernando Alonso's race killed by engine failure.\n\nSato, who started from the second row, beat Castroneves by two-tenths of a second.\n\n\"I couldn't do what he was doing (on the closing laps),\" Castroneves said.\n\nRookie Ed Jones, born in Dubai, was third, followed by Britain's Max Chilton - who led a race-high 50 laps - Brazil's Tony Kanaan, Colombia's Juan Pablo Montoya and 2016 winner Alexander Rossi of the United States.\n\nThe hectic race featured 35 lead changes among a race-record 15 drivers.\n\nThat included Spain's Alonso, who rocked racing when he opted to play hooky from Formula One's Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday to tackle the 4km Indianapolis Motor Speedway.\n\nDespite his Formula One pedigree, Alonso faced a welter of new challenges. He had never raced before on an oval, never driven an IndyCar and hadn't done a rolling start since his karting days.\n\nBut he challenged for the lead much of the day, leading 27 laps before his Honda engine blew after 179 of 200 laps.\n\nHonda engine failures also ended the hopes of Ryan Hunter-Reay and Charlie Kimball.\n\n\"I felt the noise, the engine friction and then I backed off and saw the smoke from the exhaust,\" said Alonso, who received a rousing ovation as he exited his vehicle.\n\n\"I think we deserved at least to finish the race ... who knows what position we could be.\" Despite the anti-climactic finish, Alonso called his month of May - from rookie training through qualifying and the race - \"one of the best experiences in my career,\" intimating he would consider coming back to try again.\n\nDixon survives scare\n\nDixon's day ended in much more frightening fashion when, after 53 laps, his car was hit by that of Jay Howard after the Briton went into the wall.\n\nThe Kiwi's car was catapulted into the air, then slid sideways on the inside safety barrier, flames erupting as the back end of the car was ripped away.\n\nMiraculously, Dixon climbed out of the car and walked away under his own steam, as did Howard.\n\n\"I'm a little beaten up there, it was a bit of a rough ride,\" said Dixon, a four-time IndyCar series champion, who later returned to the track infirmary to be fitted with a boot on his sore left foot and ankle.\n\nCastroneves just avoided being caught up in the incident, driving under Dixon's car as it was spiraled through the air.\n\nOther mishaps included a crash on lap 122 that had doctors checking out 1996 winner Buddy Lazier for chest pain, and a five-car crash on a restart from a caution period just 17 laps from the finish.\n\nSato, 40, avoided it all to seize the historic victory that eluded him in 2012 - when his last-lap bid to pass Dario Franchitti for the lead ended with a spin into the wall.\n\nDespite that memory he had no qualms about taking on Castroneves when it counted.\n\n\"Helio is just a gentleman, and I knew I was racing against a real champion,\" he said.\n\n\"When Helio came up beside me with three laps to go, I decided this was the moment and I just had to go for it.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/30a6702560ac1a60ddaae1062aea68f56de51dea053a0d7497bbd40e68f45daf?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Japanese driver Takuma Sato of Andretti Autosport celebrates in Victory Circle after winning the 101th running of the Indianapolis 500 auto race at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana on 28 May 2017."}]}

Travellers also faced hold-ups at Gatwick, but no flights were cancelled.\n\nBA cancelled all its flights out of the two airports on Saturday after the IT failure, which shut down all of the carrier's check-in and operational systems and affected call centres and its website.\n\nHowever, it did not appear to be a cyber-attack, according to chairman and chief executive Alex Cruz, who said the root cause appeared to be a \"power supply issue\".\n\nBritain is still recovering from a ransomware attack that crippled crucial infrastructure earlier this month, including computer systems at the National Health Service.\n\n'Horrible time'\n\nBA's outage came on a busy weekend in Britain, where Monday is a public holiday and many schoolchildren are beginning a week's holiday.\n\n\"This has been a horrible time for customers, some of you have missed holidays, some of you have been stranded on aircraft and some of you have been separated from your bags. Many of you have been stuck in long queues while you waited for information,\" Mr Cruz said in a video statement on Sunday.\n\nThe airline advised passengers not to come to the two airports unless they had confirmed bookings, with disruption expected throughout the holiday weekend.\n\nMr Cruz warned that Heathrow terminals were still \"very congested\" and told passengers not to arrive too early, as they may only be admitted 90 minutes before their departure.\n\nThe carrier said those unable to fly would be offered a full refund.\n\nAn AFP photographer at Heathrow's Terminal 5 on Saturday said many travellers were waiting outside the departure area with their luggage in \"chaotic\" scenes.\n\n'Ruined honeymoon'\n\nTearful passenger Melanie Ware flew from Los Angeles to Heathrow for a connecting flight to Venice on Saturday for her honeymoon.\n\nShe said that flight was cancelled, and another flight she rebooked for Sunday was also cancelled, while there was no sign or news of the couple's luggage.\n\n\"British Airways has ruined our honeymoon,\" she told Sky News.\n\n\"They're not helping us at all.\"\n\nPassengers were asked to contact the airline in order to locate their luggage, after many were forced to leave Heathrow without claiming their bags.\n\nThe carrier said it was \"extremely sorry\" for causing inconvenience over the holiday period.\n\nBritish Airways has suffered other IT glitches recently, leading to severe delays for passengers in July and September last year.\n\nIAG, the parent group of British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, earlier this month reported a 74-per cent slump in first-quarter net profit to 27 million euros (S$41.46 million), due in large part to a weak pound.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/0b06b98d75797fea2e207bd31c3037d053dcaedb3cf23ec74785c5dbbaae622b?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "People waiting with their luggage at the British Airways check in desks at Heathrow Terminal 5 in London, Britain on 28 May 2017."}]}

The second phase of the project will be a food safety testing centre to support domestic food demand.\n\nKSH previously intended to launch part of the first phase in mid 2017, but were informed that the two parts would then be considered separate developments, with setbacks required for each.\n\n\"About 20 to 30 per cent of the land could have been lost to setbacks. It was not worth it,\" said Choo Chee Onn, KSH executive chairman and managing director.\n\nAs a result, KSH has resubmitted its application to use the land as one parcel, minimising land loss.\n\nAbout 500 of the 3,008 residential units will be released when the launch commences in the second half of 2017, with more units to be released as each batch is sold, said Mr Choo.\n\nHe declined to reveal the targeted initial launch price, but said that from past experience in the Chinese market, KSH expects prices to rise sharply with each phase.\n\nFor instance, units in the Sequoia Mansions project in Tongzhou, Beijing, went for 2,800 yuan per square metre in the first phase, but sold at 24,000 yuan per sqm in the fourth and final phase.\n\nKSH's property investments in the UK and Japan continue to provide a steady stream of recurring income. The company also has a 4.95 per cent stake in a residential development joint venture project in Brisbane, Australia, and Mr Choo says it will continue exploring its opportunities in the country.\n\nHowever, KSH is keeping an eye on the situation close to home even as it ventures abroad. Mr Choo says the Singapore property market is recovering, albeit slowly, and KSH expects to return its focus to the local market when it does.\n\n\"The cooling measures cannot be there forever. Slowly they will let go, and once they do, prices will jump,\" he said.\n\n\"I think there are a lot of buyers and they are getting impatient. We can now look for more sites, because the atmosphere has changed.\"\n\nKSH on Friday reported a 33.4 per cent drop in net profit to S$41 million for the year ended March 31, mainly due to lower group revenue and share of results of associates.\n\nIt is also part of the consortium that recently secured residential property Rio Casa in Hougang, and holds a 35 per cent stake in the en bloc purchase.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ad and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further.\n\nGoogle senior vice-president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in the coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working.\n\n\"Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,\" he said.\n\n\"Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey - from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.\"\n\nReal-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide \"a complete view\" of marketing performance, according to the company.\n\nUsing artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better understand consumer behaviour to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference.\n\nAttribution promises to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money's worth at the firm's online venues.\n\nFor several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Mr Ramaswamy noted. \"Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,\" he said. \"You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.\"\n\nReal-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handled in \"a secure and privacy-safe way\", with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymised forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company.\n\nTying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a \"holy grail\" for advertisers , and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) senior policy analyst Jay Stanley.\n\nHe said Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenet of privacy - that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with.\n\n\"This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step towards increased monitoring of individuals,\" he said.\n\nMr Stanley expects Google to be on its best behaviour when it comes to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the \"enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive\".\n\n\"We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven towards monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,\" he said \"It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.\"\n\nGoogle and Facebook dominate the online ad world and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group.\n\nData showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, he reasoned. \"You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money.\" AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

A contrived supply chain engineered for carousel fraud would typically start with an importation of goods and the sale of the same goods to a domestic buyer with GST collected.\n\nThe seller then disappears without handing over the GST to the tax authorities. The goods then change hands via a series of businesses (which act as a buffer) with the last party exporting the goods (which are zero-rated).\n\nThe syndicate continually re-exports and re-imports the same goods in a \"carousel\" system, with the last party in the chain making a GST claim for the goods purchased to be exported.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

That works out to about US$60 per square foot to start, and nearly US$74 over the full term of the lease for the offices at 50 Hudson Yards. The company also will be responsible for its operating expenses at the building and a share of property taxes, which will add about US$30 a square foot to the lease, a source with knowledge of the transaction said.\n\nThe lease is one of the largest ever in Manhattan in terms of size and value of the overall contract.\n\nThe average asking rent in April for midtown Manhattan office space was US$84.09 a square foot, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Along Park Avenue, near where BlackRock is currently located, asking rents averaged US$91.13 a square foot.\n\nHigh-end \"trophy\" properties, such as 50 Hudson Yards, often rent at higher rates than average. The developing district has also attracted Coach Inc, Wells Fargo Securities and the National Hockey League.\n\nThe success of the Hudson Yards district has already moved the centre of Manhattan's office complex from BlackRock's current location, in the coveted Plaza District in midtown, south and westward to the new development.\n\nThe BlackRock lease was agreed on Wednesday and starts on May 1, 2023.\n\nFor the time being, BlackRock has offices in two buildings on 52nd Street off Park Avenue, along with other locations.\n\nIts new building, which is expected to be finished in 2022 and be the city's fourth-largest office tower, will include 15 floors of a 58-story tower developed by Related Cos LP and Oxford Properties Group Inc. It also includes a 400-seat auditorium.\n\nBlackRock received a US$25 million tax credit from New York state as part of the move on the condition the company creates 700 new jobs and retains staffing in the city of 2,700 for a decade.

Fitch said on Thursday that it expects the banks will do so, but on less favourable terms.\n\nThe cut from Fitch came as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it has raised its deemed interest in Noble Group to almost 8 per cent. This disclosure on Friday follows a similar statement about a rise in deemed interest from Morgan Stanley, which came after the close of trade in Singapore on Thursday. Mitsubishi UFJ's filing noted its stake of more than 20 per cent in the New York-based bank. Both sets of statements said the circumstances that gave rise to the changes in the banks' interests were down to \"stock borrow\".\n\nMorgan Stanley has a 7.95 per cent stake, which is deemed rather than direct, at the same time that it has been mandated by Noble Group to help review its strategic alternatives. Morgan Stanley spokesman Nick Footitt declined comment.\n\nThe crisis at Noble Group, which declined to comment on Fitch's cut or Morgan Stanley, has intensified this week amid rising investor concern about its ability to revive its business and meet debt obligations. The firm's shares and bonds have plunged since S&P Global Ratings flagged the risk of a default within a year; Muddy Waters founder Carson Block has predicted that Noble Group will almost certainly have to undergo a restructuring.\n\nFitch said: \"The downgrade and rating watch negative reflect the need for Noble to address debt maturities of $2 billion to $2.1 billion over the next 12 months.\"\n\nFitch has cut its score on the company and its unsecured notes by three notches from BB- to B-, six steps below investment grade. \"The continuous negative news about the company and resultant weak sentiment is likely to make refinancing negotiations more difficult than we expected.\"\n\nS&P's score at CCC+ and Moody's Investors Service at Caa1 are seven steps below investment grade.\n\nNoble Group's shares have lost more than 75 per cent this year, with the dive deepening this month after a first-quarter loss and ratings cuts by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, which reduced its assessment on May 16.\n\nThe Singapore-listed shares ended level at 42 Singapore cents on Friday, valuing the company at S$551 million.\n\nAnnisa Lee, the Hong Kong-based head of Asia ex-Japan flow credit analysis at Nomura International (Hong Kong) Ltd, said: \"It's unusual for a rating agency to cut a company twice in such a short space of time and by that many notches.\"\n\nFitch said on Friday that multiple-notch rating changes do occur \"when exceptional circumstances warrant it\". It cited the challenges faced by Noble Group, including the debt maturities coming due, as well as negative news and weak sentiment.\n\nThe maturities Noble Group faces between next month and May 2018 comprise US$600 million of secured debt, a US$1.1 billion unsecured term loan and US$380 million of senior notes, said Fitch, but noted the \"strength of Noble's balance sheet, with a high working capital/total debt ratio, low portion of secured debt and significant amount of assets available to pledge\".

Most traders expect the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at their upcoming meeting at mid month. The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting minutes that were released over the past week suggested however that there were concerns about the slower US economy.\n\n\"The meeting minutes were neatly packaged with a dovish undertone. Although expectations of a rate hike in June were realised when Federal Reserve officials said it would 'soon be appropriate' to raise rates again, the longer-term hiking path remains clouded,\" FXTM Research analyst Lukman Otunuga said.\n\nThere are other reasons investors will keep a hawk eye on the US - politics, of course. More damning reports surfaced from US newspapers over the weekend surrounding the US presidency, this time a report that President Donald Trump's son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, had undisclosed contacts with the Russian envoy.\n\nFormer FBI director James Comey has agreed to testify in open session after the Memorial Day holiday on Monday about the FBI's probe into Russian meddling in last year's presidential election. Reports, however, say that the White House could try to exert pressure to bar Mr Comey from disclosing details. It remains to be seen how this will unfold.\n\n\"We would not be surprised should we find any aggravation of the situation in the Trump-Russia investigation inviting bearish sentiment for both the US equity and currency markets. This could, in turn, trigger a sell-off in global markets once again,\" said IG market strategist Jingyi Pan.\n\nThere is also a fortnight to go until the snap elections in the UK.\n\nThe UK statistics office recently revised down, albeit modestly, its first quarter growth estimates. \"Despite initial signs that things may not be as bad, Brexit is seemingly starting to weigh on the British economy,\" said Rabobank Research. Brexit anxieties amid election uncertainty could weigh on equity markets.\n\nThin markets at the start of the week is likely with China and Taiwan markets closed on Monday and Hong Kong to follow suit on Tuesday.\n\nJapan, the world's third largest economy, is set to release a slew of data over the week including jobs, retail sales, manufacturing and housing starts. The economy is performing well this year and a weak yen is supporting export-facing manufacturers although the boost from global tech cycle is fading, said Moody's Analytics.\n\nIndia and South Korea will report GDP figures while China will release May's manufacturing data which Moody's Analytics expects would likely show a slight recovery from an \"overdone\" deterioration in April.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Singapore Exchange's investor education portal My Gateway, Singapore's Straits Times Index has chalked up a total return of 14.1 per cent year-to-date, reflecting the domestic economy's robust performance and brighter outlook.\n\nSo far, the local market's barometer has outperformed its regional counterparts namely Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Japan.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That drove the US dollar to its lows of the year against some currencies, a positive if you are a large US corporation. This week, the US dollar could well rebound, leaving stock bulls in something of a quandary, if jobs data is strong enough to warrant a more aggressive position from the central bank.\n\nThere's something of a debate as to whether the \"reflation trade\" - the purchase of economically sensitive sectors as a play on President Donald Trump's pro-growth policies and perceived economic strength - is working or not, now that the Trump agenda has stalled. Last week, the industrial sector received a shot in the arm from a multibillion-dollar arms deal brokered by Mr Trump with Saudi Arabia. Still, as has been the case for weeks, more counter-cyclical sectors such as utilities, telecommunications and healthcare have been among the leaders, just as they were in the latter, slow-growth days of Barack Obama's presidency.

Chinese officials said that they were \"considering\" a change in their procedures that would reinforce their control of the currency - a kind of statement usually indicating a policy had already been approved. The move would essentially bring more short-term stability to China's financial system, already the subject of renewed focus after Moody's Investors Service downgraded its credit rating on China's bonds on Wednesday, citing the country's mounting debt.\n\nBut a move with the currency, the renminbi, would signal that China was retreating from promises it made to the world in recent years to open up its financial system - and many economists say China needs to do that if it wants to continue to grow at a healthy, sustainable pace.\n\nThe China Foreign Exchange Trade System, which is controlled by the central bank, said that it might change the way it sets a value each morning around which the country's currency is allowed to fluctuate through the day.\n\nEvery weekday, the government sets a benchmark value for the renminbi against what is supposed to be a basket of currencies, although the dollar dominates. The renminbi is then allowed to rise or fall in value only 2 per cent from the benchmark during the day. That benchmark is supposed to be based on the currency's value the day before.\n\nOn Friday, the government said it was considering introducing a \"countercyclical variable\". A better name might be \"fudge factor\". It means that the government would no longer have to follow the previous day's closing price in setting that day's benchmark.\n\nChina does not disclose much about the inner workings of its currency, but some variation of the policy may be in place. The currency has settled into trading range at or just below 6.9 to the US dollar, just below the psychologically important level of seven to the dollar.\n\nMany Wall Street analysts say the currency should be a bit weaker, though they disagree on the degree. More broadly, many say the renminbi is now closer to its true value than it was in earlier years, when Beijing faced deep pressure from the US and others to more fairly value the currency.\n\nStarting in summer 2015, when China's stock market crashed and when Beijing shocked the world by abruptly weakening its currency, a lot of money left China. Many in China did not want to hold stocks, bonds or other assets in a currency that was losing value in the broader financial world.\n\nIn response, Beijing tightened its already considerable limits on money leaving the country. Still, the potential for the currency to weaken further, amid doubts over China's debt woes and slowing growth, has lingered over markets.\n\nChina's financial regulators generally do not announce they are considering a shift in something as essential as the value of the currency unless they have already approved it, so the announcement on Friday was widely viewed as a signal to financial institutions, corporations and investors that change was on the way.\n\nFor economists and investors, the change would probably bring stability to the currency, at least in the short term. Among the losers, assuming China kept the currency at current rates, would be Chinese manufacturers, who benefit in foreign markets when the currency weakens.\n\nThe Chinese government contended that the winners would be Chinese companies and households. Their assets are less likely to rise and fall quickly with ups and downs in financial markets.\n\nBut the change to its currency rules would help Beijing too. Since 2015, when the money flight began, China dipped into its vast foreign-exchange hoard to support the currency, reducing that pile of money by an astonishing US$1 trillion. That is politically costly for Chinese officials, who once promoted the country's foreign exchange reserves as the \"blood and sweat\" of its labourers.\n\nThe currency rule change could also reassure the public that the government was firmly in control. In recent weeks, Chinese efforts to rein in some frothy lending caused turbulence in China's financial markets. President Xi Jinping recently urged the country's financial regulators to focus on stability.\n\nThe country's political leaders are scheduled to gather in late autumn in Beijing for a Communist Party Congress, an event held only once every five years to review and to some extent adjust the party's leadership. Few in Beijing want turbulence in the economy or financial markets in the months leading up to the event.\n\nThe Trump administration would most likely also be pleased, because although the rule change would amount to Chinese currency manipulation, it would keep China's currency from weakening. If the renminbi weakened further, it could help Chinese exporters at the expense of US manufacturers.\n\nBut the change marks a big step back from China's goal of turning the renminbi into an international currency such as the dollar and the euro. Global investors want their currencies to move predictably along with financial markets, not based on decisions made behind closed doors.\n\nMore broadly, it signals that China is not in a hurry to lower its financial barriers with the rest of the world. Those barriers create long-term imbalances that could rattle the global economy if they became severe enough.

The 20-year-old Lee, who is of Singaporean and Korean descent, owns that reputation hands down.\n\nOne Championship, the Singapore-based MMA promoter, spent weeks heavily promoting Lee's appearance in the show's main event. It was one undefeated fighter against another, as Lee squared off against her 24-year-old Brazilian challenger Istela Nunes.\n\nThe clock was fast approaching midnight as the main event drew nearer, but even spending nearly five hours in their seats, none of the 12,000 people inside the Singapore Indoor Stadium was even thinking of going home.\n\nLee, who won the inaugural women's atomweight world championship a little over a year ago at this very venue, certainly didn't need any help to get the crowd up on their feet.\n\nEscorting her to the cage was another world champion, national swimmer and Singapore's first Olympic gold-medal winner Joseph Schooling.\n\nThe already deafening roar inside the stadium went up several more decibels as 21-year-old Schooling - the athlete who defeated American Michael Phelps at last year's Rio Olympics - emerged and waved a giant Singapore flag in the air.\n\nMany of the world's greatest singers and bands have performed at the Indoor Stadium over the years, but few of them could have matched the insane volume that greeted Lee's and Schooling's entrance.\n\nSoon, it was down to business. Lee wasn't in tip-top condition, for it was revealed post-fight that she had been battling a bad bout of pneumonia for the past 10 days, and had thrown up repeatedly, even on the day of the event.\n\nOne Championship founder and chairman Chatri Sityodtong was even prepared to cancel his show's main event for the sake of Lee's health, but the young warrior was having none of it.\n\nShe overcame a sluggish start against Nunes and managed to lock in her favourite twister submission move in the first round, but Nunes hung on bravely to survive until the interval.\n\nLee, desperate to end the battle as early as possible, wasted no time in the second round as she pressed her opponent up against the side of the cage, locked in the anaconda choke and pulled her to the ground.\n\nWith two minutes and 18 seconds gone in the second round, a helpless Nunes had no option but to tap out. The crowd, which was on edge just minutes earlier, exploded into life once more as the referee Olivier Coste raised Lee's hand high in the air.\n\nLee wasn't the only big winner at Dynasty of Heroes. Singaporean fighters Tiffany Teo and Amir Khan both won their matches earlier in the evening, against Rebecca Heintzman-Rozewski and Rajinder Singh-Meena respectively.\n\nThe only other championship bout of the night saw American Ben Askren, the reigning Welterweight world champion, make quick work of Malaysia's Agilan Thani in the opening round.\n\nAt the end of it all, the night belonged to Lee, and deservedly so. She said in the ring after her victory: \"I really love you guys, and it's an honour to fight here (in Singapore) as your champion.\"\n\nHer nickname is \"Unstoppable\", and it will surely require an exceptional opponent to stop Lee in her tracks and take that shiny championship belt away from her waist.\n\nIt will be a tough job for the One Championship bigwigs in the coming weeks and months as they scour the globe for another challenger who can go toe to toe with Lee in the ring.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I would not be concerned about it\". His comments were echoed by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.\n\n\"It's both normal in my opinion and acceptable,\" he told ABC News on Sunday.\n\n\"Any way that you can communicate with people, particularly organisations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us, is a good thing...\", he said.\n\nBut the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the Russian election meddling, was dubious about those assertions.\n\n\"You have to ask, well, who are they hiding the conversations from?\" Representative Adam Schiff said in an interview with ABC News.\n\nHe added: \"Ultimately we're going to want Mr Kushner to come before the committee and I fully expect that to happen.\"\n\n\"If you're going to create a back channel that relies solely on the Russian communications and apparatus, that's a really serious issue,\" added Mark Lowenthal, a former CIA assistant director.\n\n\"That's extremely dangerous.\"\n\nAnd others doubted there was any naivete on the part of Kushner who is a mogul in his own right, and an attorney with a graduate business degree at 36 years old.\n\n\"With the avalanche of media attention to 'Russiagate', it's mindboggling why Mr Kushner would conceal this info instead of disclosing it and avoiding a media firestorm,\" former attorney Dean Obeidallah told CNN.\n\nMr Kushner made his secret communications proposal on December 1 or 2 at Trump Tower in New York, according to intercepts of Russian communications reviewed by US officials, the Post reported late Friday.\n\nMichael Flynn, who was Trump's national security adviser for just 24 days before being fired amid questions about meetings he held with the Russian ambassador, was also present, the newspaper reported.\n\nMr Kushner boasts an enormous portfolio of domestic and international responsibilities, underscoring his importance as Mr Trump's chief adviser despite having no experience in politics before the 2016 White House race.\n\nHe is the only person currently in the White House known to be under investigation.\n\nSome critics have called for Mr Kushner's security clearance to be revoked, others say he should temporarily step aside while his ties to Moscow are being reviewed.\n\nThe wider investigation into Russia's alleged election meddling is being led by Robert Mueller, a respected former FBI director who was given broad powers to pursue the case as a special counsel.\n\nThe Senate and House Intelligence committees are also leading their own investigations, but not with an eye to bringing criminal charges.\n\nMeanwhile, some top Republicans cast doubts on the Post's reporting, suggesting the whole episode may be a Russian ruse to throw America's political system into a tailspin.\n\n\"I don't trust this story as far as I can throw it,\" Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/f9964e8e718e5c9dc0b07b85f056529ae787238ecca793c38ad23e5e0715f7ff?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "A White House in crisis scrambled to allay public concern over reports that Donald Trump's son-in-law sought a secret communications link to Russia - a bombshell allegation the US president swatted down as \"fabricated\"."}]}

It is carrying out a study on a possible new railway network in the area.\n\nEarlier governments refused to construct roads near the border, fearing they could be used by Chinese troops in a conflict.\n\nBut in 2014, Mr Modi eased rules on building roads and army facilities near the 4,056km long border in Arunachal Pradesh, signalling a shift in India's strategic policy.\n\nRelations between India and China are dogged by mistrust stemming from a brief border war in 1962 over Arunachal Pradesh which has a large ethnic Tibetan population.\n\nThe two sides regularly accuse each other of border incursions.\n\nChina and India ties soured this month when India boycotted a Beijing summit in opposition to a Chinese-Pakistani economic corridor that runs through disputed Kashmir.\n\nLast month, China protested after India let Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama visit Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/db8f536d26d5b5cb5d5675c562e53f3f32909b63cd6e944eb4df9c67cb9f543f?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "India opened its longest bridge close to the border with China in a move seen as bolstering its defences in a sensitive region."}]}

We just kept on making what we felt we wanted to make,\" he said.\n\nWith just his second full-length feature, Lanthimos won the \"Un Certain Regard\" section at the 2009 Cannes film festival.\n\nHis equally surreal \"Alps\", the story of an underground organisation that helps mourners by impersonating the deceased, won best screenplay in Venice in 2011 and best film at the Sydney awards in 2012.\n\nBy that point, Lanthimos had had enough of trying to make a career in crisis-hit Greece.\n\nTired by the mounting financial constraints - \"Dogtooth\" nearly failed to secure a home release before its success at Cannes - he soon decamped for greener pastures, settling in Britain in late 2011 with his actress spouse Ariane Labed.\n\nNotoriously reclusive and media-shy, Lanthimos told The Guardian in a rare 2012 interview that he had \"served his time\" in Greece and was entitled to look for a better future in a functional enviroment where filmmaking was not regarded as a hobby.\n\n\"I made three films in Greece under very difficult circumstances, so I think I've served my time,\" he told the paper, who called him the \"laughing mortician\" of contemporary Greek culture.\n\n\"But I don't see it as jumping ship. It's not abandonment. One day I'll go back. It might be sooner rather than later.\" It took him a while to find his next project but when he did, the change in scope was palpable.\n\nIn 2015, Lanthimos released \"The Lobster\", a surreal black comedy about modern love, this time with the backing of Irish funds and bankable Hollywood names on the roster.\n\nHis first English-language feature, which featured Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz and John C Reilly, and ended up bagging the third-place jury prize at the Cannes film festival.\n\n\"Lobster\" became an arthouse hit, making over US$5 million worldwide and securing him an Oscar nomination for best foreign language film in 2017 - Greece's first such accolade in over 30 years.\n\nLanthimos was also in talks to film \"The Favourite\", a period drama starring Weisz and Emma Stone about the rule of Queen Anne in 17th-century Britain.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c82d9618654e94a7c112c46865874df2c7b2ad7d977548f320d5ad543b7f118b?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos poses during a photocall on May 28, 2017 after he won won the Best Screenplay prize."}]}

Tarabzouni plans to help transform the company into something more akin to SoftBank Group Corp., which owns stakes in fixed-line and mobile carriers along with e-commerce, web advertising and semiconductor businesses. Saudi Telecom invested US$100 million in Dubai-based ride-hailing app Careem Networks FZ in December, in a funding round that valued the Uber rival at US$1 billion.\n\n\"We have an incredible pipeline already of great opportunities, so we have a great problem of weeding through that pipeline and finding the first initial investments we'd like to make,\" Mr Tarabzouni said. \"Our job is going to be to identify the winners and make bets on them over the next few months.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

But none want an incident aboard one of their airplanes.\n\n\"Whatever comes out we'll have to comply with,\" Oscar Munoz, chief executive officer of United Airlines said at the company's annual meeting last week. \"To the administrations' great credit, they have given us a heads up. We've had constant updates on the subject. We know more than most. And again, if there's a credible threat out there, we need to make sure we take the appropriate measures.\"\n\nAmong the enhanced security measures will likely be tighter screening of carry-on items to allow Transport Security Administration (TSA) agents to discern problematic items in tightly stuffed bags.\n\nThe reason, Mr Kelly said, is that in order to avoid paying fees for checking bags, people are stuffing them to the point where it is difficult to see through the clutter.\n\n\"The more stuff is in there, the less the TSA professionals that are looking at what's in those bags through the monitors can tell what's in them.\" The TSA has begun testing certain new procedures at a limited number of airports, requiring people to remove additional items from carry-on bags for separate screenings.\n\nAsked whether the government would expand such measures nationwide, Mr Kelly said: \"We might, and likely will.\" Speaking on CBS's\n\nFace the Nation\n\n, Defence Secretary James Mattis reiterated his announcement made on May 19 that US-led coalition was now encircling Islamic State fighters in their strongholds in a tactical shift before starting a military campaign to \"annihilate\" them.\n\n\"Our intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive the fight to return home to North Africa, to Europe, to America, to Asia, to Africa,\" he said. \"We're going to stop them there and take apart the caliphate.\" On Friday Mr Kelly told Fox News that if most people knew the extent of the security threat to the United States some people would \"never leave the house.\"\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/ce27b41f666f683afd1ccb6521b1b5d085061ff6560916a65878e3dd203e5318?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The United States might ban laptops from aircraft cabins of all flights into and out of the country, John Kelly, Secretary of Homeland Security, said on Sunday."}]}

Some NGOs have blamed the rising civilian death toll on a push by President Donald Trump's administration to accelerate the pace of combat in an effort to \"annihilate\" the jihadists.\n\nBut the Pentagon contests both the NGOs' death counts and the charge that a new sense of urgency under Mr Trump is to blame.\n\n\"We have not changed the rules of engagement,\" Mr Mattis said.\n\n\"There is no relaxation of our intention to protect the innocent.\"\n\nThe coalition has officially acknowledged responsibility for more than 450 civilian deaths since its bombing campaign began in 2014, including 105 in the Iraqi city of Mosul on March 17.\n\nHowever, Airwars - a London-based collective of journalists and researchers that tracks civilian deaths in Iraq and Syria - reports that coalition strikes have killed at least 3,681 people.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon on Thursday acknowledged that an American bombing attack in Mosul on March 17 claimed at least 105 civilian lives, it blamed munitions stored by the jihadists in the houses targeted.\n\nThat, Mr Mattis said Sunday, showed \"once again the callous disregard that is characterised by every operation they have run.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

Fitch expects the banks will do so, but on less favourable terms, according to a statement late on Thursday.\n\nThe cut from Fitch came as Morgan Stanley emerged as a major shareholder in Noble Group, with a stake of 7.95 per cent, according to three statements to the Singapore exchange, the last of which cited an aggregation of global positions.\n\nThe bank owns the stake at the same time that it's been mandated by Noble Group to review its strategic alternatives, along with Moelis & Co.\n\nThe crisis at Noble Group, which stretches back more than two years, has intensified this week amid rising investor concern about the company's ability to revive its business and meet debt obligations. The firm's shares and bonds have plunged after S&P Global Ratings flagged the risk of a default within a year.\n\nMuddy Waters LLC founder Carson Block has predicted that Noble Group will almost certainly have to undergo a restructuring.\n\n\"The downgrade and rating watch negative reflect the need for Noble to address debt maturities of US$2 billion to US$2.1 billion over the next 12 months,\" Fitch said, cutting its score on the company and its unsecured notes by three notches to B- from BB-.\n\n\"The continuous negative news about the company and resultant weak sentiment is likely to make refinancing negotiations more difficult than we expected.\"\n\nThe B- rating at Fitch is six steps below investment grade. Both S&P's score at CCC+ and Moody's Investors Service at Caa1 are seven steps below that level.\n\nNoble Group's shares have lost more than 70 per cent this year, with the dive deepening this month after a first-quarter loss, and ratings cuts by S&P, Moody's and Fitch, which had reduced its assessment on May 16. The Singapore-listed shares traded 2.4 per cent higher at 43 Singapore cents at 11:43am, valuing the company at S$565 million.\n\n\"It's unusual for a rating agency to cut a company twice in such a short space of time and by that many notches,\" said Annisa Lee, the Hong Kong-based head of Asia ex-Japan flow credit analysis at Nomura International (Hong Kong) Ltd. \"I don't see this happening very often.\"\n\nMultiple-notch rating changes do occur \"when exceptional circumstances warrant it,\" Fitch said in an emailed statement on Friday, citing the challenges faced by Noble Group, including the debt maturities coming due, as well as negative news and weak sentiment.\n\nThe maturities Noble Group faces between next month and May 2018 comprise US$600 million of secured debt, a US$1.1 billion unsecured term loan and US$380 million of senior notes, according to Fitch.\n\nThe agency noted the \"strength of Noble's balance sheet, with a high working capital/total debt ratio, low portion of secured debt and significant amount of assets available to pledge.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nChina clears Synopsys\u2019s US$35 billion Ansys buyout in US win\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:51 PM\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM", "images": []}

I would not be concerned about it.\"\n\nHis comments were echoed by the administration's Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly.\n\n\"It's both normal in my opinion and acceptable,\" he told ABC television on Sunday.\n\n\"Any way that you can communicate with people, particularly organisations that are maybe not particularly friendly to us, is a good thing and, again, it comes back to whatever the communication is, comes back into the government and shared across the government so it's not a bad thing to have multiple communication lines to any government,\" he said.\n\nKushner under fire\n\nMr Kushner made his secret communications proposal on December 1 or 2 at Trump Tower in New York, according to intercepts of Russian communications reviewed by US officials, the Post reported late Friday.\n\nMichael Flynn, who was Mr Trump's national security adviser for just 24 days before being fired amid questions about meetings he held with the Russian ambassador, was also present, the newspaper reported.\n\nMr Kushner boasts an enormous portfolio of domestic and international responsibilities, underscoring his importance as Mr Trump's chief adviser despite having no experience in politics before the 2016 White House race.\n\nHe is the only person currently in the White House known to be under investigation.\n\nSome critics have called for Mr Kushner's security clearance to be revoked, others say he should temporarily step aside while his ties to Moscow are being reviewed.\n\nThe wider investigation into Russia's alleged election meddling is being led by Robert Mueller, a respected former FBI director who was given broad powers to pursue the case as a special counsel after Mr Trump abruptly fired Mr Comey on May 9.\n\nThe Senate and House Intelligence committees are also leading their own investigations, but not with an eye to bringing criminal charges.\n\nMeanwhile, some leading Republicans cast doubts on the Post story's plausibility, suggesting the whole episode may be a Russian ruse to throw America's political system into an even deeper tailspin.\n\n\"We're chasing our tails as a nation when it comes to the Russians,\" US Senator Lindsey Graham told CNN.\n\n\"I don't trust this story as far as I can throw it,\" he said.\n\n\"The whole story line is suspicious.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/a6702fa734bdaa6a31ae5d1b7b5932b532b7a3fa9eb0163f470f50e74f2a78ef?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Returning late Saturday from his first foreign trip as president, Mr Trump geared up to combat concerns over advisers' ties to Russia, including explosive reports about Jared Kushner, his indispensable aide-de-camp."}]}

Before that, he had served as a justice on Brazil's top electoral court.\n\nMr Jardim replacea Osmar Serraglio, a lawmaker from Mr Temer's own party, who had been in that post for just three months. A source close to Mr Temer told Reuters that Mr Serraglio will soon be announced as the new transparency minister.\n\nThe Justice Ministry oversees Brazil's federal police, who along with federal prosecutors are leading massive corruption probes, including the \"Car Wash\" political graft investigation now looking at Temer.\n\nCarlos Sobral, head of the national association of federal police inspectors, said the abrupt change in ministers was worrying.\n\n\"We were surprised with the news of the change,\" he said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Any changes in the Justice Ministry command create uncertainty and worry about possible interference in the work done by federal police.\" Mr Sobral called on Congress to approve a measure pending before the body that would grant autonomy to federal police.\n\nMr Temer's change in ministers came as thousands of protesters gathered on the golden sands of Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro to demand the president's resignation and that direct elections be called.\n\nSeveral of Brazil's most famous actors and musicians led the rally, which despite the star appeal drew a smaller crowd than the 50,000 demonstrators organisers expected. Police said they would not divulge an estimate on the number of people present.\n\nMr Temer has refused to resign and denies any wrongdoing.\n\nRecent polls show that 85 per cent asked want a new election. But it is unlikely to happen as that would require a constitutional amendment be passed through Congress, where scores of politicians are under investigation for graft.\n\nIf Mr Temer falls from office, the constitition mandates that Congress appoint a new president, who would finish the current term that ends on Jan 1, 2019.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2c02674cb5816025381297b94d809366b30ff239f4b8c27f894215ca8f307bbf?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Scandal-plagued Brazilian President Michel Temer on Sunday named a new justice minister, placing a respected legal figure in the position as the leader defends himself against corruption allegations."}]}

In the last few months, journalists, academics, technology experts, civic-minded foundations and well-intentioned politicos have devoted decades of collective brain hours to an all-hands effort to stanch the conspiracy theories and outright falsehoods roiling our democracy.\n\nFacebook and Google have worked up new computer formulas and dispatched dedicated teams of humans to push the corrosive stuff off their platforms or, at the very least, to let readers know when something doesn't look right.\n\nAd makers are pulling their advertising from sites that run false items. And educators are working up \"news literacy\" programmes to teach students how to tell the difference between real, corroborated journalism and naked lies dressed in the colours of veracity.\n\nBut as the Seth Rich story shows, we're going to need a bigger algorithm.\n\nIn case you haven't been following it, the Seth Rich conspiracy holds that before his death (or, in this version of events, assassination) in July, he had been involved in the leaking of Clinton campaign e-mails to WikiLeaks, which the US intelligence community has attributed to Russian-sponsored hackers.\n\nYou can see the partisan appeal. If you don't want to believe US intelligence assessments that the Russians were behind the breach - supposedly to help the electoral prospects of President Donald Trump - and if you don't like all the news about the investigations into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, well, there's an alternative fact set to grab onto: Mr Rich did it and paid for it with his life.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that there's no real evidence for the notion.\n\nThe police in Washington have theorised that a thief may have killed Mr Rich in a botched robbery attempt.\n\nThe Rich story has been kicking around since July, but flared anew last week after FoxNews.com and the Fox affiliate in Washington, WTTG, quoted an investigator working with the Rich family as saying that Mr Rich had been in contact with WikiLeaks before his death.\n\nBut when questioned by Oliver Darcy of CNN, the investigator acknowledged that he had no evidence to suggest any such thing, and that he was only repeating what the FoxNews.com reporter who interviewed him about the case had told him. (Ed Butowsky, a Dallas businessman who criticised Hillary Clinton last year, told CNN that he helped connect the investigator with the Rich family after initially denying it to NBC).\n\nStill, the story lived on as a meme flowing through conservative media, which seemed to relish the chance to change the subject from the torrent of news spilling forth last week on the president's Russia troubles.\n\nAfter calls from Rich's family to retract its article, FoxNews.com did so on Tuesday, saying in a statement that it had not gone through \"the high degree of editorial scrutiny we require for all our reporting\". It removed the article from its site.\n\nBut if you thought that would chasten people pushing the story and lead them to drop it, think again.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Sean Hannity, who had been perpetrating the Rich conspiracy theory on his nightly Fox News show, said on his radio programme: \"I am not Fox.com or FoxNews.com. I retracted nothing.\"\n\nSomething - like a reminder that he is under lucrative contract - must have changed in the hours that followed because Hannity said on his prime-time show on Fox that he would not be \"discussing the matter at this time\" out of \"respect for the family's wishes\". Astute listeners picked up on two other words in his statement: \"For now.\"\n\nLike water, conspiracy theories find their own level. So, where Fox News issued its retraction, International Business Times put up a Facebook post that carried the headline, \"Breaking: Kim Dotcom claims he has evidence that proves murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was involved in the WikiLeaks hack.\"\n\nThe article explained that Kim Dotcom is \"a New Zealand hacker\" - wanted in the US on racketeering charges, which he denies - and the sum total of the report was that he was making a \"claim\".\n\nIt didn't include anything about what the details might be, though the hacker said he would be happy to share those with investigators.\n\nThe unspecified claim was also picked up by the Gateway Pundit (now credentialed by the White House) and the conspiracy site InfoWars, whose Washington bureau chief Jerome Corsi has a long history of spreading corrosive conspiracies.\n\nYou might know him from his first big breakout hit, Unfit For Command, the book of which he was a co-author that formed the basis of the false attack against John Kerry's Vietnam War record during the 2004 presidential campaign.\n\nMillennials may be more familiar with his more recent, anti-Obama \"work\", like Where's The Birth Certificate? (\"Right here,\" Mr Obama had answered.) Those were books, and by today's standards, they may as well have been stone tablets.\n\nActually, as Financial Times recently noted, false reportage dates to at least the propaganda war between Mark Antony and Octavian - fought in the century before the birth of Christ, communicated through coins. Coins became the printed page, which became the political advertisement, which became the cable \"news\" segment, the blog post, the Twitter message and the Facebook post.\n\nSo what is new is the speed of the Internet and the especially fertile soil of our angry political divide.\n\nTake heart, there are optimists. Brad Bauman, a spokesman for the Rich family (who is open about his work as a liberal political consultant), said in an interview that the developments of this week, capped by Fox News' retraction, \"should not just serve as a cautionary tale but it should also serve as a message that in the end, truth does prevail - but we need to be vigilant\".\n\nAnd Alan Miller, the founder of the News Literacy Project, which teaches middle- and high-school students how to \"sort fact from fiction in the digital age\", said the developments of the last year had spurred many more converts to the cause he began pursuing nearly 10 years ago.\n\n\"All the viral rumors, conspiracy theories and hoaxes were a wake-up call for at least some people, and certainly some institutions that are now moving to address this, including news organisations, social media organisations and educational institutions,\" he told me.\n\nBut no matter what the media ecosystem does to stop uncorroborated conspiracies and false information, they will continue to live on as long as there are people eager to spread them, and viewers and readers eager to believe them. All the algorithms in the world can't stop that.

The owner of a New York-based antique frame restoration and replication company recalled: \"We had a nice house, a lot of privacy. And then friends of ours wanted to go out to visit Montauk.\"\n\nAfter \"crawling around\" for a few hours in the area, \"we were like: 'Oh, my God, this is where we want to live\".\n\nSoon after, they discovered 36 acres (14.5 hectares) on the market, with 400 feet (122 metres) of beachfront next to Andy Warhol's compound. (Warhol bought his property, called Eothen, in the early 1970s and used it as a vacation home until his death in 1987.)\n\nAfter hemming and hawing, Mr Wilner said, \"we bought it for the grand price of US$620,000.\" The couple set about building a five-bedroom, four-bath home and by 1994 they had moved in. Over the next 23 years, Mr Wilner said, he sank over US$15 million into landscaping, improvements and additions.\n\nThe 7,000-square-foot house has bounced on and off the market at least four times, according to Zillow Group Inc. Mr Wilner initially listed it in 2008 for US$35 million, took it off the market, put it back on a year later, then bumped its price up to US$50 million. He took it off yet again, relisted it in 2011 and 2015, and then brought it to the market a fourth time in 2016 for US$55 million.\n\nNow it's back on the market a fifth time, listed with Brown Harris Stevens, an affiliate of Christie's International Real Estate, at US$48 million.\n\nProspective buyers will find themselves in possession of one of the largest private properties in Montauk. There's a 2-acre pond filled with wildlife. \"We have 22 wood ducks that live there, too,\" says the owner.\n\nThere are dunes, forest and a rolling lawn that leads down to the water, where two natural jetties 1,000 feet apart extend 200 feet into the ocean.\n\nThe house itself comprises three levels, which are connected by both an elevator and a sweeping mahogany-clad staircase.\n\nThe top floor contains the kitchen, living room, and dining room, which opens onto a terrace that runs the length of the house. While the ground floor has most of the bedrooms, including a master suite, the lower floor has more guest rooms, a conference room, and a home theatre, which includes a 14-foot screen and \"concert-level\" sound system. All the floors are marble, and the house is warmed with radiant heat.\n\nWhen Mr Wilner and his wife bought the house, Montauk was largely undeveloped.\n\nThere was Warhol's estate, and Ralph Lauren had a property, as did Robert De Niro. But most roads in the area were unpaved, and many weekenders stayed nearby in the more fashionable Hamptons.\n\nNow, of course, that's changed, and property values have skyrocketed. The Warhol estate, for instance, which is about 6 acres, sold in 2015 to the art dealer Adam Lindemann for US$49 million.\n\nThere's a ranch on the other side of Wilner's property owned by J.Crew Group Inc. chief executive officer Mickey Drexler (who also owned the Warhol estate, until he sold it to Mr Lindemann).\n\n\"Now you've got people like (art dealer) David Zwirner, Paul Simon, and (photographer) Peter Beard,\" said Mr Wilner. \"Plus, the airport is close by.\"\n\nMr Wilner, who spends \"most of his disposable income on helicopter rides\", said the trip from Manhattan to Montauk takes about 45 minutes, which can be cut to 30 if the traveller is \"willing to pay extra for a Sikorsky\".

Armed soldiers are patrolling the streets amid fears of more attacks, say media reports.\n\nThe last time the UK was on maximum terrorist alert was 2007, after the attempted bombing of Glasgow Airport.\n\nSanghamitra Bose, general manager (Singapore) for American Express Global Business Travel, said: \"While we have not seen companies looking to alter travel plans to the UK following the attack in Manchester this week, we are working with customers and suppliers to monitor the situation.\"\n\nShe said London is the choice business travel destination outside of the Asia-Pacific for Singapore's business travellers.\n\n\"Therefore, duty-of-care considerations remain absolutely paramount,\" she said.\n\nAlicia Seah, director of public relations at Dynasty Travel, said existing bookings for the holiday period between now and July are unlikely to be affected, though the number of new bookings may slow down in the short-term.\n\nShe noted that the recent terrorist attacks in European cities have not had long-standing impact on the demand for travel.\n\nDemand for hotels and destinations have started to bounce back more quickly after terrorist attacks in recent years because consumers and companies now adopt a carry-on-as-normal mentality, she said.\n\nA spokesman for Singapore Airlines said the airline has also not seen any noticeable shifts in demand for travel to or from the UK.\n\nOver at Chan Brothers Travel, customers are also going ahead with travel plans to the UK and other parts of Europe.\n\n\"We have several groups departing for the UK weekly from now until the end of the June school holidays,\" said a company spokeswoman.\n\nShe added that other popular holiday destinations this June include Japan, Korea, Australia and China.\n\nDynastry Travel said it has had bookings from repeat travellers to Scandinavia, Spain, Portugal, Croatia and Russia as a result of favourable exchange rates for some of these countries, as well as keen interest in more exotic tourist destinations such as the Balkans and Iceland.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

One was the lack of a back-up plan, and the second was a lack of support from the majority shareholders. In these, there was little the requisitioning unitholders could do.\n\nCertainly, having a credible alternative management team to put forward would have helped to give other unitholders more confidence to vote out the incumbent.\n\nHowever, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) rules require the manager to comprise at least three full-time representatives who have at least five years of experience relevant to Reit management. The CEO would also need to have at least a decade of relevant experience.\n\nWhere do you find someone like that? Most people who fit the criteria are already doing just that - Reit management.\n\nJerry Low, the stockbroker who requested the EGM, told The Business Times that the unitholders tried to find suitable candidates, but realised that no existing licensed manager would be willing to stick his or her neck out for another Reit, especially an embattled one.\n\n\"There was no way anyone of credible background would talk to us. It was not so easy. Also, don't forget all the Reit managers knew one another. We are talking about asking one to stand up and be a reserve, ready to take over a Reit manager that a group of unitholders is trying to remove.\"\n\nThere were other tasks that the minority unitholders could not do, such as address the manager's threat that removing it may trigger breaches under Sabana Reit's existing financing arrangements, since this was a conversation between institutions that a retail investor could not be privy to.\n\nThen there was the problem that the majority unitholders may not have been on their side. Mr Low believes that Chinese tycoon Tong Jinquan, with his approximately 6.17 per cent stake in the Reit, had probably agreed to work with e-Shang Redwood when the latter entered the picture with a substantial shareholding of 5 per cent. He believes they both voted against removing the manager.\n\nThe requisitioning unitholders collectively own only about 0.6 per cent of Sabana Reit.\n\nCoupled with the fact that the sponsor, Vibrant Group, and Sabana Reit's management have a combined stake of about 8.5 per cent and most certainly voted against removing the manager, it was no surprise then that the unitholders could not get the simple majority needed to pass the resolution for removal of the manager.\n\nStill, it was not a futile exercise at the end of the day. Two weeks after the EGM, the manager announced material changes, including the resignation of CEO and executive director Kevin Xayaraj, the dropping of the controversial acquisition of an industrial building in Changi South from its sponsor, and the Reit manager's one-time move to cut 75 per cent of its base fees for the first quarter to lessen the dilutive impact on the Reit's distribution per unit.\n\nBesides successfully driving a point to the manager on their frustrations, the unitholders did something more. They provided an important precedent for unitholders of other Reits who may in future want to take a similar course.\n\nIn this regard, more can be done by the authorities and the trustee in support of shareholder activism.\n\nMany unitholders likely do not know how they can contact the trustee, who holds the Reit's underlying assets on behalf of the investors. They are also likely not aware that they can obtain the trust deed of a Reit from the registered office of the Reit manager.\n\nIn view of this, Reits should consider publishing a trustee's contact details clearly on their respective websites, publications and presentation slides.\n\nThe trust deed is a document that is supposed to detail the flow of events after an existing manager is removed. Ironically, after going to lengths to obtain it through a lawyer who is also a unitholder, Mr Low found the document to be mostly silent on what happens after a manager is removed.\n\nMAS can also attempt to offer guidelines on clear steps unitholders can take in the event that they wish to review a Reit's management team.\n\nMAS had in July 2015 done away with an earlier proposal requiring managers to submit themselves for re-appointment by unitholders' approval regularly, because the industry had responded to the consultation paper, saying it is \"not difficult\" for unitholders to convene an EGM to obtain a simple majority to remove a Reit manager.\n\nThe Sabana Reit episode shows that this observation is wrong. It was not an easy feat for the requisitioning unitholders to locate one another through Facebook and organise the EGM. Months were spent researching for information on what can or cannot legally be done, in the absence of a precedent to guide them.\n\nGoing forward, the authorities can consider providing unitholders advice on how to convene an EGM and draw out resolutions for the purpose of reviewing a Reit's management team. Without this, it will take more trial and error and learning from the experience of those who have gone before to provide case studies to learn from.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That's also because it's been quite vulnerable recently,\" said Alexandra Russell-Oliver, currency analyst at Caxton FX in London.\n\nThe euro has enjoyed a bull run this month, driven by ebbing political concerns over France and upbeat batches of economic data that have strengthened expectations for a tightening of central bank monetary policy later this year.\n\nAfter a steady climb in morning trade in Europe, the single currency lost steam and traded 0.1 per cent lower on the day and around half a cent below Tuesday's peak of US$1.1268.\n\nThe Australian dollar was half a per cent lower at US$0.7466 after Wednesday's fall to US$0.7443 following ratings agency Moody's downgrade of China. The Australian dollar is often used as a liquid proxy for China-related trades but, like the Canadian dollar, tends to track closely moves in commodity prices.

The S&P consumer discretionary index closed up nearly 1 per cent.\n\nEuropean shares struggled for direction, with investors hunting for fresh catalysts as a blistering earnings season that helped stocks surge to new highs nears its end.\n\n\"There's no clear and present danger on the horizon,\" Jimmy Chang, chief investment strategist at Rockefeller & Co in New York, said in reference to the gains in US stocks. \"The lack of fear, the complacency is supporting the market.\" Energy shares on both sides of the Atlantic tumbled, however, after a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) disappointed some investors. The S&P energy sector closed down 1.8 per cent, while Europe's STOXX 600 oil and gas index closed down 1.2 per cent.\n\nUS crude prices plummeted as much as 5.7 per cent to US$48.45 a barrel, their lowest level in a week, after Opec agreed to extend output cuts for nine months, dousing hopes for deeper, longer cuts. US crude prices settled down US$2.46 at US$48.90 a barrel.

The Nasdaq Composite ended up 42.23 points, or 0.69 per cent, at 6,205.26.\n\nEurope's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 0.04 per cent at 1,540.78.\n\nThe US dollar was little changed against a basket of major currencies a day after Federal Reserve minutes dialed down expectations of the central bank hiking interest rates soon.\n\nMany investors and strategists expect Fed rate hikes to boost the US dollar.\n\nThe US dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was last roughly flat at 97.224 .\n\n\"The minutes sort of made it clear that the Fed wasn't going to be reducing its balance sheet anytime real soon, and the response was negative for the US dollar,\" said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.\n\nUS Treasury yields fell slightly on the doubts over whether the Fed would raise interest rates more than once by the end of 2017. Bond yields slipped into the lower end of this week's tight trading range with the benchmark 10-year yield hovering around 2.25 per cent.\n\nUS gold futures settled up 0.3 per cent at US$1,256.40.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCapital Markets & Currencies\n\nFrasers Hospitality Trust\u2019s proposed privatisation by sponsor gets SGX in-principle approval\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:54 AM\n\nStocks to watch: OCBC, SGX, Centurion, Sats, Frasers Property, Frasers Hospitality Trust\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:39 AM\n\nAims Financial Group raises stake in Aims Apac Reit to 18.7%\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:35 AM\n\nUS dollar has best week since February on tariff inflation risks\n\nJul 12, 2025 11:52 AM\n\nEurope: Stocks down with bank and healthcare drag, US-EU tariffs in focus\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:56 AM\n\nUS: Stocks edge down from records amid tariff threats\n\nJul 12, 2025 05:45 AM\n\nSingapore stocks notch 5-day rally ahead of GDP data\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:06 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM", "images": []}

I'm doing ok,\" she said of her electoral defeat. \"I won't lie, Chardonnay helped a little too,\" she added to roars of delight.\n\nMrs Clinton implicitly compared Mr Trump to Nixon, the Republican president brought down by the Watergate scandal. He sacked his attorney general in a move some have compared to Mr Trump's firing of FBI director James Mr Comey, who was investigating Russian interference in last year's election and possible collusion by Mr Trump's campaign.\n\nThe former first lady said her class of 1969 was \"furious\" about the then-recent election of Nixon, \"a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice.\"\n\n'ASSAULT ON TRUTH'\n\n\"You are graduating at a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason. Just log on to social media for 10 seconds it will hit you right in the face,\" she said.\n\n\"People denying science, concocting elaborate hurtful conspiracy theories... Drumming up rampant fear about undocumented immigrants, Muslims, minorities, the poor,\" she added.\n\n\"Some are even denying things we see with our own eyes, like the size of crowds,\" she said, again alluding to but not naming Mr Trump, who falsely accused the news media last January of misrepresenting the size of his inauguration crowds. \"Then defending themselves by talking about quote unquote alternative facts.\"\n\nMrs Clinton called Mr Trump's proposed federal budget \"an attack of unimaginable cruelty on the most vulnerable\" that \"grossly underfunds\" public education, mental health care, efforts to combat America's opioid epidemic and threatens to worsen climate change.\n\n\"It matters because if our leaders lie about the problems we face, we'll never solve them. It matters because it undermines confidence in government as a whole.\"\n\nMuch of her speech was a rallying cry for graduates to get politically involved and engaged with their communities.\n\n\"In the years to come, there will be trolls galore, online and in-person, eager to tell you that you don't have anything worthwhile to say or anything meaningful to contribute, they may even call you a nasty woman,\" she said.\n\n\"You don't have to do everything, but don't sit on the sidelines.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/00c07f73025d0be9bd1d12a6642dcf33830edcf88b9f87ba5b5d47e4039c5fb2?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Hillary Clinton launched a stinging attack on Donald Trump on Friday, obliquely comparing him to former president Richard Nixon, who resigned in 1974 to escape impeachment, and savaging the Republican assault on fact-based politics."}]}

The board of SBI in March approved fundraising of as much as 150 billion rupees (S$3.21 billion) through methods including an institutional share sale, rights offering and depositary receipt sale.\n\nSBI hasn't finalized the exact timing and size of any offering, the people said.

Those who have construction facilities can take part in a tender and in the event of victory will get an order as contractors,\" Marat Khusnullin said of the plan to move people into new homes.\n\nActing as contractors will deliver margins several times lower for property firms than if they were developers.\n\nPavel Bryzgalov, director for strategic development at Lider, one of Moscow's biggest real estate companies, said his firm was interested in acting as a contractor but would want to be able to act as co-developer too.\n\n\"Its important for the development companies to have the option to offer part of the flats for the sale,\" Mr Bryzgalov added.\n\nMr Khusnullin said 15.1 million cubic metres - or some 350,000 flats - would be demolished and replaced with 20 million cubic metres of new residential space under the 15-year programme.\n\nThousands of Muscovites protested against the scheme on May 14, with some living in buildings scheduled for demolition saying they do not want to move unless they have guarantees about where they will be resettled.

Now, more sellers in those areas are being forced to cut their prices after values quickly outstripped the spending power of the average buyer.\n\nThe number of asking-price reductions is growing at the fastest rate in outer London boroughs such as Barking & Dagenham and Newham. Discounts have also increased in areas such as Tower Hamlets in the east and Croydon in the south.\n\n\"Peripheral areas, which buyers turned to when inner London became too expensive, have seen considerable inflation recently and reached a point where affordability is stretched,\" said Neal Hudson, founder of researcher Residential Analysts Ltd. \"Before, people got around it with longer-term mortgages, but the limit has been reached.\"\n\nLondon home prices surged 82 per cent in the past decade - led by central areas such as Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster - outpacing wage growth and testing the limits of what buyers can borrow. That led purchasers to seek discounts in the city's lower-cost outer districts, causing values to soar.\n\nThe percentage of sellers cutting prices in April rose the fastest in the eastern borough of Barking and Dagenham, where 28 per cent of properties had reductions, up from 21 per cent in January, according to data compiled by real estate listings website Zoopla. Newham and Redbridge had the second and third-largest increase of sellers lowering prices, the data shows.\n\n\"People are struggling with affordability and the problem is especially acute in London,\" said Ian Sutcliffe, chief executive officer of Countryside Properties Plc. The Brentwood, Essex-based homebuilder has pushed down the average cost of its new homes by 13 per cent in the first half from a year earlier.\n\nMr Sutcliffe says that the bulk of demand for London homes comes from people who work in the capital and can afford to spend between \u00a3400,000 ($715,000) and \u00a3600,000. The current average price is \u00a3680,607, according to Zoopla, while the average Londoner's salary is \u00a334,762.\n\n\"Before, people were moving to areas they wouldn't necessarily want to live in because it was all they could afford,\" said Paula Higgins, chief executive officer of HomeOwners Alliance, a consumer organization for U.K. home buyers. \"Now that prices in those places are becoming out of reach they are just giving up altogether on the idea of buying.\" \"The increase in values in these outer boroughs was definitely underpinning price growth for London as a whole,\" said Lucian Cook, head of residential research for Savills Plc. He estimates that prices in the capital will stagnate this year for the first time since 2009 before rising 3 per cent in 2018. \"What we have seen already with discounts in the higher end market is gradually coming full circle and extending to the more affordable areas.\" Low interest rates will limit the impact of Brexit on London's property market, but prices are already turning south, according to Ailbhe Tobin, an investment associate at J&E Davy Holdings Ltd. Values need to correct after the average price-to-earnings ratio for first-time buyers hit a record high of 10.1 at the end of last year, she said.\n\n\"Some heat needs to be taken out of London property,\" she wrote in a note to investors. \"Even if prices fall by 20 per cent this would still leave them looking expensive at eight times average income.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/51f71fa1bc46881b588ea6ad9b66503f47e99dff2cb7eb4810f4b3065d7a19ca?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "On the less fashionable fringes of London, home sellers are quickly finding out just what the market can bear."}]}

Paul Romer is relinquishing oversight of the Development Economics Group, the research hub of the Washington-based development lender, according to an internal staff announcement dated May 9 seen by Bloomberg. Kristalina Georgieva, the chief executive for the bank's biggest fund, will take over management of the unit on July 1.\n\nDr Romer will remain chief economist, providing management with \"timely thought leadership on trends directly affecting our client countries, including the 'future of work',\" World Bank president Jim Yong Kim said in the note to staff.\n\nDr Romer said he met resistance from staff when he tried to refine the way they communicate. \"I was in the position of being the bearer of bad news,\" he said in an interview. \"It's possible that I was focusing too much on the precision of the communications and not enough on the feelings my messages would invoke.\" It's unusual for the World Bank's chief economist, a role once occupied by heavyweights such as Stanley Fischer and Lawrence Summers, not to run the Development Economics Group, known as DEC, which publishes original research, develops the bank's forecasts and oversees its data. The move raises questions about how much freedom the bank's economists will have to do outside-the-box research on policies to help the world's poorest.\n\n\"The chief economist is essentially parachuted into the bank and put in this very exalted position,\" said Peter Lanjouw, former head of research into poverty and inequality within DEC and now a professor at VU University in Amsterdam and editor of the World Bank Research Observer. Prof Lanjouw, who consults for the bank, said he's spoken to DEC researchers about the matter.\n\nDr Romer, 61, assumed the role in October after taking leave from his position as a professor at New York University. His appointment was hailed as a coup for the World Bank, which is trying to maintain its status as a leading development voice at a time when governments in some rich nations are increasingly reluctant to finance the development of poor nations.\n\nDr Romer pioneered research into \"endogenous growth\", examining how the diffusion of knowledge boosts output. His name often comes up in short lists for the Nobel Prize in economics. But in recent years, his attacks on the credibility of macroeconomic models irritated many of his peers. His combativeness didn't endear him to some of the more than 600 economists who work in DEC, said sources.\n\nDr Romer wanted DEC to set the intellectual agenda among those who think deeply about how to help the world's poorest countries, said a source. The World Bank is already considered a major source of development research, ranking first among institutions in terms of the number of times its work is cited, ahead of Brown University, the London School of Economics and Harvard University.\n\nBut Dr Romer expressed to those around him that the department should communicate more clearly, dive right into public debates, and align its work with the institution's goals of ending extreme poverty and reducing inequality.\n\nIt didn't take him long to shake things up. He declared several positions redundant and enforced term limits on senior managers. In the interview, Dr Romer said he cut more than US$1 million in annual expenses from the group's budget.\n\nDr Romer asked for shorter e-mail and insisted that presentations get straight to the point, cutting staff off if they talked too long, said another source. But researchers didn't like the curt way Dr Romer often conveyed his message, said sources.Researchers were flummoxed by some of his stylistic hangups, including a distaste for the conjunction \"and\". Dr Romer was frustrated with what some see as the dense, convoluted style of many of the department's reports. He pushed researchers to write more clearly, using the active voice to be more direct.\n\nDr Romer said he was surprised by the defensiveness of the group's economists. A study by Stanford University's Literary Lab in 2015 found the bank's use of language has become more \"codified, self-referential, and detached from everyday language\" since the bank's board of governors held their inaugural meeting in 1946. The study coined the term \"Bankspeak\", a vague \"technical code\" that symbolised the lender's organisational drift.\n\nIn an e-mail to staff obtained by Bloomberg, Dr Romer argued that the World Development Report, one of the bank's flagship publications, \"has to be narrow to penetrate deeply\", comparing his vision for the report to a knife. \"To drive home the importance of focus, I've told the authors that I will not clear the final report if the frequency of 'and' exceeds 2.6 per cent,\" said Dr Romer, citing the percentage of the word's use in World Bank documents analysed as part of the \"Bankspeak\" report.\n\nThe \"Bankspeak\" study noted the penchant of World Bank authors to link long chains of nouns with the word \"and\" can produce mind-numbing lists that create the impression of activity.\n\nOne of the study's authors, Stanford English professor Franco Moretti, was sceptical that eliminating the conjunction would improve the clarity of World Bank communications. \"It will take much more than a few fewer 'ands',\" Prof Moretti said in an e-mail.\n\nIn her new role overseeing DEC, Ms Georgieva will look to strengthen the link between research and the bank's lending operations, Mr Kim said in his note to staff. But some scholars worry the unit's independence will suffer if the arrangement is permanent.

A 14.1 per cent increase in ICE revenue to HK$1.3 billion was mainly driven by connectivity modules used in the automotive industry.\n\nValuetronics has been supplying such modules to an automaker through one of its customers since FY2016, and is undergoing qualification by another automaker through the same customer. It expects to obtain the second automaker's approval by late FY2018.\n\nConsumer electronics revenue increased 19.7 per cent to HK$987.1 million. The company noted that by introducing new smart LED lighting products with Internet-of-Things (IOT) features, it was able to mitigate the negative impact of its exit from the mass market LED light bulb business in Q3 2016.\n\nA bonus issue of new ordinary shares of par value 10 HK cents each on the basis of one new share for every 10 existing shares (including treasury shares) was approved by Valuetronics' shareholders on May 22, 2017.\n\nAs a result, earnings per share (EPS) for FY2017 rose to 36.8 HK cents, from restated EPS of 29 HK cents a year ago, based on the new number of shares.\n\nThe company declared a final dividend of 15 HK cents per share and a special dividend of 5 HK cents per share for FY2017, from 13 HK cents and 7 HK cents respectively in the preceding financial year.\n\nValuetronics said it remains optimistic on the growth prospects of the smart LED lighting product, as consumers start to adopt personal wireless lighting systems for their homes.\n\nRicky Tse Chong Hing, chairman and managing director of Valuetronics, said: \"This year is the 10th anniversary of our SGX (Singapore Exchange) listing, and I am happy to note that as a company, we are stronger, resilient and ready today to pursue more opportunities for growth, especially with the emergent IOT trend.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The flat fare option computes a fixed fare, taking into account distance travelled and existing surcharges, providing certainty of fares.\n\nAng Wei Neng, CEO of ComfortDelGro's taxi business, said: \"We are glad to partner Ryde to offer the commuters more choices to book our taxis. Ryde users also have a choice of both the flat fare and metered fare. The car-pooling service, however, is not something on the cards immediately.\"\n\nRyde launched in 2014 as the world's first real-time car-pooling app. With the partnership, users of the app now have an alternative to car-pooling.\n\nTerence Zou, CEO and founder of Ryde, said: \"We are immensely excited to share our platform with the largest taxi operator in Singapore. With this partnership, Ryde will be able to improve user experience when users cannot find a suitable carpooling option.\"\n\nThe company is focused on building social capital, with unique social features. Riders and drivers are able to \"favourite\" each other, and riders can send personal \"Private Requests\" to specific drivers.\n\n\"Our vision is a big one. We're looking to make ride-sharing a more social experience and, in the process, transform the daily commute for every rider and driver in Singapore and beyond. We're confident that through our mobile- based platform, we're close to achieving this vision,\" said Mr Zou.\n\nThe company also aims to provide a sustainable alternative for the daily commute to solve congestion and pollution issues in cities.\n\n\"Ryde helps the government achieve a 'car-lite' Singapore by optimising existing assets - be it taxis or private cars. Our asset light approach allows us to build a more sustainable ecosystem - we can then do much more with less,\" added Mr Zou.\n\nAccording to Ryde, member numbers for the app have grown fivefold, and user-activity has seen a tenfold increase. Other new features for the app are also in the works.\n\n\"We will continue to introduce other taxi services onto our platforms in the coming months and also Ryde Pay, our own cashless payments which can be used to pay for car-pools and taxis,\" said Mr Zou.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That makes it more and more vital to figure out how to spread out the brief but intense bursts of energy harnessed from the sun and wind to the more diffused needs of consumers.\n\nWhile battery storage has received most of the attention so far, hydrogen has \"massive long-term potential\", said Didier Holleaux, executive vice-president at Engie.\n\n\"Batteries are fine for intraday, or a few hours,\" Mr Holleaux said in an interview in Singapore. \"But if you produce energy in summer and need it in winter, or need it to last during a few cloudy days, then hydrogen would be the obvious solution.\"\n\nTo be a solution, though, hydrogen storage costs would have to come down dramatically. A hydrogen-based energy storage system costs about 10 times more than a diesel back-up generator with similar power output, according to a Toshiba Corp presentation at the World Smart Energy Week in Tokyo in March.\n\nHydrogen storage is basically a three-step process: electricity powers a chemical process known as electrolysis that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then stored until it's needed, and is then pumped through fuel cells to generate electricity.\n\nThe biggest hurdle to commercial viability is the electrolysis process, Mr Holleaux said. Manufacturers are trying to make the water-splitting equipment cheaper and more efficient, but are probably 10 to 15 years away.\n\nThe Semakau Island project, which Engie is taking part in along with Singapore's Nanyang Technological University and France's Schneider Electric SE, aims to build demonstration micro-grids that integrate wind, solar, tidal and diesel power along with storage to provide electricity to small island communities not connected to traditional power plants.\n\nThe micro-grid is expected to be operating by October, with hydrogen storage capabilities added next year, Mr Holleaux said.\n\nEngie sees big opportunities for such micro-grids in South-east Asia, especially in the Indonesian archipelago, where nearly 1,000 islands have populations that don't have access to traditional power plants.

The NODX has similarly recovered from a 5.4 per cent fall in the third quarter to grow 2.7 per cent in the final quarter of 2016.\n\nThe NODX slipped 2.8 per cent for the full year of 2016. IE Singapore said NODX in the first quarter of this year rose on the back of increased shipments in both electronic and non-electronic goods.\n\nDomestic exports of electronic products, which accounted for 28 per cent of total NODX, jumped 9 per cent in the first three months of 2017, up from a 1 per cent rise in the previous quarter.\n\nIntegrated circuits rose 21.5 per cent, personal computer parts rose 21.6 per cent, and disk media products rose 10.3 per cent. They contributed the most to the increase in electronic NODX.\n\nNon-electronic NODX, which made up 72 per cent of NODX, increased 17.8 per cent, against a 3.5 per cent gain in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nThe biggest contributors to the rise in non-electronic NODX were specialised machinery (+92.6 per cent), petrochemicals (+41.9 per cent) and non-monetary gold (+28.9 per cent).\n\nNODX shipments to nearly all the top 10 markets jumped in the first quarter, with China (+48.6 per cent), Taiwan (+52.7 per cent) and South Korea (+36.8 per cent) being the three biggest contributors to the jump.\n\nNODX exports to the EU dipped 0.4 per cent.\n\nTotal Trade extended its growth from 4 per cent in the previous quarter to 16.3 per cent in the first three months of 2017. This has also led IE Singapore to adjust upward its full-year growth forecast for trade from 4-6 per cent to 5-7 per cent.\n\nOil trade accounted for the bulk (64 per cent) of the trade expansion in the first quarter. Thanks to higher oil prices, oil trade saw a 77.1 per cent spike, compared to a 15.4 per cent increase in the preceding quarter.\n\nNon-oil trade crept up 6.8 per cent in the first quarter, after a 1.8 per cent increase in the previous quarter.\n\nNon-oil shipments, which includes both NODX and non-oil re-exports (NORX), jumped 10 per cent in the first quarter, after a 0.1 per cent rise in the last quarter of 2016.\n\nNORX rose 6.6 per cent in the first quarter, following a 1.4 per cent drop in the previous quarter.\n\nTotal services trade also continued to rise, posting a 4.3 per cent increase in the first quarter of 2017, better than the 3.4 per cent growth in the previous quarter.\n\nTotal services trade hit S$106.8 billion for the quarter, with both services exports and imports rising 3.9 and 4.6 per cent, respectively.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is being advised by UBS, Macquarie and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\nAnalysts at Royal Bank of Canada and Citi value Lattice at A$2 billion and A$2.3 billion, respectively, including debt, on a discounted cash flow basis.\n\n\"Origin has set the bar quite high.

Lattice, with annual output of around 13 million barrels of oil equivalent, would more than double Beach's production.\n\nBut even for Beach, with a market value of A$1.2 billion, Lattice would be a huge bite.\n\nBeach declined to comment on whether it was bidding, but the company has said in presentations it is reviewing several \"inorganic growth\" opportunities.\n\nFosun International, which took over Roc Oil in Australia in 2014, is looking, the banker said.\n\nPrivate firm Questus Energy, run by former Roc Oil and Shell executives and backed by UK-based Intermediate Capital Group , is also in the running, a second banker said.\n\nOrigin declined to comment beyond what it has announced.\n\nFosun and Questus did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBankers expect private equity firms that have long eyed Australian oil and gas assets to team up with local producers to bid.\n\nSenex Energy is expected to work with its stakeholder, US private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners.

But clashes with investors, government overspending and falling commodity export revenues slowed growth to one per cent last year and tipped the country into an economic crisis.\n\n\"This is one of the biggest programmes in IMF history in terms of countries' GDPs,\" said Neil Saker, IMF's Mongolia representative, at a press briefing in Ulaanbaatar. \"The absolutely critical objective is to break the boom-bust cycle seen in Mongolia in the last 15 years,\" he added.\n\nMongolian finance minister Battogtokh Choijilsuren said the package was designed to stabilise the economy, impose fiscal discipline and boost competitiveness, adding that Mongolia would aim to bring its budget deficit to under 2 per cent of its gross domestic product by 2021, down from 17 per cent now.\n\nThe deal will enable Mongolia to swap US$550 million in debt held by the Development Bank of Mongolia for new sovereign bonds worth US$600 million due in 2024. It also included a three-year extension to a 15 billion yuan (S$3 billion) swap agreement with the People's Bank of China.\n\nThe formal confirmation of the package, first proposed in February, was delayed from last month amid concerns about a controversial clause in Mongolia's legislation that forced \"strategically important\" mines, such as the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine run by Rio Tinto, to conduct transactions through local banks.\n\nThe government has subsequently annulled the banking requirement in order to push the IMF deal through.\n\nMongolia has agreed to cut spending, raise taxes and the retirement age, while pledging to maintain a flexible exchange rate and build a stronger regulatory environment for banking and finance.\n\nCandidates running in next month's presidential elections may try to make political capital out of the painful austerity measures introduced by the ruling Mongolian People's Party (MPP), which is fielding Miyeegombo Enkhbhold, currently parliamentary speaker.\n\nBusinessman and former martial artist Khaltmaa Battulga is contesting the vote on behalf of the main opposition Democratic Party, while the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party has nominated former independent Sainkhuu Ganbaatar. Both challengers have gained popularity partly through their resource-nationalist rhetoric and their suspicion of foreign investors.

But how bumpy will the ride be till year's end?\n\nPublished\n\nThu, May 25, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nSingapore economy\n\nFollow\n\nSingapore\n\nSINGAPORE'S strong first-quarter growth data prompted its Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) to do a nudge and a wink to say that full-year growth for 2017 is likely to be better than 2016's.\n\nEconomists say that Q1 2017 growth is the best that Singapore can get this year. So, for goodness growth's sake, is the glass half full or half empty? Turns out, it's both.\n\nWhat economists are actually saying is that the 2 per cent floor for Singapore's full-year growth, as suggested by MTI on Thursday in its gross domestic product (GDP) data release, is achievable.\n\nTo be sure, MTI's proclamation shouldn't come as a surprise to many. Before Thursday's GDP data, some economists were already saying Singapore's growth spurt late last year gave its economy a higher base to work with going into 2017.\n\nIt's all in the calculation. As the economy grows from last year-end to Q1 this year, it just needs to sustain, or not stray too far from this growth momentum, to clock in a nice full-year growth for 2017.\n\nQ1's year-on-year growth is already at 2.7 per cent. This means that MTI's suggested 2 per cent floor for 2017 growth is somewhat in the bag for Singapore already. If the remaining three quarters' growth does not fall too far below 2 per cent, Q1's 2.7 per cent can make up for any small shortfall. The glass is half full.\n\nThis would also mean that 2017 might just be the best year in three years. Singapore's economy grew by 2 per cent in 2015 and 2016. But does this really mean that all is good? Beneath that notable headline growth, there's a spate of worries. So far the growth has been driven by external-facing sectors.\n\nDomestic-oriented ones are sluggish. The labour market is slackening. Consumers are not buying. There's no demand-side impetus for growth. Without these anchors, the Singapore economy is left exposed to external challenges. And as we saw in 2016, strange things can certainly happen fast and swift.\n\nSome economists say that Q1's growth is the best that we can get for 2017. That denotes some worries about the unevenness in Singapore's economic growth.\n\nBut others also noted that growth seems to be broadening across different clusters, albeit slowly. What matters now is whether growth can be more widespread before the next shock arrives.\n\nBuckle up. It's going to be a bumpy ride for 2017.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its third edition will be held at popular underground cinema The Projector, which also curated the line-up in partnership with the Embassy of Mexico in Singapore.\n\nThe five films have been handpicked by The Projector's programme manager Viknesh Kobinathan, and the selection focuses not just on the diversity of genres but also the depth and breadth of talent that is on the rise in Mexican cinema.\n\n\"This being our first partnership, we knew that we wanted a small and tight line-up; which is why we only have five films in the programme - brought down from a long list of close to 30,\" shares Mr Kobinathan.\n\n\"One thing that was very important for me was that these films were made within the last two to three years, so the programme can serve as a snapshot of the newest in Mexican cinema.\"\n\nFrom tense socio-political themes in opening film Desierto, to the intriguing youthful gaze of Mexican youth in Gueros, the festival invites cinephiles to discover a different side of the country that is multi-faceted and, more importantly, relevant in the current political climate.\n\nDesierto, for instance, is a tightly-paced thriller which stars Gael Garcia Bernal (Y Tu Mama Tambien, 2001) as an illegal immigrant trying to cross the America-Mexico border while being chased by a Confederate flag-waving psychopath (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).\n\nThe film marks the directorial debut of Jonas Cuaron, offspring of Ocar-winning director Alfonso Cuaron who is best known for helming Gravity (2013). Both father and son also wrote the George Clooney and Sandra Bullock outer space thriller together.\n\nDesierto was selected as Mexico's official entry for Best Foreign Film and bagged the Prize of the International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI) for Special Presentations when it was screened at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nOther contemporary Mexican works in the line-up include the deeply personal romantic drama You'll Know What To Do With Me, with director Katina Medina-Mora in attendance to host a question-and-answer session; Bleak Street, a dark comedy and nihilistic black-and-white drama directed by Mexican auteur Arturo Ripstein; and Mr Pig, a touching drama which stars Danny Glover and Maya Rudolph, and is inspired by actor-turned-director Diego Luna's own relationship with his father.\n\nMr Kobinathan says his personal favourite is Gueros, a road movie that is both a \"stunning\" and \"unique\" debut for director Alonso Ruizpalacios. The black-and-white drama puts a playful spin on the coming-of-age genre and won five Ariel awards (Mexico's equivalent of the Oscars), including Best Picture in 2015.\n\nThe Mexican Film Festival is also supported by the Singapore Film Society which will present an additional two titles outside of The Projector at *Scape: El Jeremias, a heart-warming drama about a child genius; and Cantinflas, the titular biopic about the country's most beloved comedian, on June 5 and 6 respectively. Both of these screenings are free but require RSVP.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The implications of this downgrade to Hong Kong are very minimal as the Hong Kong government does not need to raise money through bonds,\" said Professor Terence Chong Tai-leung, executive director at Chinese University of Hong Kong's Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance.\n\nThis is unlike in the mainland, where the China government and corporations rely more on bond issuance to raise money, he added.\n\nHong Kong's financial markets appeared to shrug off the ratings news, with the benchmark Hang Seng Index extending a five-day rally while the Hong Kong dollar remained unchanged as of mid-Thursday.\n\n\"The Hong Kong corporate bond is undisturbed and there is no sell-off or material credit spread widening. Hong Kong corporate bonds' anchor investors are local bond funds and private banking clients, and they have their own views on individual corporate credits,\" Hang Seng Bank's executive director and head of global banking and markets Andrew Fung told The Business Times.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Korea's new president angers small firms he has vowed to help\n\nSmall businesses fear their survival is at stake if President Moon pushes ahead with plans to implement labour reforms\n\nPublished\n\nThu, May 25, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nSouth Korea\n\nFollow\n\nSeoul\n\nSMALL businesses in South Korea fear their profits could be cut to the bone and some could be forced to close if the country's new president pushes ahead with plans to raise minimum wages, restrict contract staff numbers and reduce working hours.\n\nSince his election earlier this month, President Moon Jae-in has made boosting job prospects for young South Koreans a signature policy, while also protecting workers' rights.\n\nWith that in mind, he has also targeted reform of South Korea's giant family-run conglomerates, or chaebol, to make them less dominant and help smaller firms become engines of growth in Asia's fourth-largest economy.\n\nJust last week, Mr Moon's nominee to head the country's anti-trust regulator noted that South Korea's 10 largest conglomerates - including household names such as Samsung and Hyundai Motor Group - employ only one million of South Korea's 19 million actively employed workforce.\n\n\"The ultimate goal of chaebol reform is to protect small companies and self-employed business owners so they can create many more new jobs,\" said Kim Sang-jo, the president's choice to head the Korea Fair Trade Commission.\n\nBut many businessmen fear that instead of generating jobs, smaller businesses will be crippled by the higher cost of hiring and paying workers if Mr Moon's labour reforms are implemented.\n\nTake for example, Sam Heung Heat Treatment, a company employing around 50 workers at a factory supplying components to carmakers such as Hyundai and General Motors Co.\n\nChairman Joo Bo-won told Reuters that his firm could fold because of policies he says would both double the wage bill and double the number of full-time workers needed to make up for the shorter working week.\n\nAsked what would happen if Mr Moon's proposals became law, Mr Joo gave a stark response.\n\n\"It's simple: you can just shut down the factory,\" he said.\n\nMr Moon has pledged to raise the minimum wage by 55 per cent to 10,000 won (S$12.40) per hour by the end of his five-year term.\n\nAt the same time, he wants to lower the maximum working week to 52 hours, bringing it down from the current cap of 68 hours, in a move that he says would help create 500,000 private sector jobs.\n\nSmall businessmen, however, say Mr Moon has got it wrong, and there will be less work as profit margins suffer.\n\nKim Moon-sik, the president of an association of petrol filling station owners, is a member of the labour ministry's key minimum wage committee.\n\nHe warned that the proposals, as they stand, would backfire if they are applied to firms regardless of size.\n\nMr Kim said filling stations' profit margins average less than 0.5 per cent, and if the hourly pay rate is increased so sharply it would probably force owners to run their businesses for shorter hours each day.\n\n\"Instead of creating jobs, the changes could make it harder to maintain the jobs that exist now,\" said Mr Kim, president of the Korea Oil Station Association.\n\nTo try to coax the private sector to hire more, Mr Moon has pledged that the government will pay for the salary of every third youth employee hired by small companies for three years.\n\nBut a spokesman for Arbeit Workers Union, representing some 1,000 part-time employees at convenience stores and fast food outlets, such as the local McDonalds unit, said the government needs to do more to help small businesses so that they can afford to pay more.\n\n\"We understand that it would be illogical to ask businesses to pay higher wages when they have no ability to pay,\" Choi Gi-won, the union spokesman, said. \"But the minimum wage has to be raised.\" REUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

Yet of the 28 member nations, 23 \"are still not paying what they should be paying and what they're supposed to be paying for their defence,\" he said.\n\n\"That is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States,\" Mr Trump said at an event in Brussels on Thursday to mark the opening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's new headquarters.\n\n\"Many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years and not paying in those past years.\"\n\nMr Trump's rebuke of mainly European allies for not spending the recommended two per cent of GDP on defence came during a ceremony marking the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the US, when Nato invoked for the first and only time its mutual-defence clause.\n\nMr Trump said that Nato would have had US$119 billion more if Nato members lived up to their obligations.\n\n\"Two per cent is the bare minimum for confronting today's very real and very vicious threats,\" he said.\n\nMs Merkel, who stood emotionless during the speech, earlier issued her own challenge to the US president, saying that member states including Germany had already pledged to work towards the two per cent target by 2024 and that outlays on security more generally also count toward the goal. A plan to reaffirm the pledge made three years ago \"means nothing more or less than that\", she said.\n\n\"We're happy that in the future the sole question will no longer be how much we spend on defence but also what contributions are being made to Nato in terms of capabilities and contributions we're offering,\" Ms Merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting.\n\n\"Germany stands strong in this point and I'll make that clear.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

Total turnover was S$1.2 billion, about 96 per cent of the January-to-April daily average.\n\n\"Market sentiment is quite bullish,\" CMC Markets' market analyst Margaret Yang said. \"However, although the market has been trading up, volumes have been shrinking compared to the first quarter. . . And because the market is trading near its two-year high, we are seeing some consolidation here and there and trading in a range.\"\n\nBank stocks DBS Group and OCBC Bank lifted the blue-chip STI as official estimates guided for slightly better economic growth in Singapore in 2017.\n\nDBS increased by 0.19 per cent or four Singapore cents to close at S$21.04, while OCBC added 0.38 per cent or four Singapore cents to S$10.47.\n\nThe Ministry of Trade and Industry on Thursday kept its forecast for 2017 economic growth at 1-3 per cent. However, the ministry said that full-year growth in 2017 will probably be higher than the 2 per cent expansion in 2016.\n\nThe guidance for stronger growth in 2017 matched most economists' expectations. Nomura said semiconductor-related manufacturing is supporting its forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in 2017, although the first is estimating a slowdown to 1.5 per cent growth in 2018.\n\n\"Our forecast implies that growth will slow,\" Nomura said. \"As we expect semiconductor demand to moderate gradually through the rest of the year, we forecast GDP growth slowing to 2.4 per cent year on year in H2 from 2.7 per cent in H1. The decline in non-oil domestic exports growth to minus 0.7 per cent in April from 16.5 per cent in March already hints at slower GDP growth in Q2 than in Q1.\"\n\nThe STI could have boasted a stronger performance on the day if not for Singapore Telecommunications, which extended its loss streak to two days. Singapore's largest telco shed 0.53 per cent or two Singapore cents to head out at S$3.73.\n\nCommodity trader Noble Group bounced back from five straight declines to rise 9.09 per cent or 3.5 Singapore cents to finish at 42 Singapore cents.\n\nNoble's stock has been particularly volatile this week, as Standard & Poor's cut the group's credit rating by three notches to \"CCC+\" and raised concerns about potential for default within a year. Reuters also reported that China state-owned conglomerate Sinochem was no longer pursuing an investment in Noble.\n\nNoble, however, has said that discussions about its strategic review, including talks with potential partners, are still ongoing.\n\n\"Noble is still very speculative,\" CMC's Ms Yang said. \"We have very limited visibility of the future plans of the company.\"\n\nLooking ahead, US markets could be headed for a rally overnight, Ms Yang said.\n\n\"US futures are doing really well during Asia hours,\" she said. \"Right now they're headed to a new record high.\"\n\nOil counters held firm in anticipation of a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).\n\nKeppel Corp slipped 0.15 per cent or one Singapore cent to close at S$6.58, while Sembcorp Marine eased 0.58 per cent or one Singapore cent to S$1.71 at the close.\n\nOpec members on Thursday agreed to extend cuts in oil production for another nine months, to March 2018, but declined to make additional cuts. Non-Opec producers are expected to match production levels.\n\nFor full listings of SGX prices, go to\n\nhttp://btd.sg/BTmkts\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its rise to become a global financial centre was founded on building blocks which included business friendly policies, reliable infrastructure, a well-educated workforce, a favourable regulatory framework and political stability.\n\nThe financial services sector in Singapore has grown tremendously over the last 30 years. Wealth management was a more recent phenomenon in the past decade with US$2.6 trillion of assets under management in 2015. The combined growth of the financial services sector, along with that of the manufacturing and biomedical sectors, has resulted in an influx of liquidity in foreign currency into Singapore.\n\nSo what are the major sources of liquidity flows? Today, Singapore houses some of the world's largest commodity trading companies such as Olam, Hin Leong, Rio Tinto, and BHP. These traders have the ability to tap the deep liquidity available in Singapore to finance their high trade volumes. Since 2001, the Global Trader Programme has succeeded in attracting key players with a reduced corporate tax rate of 5 to 10 per cent in exchange for commitment to make significant use of Singapore's banking and financial infrastructure, including logistics, arbitration and other supporting services.\n\nNow home to more than 7,000 multinational corporations, with over half of them using Singapore as their regional headquarters, Singapore has established itself as a compelling hub in Asia for companies setting up regional treasury centres, thus fuelling liquidity flows.\n\nThe successes of the Singapore government's initiatives are clearly evident as the country is now well placed as a global currency centre. Singapore is the largest forex centre in the Asia-Pacific, and the third largest globally after London and New York, with excellent US dollar (USD) liquidity in Asia. The reinforcement of this global position in 2016 was largely driven by the growth in G-10 and Asian currencies - a result of shifting patterns in global trade and economic growth.\n\nWhat this means from a USD liquidity perspective is that Singapore will continue to be in an advantageous position as most currencies are traded against USD. Secondly, with Singapore being positioned as a strong private wealth centre and a major banking hub, there are natural inflows of currencies into the country; adding to the already USD rich pool held by wealthy locals.\n\nThe well-developed banking infrastructure and banking services available in Singapore also play an important role in the ecosystem. Banks have been pushing boundaries to support their clients' international payment needs by extending trading hours and providing innovative solutions enabled by technology.\n\nROUND-THE-CLOCK PROCESSING\n\nTraditionally, companies with global treasury centres in the US or Europe would not consider managing their USD liquidity position out of Singapore due to the time zone constraint. This restricted companies' flexibility in moving funds and deprived them of the higher yield on USD positions Asia has to offer, due to a higher demand for USD in the region. However, this can easily be changed with a longer USD trading window. For instance, Standard Chartered Bank allows \"round-the-clock\" transaction processing in Singapore which mirrors the USD clearing cut-off time in New York, giving clients the access to USD funds even during bank holidays.\n\nBanks have also leveraged technology to look for ways to make treasury management easier. A common challenge many companies face is the complexity of cross-border payments to their entities across the globe. Companies typically need to maintain an account for each currency of transaction and in each destination; this creates the need to maintain multi-entity cash pool structure with multiple physical bank accounts, further complicates the operational processes and makes account reconciliation very difficult.\n\nThe latest solution proposed by banks is a full-fledged virtual account concept for collections and payments, along with the International Automated Clearing House solution that allows companies to operate all of its cross-border transactions across entities in any destination through a centralised and rationalised bank account in Singapore. This way, liquidity is concentrated in Singapore while exposure can be minimised through concentration of liquidity in core currencies. This also allows easy buyer and payer identification to ensure efficient reconciliation and lower transaction cost.\n\nProtectionism could derail Singapore's position as a global liquidity centre. Are we trending towards protectionism? It has been evident over the past few years where governments have introduced tax amnesty to attract capital inflows, the most recent being Indonesia. Whenever this happens, there could be short term outflows. Separately, we would need to closely monitor the potential impact that the Trump administration will have on liquidity management of US and other international currencies. What we know is Chinese President Xi Jinping made his presence felt at Davos, where the agenda had traditionally been set by the Western leaders and not their Asian counterparts.\n\nGrowth of Hong Kong as a yuan centre is one to watch as it means USD liquidity will grow alongside, which could derail Singapore's liquidity position as a centre. From banking infrastructure standpoint, to become the next London, Singapore will still have to develop a market for the exotic currencies. Barring the above potential hindrances, Singapore has a real shot at becoming a global currency centre, as evidenced by its past successes of re-inventing itself.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

Let's make a plan how we move ahead.\" What followed was a multi-year quest to find Russian suppliers, or producers of similar foods in countries outside of the trade sanctions. While in other countries Eataly produces soft cheeses like mozzarella in its in-house kitchens, in Russia it had to expand that to other types of cheeses such as Gorgonzola and Asiago. It also sourced cheese from Switzerland and travelled as far as 1,000 kilometres from Moscow to get meat, honey, fruit and vegetables from Russian farmers.\n\nItalian cheese producers were repeatedly flown to Russia to check the milk for mozzarella and aged varieties, and kept rejecting samples until an acceptable substitute was found. Also off the menu: original Parmigiano Reggiano, Grana Padano cheeses and San Daniele or Parma hams, according to Simone Tosato, the company's franchising director. Many Italian cheeses are marketed around Europe as DOP, for the Protected Designation of Origin, to guarantee consumers of the ingredients and processes used in production.\n\nThe irony isn't lost on Eataly, which is hoping to exploit Russia's love of Italian goods, from high fashion to fine food to fast cars.\n\n\"It's like Prada without bags,\" Mr Tosato added.\n\nEataly's Russian ambition shows in the site's scale. The Moscow location will be the chain's second-largest after Rome, surpassing all others of its roughly 30 sites from Seoul to New York (it's 60 per cent bigger than the Flatiron district flagship hall). It can seat 950 diners, more than any other Eataly.\n\nThe Moscow Eataly expects to generate about 60 per cent of its revenue from restaurants and 40 per cent from shops, which would be about the same split as in New York, Mr Tetrov said. The average ticket would be 1,200 roubles (S$30) per person in restaurants and 1,500 roubles in stores, according to Mr Tosato.\n\nEataly in 2012 picked Mr Tetrov, a Soviet-born food entrepreneur whose family left the Soviet Union for Israel in 1972 and who now lives in Spain. He previously ran the Italian Lavazza coffee shop's franchise in Russia, a high-end jewellery business in Belgium, and is a co-owner in several restaurants in Spain. He said his first business breakthrough, in the 1970s, was supplying Swedish water-slides to Israel.\n\nYears behind plan, the doors are opening as Russian consumer data show mixed signals. Households still lack the confidence to reverse a record contraction of retail sales, even after eight months of growth in real wages. The Russian dining-out market fell 3.8 per cent to 1.33 trillion roubles in 2016, after falling 6 per cent in 2015, according to Federal State Statistics Service.\n\n\"I guess the food embargo may be good for Russia as a country because people start to produce food locally,\" Mr Tetrov said.

It's a play that takes advantage of cheaper prices for land designated for health-care use, allowing developers to reap a premium for nearby residential towers that offer home buyers easy access to hospitals, clinics or nursing homes. Developers are also betting they'll be able to rake in profits directly from soaring demand for medical services.\n\nWith the rapid growth of the property market expected to slow in the coming decades, companies such as Dalian Wanda Group and Evergrande, as well as smaller players including Tahoe Group Co. of Fuzhou, are pouring in billions. Dalian Wanda so far has announced plans to invest at least 85 billion yuan (S$17.1 billion) in 13 hospitals, including an ambitious hospital park with 30 heath-care firms headquartered in Chengdu. Suning Universal Co, formerly a residential property developer in Nanjing, has given up building homes in order to plunge into cosmetic surgery clinics China-wide with a 5 billion yuan fund to invest mainly in such hospitals. It purchased one in Shanghai in November.\n\n\"What developers truly expect by building hospitals is to boost housing prices by adding value to the complex by integrating all those facilities,\" said David Hong, Hong Kong-based head of research at China Real Estate Information Corp. \"For a hospital itself, the return on investment is usually quite poor. Developers generally want to make experimental forays to see if they can profit from related business.\" In Tianjin, prices at Evergrande Oasis, the residential compound adjacent to the plastic surgery hospital - which includes a hot-spring spa called Paradise and a European-style \"super five-star hotel\" - surged 16 per cent to 8,474 yuan a square meter in 2016 after the hospital opened, according to data provided by property consultant Savills Plc. The jump was more than double the increase in the same period at a project by Shenzhen Overseas Chinese, a smaller developer that didn't build health-care services nearby, the data show.\n\nNew Era Evergrande Health Industry Group, the unit leading the health-care push, said China has entered a new era of consumption growth, and demand for health and beauty is on the rise. Evergrande's other ventures include 12 health-management centers that provide primary and senior care, and a 5 billion yuan cancer hospital linked with Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boao, on China's retirement island of Hainan.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/ffdf92ce87b658f9fb3e1a4ee83d31feeabbe59f858af5725eed6a4cb6ea3208?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "It's called \"Asia's top-notch plastic surgery hospital,\" according to the promotional brochure for the grand, Chinese palace-style building near the port of Tianjin."}]}

That means the electric taxis need to boast fast-charging batteries that can last, he added.\n\nOver the last few years Giant Motors and Moldex have developed and sold 500 light-weight, electric cargo trucks capable of handling up to a one tonne load. Mr Massri said the experience has given them a platform for the taxi project.\n\nSlim's Grupo Financiero Inbursa has a 50 per cent stake in Giant Motors.\n\nIn February, Giant Motors and China's Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co Ltd (JAC Motors), along with distributor Chori Co Ltd, said they would invest some US$210 million to build SUVs at a plant in the central state of Hidalgo.\n\nGiant Motors and JAC aim to be producing some 10,000 vehicles per year at the Hidalgo plant within four years, said Massri. Passenger cars will account for 70 per cent of total output and the remainder will be commercial trucks.\n\nInitially, the Giant Motors-JAC Motors joint venture will focus on selling to Mexico's growing domestic market, with an eye to expanding into other Latin American nations, Mr Massri said.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2f14640cb12d2c850697a48238cb6641f3fd40e13a513ebb289e7363dd125f09?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Giant Motors, an automaker partially owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, is working on a prototype electric taxi to replace the gas-guzzling cabs polluting Mexico City's air, a company executive said."}]}

Chung took her case against extradition to the Aalborg district court, but the court upheld her extradition, which she then appealed.\n\nHer lawyer Michael Juul Eriksen told AFP last month that Chung's main fear regarding extradition was losing contact with her infant son because she had been \"pressured\" and \"threatened\" by the Korean authorities to collaborate in the case.\n\nMr Eriksen argued in the Aalborg district court that his client had not committed any crime and that the extradition was politically motivated.\n\nChung, an equestrian who has reportedly bought horses and trained in Denmark in the past, has told police she was in the country because of her involvement in the sport. She has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe high court on Wednesday did not say why Chung abandoned her appeal.\n\nChung's mother Choi Soon Sil, a confidante of Park's, is accused of using her influence to secure her daughter's admission to the elite Ewha Womans University in Seoul, with a state probe revealing that the school had admitted Chung at the expense of better-qualified candidates.\n\nShe is also accused of using millions of dollars of bribes from Samsung, South Korea's largest conglomerate, to finance her daughter's equestrian career and luxurious lifestyle in Europe.\n\nChoi is already on trial for coercing local conglomerates into donating a total of 77.4 billion won (S$95.5 million) to two non-profit foundations, and allegedly used some of the donations for personal gain.\n\nPark - whose trial in Seoul on charges of bribery, abusing her powers and leaking state secrets begins Thursday - is accused of colluding with Choi in the million-dollar scheme.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

It squeaked through the House on a 217-213 vote.\n\nThe Senate, which like the House is controlled by Republicans, intends to craft its own bill, which would then need to go back to the House. But the CBO report only highlighted the difficulties ahead in reaching Republican consensus on a path forward.\n\nRELIEF OR 'NIGHTMARE'?\n\nDespite the forecast of many uninsured, House Speaker Paul Ryan hailed the report as \"another positive step toward keeping our promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.\"\n\nMr Trump's team reacted by saying CBO has shown itself to be \"totally incapable\" of accurately predicting the effects of US health care law.\n\n\"We must repeal and replace the disastrous Obamacare law with the American Health Care Act - the vehicle which will reform our broken healthcare system,\" a White House official said.\n\nThe CBO findings immediately led several Democrats to blast the Republican bill.\n\n\"The report makes clear that Trumpcare would be a cancer on the American health care system - causing costs to skyrocket, making coverage unaffordable for those with preexisting conditions and many seniors, and kicking millions off of their health insurance,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\n\"Unless you're a healthy millionaire, Trumpcare is a nightmare.\"\n\nSeveral Republicans have expressed concern about the House plan's rollback of Medicaid, and a provision that allows insurers to increase health premiums for people with pre-existing conditions - a practice Obamacare prohibits.\n\nUnder the new plan, federal funding for health care programmes for the poor and disabled would shrivel by US$834 billion through a phase out of Medicaid's expansion.\n\nSeveral states opted for such an expansion in recent years to families living slightly above the poverty line.\n\nThe subsidies that help low-income Americans purchase insurance premiums under Obamacare would be replaced by tax credits under the new measure, beginning in 2020. But they would be less generous than current subsidies, according to CBO.\n\nIt also warned of rising costs for patients should insurance companies be allowed to charge higher rates for those with more serious medical conditions.\n\nAnd it said costs could rise in states that apply for waivers to modify or remove the \"essential health benefits,\" such as maternity care, that are currently required in all insurance plans.\n\n\"People who are less healthy (including those with preexisting or newly acquired medical conditions) would ultimately be unable to purchase comprehensive non-group health insurance at premiums comparable to those under current law, if they could purchase it at all,\" CBO stated.\n\nWhile Republicans repeatedly warn that Obamacare is collapsing, CBO said sufficient demand remains under current law for insurance marketplaces to stay \"stable in most areas.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

Four other delegates agreed it was the most probable outcome.\n\nOpec's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and top non-Opec producer Russia have said cuts need to be extended to speed up market rebalancing and prevent oil prices from sliding back below US$50 per barrel.\n\nOpec sources have said the Thursday meeting will also highlight the need for long-term cooperation with non-Opec producers.\n\nThe group could also send a message to the market that it will seek to curtail its oil exports, which have not declined as steeply as its production.\n\nHowever, a decision on deeper output cuts is unlikely on Thursday, sources have said. By 0725 GMT, Brent crude was trading up almost one per cent, above US$54.40 a barrel.\n\nOpec's cuts have helped push oil back above US$50 a barrel this year, giving a fiscal boost to producers, many of which rely heavily on energy revenues and have had to burn through foreign-currency reserves to plug holes in their budgets.\n\nOil's earlier price decline, which started in 2014, forced Russia and Saudi Arabia to tighten their belts and led to unrest in some producing countries including Venezuela and Nigeria.\n\n\"Russia has an upcoming election and Saudis have the Aramco share listing next year so they will indeed do whatever it takes to support oil prices,\" said Gary Ross, head of global oil at Pira Energy, a unit of S&P Global Platts.\n\nThe price rise this year has spurred growth in the US shale industry, which is not participating in the output deal, thus slowing the market's rebalancing with global stocks still near record highs.\n\nOpec has a self-imposed goal of bringing stocks down from a record high of 3 billion barrels to their five-year average of 2.7 billion.\n\nAlgerian Energy Minister Noureddine Boutarfa told Reuters on Wednesday he believed that inventories should normalise by the end of 2017.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f26c161d3b29457dc97b6aa41d8c6a451b8d288dcf0937a8889f938450c81f13?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Opec and non-member oil producers are gearing up to extend output cuts on Thursday, possibly by as long as 12 months, to help clear a global stocks overhang and prop up crude prices."}]}

In 2014 alone, Shell-operated ventures contributed US$202 million to the Niger Delta Development Commission; some US$112 million was directly invested in social investment projects, making Nigeria the site of the largest concentration of social investment spending in the Shell Group.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/cf9014b195ed7268c4ae568bb577471bc199c80cad96331c9e56373d44188f4c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Despite having invested millions in social investment projects in Nigeria, Shell has failed to win the hearts of the communities it operates in."}]}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/lenovos-profit-tops-estimates-pc-market-levels", "site_title": "Lenovo's profit tops estimates as pc market levels off", "publish_date": null, "content": "Lenovo's profit tops estimates as pc market levels off\n\nPublished\n\nThu, May 25, 2017 \u00b7 05:59 AM\n\n[BEIJING] Lenovo Group Ltd's quarterly profit fell less than expected after the global personal computer market eked out growth for the first time since 2012.\n\nThe world's second-largest PC maker reported a 41 percent slide in net income to US$107 million in the three months ended March. That compares with the US$97.9 million average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 5 per cent to US$9.6 billion, compared with the US$9.65 billion projected.\n\nLenovo narrowly lost its top position in global PCs to HP Inc in the quarter but managed to increase market share as industry shipments grew 0.6 per cent, the first time they've risen since early 2012 according to IDC. Lenovo's biggest rival posted better-than-expected revenue growth on Wednesday as the market stabilized. Overall demand however remains depressed and Lenovo needs to tap new sources of growth or turn around an under-performing smartphone division. It's re-enlisted the executive who steered the acquisition of Motorola to run its Chinese PC arm, shaking up its senior ranks to breathe new life into a stagnating business. Shares of Lenovo rose more than 4 per cent in Hong Kong as trading resumed after the midday break.\n\n\"Any sign of stabilization of operating performance of mobile business group should build market confidence in Lenovo's capability to achieve a break-even in the second half of fiscal year 2018,\" Mark Po, a China Galaxy International analyst, wrote in a memo ahead of the earnings release.\n\nLenovo however warned that the supply of PC components will remain tight for the industry as a whole, potentially weighing on margins. In response, it plans to focus on faster-growing markets while continuing to build branding in smartphones, an area in which it continues to lag frontrunners like Samsung Electronics Co and Huawei Technologies Co. It's now streamlining its product line and will focus on a narrower selection of devices each year.\n\nThe company said it commanded a record 37.1 per cent share of its home market, which accounted for just over a quarter of its overall revenue. Yang has emphasized the importance of the Chinese market in recent speeches, promising a clearer strategy for its biggest market. The company is also embracing a multi-year plan to build new businesses in cloud and data-centers while maintaining its edge in PCs.\n\nIt announced a leadership shuffle last week, bringing back Liu Jun - who left in 2015 shortly after the company took over Motorola - to oversee a newly created local PC and smart devices division. He replaces Chen Xudong, a former rising star and lieutenant of Chief Executive Officer Yang Yuanqing.\n\nLenovo also intends to move its smartphone and datacenter businesses out of the red, though it said transforming its server division will take time. The mobile business group, which encompasses both Motorola and Lenovo phones, posted near-20 per cent growth in revenue in the quarter, and expanded shipments by 17.4 per cent to 11.3 million units outside of China. Datacenter revenue fell 13.7 per cent to US$850 million.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTechnology\n\nMusk\u2019s xAI seeks up to US$200 billion valuation in next funding round: report\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:47 AM\n\nBreaking into Japan?

This was a decline of 57.9 per cent from the total order book of S$19 billion as at end 2015. The total order books included the backlog of orders clinched from earlier years and these projects have completion dates and delivery schedules stretching into 2021.\n\nThe total employment in the local offshore and marine industry was 85,600 in 2016, down by 10 per cent from 2015 when 95,500 workers were employed.\n\n\"The tightening of work permit quota, fewer recruitment, retrenchment and natural workforce attrition contributed to the drop in the industry's workforce in 2016. The number of workers employed in the industry has been decreasing since 2013,'' Mr Chua noted.\n\nThe Singapore offshore and marine industry generated a total turnover of S$13.06 billion, 11.3 per cent lower than the turnover of S$14.73 billion achieved in 2015.\n\nThe ship repair and conversion sector generated a total turnover of S$4.57 billion, accounting for 35 per cent of the industry's turnover. This was a decrease of 6 per cent, or S$290 million, less than the S$4.86 billion earned in 2015.\n\nThe shipbuilding sector contributed S$200 million to the industry's turnover in 2016. This was a decline of S$90 million, or 31 per cent, lower compared to the total turnover of S$290 million in 2015.\n\nThe offshore rigbuilding sector generated a turnover of S$8.29 billion in 2016. It remained the largest contributor to the industry's total turnover since 2008. There was a decline of S$1.28 billion, or 13.4 per cent, from turnover of S$9.57 billion achieved in 2015.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Chua said the upstream oil and gas industry remained challenging, even though prospects in the marine and offshore industry have improved following the agreement by OPEC and major non-OPEC countries to cut production.\n\n\"However, a more robust recovery will take a longer time,'' he said. \"The challenging environment in the offshore business is expected to remain for some time.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Blue is a C sharp, for instance; red sounds calm to him, while white is silent. When he sees people, we all \"sound\" like hues of light to dark orange, even though we visually classify humans as \"white\", \"yellow\", \"brown\" or \"black\".\n\nGoing to the supermarket is like going to the nightclub, he says, and yes, he can distinguish certain musical styles from artists' pattern of paintings.\n\nHe has upgraded his antenna tip about four times since 2003 to enable him to hear infrared and ultraviolet rays now and also senses different saturations. \"So now I sense more colour than people,\" he says.\n\nHis antenna is also Bluetooth-enabled so he can transmit and receive sounds and signals from five specific sensors around the world.\n\nOne of them is in the ArtScience Museum for the duration of the exhibition.\n\nVisitors can show different colours to the sensor in Sonochromatic Head (a bust looking like Mr Harbisson) which can be transmitted to his head wherever he is in the world.\n\nExplaining why he wanted to implant the antenna in his head, he says that he wanted to have a body part and a real sense of colour rather than just using headphones.\n\nHow has the public reacted? He quips: \"In 2004, people thought it was a reading light. In 2007, a hands-free telephone. In 2009, a Go-Pro; 2011 and 2012, a Google Glass; in 2015, a selfie stick and 2016, they thought I was a Pokemon.\"\n\nHe hopes that by 2020, his antenna will be rightly seen as a body part as his Cyborg Foundation aims to help humans become cyborgs, have cyborg rights and promote cyborgism as a social and artistic movement.\n\n\"I think we're now in the renaissance of the human species as we have the ability to transform ourselves and have extra senses.\"\n\nThe Human+ exhibition explores this very conundrum - now that we have advanced in genetic engineering, biotechnology and nanotechnology, what does it mean to be human?\n\nShould we continue to embrace modifications to our minds, bodies and daily lives, or are there boundaries we shouldn't overstep?\n\nThe work of 40 international artists, scientists, technologists and designers explores possible future paths for our species.\n\nThe exhibition is a collaboration between ArtScience Museum, Science Gallery at Trinity College Dublin, and The Centre de Cultura Contempor\u00e0nia de Barcelona (CCCB).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For Uber, the investment isn't a good sign. SoftBank has been pouring money into various ride-hailing companies not named Uber, including US$5 billion for China's Didi Chuxing this year.\n\nAnd Latin America has been one of the regions for Uber where margins are the highest, a person familiar with the matter said, even if it doesn't contribute as much revenue as North America. Competition can drive down Uber's margins as companies spend money on subsidies to compete for market share.\n\nSao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city, has ranked among Uber's busiest cities in the world by the number of trips taken. 99 operates in more than 400 cities in Brazil, offering both on-demand cars and taxis.\n\nThe SoftBank investment comes less than six months after 99 raised US$100 million from Didi and Riverwood Capital. \"99 was launched in 2012, with only three entrepreneurs; today, we are an urban mobility startup with a team of over 350 people,\" Peter Fernandez, the chief executive officer of 99, said in a statement Wednesday. A SoftBank executive sat down with Uber competitor Lyft Inc's President John Zimmer in the past few weeks, a person familiar with the matter said. A Lyft spokesman declined to comment on what they discussed. SoftBank didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nLast year, Uber struck a deal with Didi that gave the San Francisco-based company a 17.5 per cent stake in Didi and it exited the Chinese market, taking the two companies out of direct competition. But Didi has investments in many of Uber's local rivals, including Lyft Inc., Indian competitor Ola, and Southeast Asian rival Grab.\n\nLast year, Uber generated $20 billion in bookings on US$6.5 billion in net revenue. The company lost $2.8 billion globally, not including another US$1 billion or so loss in China.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/3e91db1673a3265740f30796827ea92aa5d90191f1d5b6323916a6a5faa2b402?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "SoftBank has been pouring money into various ride-hailing companies not named Uber, including US$5 billion for China's Didi Chuxing this year."}]}

Team delighted,\" Rocket Lab said on its official Twitter account.\n\nThe successful launch of a low cost, 3D-printed rocket is an important step in the commercial race to bring down financial and logistical barriers to space while also making New Zealand an unlikely space hub.\n\nThe Los Angeles and New Zealand-based rocket firm has touted its service as a way for companies to get satellites into orbit regularly.\n\n\"Our focus with the Electron has been to develop a reliable launch vehicle that can be manufactured in high volumes - our ultimate goal is to make space accessible by providing an unprecedented frequency of launch opportunities,\" said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab founder and chief executive in a statement.\n\nThe firm had spent the past four years preparing for the test launch and last week received the go-ahead from the US Federal Aviation Administration, which is monitoring the flight.\n\nBad weather had delayed the rocket from taking off three times this week.\n\nNew Zealand has created new rocket legislation and set up a space agency in anticipation of becoming a low-cost space hub.\n\nShips and planes need re-routing every time a rocket is launched, which limits opportunities in crowded US skies, but New Zealand, a country of 4 million people in the South Pacific, has only Antarctica to its south. The country is also well-positioned to send satellites bound for a north-to-south orbit around the poles.\n\nBut many locals in the predominantly Maori community were not happy with access to public areas blocked.\n\n\"People come to Mahia so they can go to the beach and it's been chopped off now and by the sounds of it one of these rockets are going to be launching one every 30 days so they've taken over our lifestyle,\" said Mahia farmer Pua Taumata.\n\nBut Taumata also said the programme could bring opportunities.\n\n\"I'm for technology ... a lot of things could come of it through education.

This in turn would enable Mr Abe to inject further fiscal stimulus into Japan's already recovering economy.\n\nMaintaining or even stepping up the BOJ's quantitative and qualitative easing policies would also be likely to keep the yen from appreciating, which in turn would boost Japan's yen-denominated exports and corporate profits while driving share prices higher, analysts said.\n\nThe yen responded on Wednesday by weakening to below 112 to the US dollar and also dipping against other major currencies while Tokyo stock prices moved higher, apparently taking their cue from Mr Bernanke's remarks in Tokyo.\n\nThe former Fed chairman's comments come at a time when some economists have speculated that the BOJ's next move might be to begin tightening - rather than loosening - policy and when Mr Kuroda is under pressure to produce an \"exit strategy\" from monetary easing.\n\nThe BOJ governor told parliament recently that he was willing to offer some indication to anxious financial markets about an exit strategy because of the impact such a move could be expected to have on stock and bond markets and on the yen exchange rate.\n\nHowever, Mr Bernanke's comments on Wednesday may have supplied the BOJ with ammunition to justify continued monetary easing, and to delay publication of an exit strategy, analysts said.\n\nHis remarks also open the way for a heavily indebted Japanese government to increase further its borrowing without raising the debt to GDP (gross domestic product) ratio. Additional fiscal spending would in effect be financed by the BOJ and go onto the central bank's balance sheet.\n\nOne approach \"would be for the BOJ to commit to a temporary overshoot of its inflation target sufficient to avoid any increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio\", Mr Bernanke said.\n\n\"This commitment amounts to a monetary financing of the fiscal programme without relying on exotic concepts like helicopter drops.\"\n\nThe BOJ's current policy framework may be reaching its limits because short and long-term interest rates are near zero, Mr Bernanke acknowledged, while adding however that the need for additional monetary easing by the BOJ could not be ruled out.\n\nCreating inflation - currently stuck at around 0.2 per cent annually instead of the 2 per cent the BOJ has been targeting since 2013 - is aimed ostensibly at stimulating consumption and investment.\n\nBut it would also have the effect of eroding the real value of debt, analysts noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Almost immediately after he took office in January, US President Donald Trump signed executive orders to withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Singapore is part of. The tussle between the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU) over Britain's withdrawal from the regional bloc, or Brexit as it is called, has also got observers wondering if it may help protectionism gain more political ground as key EU member states head to the polls this year.\n\nThe larger political climate that these rumblings underpin has been anticipated by Singapore. A stronger global growth outlook has led the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) to say on Thursday that Singapore's growth this year may be better than last year's, but uncertainties, including political ones like Brexit and US policy flip-flops, could be downside risks.\n\nBut there also have been positive developments globally, which serve to diminish some of the political and trade risks flagged by MTI. China's One-Belt-One-Road (OBOR) initiative, which is gathering momentum, holds out the promise of creating new trade routes linking Asia to Europe as well as expanding regional cooperation. Although there are questions relating to the modalities of how OBOR would work in practice and in what ways it would benefit participating countries, it has the potential to significantly boost trade and investment in the region.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nRECOMMENDED", "images": []}

New Zealand also allows same-sex couples to legally marry.\n\nTaiwan is seen as one of the most progressive societies in Asia when it comes to gay rights.\n\n\"While I think it is still a long way to the equality dominos falling all over Asia, I think a few East Asian countries, such as Japan and Vietnam, may be more ready to consider equality legislation,\" Ray Chan, Hong Kong's first openly gay lawmaker, told AFP.\n\n\"I can foresee many couples in Hong Kong will try to get married in Taiwan. When they return home, they will press the government and even the private sector for recognising them because the current laws, policies, and rules are blatantly discriminatory.\"\n\nIn Vietnam, which is seen as socially progressive on LGBT issues and where a vibrant gay scene flourishes online and in some big cities, hopes for marriage reform have stalled.\n\nBut iSEE's Phong said the Taiwan ruling \"will give us momentum to mobilise the community to take action - to do something so that gay marriage can be considered when lawmakers discuss changing the marriage law in 2020.\"\n\nGay activists in China expressed optimism that their country's cultural connections with Taiwan could help their efforts to change the law on same-sex nuptials.\n\nHomosexuality was officially decriminalised in 1997 but only taken off the list of psychiatric disorders four years later.\n\n\"Taiwan and mainland China have the same roots and culture so it suggests that Chinese society could also accept the idea of gay marriage,\" said Li Yinhe, a renowned Chinese sexologist who has pressed Beijing policymakers on the issue.\n\nThere have been small signs of progress. While a Chinese court last year ruled against two men seeking to marry, the fact the case even made it into the judicial system was seen by many as an achievement.\n\n\"I am very happy and very excited that homosexual marriage is legalised in Taiwan. It's a pity that the mainland has not taken this step,\" said Sun Wenlin, one of the men in the case.\n\n\"But I'm optimistic about the legalisation of same-sex marriage in China.\" Elisabeth Lund Engebretsen, a senior lecturer at the University of Oslo's Centre for Gender Research, said Taiwan's court ruling \"creates a momentum for putting this on the table as a political issue\" in Asia.\n\nGAY SEX ILLEGAL\n\nSouth Korea allows homosexual acts between civilians but not military personnel and a high-profile legal challenge to the country's ban on same-sex marriage in 2015 by movie director Kim Jho Gwang-Soo and his long-time partner Kim Seung-Hwan failed.\n\n\"People say that it's too early for our society to handle but I think if there is an open debate about the troubles of sexual minorities then I hope South Korean society can also walk a similar path,\" said Lee Na Ra from Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea.\n\nBefore they can consider marriage, activists must win other battles in places such as India, Singapore and Indonesia's Aceh province, where gay sex is still outlawed.\n\n\"Legally we are not even pressing for gay marriage now. We are being denied our fundamental right,\" said Manvendra Singh Gohil, one of India's most vocal gay rights activists. \"We have to go step by step.\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/cd825c62982283ced87edcb589504c76531f8e37cb5bc61b0982d4be025ae2a7?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Taiwan's giant step towards allowing same-sex marriage has reverberated across Asia, but activists warn the fight for equality isn't over in a region where gay sex remains illegal in some countries."}]}

And now the Philippines is performing its own pivot to Beijing, and away from its traditional ally, the US.\n\nBoth these shifts are forcing Hanoi to modify its foreign policy. The transformed regional order has upset Vietnam's calculations of its national defence and security. The new trend of Vietnamese diplomacy was evident in the visit of Vietnam's President Tran Dai Quang to China this month.\n\nThe adjustment of Vietnamese foreign policy began when Hanoi did not publicly welcome, or celebrate, the judgment of the tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague which issued a verdict against China on the South China Sea dispute in July last year. Instead, Hanoi displayed stony silence signifying its quiet approval of the decision. The low-key response was designed not to upset Beijing.\n\nChina then launched its charm diplomacy aimed at weaning Vietnam away from its alliance with the US. There were flurries of Chinese leaders visiting Vietnam, and Vietnamese leaders travelling to China.\n\nThe Chinese accelerated their diplomacy after the tribunal ruled that Beijing's claims to the South China Sea were without legal foundation.\n\nIt declared that China's illegal fishing, and construction of artificial islands within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, infringed on Manila's sovereign rights. The ruling was seriously undermined by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte who made an extraordinary pivot towards Beijing during his visit to China last October, and his threat to break away from the US.\n\nThe shift is worrying Hanoi. Vietnam fears that the new Sino-Philippine accord undercuts Vietnam's claim to the South China Sea resources. This is because Manila has softened, if not abandoned, its island claims. The other rival claimants are Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nNow, Beijing is aiming to draw Vietnam away from the US and into China's expanding sphere of hegemony. But Vietnam is resisting falling under Chinese domination, and it remains in confrontation with Beijing over the waterway. Nonetheless, during President Quang's visit to China this month, the two countries agreed to manage and properly control their maritime disputes, and to avoid actions that may complicate or widen the differences in maintaining peace.\n\nChina claimed that President Xi Jinping and President Quang held \"positive\" talks on the South China Sea. Yet, Vietnam's foreign policy has been shifting.\n\nIt is obvious that Hanoi might have been pressured, or advised, by Beijing to avoid publicly welcoming the verdict. Soon after the verdict, senior Vietnamese leaders began travelling to China, with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc going last September for discussions on trade, security and the South China Sea. The trip achieved little of consequence aside from Chinese assurances of friendship.\n\nNext, Dinh The Huynh, the Standing Secretary of the Central Committee Secretariat of the Communist Party of Vietnam, visited Beijing in October for three days, and right afterwards he went to the US where he spent double the time. Its significance was that Hanoi was now balancing its relationship with both the US and China, but leaning more towards Washington.\n\nAfter Mr Huynh's visit, the supreme political leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam, general secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, went to China in January this year. But his visit was not a Duterte-like swing towards China, and was more a summit between the communist parties of both countries.\n\nCHINA-PHILIPPINES BOND\n\nForeign policymakers in Hanoi are conducting active diplomacy as they seek refuge in multiple alliances and friendships with the US, as well as with Asia's middle powers, in order to diminish the Chinese threat. Here is why Vietnam should be worried about President Duterte. His actions demonstrate that he used the Philippine victory in the tribunal's ruling as a bargaining chip in negotiations with China.\n\nOn his visit to China last October, Mr Duterte announced his \"separation\" from the US, declaring he had realigned with China as the two agreed to resolve their South China Sea dispute through talks.\n\nMr Duterte declared in Beijing that the South China Sea arbitration case would \"take the back seat\" during his talks with Chinese leaders.\n\nThe Philippine pivot to China appears to be caused by Chinese financial largesse. Philippine trade secretary Ramon Lopez announced that US$13.5 billion in deals would be signed during the China trip.\n\nPhilippine finance secretary Carlos Dominguez explained: \"We will maintain relations with the West but we desire stronger integration with our neighbours.\"\n\nPresident Xi told Mr Duterte that China and the Philippines were brothers and they could \"appropriately handle disputes\".\n\nInterestingly, China also claims to extend brotherly treatment to Vietnam. Beijing recently described its relationship with Vietnam as one of \"brothers and comrades\".\n\nThe diplomacy of Vietnam with China has been weakened because Manila has signalled to Beijing that it has shelved the South China Sea dispute. Vietnam will now find it harder to mobilise the pressure of opinion against China.\n\nThe makers of Vietnamese foreign policy could not have anticipated the surprising capitulation by Manila. They must now broaden their efforts to improve relations not just with China, but also with rival claimants, and non-claimants such as the US, India, Japan and Australia.\n\nAll of them have a strong interest in ensuring open and unobstructed transit through these waters as commerce worth US$5 trillion passes through them every year, representing 30 per cent of global trade.\n\nVietnam's options are limited in the new phase after the tribunal's judgment. It should engage with China, but should not abandon adherence to the rule of law in settling maritime disputes.\n\nThe numerous interactions between Hanoi and Beijing suggest that Vietnam is seeking closer cooperation with Beijing, to which China is reciprocating by welcoming Vietnamese leaders with ceremonies marked by pomp and show.\n\nThe challenge for Vietnamese policymakers is to reiterate to China the gritty intention of Hanoi to adhere to its traditional claims to the maritime resources and islands.\n\nMuch will depend on the other claimant states ensuring that they do not perform a Duterte-style pivot.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite a supersize budget in excess of US$230 million, the latest Pirates film - the first since On Stranger Tides in 2011 - is notable mainly for a distinct lack of yo-ho-ho's.\n\nViewers expecting fast-paced CGI action sequences involving pirate ships, ghoulish crews and heavily-mascaraed protagonist Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) stumbling around doing his patented shtick won't be disappointed, but the sight of so many buckles being swashed has gotten a little tired.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/ce686a4413a37f3e5ac0d5fd4497f731df9be934562dbd47795808ef4cb37d7c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow (above) doing his patented shtick in Pirates of the Caribbean: Salazar's Revenge."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/0e08b6f965718b51fc98b7be61a7683a9769212faf5f4f8d2e2c012dfd257072?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Javier Bardem as pirate-basher Captain Armando Salazar (above), who years ago was tricked by a young (and sober) Jack Sparrow."}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/halal-travel-offers-tourism-ticket-asian-destinations", "site_title": "Halal travel offers tourism ticket for Asian destinations", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHalal travel offers tourism ticket for Asian destinations\n\nPublished Thu, May 25, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nAS the US applies the pilliwinks to travellers from select Muslim countries (starting with Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Iran), holidaymakers from Islamic nations are renewing their romance with Asia, from shopping in Singapore to experiencing monsoon downpours in Penang or Mumbai.\n\nAsian countries have been quick to respond with Muslim-friendly features such as halal restaurants and even alcohol-free halal hotels - with separate lifts for men and women, segregated swimming pool hours, prayer mats, and food prepared according to religious requirements. While all this may appear excessively prudish and unmanageable by Western standards, it has been nothing short of liberating for many Muslim travellers, especially women.\n\nThe halal craze is not some faddish rush to cosy up to a new poster-child demographic in the hope of a few crumbs. It is very serious business with serious underpinnings. Islamic travel is estimated to be worth US$220 billion by 2020, and that green carpet is rolling out faster than you could say, \"Salaam aleikum\" or \"Take that, Mr Trump\".\n\nAccording to the Singapore-based CrescentRating that has just concluded its latest survey with MasterCard, called the Global Muslim Travel Index 2017, or GMTI, there were 121 million Muslim visitor arrivals in 2016. In Asia, the countries best poised for the influx are Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nBased on points awarded for \"attractiveness to Muslim tourists\", Asia topped the GMTI with a score of 57.6, followed by Africa with 47. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Americas racked up just 33 points.\n\nIndividually, Malaysia led the rankings with a score of 81.9, followed by the UAE (76.9) and Indonesia (72.6).\n\nSingapore (10th overall) with 67.3 outperformed both Bangladesh (60) and India (48.7). Interestingly, India (ranked 40th worldwide on this scale) has the second largest Muslim population in the world behind Indonesia. Yet it weighed in below Buddhist Sri Lanka (with its score of 49) and the much abused US that pulled off a somewhat respectable 48.9.\n\nThis will come as a surprise to staunch Indophiles, if not to others convalescing from Delhi Belly and the after effects of foolhardy street food adventures. But the culprit, say travel business experts, is not food. It's safety. Too many toe-curling headlines have left demand for India limp, regardless of whether travellers are Muslim or not. That is part of a larger malaise.\n\nNOT STRICTLY HALAL\n\nAnd while several great Indian hotel chains from Taj and Oberoi to Leela, all brim with the right sort of Muslim-friendly sensibility, none can claim the green mantle. They are not strictly in any sense halal hotels, sorely lacking in prudence on alcohol consumption and the necessary male-female segregation to earn that nom de guerre.\n\nOne might argue that in India, despite the machinations of a saffron government, syncretic, tolerant Islam is so much part of the nation's fabric that catering exclusively for the halal crowd would be as risible as having five-star hotels just for Brahmins, Sikhs, Hindus or Christians. Even avant-garde USA would not entertain the notion of a kosher Jewish hotel or beds for Catholics who want in-room rosaries and free ecumenical wine. Sensible hotels cater for all segments.\n\nYet, halal status is exactly what Japan is aiming for. Having realised that its showcase sakura - and the limping GDP too - could acquire a fuller bloom with an injection of visitor cash, the country is pulling out all the stops, from prayer mats at airports to silk hijabs in storefronts, halal menus at restaurants, and even halal whale meat. It is one way Japan hopes to get to that 20-million visitor number in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Even sunburnt Australia, better known for carting off boat people to holding camps in Papua New Guinea, is straining to rectify its bruised image with Tourism Australia offering a \"halal travel guide\" to the country.\n\nBangkok's alcohol-free Al Meroze hotel, is a self-proclaimed halal hotel with front office receptionists in immaculately chaste head scarves, a Mediterranean restaurant with the right sorts of meats, a prayer room, toiletries unsullied by animal fat, and an attractive rooftop pool that is open only to women during the morning and just men from midday on. There is no spa, but there is enough of that in a city where you cannot stretch out an arm without being hauled off into some scented den with the promise of aromatherapy and blushingly more.\n\nAnd now, a vigorous and adventurous Gen Z has added impetus to this fortuitous conflation of greenbacks and green travel that offers a tantalisingly attractive and potentially profitable alternative path to heal political wounds and bridge cultural divides.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

More to the point, Bella is an obsessive-compulsive recluse living alone in a rented house in the heart of London. She checks the clock 20 times before leaving for work at the local library, wearing the same buttoned-to-the-collar black dress. In her larder are identical tins of food neatly aligned, and she has seven toothbrushes, one for each day of the week.\n\nBy contrast, her backyard is a tangle of weeds. Bella, you see, has a phobia of plants from having been abandoned as an orphaned infant in Hyde Park, where she was found in the middle of winter protected by ducks.\n\nTom Wilkinson is the next-door neighbour Alfie Stephenson, a curmudgeonly retiree widower, who, wouldn't you know it, is an amazing and committed horticulturist. Alfie is aghast at the overgrown jungle across his fence. He alerts the landlord, and Bella is given 30 days to tidy up her \"unmitigated eco-apocalypse\" or be evicted.\n\nBella has an ally in Alfie's Irish cook Vernon (Andrew Scott), also a widower, a young father of twin girls.\n\nShe additionally has a shy courtship subplot with a nerdy inventor of mechanical creatures (Jeremy Irvine). Both the latter and the equally infatuated Vernon are redundant characters included only to underscore how adorable the beautiful, neurotic Bella is, as if there could be any other type of heroine in such quasi-magical rom-com confections since the French gamine Audrey Tautou made an international hit of Am\u00e9lie (2001).\n\nEven mean old Alfie eventually warms to Bella. The movie is their Odd Couple story: the nemesis turns mentor, helping Bella overcome her fears through gardening, and the garden is a metaphor for the duo's budding friendship, the flowering of a woman, the blossoming of her literary ambitions, all that.\n\nThe whimsy is a little much. Otherwise, fresh-faced Findlay and a crotchety Wilkinson are an enjoyable match, and the flora and fauna are colourful; which is to say, everything's coming up roses.\n\nRating: B-\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company aims to raise up to A$10 million (S$10.4 million) to support its innovations in energy solutions to grow its operations in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Raffles will acquire all securities in GasHub. Raffles will issue 150 million new Raffles shares to GasHub group shareholders, valuing the company at A$30 million, and 50 million shares to the public at the issue price of A$0.20 per share. The public offer will open on July 13 and close on Aug 11.\n\nCommenting on the ASX listing, Aviers Lim, group CEO of GasHub, said: \"Listing on the ASX will provide us with a springboard to launch the company across Asia-Pacific and market our eco-friendly and cost-effective energy solutions and technologyinnovations.\"\n\nMr Lim added that the capital raised will be used to further develop GasHub's technology division and roll out its patented 3GEX System, an energy system that harvests energy from lower temperature heat sources and produces electricity.\n\nOn why it didn't list on the Singapore Exchange (SGX), GasHub told The Business Times that the Australian market is very familiar with energy players, given that many of these companies are listed on the ASX.\n\n\"We believe that the ASX offers the appropriate platform at this time to support the company at its current level of growth. The liberalised Australian LNG market and abundant supply of natural gas provides good potential for GasHub to capitalise on downstream opportunities in the gas piping business.\"\n\nGasHub added that it does not rule out the possibility of listing on SGX in the future.\n\nCurrently, the gas piping and engineering services market in Singapore is \"fragmented\", but there are opportunities for GasHub to increase its dominance, the company said.\n\nGasHub operates in two divisions: GasHubin Engineering Private Limited (Engineering), a gas-energy provider for commercial and residential users, and GasHubin Technology Private Limited (Technology), a developer of high-technology energy efficiency products.\n\nAs at Dec 31, 2016, GasHub's annual revenue is S$10.8 million and its net profit after tax is S$0.65 million.\n\nA press release issued on Tuesday by ASX said that on the company's consolidated financial performance in the fiscal year ended Dec 31, 2017, revenue is expected to increase to about A$12 million due to the operations acquired.\n\nNet profit before tax is projected to be about A$1 million and expenditure will increase by about A$10.5 million, comprising mainly expenses relating to the operations acquired and additional corporate overheads of A$275,000.\n\nFollowing completion of the proposed acquisition, the board of directors from Raffles will resign and Raffles will change its name to GasHubUnited Holding Limited.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While not a physical centre, TechnIC@SATS will spearhead the efforts to improve productivity and enhance SATS' operations amid a tight labour market.\n\nIt will focus on areas such as digital business, robotics and the Internet of Things. Some ideas already in the works have come from its employees, though the ground-handler and caterer is also working with local and overseas-based companies such as ST Dynamics and Doog.\n\nFor instance, the group is currently testing a food delivery automated guided vehicle (AGV) dubbed Dolly, which can transport trolleys full of catered food. Currently, the group's catering staff have to push several trolleys weighing up to 200kg.\n\nIn addition, the ground-handler is trying out a smart wheelchair system, which will allow one staff to oversee a convoy of wheelchairs that leverage on visual markers to move autonomously in the airport. This frees up staff since the arrival of a single flight can require up to 40 requests for wheelchair assistance.\n\nMeanwhile, SATS is planning to eventually use robotic chef, Roboto, to whip up laksa for passengers at its lounge at Changi Airport.\n\nSATS chief executive officer Alex Hungate said: \"By harnessing the power of technology, we can provide more dynamic, agile services that make travel seamless for passengers and enhances connectivity, eCommerce shipments as well as improve quality and cost of our food.\" He went on to add: \"Investments in technology also give us better operating leverage as we scale our business.\"\n\nSATS' efforts are in line with the Air Transport Industry Transformation Map, which was launched last month to create more opportunities and better jobs in the aviation industry.\n\nSecond Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng said: \"Through this initiative, we can leverage technology to automate manpower intensive processes, thus raising Changi's productivity and efficiency, as well as transforming manual jobs into high quality ones. We hope to see more partnerships and new ideas being developed, so as to further enhance Changi's competitiveness.\"\n\nMr Ng was the guest-of-honour at the launch ceremony at Changi Airport on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nSATS first starting deploying robotics and automation in its operations in 2014 with initiatives such as AGVs and an automated cutlery sorter.\n\nSuch efforts have helped boost operating margins from 10.2 per cent in FY14/15 to 13.3 per cent in FY16/17. In addition, it has chalked up a 7.7 per cent increase in value added per employment cost over the last three years. But it is doing this with less employees, which has allowed it to bump up wages per worker.\n\nShares in SATS closed at S$5.08 on Wednesday, up one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ang was represented by Hamidul Haq of Rajah & Tann.\n\nAng was a remisier at Maybank Kim Eng in 2013 when his friend and former BSI Bank wealth planner Yeo Jiawei asked for help in obtaining a favourable valuation report for Saudi oil company PetroSaudi Oil Services for a client, according to the prosecution's statement of facts. PetroSaudi is a company at the heart of money laundering investigations into 1MDB, and Yeo is currently appealing his conviction and 30-month sentence related to witness tampering charges as part of the probe, and is awaiting trial on money laundering charges.\n\nThe prosecution said NRA Capital was appointed to perform the report after they confirmed, upon viewing PetroSaudi's finances, that they could meet the target valuation of US$2.4 billion.\n\nThe analyst assigned to the job was Jacky Lee Chee Waiy, who went on to become head of research at Phillip Securities. After NRA was appointed, Ang arranged to meet Mr Lee outside of the office to try to persuade Mr Lee to rush the report, the prosecution said.\n\nMr Lee told Ang that he was working on other projects and was supposed to go to Malaysia for the weekend. Ang then told Mr Lee that the \"deal had already been done\" and that the valuation was needed simply to justify the deal, the prosecution said. Ang then gave Mr Lee an envelope containing S$3,000 for him to stay in Singapore to complete the valuation. Mr Lee accepted the money, the prosecution said.\n\nThe bribe expedited the completion of the report, and allowed Ang to collect US$235,000 in referral fees, the prosecution said. That referral fee was received from NRA, which had in turn received US$300,000 from Affinity Equity International Partners, a firm owned by Malaysian Eric Tan. Mr Tan is a close business associate of Malaysian tycoon Low Taek Jho, who is being targeted by investigators for his role in the 1MDB affairs.\n\nThe prosecution said on Wednesday that Ang has offered to surrender his referral fee to the state.\n\nAng, who is currently unemployed, is not expected to appeal.\n\nWith Ang's sentence, Singapore prosecutors have earned convictions on all five people charged so far in the 1MDB probe. Besides Yeo, former Falcon Bank branch manager Jens Sturzenegger received a 28-week prison sentence and S$128,000 fine on charges related to the movement of funds from 1MDB; and former BSI bankers Yak Yew Chee and Yvonne Seah received jail terms of 18 weeks and two weeks respectively for forging documents and failing to disclose suspicious transactions.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nM'sian money, opulent ideas, but now a forced sale\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With the onslaught of new infrastructure projects coming on stream across Asia, the development of local capital markets has become of vital importance.\n\nTwo infrastructure projects in Singapore could trigger more capital markets activity - the North-South Corridor, which will connect the north of the island to the city centre via roads, cycling paths and walkways, and the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed Railway.\n\nA strong local currency capital market is important for Singapore to diversify credit sources - creating an alternative to bank funding, and helping to recycle savings and investments from institutional fund managers, insurance companies and pension funds into development projects. Capital markets help to ensure that long-dated assets are funded by long-term investors, and that credit flows remain stable in times of volatility.\n\nInfrastructure financing has been recognised as a key potential driver for achieving this objective, but is still in its infancy in Asia. With its strong fiscal position, Singapore has historically self-funded most of its projects. As a result, project bonds and other institutional investments in infrastructure finance have played only a small part in capital markets activity.\n\nAt US$92 billion, Singapore's local currency debt market is also relatively modest in size, equivalent to about 10% of total domestic bank assets, according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Having this large banking base means that there has historically been sufficient capacity in the loan markets to satisfy demand without needing to turn to the bond markets.\n\nWhile it is likely that the traditional routes of bank debt and government financing will remain the dominant credit sources for Singapore's infrastructure development, the government has recognised the need for more projects - or the companies involved in building them - to turn to the capital markets.\n\nIn addition, banks are facing stricter regulatory and capital requirements that may temper their lending appetite, particularly in longer maturities. This means that projects like the North-South Corridor and the high speed railway represent an opportunity for infrastructure companies, investors and capital markets to work together.\n\nRegulators have been laying the framework for the development of the project bond market. For example, the Asian Bond Grant from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) aims to broaden the issuer base in Singapore's bond markets and to promote the country as a regional financial hub. For qualifying Asian issuance, the grant will help to offset up to 50% of one-time issuance costs such as international legal fees, arranger fees and credit rating fees.\n\nThe inclusion of Asian issuers under the programme is important, because it is likely that a meaningful amount of the primary or supporting contractual work for the construction of Singapore's infrastructure pipeline will be assigned to entities within the region. If these entities require extra capital to undertake the projects, the grant will help reduce their costs for tapping the capital markets for the first time, and will provide a compelling incentive to raise funds in Singapore.\n\nREGAINING LOST FOOTING\n\nAs recently as a decade ago, Singapore was a popular listing destination for small Chinese companies. However, after a series of accounting and other irregularities led to subsequent share price falls and delistings, the volume of Chinese initial public offerings dropped significantly.\n\nInfrastructure presents opportunities to deepen Singapore's capital markets and regain its footing in foreign listings. China Construction Bank recently signed a memorandum of understanding with International Enterprise Singapore, a government development agency, under which it will provide US$30 billion worth of financing services to companies in Singapore and China investing in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) infrastructure projects.\n\nThe bank followed this up by listing its first 1 billion yuan (S$201.3 million) BRI infrastructure bond on the Singapore Exchange. Such deals will help to promote the city state's capital markets to Chinese companies. Currently, there are 120 Chinese companies and 103 yuan bonds listed on the Singapore Exchange.\n\nOther efforts include the formation of Clifford Capital in 2012. Funded by Temasek, a Singapore state investment agency, and other financial institutions, Clifford Capital's mandate is to promote the role of Singapore-based companies in infrastructure projects, both within the country and abroad. Companies must be listed or incorporated on the Singapore Exchange and have local head offices to be eligible for funding.\n\nWhile the MAS has been successful in its efforts to develop domestic capital markets, there has been little project bond activity, reflecting a widespread Asian preference for financing projects through the conventional project finance loan market or the dollar, yen and euro bond markets.\n\nThis puts Singapore in pole position to spearhead the development of the project bond market and promote itself as a regional hub for raising infrastructure financing.\n\nChallenges remain. While investors have over time become savvier and more accepting of complex credits (such as high yield and hybrid instruments), there is not yet broad acceptance of amortising structures, or of greenfield and construction risk.\n\nNevertheless, Singapore is an infrastructure project haven, with a pipeline of well-developed projects that provide significant business and investment opportunities for companies and investors. There is every reason to believe that these projects are a natural fit for large institutional investors such as insurers and pension funds, for which longer-term investments in high-quality infrastructure assets with predictable revenue generation make logical sense.\n\nThe MAS has been collaborating with the industry to ensure there is transparency in the market, not only to promote bond issuance but to ensure diversification of risks so that portfolio managers can confidently allocate infrastructure holdings.\n\nGood infrastructure is the key indicator in identifying new urban renewal investment and development prospects. Existing and emerging infrastructure, particularly transport and community amenities, leads to population growth and consequently commercial and capital growth.\n\nTo achieve all that, Singapore needs credit and capital, which it is not short of. The country already has a wealth of experience as a regional finance hub. All the elements are in place - investor interest, infrastructure demand and incentives that make it compelling as a capital markets destination.\n\nA closer look reveals that the insurance and project finance industries are maturing and looking to expand. The ADB says there is an annual requirement for US$1.7 trillion for infrastructure investment in Asia (amounting to a cumulative US$22.6 trillion through to 2030). China's BRI presents even more opportunities for economies around the region.\n\nThrow in the Asian bond grant and other MAS programmes and there is a strong case for Singapore's potential success as an infrastructure finance hub. Capital market development is all about timing. For Singapore, right now is as good as it gets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We are also affirming the 'axAAA/axA-1+' Asean regional scale ratings on them.\"\n\nThe three banks are the only financial institutions in Asean to have the coveted \"AA-\" rating.\n\nThe outlooks on the issuer credit ratings are stable, said S&P.\n\n\"We affirmed the ratings because we believe Singapore banks are coming from a position of strength and have sufficient buffers against downside risks.\"\n\nThe net profits of Singapore banks have lost some momentum due to weakening asset quality and higher provisioning costs, it noted.\n\nThe ratio of non-performing loan (NPL) of these banks rose from 1.1 per cent in 2015 to 1.4 per cent last year.\n\nThe ratings agency said: \"The bulk of new NPLs originated from the vulnerable offshore oil and gas O&G support-services sector.\n\n\"We believe that O&G-related NPLs are not yet over.\n\n\"Although the rally in oil prices to US$50 per barrel - from the January 2016 low of US$28 - is positive, it is unlikely to resurrect the offshore O&G services industry.\"\n\nS&P said the slide in oil prices had deterred upstream activity by oil majors and dented the profitability of upstream services providers.\n\n\"This is compounded by overcapacity as these companies had made investments for future growth before 2014, until oil prices took a steep dive. We also expect credit costs to remain elevated to cover potential O&G collateral shortfalls from constrained valuations.\n\n\"In our opinion, downside risks from upstream O&G services-sector exposures, at about 2 per cent of total system loans, are manageable.\"\n\nSingapore banks have identified most of the vulnerable exposures, and are working to rehabilitate or restructure the loans, it said.\n\nLoan exposures outside of offshore O&G support industry have continued to perform well, and will likely continue to do so in 2017, it said.\n\n\"We forecast Singapore banks' loan growth to remain subdued in 2017 at mid-single digit, broadly in line with bank guidance. We expect the banks' interest margins to improve moderately with a time lag, given a higher probability of more rate hikes in the US.\n\n\"We estimate that every 25 basis points (bps) hike in US rates could translate to a 3 bps-5 bps uplift in net interest margins (NIMs) for Singapore banks. Sluggish loan growth and higher credit costs, offset by higher NIMs, will characterise Singapore banks' earnings in 2017. This will culminate in modest to flattish profit growth.\"\n\nThe three banks have been outperformers on the local bourse; their stocks have risen by between 15 per cent and 21 per cent so far this year.\n\nThe benchmark Straits Times Index is up 12 per cent in the year to date.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Meanwhile, demand-pull inflationary pressures remained low,\" the MPC said.\n\n\"Thus, the committee viewed that monetary policy should remain accommodative, and would stand ready to utilize available policy tools to sustain economic growth while also ensuring financial stability.\" Thai rates will likely stay on a \"prolonged hold\", said Krystal Tan, Asia economist of Capital Economics.\n\n\"The ongoing economic recovery means there is no need for rate cuts... Equally, there is no strong impetus for rate hikes either,\" she said.\n\nThe central bank is counting on government spending to keep the economy growing at a time of high household debt levels and risks of capital outflows as the US Federal Reserve plans more rate hikes this year.\n\nThe improved growth outlook was still subject to risks including \"US economic and foreign trade policies, China's economic structural reforms, and geopolitical risks,\" the MPC said.\n\nAll 19 economists polled by Reuters forecast no policy change on Wednesday. Most analysts expect the rates to hold through 2017 but some predicted a rate hike.\n\nIn January-March, Southeast Asia's second-largest economy grew at its fastest quarterly pace in four years, but it has still lagged regional peers for years.

It will update its forecasts on July 5.\n\nThe BOT said recent moves in the baht remain in line with regional currencies.\n\nThe baht traded at 34.42 per dollar on Wednesday. It has appreciated about 4 per cent against the dollar this year.\n\nLast month, Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob said the BOT was ready to act on any excessive baht moves and would relax previously-announced rules on capital outflows.\n\nThe BOT has cut the size of its weekly short-dated bond supply since April to try to slow foreign inflows.

Higher rates mean that America has to pay more to borrow, and the combination of more elevated rates and a smaller balance sheet will leave the Fed with lower excess earnings, which it pays back to the Treasury.\n\nThe double whammy is reflected in the president's proposed budget and projections, released this week. Mr Trump's administration sees Fed remittances falling from US$116 billion in fiscal year 2016 to a low of US$50 billion in 2020 before rebounding.\n\nGiven the administration's proposals, the budget also projects that net interest outlays will climb from US$240 billion last fiscal year to US$428 billion by 2020 as rates increase.\n\n\"It's the price you pay for a good economy,\" said Joseph Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington and former Fed board official.\n\nThe Fed lifted interest rates once in 2015, again in 2016 and most recently in March. Minutes from policymakers' May meeting, set for release at 2pm Wednesday in Washington, will probably underline that officials anticipate two more 25-basis-point increases in 2017 and plan on starting to wind down Treasury and mortgage-backed security holdings before year-end.\n\nThose changes are coming thanks to a strong economy: the Fed is closing in on its goals of maximum employment and stable inflation near 2 per cent. That momentum also means that the administration's budgets will enjoy higher tax receipts than the Obama administration saw.\n\n\"The Obama regime benefited from the fact that we had zero or near-zero Fed rates throughout his term,\" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities LLC in New York. \"You have to put 'benefitted' in quotation marks, because it was an indication that the economy wasn't doing well.\"\n\nMr Stanley expects Fed remittances to fall by US$10 billion per year over the next several years, but he thinks that it's possible that they could drop even faster. There are two reasons why the Fed's surplus earnings are about to shrink: it will earn less on its holdings as maturing assets roll off, and the central bank will pay banks higher interest on excess reserves as rates move up.\n\nFalling remittances are expected and probably won't expose the Fed to a lot of congressional criticism. Central bankers would have more to worry about if they have to lift rates higher than they expect and are forced to pay more on excess reserves than they're earning.\n\nEarnings could also dip into negative territory if quickly rising inflation spurred the Fed to shrink its balance sheet faster, selling assets at a loss. In either case, the Fed would stop paying remittances to the Treasury until returns rebounded.\n\n\"That's not the most likely scenario; it's a tail-risk type of scenario,\" Mr Stanley noted.\n\nStill, Raymond Stone, managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey, warned in a research note that if losses were to materialise, they \"could become a political 'hot potato' inviting unwanted congressional intrusion, compromising Fed independence\".

Other well-known JUNG products include smoke devices, USB charging sockets and home automation systems.\n\nJUNG has an established client list including numerous luxury condominiums, hotels, and residential homes. Projects in Singapore include the Four Seasons Hotel, Shangri-La hotels and apartments, condominiums like The Shelford and The Marq on Paterson Hill, and Sentosa Cove homes.\n\n\"People understand and appreciate German quality,\" said Shawn Ang, general sales manager of JUNG Asia.\n\n\"We strongly believe in the quality of our products and designs, and we pride ourselves on our after-sales service. When we sell our products, we want to be there for our customers,\" he said.\n\nToday, JUNG is at the forefront of the \"smart home\" revolution. It provides innovative systems for controlling lighting, blinds and air-conditioning in the home.\n\nThese systems incorporate wireless technologies to enable a wide range of functions including intercom messaging, multimedia control, and security cameras. They also meet requirements of cost-effectiveness and energy efficiency.\n\nJUNG's team of support engineers here includes a certified expert in KNX, the network communications protocol behind home automation.\n\n\"Our motto is 'Progress as a Tradition',\" Mr Ang said. \"We will continue to offer innovative switch systems and products with technical precision as well as a high standard of design.\"\n\nQ: What is JUNG's heritage and its tradition of innovation?\n\nIn 1912, electrician Albrecht Jung, aged 40, founded a factory in the idyllic town of Schalksm\u00fchle to produce his patented invention: A pull switch with a 1/8 rotation. Due to market demand, JUNG quickly specialised in making switches and sockets.\n\nIn the 1960s, the company launched a push-button switch which became a classic of contemporary switch design. As modern building requirements became tougher, JUNG stood out by continuously improving its product portfolio.\n\nToday, JUNG is confident that with its innovative approach and commitment to quality, the company can continue making successful products over the next 100 years.\n\nQ: What's the significance of JUNG's made-in- Germany products?\n\nGermans emphasise technology, design, functionality and product capabilities. German products are well known for their reliability and safety.\n\nSince 1912, JUNG has been based in Schalksm\u00fchle, a small town in Germany's state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It has a second production facility in L\u00fcnen, Westphalia, since 1941.\n\nJUNG is fully committed to its German manufacturing location, ensuring that its \"Made in Germany\" products are of the highest quality.\n\nQ: What are JUNG's plans for regional growth?\n\nJUNG's Asian headquarters were established in Singapore in 1997, initially covering Singapore, Malaysia, Bangkok, and Indonesia. The company then ventured into Hong Kong as a stepping stone into China, before expanding to Korea and Taiwan.\n\nToday, JUNG aims to grow in Singapore and the region by sharing the future of technology with architects and designers. Singapore is a regional design hub, with many international firms involved in projects in China, India, Hong Kong, and the Middle East.\n\nQ: What features are customers looking for today?\n\nAutomation is increasingly common. Centralised switches can control lighting and ventilation in different parts of the house like the kitchen or the car porch. A communication system has to be put in place.\n\nWe offer switch systems according to what our customers need, be it piped music coming into the dining room or a smartphone program that can remotely turn on security cameras.\n\nA new trend is LED lights replacing halogen lights. Last year, we introduced a switch that can brighten or dim different colours of lights, in addition to dimming or brightening them.\n\nQ: Please elaborate on JUNG's collaboration with the foundation of a famous architect.\n\nRenowned Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, who created architectural masterpieces in the 20th century, was concerned with chromatic harmony and the effects colours have on people and spaces.\n\nInspired by his colours, JUNG is offering its classic LS 990 range of switches in the 63 shades of Les Couleurs \u00ae Le Courbusier as a worldwide exclusive.\n\nEach of the colours can be harmoniously combined with others in the system. The switches are hand-painted using a special process, giving them an exceptional matt surface.\n\nOther than switches, sockets, rotary and touch dimmers, devices to control room functions like lighting or ventilation can also be integrated into the Les Couleurs system.\n\nQ: What awards has JUNG won?\n\nJUNG has time and again measured itself successfully against the best in the field.\n\nIt has consistently won prizes in the German Design Awards, one of the most recognised design competitions in the world. Awards were given to the real brass, Les Couleurs \u00ae Le Courbusier, and dark aluminium colours of its classic LS 990 Switch.\n\nOther recent wins include the Iconic Awards: Interior Innovation, The Most Innovative Brand Award 2016, Trade Award of the Year 2016, Best Product 2016/2017, and the Innovation Award for Architecture + Technology 2016.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/0da9a385be1dc3e2cbe4bbbbad0f862e5dda24fd4d96063df4aeaef4985f9b37?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": null}]}

Sea is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley on the share sale, the people said. Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, companies with less than US$1 billion in annual revenue can file for an IPO with the SEC privately and work out the details outside the public eye.\n\nThe company, founded in 2009 by entrepreneur Forrest Li, began as an online gaming portal and has since branched out to add mobile shopping and payment services. A US$1 billion deal would be the largest technology IPO out of South-east Asia, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and be a boon for backers such as Tencent Holdings Ltd.\n\nRepresentatives for Sea, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\n\nThe startup said earlier this month that it raised another US$550 million in funding as it steps up a battle in Indonesia with rivals including Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The latest funding round brought in some of the region's wealthiest families as new investors, including GDP Venture, backed by the son of Indonesian clove cigarette tycoon Budi Hartono, and JG Summit Holdings Inc, founded by Philippine billionaire John Gokongwei.\n\nAny overseas listing of Sea would be a blow for Singapore, which has been trying to woo local startups to sell shares at home as it seeks to build a regional hub for fast-growing, innovative companies. Singapore Exchange Ltd is nearing a deal with the country's technology regulator to develop a system for pairing startups with investors, in a move to encourage such listings, people with knowledge of the matter said this week.

Concrete columns with a height of 12 metres and crosshead pieces joining 160-ton beams will be transported to the construction site. There, they will be installed, Lego-like, to form the finished structure.\n\n\"Traditionally we would place the moulds, cast the columns and the crossheads, and place the reinforcement bars at the construction site,\" said Thomas Ng, 48, founder and managing director of Hwa Seng Builder (HSB), the homegrown firm handling the project.\n\n\"By using precast technology, the construction process is safer, and more environmentally-friendly. We can also improve our productivity and reduce our reliance on foreign labour.\"\n\nPrecast technology, the process of making construction materials away from the construction site, has been used for easily repeatable items like walls and floor slabs.\n\nIt is less commonly used in the civil engineering space, like the Punggol bridge.\n\nHSB can forge new ground and stand apart from its peers because of the willingness of its relatively young, mid-40s management team to adapt and act on new trends, Mr Ng said.\n\nIts use of precast technology has multiple benefits.\n\nFor one, the construction process is safer. Workers do not have to clamber up and down tall bridge columns, which would otherwise have been made on site.\n\nThe installation process is also faster, with a precast column installed in a week instead of three weeks on-site.\n\nIt is also more environmentally-friendly, said Alan Nah, 45, executive director of projects.\n\n\"There is less noise disturbance. The waterway is an active reservoir and casting on site would have resulted in debris dropping into the water,\" he said.\n\nVirtual modelling\n\nPrecast technology is not the only way which HSB stays ahead. For the past few years, it has been using building information models (BIM), a three-dimensional, computer-aided modelling system.\n\nBIMs allow engineers to better visualise the construction process down to the smallest details before work begins. This minimises design incompatibilities and reduces the chance of wasted work.\n\nHSB has also begun to manage its construction process through virtual design and construction (VDC), a management method that incorporates BIM to improve productivity and efficiency.\n\nMr Nah said the use of technology helps the communication process with workers, suppliers and clients. The BIM system can even be plugged into virtual reality headsets, allowing for virtual walkthroughs.\n\nOn the ground, specialised sorting machines are used to improve productivity, a GPS tracking system manages logistics, and closed-circuit TVs allow for remote monitoring.\n\nAn electronic permit-to-work system for critical activities, enabled using Novade software, helps speed up workflow and enhances work safety. The software also helps to collate near misses and non-conformance.\n\n25 years of developing people\n\nHSB has grown significantly from its beginnings in 1992 as a sub-contractor performing minor road and drain works to a 400-strong company with annual revenues of above S$100 million. The group celebrated their 25th Silver Jubilee this year.\n\n\"I started the business because I was influenced by my late father, who was a sub-contractor running a small company,\" Mr Ng said. His sister Jacqueline, a HSB director, is in charge of finance.\n\nIn 2010, HSB has qualified as an A1 contractor with the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), enabling it to bid for projects of unlimited value within the public sector.\n\nIts Punggol bridge project is part of a S$185-million tender awarded by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in 2015 for the design and construction of vehicular bridges and piled roadways on the former municipal landfill area at Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway (KPE) and the Tampines Expressway (TPE) interchange, including Link Road to Punggol Central.\n\nIn January 2017, HSB was awarded another S$74-million tender to build a new road in the area.\n\nA key reason for the company's success through the years is its team of qualified, competent and committed staff, Mr Ng said.\n\n\"Our most important asset is people. Everyone is looking for opportunities and better career advancement. You have to give good people opportunities, and treasure them, so they continue to contribute to the company.\"\n\nHSB thus sends managers and staff for overseas training. It also offers scholarships to existing staff as well as to university students so as to bring in new blood.\n\nThe company aims to be the long-term trusted and preferred civil engineering contractor among its clients by demonstrating its professional expertise and quality work within a safe, healthy and environmentally-conscious workplace, he said.\n\n\"We would also like to thank BCA for guiding and supporting us, and also our clients like LTA and Changi Airport Group for placing their trust in us and giving us the opportunity to explore new technology.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/52f4f0467ccd95453b6b5aae9d4a9fa0b173c132511e79447578d9efd9e2a44a?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": null}]}

The ball is now in the Queensland government's court.\"\n\nAustralia's largest coal project - which could fuel power generation for 100 million Indians and create 10,000 jobs in Queensland - has been delayed several times since first being proposed in 2010 due to protests and court claims from green groups concerned about its environmental impact.\n\nWestpac Banking Corp barred lending for the project in April due to a new policy on coal emissions. Gautam Adani, the billionaire chairman of Adani, said in March it could start mining coal from Carmichael in 2020.\n\nAn earlier royalties deal proposed by the state in March would see Adani pay less in the early years of the project but the same overall sum over the 60-year life of the development, Mr\n\nCanavan said. Adani will likely pay A$100 million to A$150 million (S$155.187million) a year in royalties based on its first phase target of producing 25 million tons a year of coal, with the final payment dependent on the prevailing coal price, the minister said.\n\nAdani expects to raise about US$2.5 billion to build a rail line connecting the mine with Abbot Point port over the next two years. The group will raise about US$800 million via equity and the rest through debt. That includes a controversial A$900 million loan from the government-backed Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, which Mr Canavan said continues to be assessed.\n\nFederal Labor leader Bill Shorten said while royalties need to be determined at a state level by the Labor government, he opposes using federal taxpayer money to subsidize the mining project.\n\nIf the Adani project \"is a commercial success then it doesn't need the taxpayers to underwrite a billion dollar loan to a multi-billion dollar coal company\", Shorten said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"That's our position, what Queensland does is ultimately a matter for them.\"\n\nAnnastacia Palaszczuk, premier of Queensland, didn't immediately respond to a voicemail request for comment.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": []}

But it has faced criticism and significant resistance from regulators in several countries, who accuse it of unfair competition and a lack of standards.\n\nUber was not immediately available for comment when contacted by AFP.\n\nIn April, Uber said that it would relaunch its services in Taiwan with a new business model following a two-month hiatus on the island after sparring with authorities over legal issues.\n\nIn January, the Taiwanese authorities hiked the maximum possible penalty to NT$25 million (S$1.15 million) per driver - the highest in the world.\n\nThe company withdrew from the market a month later, criticising the government's actions for hindering innovation and calling on President Tsai Ing-wen to take action.\n\nIt was also in April fined for operating an illegal taxi service in South Korea, where the service sparked angry protests from taxi drivers.

The Argentine pope has condemned the idea of using walls to keep out foreigners and slammed those who do as \"not Christian\".\n\nMr Trump, who grew up in a Presbyterian family but is not a regular churchgoer, said the accusation was \"disgraceful\".\n\nAnd while the pontiff is an ardent supporter of efforts to combat climate change, Mr Trump has pledged to pull the United States out of the COP21 Paris Agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe president, who will head to Brussels later Wednesday before returning to Italy for a G7 meeting, did not initially plan to meet the pope.\n\nWhen the unexpected, last-minute request came, the Vatican squeezed him into an early slot.\n\nHoly See sources said the president would have to enter the papal palace via a side door because the weekly Wednesday mass in Saint Peter's Square takes priority.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/looking-beyond-finance", "site_title": "Looking beyond finance", "publish_date": null, "content": "Looking beyond finance\n\nAs global leaders in infrastructure development convene in Singapore this week, they must confront a multi-trillion-dollar gap in investment. New solutions - some already being explored in Singapore - can help overcome this challenge.\n\nPublished Tue, May 23, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nMcKinsey\n\nFollow\n\nACROSS the globe - in developed and developing countries alike - insufficient and outdated infrastructure is eroding the quality of life for individuals and slowing national economic development. Adding to the challenge, trillions of dollars in infrastructure investment are needed annually just to keep pace with expected population growth.\n\nAlmost 200 world leaders in infrastructure development and investment are meeting in Singapore this week for the fourth annual Global Infrastructure Initiative (GII), a summit convened by global management consultancy McKinsey & Company. Among the crucial topics on the table is how to narrow the gap between current spending trends for road, bridges, water and power systems, and other essentials of public infrastructure and the projected needs.\n\nA new analysis from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), to be released this week in tandem with the summit, estimates that the world must invest US$3.7 trillion a year on infrastructure over the next two decades, primarily for roads and power systems, to keep up with population trends. In total, US$69 trillion of investment will be needed between now and 2035. The majority of the need is in emerging markets, and more than half is in Asia.\n\nHowever, investment to date is not keeping pace. MGI found that from 2000 to 2015, average investment rates lagged what will be needed going forward in many large economies. Notably, gaps appear most pronounced in Brazil, Indonesia and Mexico, but the developed world (e.g. the United States, United Kingdom and Germany) is also falling short. The gap to 2035 amounts to US$5.5 trillion even before additional costs to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nFortunately many countries understand the challenge and increased their infrastructure spending, in terms of share of GDP, between 2013 and 2015, notably India, Indonesia and South Africa as well as some European countries. At the same time, however, spending has stagnated in the United States. And it has dropped, arguably rightfully so, in China and Australia.\n\nOutdated and insufficient infrastructure can be dangerous as well as simply inconvenient. But beyond these considerations, inadequate infrastructure can be a significant drag on economic growth.\n\nAmong other benefits, appropriate infrastructure provides safe and reliable energy, promotes inclusive industrial growth, and eases movement of goods and labour. Every dollar invested in infrastructure can return an additional 20 cents to GDP in the long run, a 20 per cent rate of return.\n\nWithout doubt, governments must continue to increase their investment in infrastructure, but spending increases alone will not bridge the projected gap with real needs. Beyond finance, government must take the lead to ensure that infrastructure spending and assets deliver the greatest benefit.\n\nMcKinsey has identified three specific areas in which improved infrastructure efficiency and effectiveness can save more than US$1 trillion a year globally. Singapore is already exploring or leading in some of these opportunities and can offer first-hand insights to leaders gathered for the infrastructure summit.\n\nFirst, governments must strive to squeeze the most use out of existing infrastructure. While new projects often attract attention, improving and prolonging the life of current infrastructure could capture about two-fifths of the estimated savings.\n\nGovernments and asset owners can use modern data analytics to prioritise maintenance and repairs, deploy smart systems that augment capacity and reduce demand with targeted pricing mechanisms.\n\nSingapore, for example, implemented an electronic road pricing system in 1998 for traffic in the country's central business district. The system, the first of its kind, is credited with lowering traffic volume and providing a more efficient transportation network. The system is also expected to be expanded to include features like parking payments and real-time traffic information.\n\nNext, public and private sectors must work together to deliver projects more efficiently, beginning with construction. Streamlined delivery accounts for another two-fifths of the estimated savings. MGI found that, globally, annual labour-productivity growth in construction averaged just one per cent over the past two decades, compared with an average of 2.8 per cent for all sectors and 3.6 per cent for manufacturing.\n\nDespite improvements in recent years, construction productivity across Asia continues to lag that in other industries. In Malaysia and Singapore, for example, labour productivity in construction is about a third the average seen across other industries, which costs Singapore about US$15 billion a year in lost value and Malaysia about US$11 billion. The situation is more pressing in Indonesia, where construction productivity is just more than a tenth the overall average, costing the economy about US$190 billion a year in lost value.\n\nBy addressing a full menu of initiatives - regulation, design processes, contract structures, procurement and supply-chain management, on-site execution, new technology, materials and automation, and workforce development - construction productivity could be boosted by up to 60 per cent, MGI concludes.\n\nThe final fifth in estimated savings comes from improved project selection. Too often, for instance, projects are still approved based on a \"wow\" factor, political tradeoffs or wildly optimistic use projections. Instead, governments should use fact-based analysis to identify projects that present the strongest objective business cases and to evaluate the realistic costs and benefits of each idea.\n\nAs the world struggles to meet the infrastructure needs of a growing population, increased finance is just a part of the solution. Governments and private companies can work harder to extract greater good from current assets and new funding, delivering greater benefits to individuals and companies and creating a smoother path for economic growth.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in New Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/ec30bc523dd0d5853c3e3b2bdd851bef3ecd76948c3525880899bb39074920c2?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Singapore implemented an electronic road pricing system in 1998 and the system, the first of its kind, has been credited with lowering traffic volume and providing a more efficient transportation network."}]}

The exploit infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, crippling everything from hospitals to logistics firms.\n\nWhile it will take months for forensic investigators to sift through the fallout, in the short term, the attack has provided a timely wake-up call to businesses in every industry about the importance of security.\n\nWorking closely with businesses large and small, we've had a unique insight into the real-world impact of WannaCry at Tata Communications. Here are three key learnings from the incident to help protect your organisation.\n\nUPDATE, UPDATE, UPDATE\n\nIn theory, the impact of the WannaCry ransomware should have been minimal because Microsoft rolled out a patch for the vulnerability on March 14. But internal estimates at Tata Communications suggest that in reality, only 10 to 15 per cent of businesses around the world had implemented the critical update. The majority of businesses were unprotected and had to firefight the attack with emergency patching.\n\nThis brings us to our first important lesson: Business leaders need to appreciate the importance of security updates. All too often we see IT departments needing to wait for approval from divisions higher up in the hierarchy before they can issue critical patches. For example, CFOs may be unwilling to sign off on updates because it risks application downtime during critical periods, such as the end of a financial quarter when every sale counts. Delaying a security update may provide a short-term benefit but as WannaCry dramatically showed, doing so can leave you vulnerable in the long term.\n\nEVOLVE YOUR SECURITY MINDSET\n\nToday, we're seeing SMEs and large corporations adapting their business models to re-invent themselves during the era of digital disruption. This same principle needs to be applied to the way they handle security internally.\n\nInvesting in the best infrastructure is the foundation of any security strategy. But just because you have a secure network on Day 1 doesn't mean you can be complacent. Once infrastructure is put in place, many organisations fall back into the outdated practice of \"incident response\". This spells disaster in the digital era where issues can arise and snowball by the minute.\n\nSo what should be the strategy?\n\nThe answer is to move towards a \"continuous response\" mindset. This can be achieved by investing in detection and predictive tools and services to gain a 360-degree overview of your defences and address weaknesses as soon as possible. The digital transformation that many organisations are undergoing currently represents an opportunity to harness new digital technology.\n\nI can't stress enough the importance of adaptability for this strategy to work. You need to have the latest information on vulnerabilities at your fingertips, which will allow you to make informed decisions and increase overall security.\n\nTRUST THE EXPERTS\n\nWith security exploits emerging at unprecedented rates, it's almost impossible for businesses today to navigate the security minefield alone. With that in mind, it's become essential to seek out the expertise of a managed security services provider for two reasons.\n\nWorking with a security provider can help you develop a solid preventative strategy. The firm can, for example, provide sustained monitoring solutions, and advice on how and when to release the latest patches into the systems to ensure optimal protection and minimise downtime.\n\nSecondly, a security provider can also give invaluable support during times of crisis. As soon as word of WannaCry spreads, it would be on hand with an emergency helpdesk and would proactively reach out to its customers to help patch their antivirus systems, servers and desktops. This would go a long way towards mitigating any follow-up attacks in the future.\n\nRemember, security is not a perfect science. You won't be able to thwart every cyber-attack ahead of time but much like the game of chess, implementing a good strategy will always swing the odds in your favour.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unfortunately, I must go there now,\" he said at the start of the meeting.\n\nThe announcement of martial law came after security forces battled dozens of IS-linked gunmen in a Marawi, a city of about 200,000 people in Mindanao, on Tuesday.\n\nMarawi is about 800km south of Manila, the nation's capital.\n\n\"Our country needs modern weapons... to fight against the Islamic State group we need weapons,\" Mr Duterte said in Moscow.\n\nDefence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said one policeman and two soldiers were killed in the clashes, which began when security forces raided a house where they believed Isnilon Hapilon, a leader of the infamous Abu Sayyaf kidnap gang and Philippine head of IS, was hiding.\n\nPhotos posted on social media by residents showed the gunmen walking through the streets of Marawi and placing black flags that looked similar to those used by IS.\n\nMr Lorenzana said the gunmen, who were believed to number more than 100, had occupied a hospital and a jail, and burnt down buildings including a Catholic Church.\n\nHe said many were hiding in buildings as snipers, making it difficult for security forces to combat them.\n\nThe Abu Sayyaf, based on the most southern islands of Mindanao, has kidnapped hundreds of Filipinos and foreigners since the early 1990s to extract ransoms. The United States lists it as a terrorist organisation.\n\nAbu Sayyaf militants beheaded an elderly German man early this year and two Canadians last year after ransom demands for many millions of dollars were not met.\n\nIt has also been blamed for the country's worst terrorist attacks, including the 2004 bombing of a ferry in Manila Bay that claimed more than 100 lives.\n\nIS THREAT\n\nThe US State Department offers a US$5-million bounty for Hapilon's capture.\n\nSecurity analysts say Hapilon has been trying to unite Filipino militant groups that have professed allegiance to IS.\n\nThese include the Maute group, which is based near Marawi.\n\nThe Maute group has engaged in repeated deadly battles with the military over the past year in rural areas around Marawi.\n\nMuslim rebels have been waging a rebellion since the 1970s for an independent or autonomous homeland in Mindanao, with the conflict claiming more than 130,000 lives.\n\nThe main Muslim rebel groups are involved in peace talks with the government.\n\nBut the Abu Sayyaf, Maute and other hardline groups are claiming they want to set up an Islamic caliphate in the south for IS, according to security analysts.\n\nThe fighting on Tuesday came six weeks after the military foiled a mass kidnapping attempt by the Abu Sayyaf on the central island of Bohol that is popular with foreign tourists.\n\nThe US and other Western governments warned this month that terrorists were planning to kidnap foreigners in other tourist hotspots in the western and central Philippines, adding to longstanding advisories of abduction threats in Mindanao.\n\nMr Duterte, 72, known internationally for waging a war on drugs that has claimed thousands of lives, had said on many occasions since becoming president last year that he was prepared to declare martial law nationally as well as in Mindanao.\n\nHowever Mr Lorenzana emphasised on Tuesday that martial law on this occasion remained restricted to Mindanao.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

Efforts by officials to decrease the nation's enormous debt pile without destabilising domestic markets are having profound consequences, most visibly in the bond market, where the yields on short-term debt have risen above those on longer maturities for the first time.\n\nThe implications are more than just academic - they will likely pressure China to allow the yuan to become a free-floating currency sooner rather than later.\n\nMarket historians know that an inverted yield curve generally means tougher economic times ahead and the potential for capital flight. Presumably, the Chinese know this as well, which is why it has embarked on a flurry of initiatives to give foreign investors broader access to the nation's markets. China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange allowed foreign investors to hedge onshore yuan forwards, Chinese government bond futures were launched by the Hong Kong Exchange, and China Bond Connect was established to provide mutual access between mainland and Hong Kong bond markets. And by year-end, China could be included in major bond indices, resulting in an estimated US$250 billion flowing into its debt securities as global investors scoop them up to maintain pace with changes to benchmark indexes.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Wealth & Investing\n\nWhat family offices need from wealth managers today\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:19 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nM&A a quiet tailwind for tech sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:34 PM\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/5fa2dfb52d22522f2ddf4a42b23d57e2bf70483dd1e8bf49a1c75d040bd7cb8f?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "If China's financial liberalisation policies continue, it is likely that external corporate debt issuance will pick up to meet foreign demand."}]}

Our customers are the consumers of the world and this is by far the biggest region,\" said Symrise's chief executive Heinz-Juergen Bertram.\n\n\"We invest consciously where we believe it makes sense. Asia was, is and will continue to be one of the most important areas for us.\"\n\nDr Bertram added that Symrise aims to increase Asia-Pacific sales from 21 per cent of total sales to about 33 per cent by 2025, mainly through organic growth rather than acquisitions.\n\nLionel Flutto, president of Symrise's Asia-Pacific Flavour division, said that while the centre's main focus will be on Asian products and consumers, it will also develop methodology and testing for global companies.\n\n\"Flavour is a very small percentage of the final product composition, typically 0.1 per cent of the total final product. But when it comes to driving consumer preference, it's a dominant factor,\" said Mr Flutto.\n\n\"We've moved from a period where the US and Europe were the influencing taste, to now Asia being the influencing taste for consumers in Europe and the US. The better we understand here, the more authentic we will be over there,\" he added.\n\nIn the sensory and consumer insights division, sensory experts will test flavours in individual tasting booths with temperature, ventilation and lighting control. Focus groups will be conducted in purpose-built facilities equipped with one-way mirrors and audio and visual recording equipment.\n\nThe state-of-the-art laboratories will be used in the R&D of encapsulation and flavours delivery technologies for applications such as dry formats of beverages. Symrise aims to develop rich and complex flavours for natural, halal-compliant and meat-free products.\n\nFlavour creation and prototyping will take place in the kitchens, and Symrise plans to increase its production capability in its local plants to deliver results quickly to clients.\n\nMr Flutto said: \"As a flavour company, we have a responsibility to deliver a product that will be the winning taste for the consumer. And because the markets are moving so fast, the speed to market for our customers has become absolutely essential.\"\n\nSymrise's existing production functions in Singapore comprise a flavour encapsulation plant, liquid flavour plant and liquid automation plant.\n\nThe company has an 11 per cent market share in the flavours and fragrances industry, and started expanding its reach to new nutrition sectors such as probiotics and pet food about three years ago. Symrise is currently the market leader in flavours for pet food, holding 45 per cent of the market share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The timing, which coincides with the Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and G-7 summits of Western powers, underlines that Beijing and Moscow have an alternative cooperation agenda on multiple issues, including the Korean nuclear stand-off and the Syrian conflict.\n\nWhile Korea tensions will probably top the agenda, the two countries also enjoy an extensive bilateral economic dialogue which has warmed, in certain areas, since the crisis in Ukraine which has seen Russia's suspension from the G-8 (now the G-7 in Moscow's absence). In the period following the escalation of those tensions, Russia has for instance announced plans for a number of cooperation projects with China including a new method of inter-bank transfers, and a joint credit agency that seeks to create a shared financial and economic infrastructure that will allow them to function independently of Western-dominated financial institutions.\n\nChina and Russia are also among the states involved in creating alternative fora to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, including the New Development Bank (NDB). This will finance infrastructure and other projects in the BRICS states, and a related US$100 billion special currency reserve fund.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/2a3a8657279ee86655a6f624dcd79f51ce249e6d8f34df98bf9fd049b93a1ef9?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The regime last month celebrated the 105th anniversary of the birth of its founder with a huge military parade."}]}

Ditto for spending on information technology.\n\nTraditionally, the sector has tended to focus on making incremental improvements. But this will no longer do. Projects are ever larger and more complex. The growing demand for environmentally sensitive construction means traditional practices must change. And the shortage of skilled labour and supervisory staff will only get worse.

Manchester!\" broke out at a vigil held in the city centre.\n\nBROKEN\n\nTerrified fans, many of them teenage girls, fled the arena in panic after the explosion in the foyer as they began to leave at the end of Monday's performance by Grande, a 23-year-old former child television star who described herself as \"broken\" by the attack.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and European leaders issued vows of defiance.\n\nEight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos and teenager Georgina Callander were among the first of the 22 victims to be confirmed.\n\nAnother 59 people were taken to hospital, many with life-threatening conditions.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing bodies on the floor after the blast around 10:30pm (2130 GMT) on Monday, and some fans were trampled as panicked crowds tried to flee the venue.\n\nFamilies were separated, with dozens of young people taken to nearby hotels overnight, and some parents were still desperately searching for their children on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm just hearing nothing - her phone's dead,\" Charlotte Campbell, whose 15-year-old daughter Olivia was at the concert, told BBC radio.\n\nThe attack was the deadliest in Britain since July 7, 2005 when four suicide bombers inspired by Al-Qaeda attacked London's transport system during rush hour, killing 52 people and wounding 700 more.\n\nIt revived memories of the November 2015 attack at the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in which armed men wearing explosive belts stormed in and killed 90 people.\n\nThat attack was also claimed by IS, as was one in March by a knifeman at the gates of the British parliament - although police downplayed that claim.\n\n'EVIL LOSERS'\n\nQueen Elizabeth II condemned the Manchester attack as an \"act of barbarity\" and observed a minute's silence at a Buckingham Palace garden reception.\n\nMr Trump said during a visit to Bethlehem: \"So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers.\"\n\nIn a city famed globally for its musical traditions and football teams, showbusiness stars and teams expressed their horror at the carnage.\n\n\"We are deeply shocked by last night's terrible events,\" said Manchester United.\n\nA support centre for people caught up in the attack was set up at the Etihad Stadium, the home of their rivals Manchester City.\n\nBritain's third biggest city was hit in 1996 by a massive car bomb planted at a shopping centre by Irish Republican Army paramilitaries which wounded more than 200 people.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/83f6afcd74ff76c1b4c7175217873607629f7b8f937037f6c2884d4a028e1a90?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Britain is imminently facing another terror attack, Prime Minister Theresa May warned Tuesday as she deployed soldiers at key sites after a suicide bomber killed 22 people at a pop concert in Manchester."}]}

Other top shareholders include sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, Orbis Investment Management and Eastspring Investments.\n\nNoble shares continued to take a beating on Monday, shedding 6.4 per cent or 4 Singapore cents, to close at 58.5 Singapore cents. More than 61.8 million shares were traded.

This emerged from discussions among IFC, MAS and the Asean Bankers Association (ABA) following the Singapore Fintech Festival in 2016.\n\nThrough AFIN, IFC and MAS plan to establish a regional network to help financial institutions, fintech firms and regulators address issues of connectivity, local compliance and cross-border compatibility, said the two partners in a media release.\n\nAFIN will also evaluate options to create an industry \"sandbox\" to provide a cloud-based testing environment through which banks and fintech players can develop, test and refine digital finance and inclusion solutions. This can allow fintechs to distribute their services to financial institutions in multiple jurisdictions, said Sopnendu Mohanty, chief fintech officer at MAS.\n\n\"We hope that this platform could also spur discussions amongst participating regulators on cross-border policy harmonisation across Asean,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"We believe that innovation and digital technology can play a decisive role in enhancing financial access for a wider population. MAS is pleased to partner with IFC and further its discussions with ABA to help establish an industry sandbox infrastructure that promotes real-time collaboration and financial innovation.\"\n\nVivek Pathak, IFC's director for East Asia and the Pacific, said the agreement builds on IFC's efforts to deepen access to finance for underserved segments of the population.\n\n\"In today's world it is feasible to reach these segments of the population at a fraction of the cost and at a speed that was not feasible earlier,\" he said. \"New business models resulting from digital transformation of financial services and fintech adoption in the region can create new markets that will lead to a higher level of prosperity.\n\n\"The end desired state is for financial institutions to be able to embrace innovation and collaboration more easily, and for innovations to spread more easily across the region.\"\n\nThis comes as MAS in April sealed a partnership with a United Nations unit to encourage the development of and access to digital financial services in Asean. MAS will work with the United Nations Capital Development Fund on the digitisation of low-tier financial institutions in the region.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The blunder, they fear, could cost them seats in the June 8 vote.\n\nThe backlash triggered by the key manifesto pledge was followed by a narrowing of her Conservative Party's lead in polls and a U-turn four days after it was announced. While the domestic implications were immediate, analysts warned that Mrs May's habit of changing her mind might not serve her well in divorce talks from the European Union due to start less than two weeks after elections.\n\n\"A U-turn as such is not a bad thing,\" Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said. \"But hers have not been a reflection of reality changing on the ground - which is when a good, savvy politician changes his or her mind - it's been political missteps.\"\n\nFor him, Mrs May's \"style of secrecy and taking big decisions without generally debating with her own cabinet, that bodes disastrously for Brexit\".\n\nMr Kirkegaard drew a comparison with Germany's Angela Merkel and her turnaround on nuclear policy in the aftermath of the disaster at the Fukushima plant in Japan. That change of heart, he said, was justified. But Mrs May, he argues, has collected a series of unnecessary policy reversals in less than a year in power that are the result of political miscalculation.\n\nIn this latest episode, for example, Mrs May generated the policy with little consultation, then said its unpopularity showed her willingness to be tough, then backed down when it proved more unpopular than she had expected, then denied she'd backed down.\n\nThat combination raises questions about whether the prime minister and her team will be able to cope with the pressure of Brexit talks. While flexibility is an advantage in government and in negotiation, she has now found her campaign slogan, \"strong and stable\", turned back on her by the Labour Party, which called her \"weak and wobbly\".\n\n\"She will be dealing with 27 member states, as well as institutions,\" said Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at Eurasia Group in London. \"It will be harder to walk back decisions if those decisions aren't fully thought out. She's going to have to learn to delegate and consult more widely. The U-turn does raise questions about Mrs May's style of governing.\"\n\nIt's not the first time she has retreated in the face of opposition. Back in March, she had to drop a tax rise announced a week earlier in the Budget.\n\nAnd while Mrs May was dealing with dissent from her own party at home, in Brussels the rest of the EU were uniting around their negotiating position - including a hard line on how much Britain should pay as it leaves the bloc.\n\nIf the last year has shown Mrs May can hit reverse - such as when she vacillated over whether to proceed with the Hinkley Point nuclear plant - it has also shown she does not like to admit to it.\n\n\"Nothing has changed, nothing has changed,\" she told reporters on Monday in Wrexham, north Wales.\n\nShe tried to use a BBC interview on Monday night to pivot the campaign back to her preferred line. \"The question that people face is who do they trust to take this country through the Brexit negotiations?,\" she said. \"It's either me or Jeremy Corbyn.\"\n\nBut to outside observers, such as Eurasia, the real issue is another. \"Can she trust senior civil servants, can she delegate effectively?\" said Mr Rahman. \"Or is she going to micromanage at the level of European Council?\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f3ca29f621f82d1fc67745235e2eef22eb16936b0b12cd72b74847e5d69b1885?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The backlash triggered by the key manifesto pledge was followed by a narrowing of Mrs May's Conservative Party's lead in polls and a U-turn four days after it was announced."}]}

On Monday, the group toughened its stance against juice, recommending that the drink be banned entirely from a baby's diet during the first year.

Vast swathes of the world are grappling with ageing, creating demand for investment products that stand a chance of earning a return greater than cash rates. Low interest rates and persistently low bond yields nudge savers towards higher risk products, which is surely an opportunity for active fund managers.\n\nYet over the past few months, the global trend in the industry has been one of consolidation - and analysts believe that this wave will intensify. Deals that have made headlines include the merger of Janus Capital and Henderson; Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management; and Amundi's US$4 billion purchase of Pioneer. A number of challenges mar the outlook for active fund management - the unrelenting pressure on fees, the burden of regulation and growing compliance costs, to name just a couple.\n\nBut by far the most formidable challenge may well be active funds' perennial underperformance against benchmarks, which is blamed for the flood of monies flowing into passive index funds. The most recent SPIVA scorecard by S&P Dow Jones provides yet more dismal findings. The report helpfully provides longer-term data to even out market cycles. Over a 15-year period to December 2016 for US equity funds, 92 per cent of large-cap managers, 94 per cent of mid-cap and 93 per cent of small-cap managers failed to beat their respective benchmarks. The efficiency of a mature market such as the US is often cited as a reason for funds' underperformance. But the SPIVA data for emerging markets (EM) is as dismal. Over 15 years, 90 per cent of EM funds also failed to beat their benchmarks.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

It is the result of decades of strong political will to sustain a robust and comprehensive anti-corruption framework, and build a society that frowns on corruption.\n\nThe Republic's fairly squeaky-clean image was reinforced by latest data from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) showing that corruption cases locally fell to a 32-year record low in 2016. Notwithstanding this, incidences of bribery and corruption continue to command public and media attention locally and globally, and unethical conduct remains one of the most pertinent risks to organisations.\n\nBusiness executives attest to this themselves. In the EY Global Fraud Survey 2016, over a third of the respondents were of the view that bribery and corruption were fairly rife in their countries. Given that many Singapore companies have business relationships with other parties overseas, particularly as the call for international growth and expansion grows, the exposure to bribery and corruption potentially widens and intensifies.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr is scheduled to accompany Canadian forestry leaders on a visit to China in June.\n\nCanada's diplomatic push comes after US President Donald Trump reignited a decades-old dispute last month by slapping duties as high as 24 per cent on Canadian softwood.\n\nOne of several trade disputes between the US and Canada, Mr Trump also threatened to take action against Canadian dairy farmers over what the US says are unfair agricultural subsidies.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he would consider banning thermal coal shipments from the US.\n\nMr Champagne said Canada's lumber pitch resonated in China and other Southeast Asian countries because softwood was an environmentally friendly building material that could satisfy a growing regional housing need without driving up greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"What the Chinese were saying is you're providing a much-needed solution that the Chinese side needed,\" Mr Champagne said.\n\n\"This is beyond selling. This is about working together to tackle a challenge for them.\"\n\nCanada exports about US$3.5 billion in total forest products to China annually, including about US$1.9 billion in lumber, according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.\n\nOver the past decade, Canadian forest product exports to China have climbed to 15 per cent from 5 per cent of the country's total forestry exports.\n\nNegotiations on a free-trade agreement between Canada and China were also moving forward, Mr Champagne said.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nEnergy & Commodities\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nOil edges up, investors eye Trump statement on Russia\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nGold hits three-week high as Trump widens trade war\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:16 AM\n\nOil rises over 2% as investors weigh market outlook, tariffs, sanctions\n\nJul 12, 2025 06:12 AM\n\nGold rises after Trump announces fresh tariffs on Canada, tariff threats to others\n\nJul 11, 2025 09:35 AM\n\nAster said to be in talks to buy Exxon Singapore stations: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 04:49 PM\n\nOil\u00a0falls amid bearish Trump tariff outlook\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:21 AM", "images": []}

The space was vacated in March by Sephora, which has moved to another location on the east side of Fifth Avenue.\n\nRepresentatives for Lululemon and landlord Thor Equities declined to comment.\n\nMidtown Manhattan has seen retail occupancies plunge as merchants balk at record-high rents. On Fifth Avenue from 49th and 59th streets - the world's most expensive shopping corridor and just a block north of the store Lululemon is said to be zeroing in on - rents averaged US$3,324 a square foot, down 2 per cent from a year earlier, according to a report released Monday by the Real Estate Board of New York.\n\nLandlords in Manhattan had overestimated tenants' willingness to pay premium prices, according to Gregory Kraut, managing partner at developer K Property Group.\n\n\"People were pointing to outliers on Fifth Avenue as the norm,\" said Mr Kraut, a co-founder of brokerage Avison Young's New York office. \"If someone was pricing their space at US$2,000 a square foot, the next person says, well, this should be worth US$3,000 a square foot. What happened was a confluence of events, where there started to be a lot of spaces popping up, and there weren't a lot of tenants who could afford to pay that dollar amount.\" Fifth Avenue from 42nd to 49th streets had average rents of US$1,185 a square foot in the first quarter, down 4 per cent from a year earlier, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc. The availability rate in the area was 32.8 per cent, compared with 17.4 per cent for the stretch from 49th to 60th streets.\n\nThor Equities has a US$105 million loan on 597 Fifth Ave. that's part of a multiproperty commercial mortgage-backed security originated by UBS Group AG. The loan is watchlisted, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, meaning it's been identified by analysts as a potential credit risk.\n\nThe Beaux Arts-style tower, also known as the Scribner's Building after the publisher that once occupied it, was completed in 1913. It was designated a city landmark in 1982. Thor, whose president is Joseph Sitt, acquired the 79,000-square-foot property in 2011 for US$108.5 million, according to a person with knowledge of the deal. A refinancing in 2014 valued the building at US$140 million.\n\nA short-term lease to Lululemon is potentially a shrewd move for both sides, Mr Kraut said.\n\n\"Retailers want to see they're not catching a falling knife,\" he said.

Beyond that, there are bonds due in 2020 and 2022.\n\nS&P's warning came in the wake of other downgrades.

The pound shed 0.45 per cent to 144.07 yen, but otherwise the currency was fairly steady against its major rivals.\n\nIt was little changed against the dollar at US$1.2994. On Monday, the pound had lost about 0.3 per cent after polls showed a narrowing lead for Prime Minister Theresa May over her opposition ahead of elections next month.\n\nPolice said they were responding to reports of an explosion at a concert in the English city of Manchester where US singer Ariana Grande had been performing. At least 19 people dead and about 50 injured in what British police said was being treated as a terrorist incident.\n\nThe US dollar was down 0.2 per cent at 111.055 yen after a dip to 110.860 and the euro slid 0.2 per cent to 124.830 yen.\n\nMs Merkel said on Monday that the common currency is weak due to the European Central Bank's monetary policy, pointing out that this helped explain Germany's relatively high trade surplus.\n\nThe chancellor's comments provided fresh momentum to the euro, which has been on a bullish footing since the French presidential elections earlier this month. Upbeat euro zone data and a widening spread between the 10-year German and US government bond yields have also supported the currency.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nBanking & Finance\n\nBank of Japan likely to consider raising inflation forecast: sources\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM\n\nIndonesia bonds may gain more on dovish policy, fiscal outlook\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:10 AM\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:30 AM\n\nMAS scrutinises some VCC managers after review finds potential regulatory lapses\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nBank of England governor Bailey warns banks against issuing own stablecoins\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 AM\n\nWho is Tan Teck Long, the former DBS veteran who is OCBC\u2019s incoming CEO?\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:14 PM\n\nMAS, PBOC to deepen cooperation in green and transition finance\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:20 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/098d04ec0a78824a63f3558465fa30b1d9b5049a7f9b36c2ff72a8c05d5ca614?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "The British pound sagged against the yen on Tuesday after a blast at a concert in the city of Manchester killed at least 19 people."}]}

Ford's US$44 billion market value is below electric car pioneer Tesla Inc's US$51 billion.\n\nBill Ford and other descendants of company founder Henry Ford effectively control the automaker through a special class of shares, but many investors share his concern that the company is running out of time.\n\nFord shares closed up 2.1 per cent at US$11.10. At Friday's close, they had fallen 37 per cent since Mr Fields took over three years ago at the peak of the US auto industry's recovery from the crisis last decade.\n\nThe automaker has tangled with US President Donald Trump, who spent more than a year criticising the company on the campaign trail for expanding operations in Mexico and exporting US jobs. A Ford spokeswoman said Mr Trump was not a factor in Mr Fields' departure.\n\nNO SMOKING GUN\n\nOverall US auto sales are slipping after a long boom. But GM has moved faster than Ford to slash unprofitable operations, and Tesla has been quicker to deploy new technology.\n\nBill Ford indicated the company would take more aggressive action to cut costs.\n\n\"We have to modernise the business\" and move \"decisively to address underperforming areas,\" he said.\n\nMr Hackett, who overhauled furniture maker Steelcase Inc and then turned around the ailing University of Michigan football programme, becomes the latest in a line of non-family CEOs brought in with a mandate to change the management culture at one of the auto industry's oldest institutions.\n\nThat task has frustrated many of his predecessors, including Bill Ford, who had been CEO before replacing himself in 2006 with Boeing Co executive Alan Mulally.\n\nThe decision to replace Mr Fields did not result from a single event, Bill Ford told Reuters.\n\n\"There is no smoking gun here,\" he said.\n\n\"It's more the way we are organised, the way Jim is going to streamline the organisation.\"\n\nAs CEO of Steelcase, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mr Hackett slashed thousands of jobs and refocused the company on innovation.\n\nA former Ford director and interim athletic director at the University of Michigan, Mr Hackett was tapped in March 2016 to run Ford Smart Mobility, a unit established to oversee and coordinate forays into autonomous driving, ride sharing and other ventures.\n\nIn that role, he helped oversee Ford's acquisition of San Francisco ride-sharing company Chariot and its US$1 billion investment in Argo AI, a self-driving startup focused on robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\nPRESSURE IN DETROIT\n\nThe upheaval at Ford underlines pressure on all three major Detroit automakers to prove they can avoid losses as the US market begins to slow from last year's record sales.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra is fending off attacks from hedge fund Greenlight Capital, which wants to install new directors and split the company's stock. In March, GM sold its money-losing Opel division to France's PSA Group, effectively exiting Europe in a move Barra promised would free cash for share buybacks.\n\nThe shake-up at Ford may bring scrutiny to its own plans in the region. The company posted a record US$1.2 billion profit in Europe last year but warned that the impact of Britain's vote to leave the European Union would put a dent in 2017 earnings.\n\nUnder a broader shake-up announced on Monday, former Ford of Europe chief Jim Farley will become president of a new \"Global Markets\" group that will include Ford's regional sales and marketing operations around the world as well as its Lincoln luxury brand.\n\nThe company is also putting government relations and corporate communications under Ford Jr, and Mr Hackett said the great-grandson of Henry Ford would have a higher public profile.\n\nMr Fields, who earned US$22.1 million in 2016 and had a 28-year-career at Ford, also faced a clamour for share repurchases at the company's annual meeting earlier this month.\n\nMr Fields declined to comment when reached on Monday.\n\nFord said last week it would cut 1,400 staff positions in North America and Asia, a small fraction of the 20,000 job reductions some news outlets had reported were imminent.\n\nThe company reported a record US$10.4 billion in pretax earnings in 2016, but investors were concerned by a weak first quarter and lower profit forecast for 2017, as well as higher costs for investments in \"emerging opportunities\".\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

Two other listed O&M players, Swissco Holdings and Swiber Holdings, have headed into judicial management (JM).\n\nStresses from their O&M exposure had forced the big three banks to increase their non-performing loan (NPL) provisions.\n\nThe banks have thus claimed that they are done with O&M provisions; the challenge at hand now is how they may then partake in the restructuring of the sector so as to mitigate their damages sustained from the O&M fallout.\n\nThere are worrying signs, however, that a tendency to over-compensate may cost the banks here the opportunity to redeem their standing in the O&M sector.\n\nTo begin with, banks are no longer underwriting loans for the construction of ships from scratch.\n\nSingapore's banks are not alone in this - banks worldwide have pulled the plug on newbuild financing as overcapacity besieged most O&M segments.\n\nWhere Singapore has lagged behind is the restructuring of massive O&M debts here, the process in which the three big banks have played a major role.\n\nPareto Securities Pte Ltd's chief executive, David Palmer observed that in many cases, banks and companies \"were merely moving debt and maturities around\" and \"replacing lower-priced debt with increasingly expensive debt\". This attempt at kicking the can further down the road has contributed to the heightened insolvency risk in Singapore's O&M sector.\n\nSingapore's banks have several options to recover debt from insolvent O&M companies. One option is to foreclose vessels mortgaged to bank loans, as Mr Gupta alluded to.\n\nA second route taken by banks backing listed O&M entities in Norway and the US is to swap debt for equity; this seems to fall outside the comfort zone of senior lenders here, perhaps owing to the due impairments from taking equity in companies under financial duress.\n\nThe inconvenient truth though for Singapore's banks is that the market valuations of the vessels reflected in their books, have fallen drastically. In some cases, these valuations are hovering at just above scrap values.\n\nSo it is apparent that losses are inevitable if banks want to offload these assets any time soon. Or they can choose to put these vessels out to work in the market. To cut deals in either case will call on banks to take haircuts and banks' resistance to do so had emerged as show-stoppers, one source said.\n\nAs Singapore's banks ponder over their next moves, fund houses and private equity players have entered the fray to pick up assets on the cheap.\n\nWhat these investors are eyeing are the high-margin returns possible from holding on to these bargain asset buys until the O&M market stages a rebound.\n\nOil companies have already signalled plans to revisit deferred projects now that oil prices have stabilised in the US$50s.\n\nTaking into account the responses from Singapore's financial sector, M3 Marine's managing director, Mike Meade summed the situation up in this bleak prediction: \"When the O&M sector eventually stages a rebound, Singapore's banks would have been so scarred by this downturn that they could have missed the boat altogether.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, many have struggled in a business facing tighter regulation and where customers are reluctant to change banks.\n\nEven UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, has posted broadly flat revenues for the past five years despite its assets under management (AUM) rising by around 30 per cent.\n\n\"It's an unforgiving and brutal market at the moment, with a very expensive delivery model and competition that's driving pricing down,\" said Seb Dovey, managing partner and private banking specialist at Scorpio Partnership.\n\nBarclays' strategy will be different from its last attempt, according to the source familiar with the plans, and will focus on increasing profits rather than assets by improving the products and cooperation with Barclays investment bank.\n\nThe hires will be in Barclays Private Bank & Overseas Services, the arm of the lender's wealth division which sits inside the Barclays International unit run by Australian Tim Throsby.\n\nReuters reported on May 11 that Throsby had announced a major reshuffle of his lieutenants and is seeking to hire 50 to 100 more staff in the investment bank, as he tries to boost returns across the Barclays businesses under his control.\n\nBarclays named former Goldman Sachs banker Karen Frank last September to run the international private bank business.\n\nThe bank itself failed in its last private bank expansion, a five-year initiative set out in 2010 and known internally as Project Gamma. It wanted to double AUM to \u00a3300 billion and lift annual profits to between \u00a3600 million and \u00a3700 million, Reuters previously reported.\n\nBarclays offered high-end clients services extending to, for instance, tips on finding the right school for their children or a chance to play cricket with former England star Andrew Flintoff - underscoring the lengths it would go to win the custom of the super wealthy.\n\nBut it didn't work.\n\nAUM were US$131 billion in 2014, making Barclays the 25th biggest private bank with a market share of about 0.6 per cent, according to Scorpio Partnership, a wealth management consultancy. By comparison, UBS had US$2 trillion in AUM for a market share of 10 per cent, Scorpio estimated.\n\nAfter the private bank swung to a loss in 2013, Barclays moved the business back into the retail bank, stopped disclosing its performance and mothballed the Barclays Wealth brand.\n\nBarclays had around US$90 billion of AUM in its private bank at the end of 2015, according to data from Scorpio that the consultancy verified with Barclays.\n\nIn the longer term the bank may try to expand its wealth business in Asia through its Singapore hub, the source said, even though Barclays sold its private bank there in April last year to OCBC Bank.\n\nThe fate so far of a similar push by Barclays' rival Standard Chartered shows just how tough it can be to win customers in private banking.\n\nStanChart's chief executive Bill Winters set a goal in 2015 of increasing assets by US$25 billion in three years but, halfway through that plan, the bank reported in February that assets had actually since shrunk by 4 per cent.

On May 14 he told reporters the tax \"reflects the way major banks are treated all around the world\" and said it would level the playing field for small lenders who did not benefit from implicit government guarantees.\n\n\"We think this is absolutely something that the banks should absorb, must absorb or, frankly, they're treating their customers like mugs,\" he said.\n\nThe tax will apply to Australia's five biggest banks from July 1. The government said it would deliver A$6.2 billion over the next four years as part of revenue-raising measures designed to bring the federal budget into surplus by 2020-2021.\n\nAustralia's \"Big Four\" banks - Westpac, CBA, NAB and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd - are very well-capitalised and extremely profitable. Westpac posted record first-half cash profit of A$4 billion on May 8.\n\nThe tax will also apply to Macquarie Group Ltd, Australia's biggest investment bank.\n\nIndustry players and analysts say the tax could encourage banks to change their funding strategy such as beefing up securitisation as a way to minimise the overall cost.\n\nPooled or securitised debt can be taken off bank balance sheets and funded in the capital market.\n\nWith about A$180 billion of combined annual funding, the top four Australian banks and Macquarie securitise only a fraction of their debt - between zero and 10 per cent.\n\nCBA shares gained 1.3 per cent, while Westpac stock was up 0.8 per cent and NAB was up 0.7 per cent, in line with the broader market.

In so doing, Mr Trump will be moving, for the first time in his presidency, to the top table of global diplomacy with leaders from Nato and the G-7.\n\nBefore these important summits, the political leg of the European tour begins in earnest on Wednesday with sessions in Brussels with European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk. These meetings will have added spice given that Mr Trump is the first ever US president to be actively hostile to the Brussels-based club following his encouragement of more countries, following Brexit, to leave.\n\nHowever, it is the Nato summit on Thursday, and the G-7 on Friday and Saturday, that will be the pinnacle of Mr Trump's international diplomacy fanfare. Only last week, the White House raised the stakes yet again on Nato by threatening that Washington may still choose to leave the organisation unless member states follow through with 2014 pledges to increase their annual contributions to the 68-year-old alliance.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": []}

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/ghost-97-stalks-hong-kong-economy-infected-housing-debt", "site_title": "Ghost of '97 stalks Hong Kong economy infected by housing debt", "publish_date": null, "content": "Ghost of '97 stalks Hong Kong economy infected by housing debt\n\nPublished\n\nSun, May 21, 2017 \u00b7 10:46 PM\n\n[HONG KONG] In 1997, the Asian financial crisis touched off a six-year property bust in Hong Kong that shaved more than two-thirds off prices and saddled the city with a stagnant economy and deflation.\n\nAs Hong Kong gets ready to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its handover to China, which happened just as Asia's crisis began to unfold, that pain seems all but forgotten. Prices are at all-time highs. Mortgage borrowing is booming. Developers are bidding up the cost of land to records. People young and old are lining up to buy newly built apartments. In short, the kind of fervour that preceded the last bust is back.\n\nThat's got experts fretting about the potential fallout should the city of about 7.4 million people experience another crash. By several measures, Hong Kong looks more vulnerable this time around. On Friday, the de facto central bank announced new measures to contain risks - its second action in a week.\n\n\"When things move to the downside here, they move big time,\" said Peter Churchouse, author of a financial newsletter bearing his name and a veteran analyst of Hong Kong's property sector.\n\n\"A lot of people here view the property market as almost an extension of the stock market and treat it as such.\"\n\nAs central banks flooded the world economy with cheap money over the past decade, property markets in cities from Sydney to Stockholm skyrocketed. Perhaps nowhere was this more pronounced than in Hong Kong, where demand from mainland buyers contributed to the boom.\n\nHong Kong is particularly exposed because of a huge accumulation of household wealth in property and the fact that banking is one of the main pillars of the local economy, said Xia Le, chief economist at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA in Hong Kong. A property crash could drag down banks and lead to a \"full-fledged financial crisis,\" Mr Xia said.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2015, inflation-adjusted prices for apartments multiplied almost four times, according to a study by Peter Richmond and Bertrand M Roehner, published last month in the Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review. Prices have kept rising, climbing 15 per cent since the beginning of 2016.\n\nAnd because wages have been relatively stagnant, it now takes a household 18 years of median income to buy a home, more than anywhere else in the world, data from Demographia shows. That compares with just over 12 years in Sydney, eight-and-a-half years in London and under six years for the wider New York metropolitan area.\n\nHong Kong bears have been proven wrong time again in recent years as the city shook off crises, epidemics, an aging population and China's slowdown. Thanks to its status as a gateway to the world's second-biggest economy with Western-style legal protections, it has attracted a steady stream of mainland buyers.\n\nHow and when the boom ends is anyone's guess, but the stakes are increasing for a government that's repeatedly failed to tame home prices. Obvious risks include a sharp financial or economic crisis in China that ripples through Hong Kong's increasingly mainland-linked economy.\n\nOne measure in particular gives market watchers pause. The value of outstanding mortgages jumped by more than a third in the five years through December and now amounts to 47 per cent of gross domestic product, more than 10 percentage points higher than in early 1997.\n\nAggressive Developers\n\nAs developers take on debt to fund expensive land purchases and increasingly compete with banks in providing mortgages, the risks are spreading through the economy, sparking concern at the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.\n\nOn May 12, the HKMA tightened rules governing bank lending for developments after expressing worry about banks' exposure to the real estate sector.\n\nThat announcement came just as developers waged a bidding war for a commercial plot of land in the Central business district, pushing the price to a record US$3 billion. A week later, the HKMA followed up with curbs on second-home mortgages as well as borrowers whose income is derived mainly from overseas.\n\nMortgages are increasingly concentrated among buyers aged 25 to 40, according to Raymond Yeung, chief economist of Greater China at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. That means young professionals who are building families are extra sensitive to interest rates, threatening to exacerbate the wealth gap in one of the world's most unequal societies. An increase in mortgage rates could quickly sap consumers' spending power.\n\n\"There's concentration risk among the first-time home buyers who are in general younger than the rest,\" said Ryan Lam, head of research at Shanghai Commercial Bank Ltd.\n\n\"Once the interest rates move, they will suffer.\"\n\nBecause Hong Kong's currency is pegged to the US dollar, the economic fate of those households - and that of the wider property market - will be determined 8,000 miles away at the Federal Reserve in Washington.\n\nChair Janet Yellen has already begun tightening and is expected to raise rates again at least once this year, possibly as early as June. Hong Kong's de facto central bank will have no choice but to follow.\n\nTurning to Parents\n\nMany looking to enter the property ladder are taking additional mortgages from developers, who unlike banks aren't bound by loan-to-value rules. They're also turning to their parents for help.\n\nTerry Wong, 32, tapped his mom and dad's savings to help finance a 20 per cent down payment for a HK$5 million (S$891,000) apartment in March after he got married. Mr Wong, whose new home in the bustling Kowloon district measures just 390 square feet, financed the rest from a bank and the Hong Kong Mortgage Corp Ltd.\n\n\"Hey, I needed a place to live,\" Mr Wong said.\n\n\"With my parents' money, I could be more financially flexible in the future.\" At Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd's Eight Regency project in Hong Kong's New Territories, apartments quickly sold out in the first batch on offer in April. About 40 per cent of Midland Realty's clients who bought flats at the development were under 30, and almost a third of them relied on funds from their parents to make down payments, said Sammy Po, the property agent's residential chief executive.\n\nBears Converge\n\nThe government's failure to cool the market means the city's economic health is getting more intertwined with real estate. Soaring prices means more wealth is tied up in property, and citizens are less inclined to amass other types of savings, said Mr Lam of Shanghai Commercial Bank.\n\nIf things turn sour, prices could drop 10 per cent to 20 per cent \"in a short period of time,\" according to Mr Lam. He's not alone: Morgan Stanley predicts home values will enter a multi-year decline, starting with 5 per cent this year.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co's Cusson Leung has said prices are economically \"unsustainable\" and warned that households are exposed should the market turn.\n\nAnd if things really head south, a crash would hammer government revenues, household wealth and consumer confidence and could trigger deflation as the economy heads into a downward spiral, said BBVA's Mr Xia.\n\nThe bearish view has precedent. Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 with an economy growing by 7.5 per cent a year, unemployment of 2.4 per cent and healthy inflation. By 2002, deflation had gripped the city, unemployment had tripled and growth plunged.\n\nAs Michael Every, head of financial markets research for Asia-Pacific at Rabobank International in Hong Kong says, \"Hong Kong's economy is the housing market, sadly.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The move would allow Subaru to capitalise on its reputation for safety while eliminating the need to partner with another carmaker, he said.\n\nSuch a strategy would contrast with the approach of other manufacturers like Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz. The luxury carmaker has bundled its electric-vehicle technology, including charging boxes and energy storage, under the EQ sub-brand, giving it more visibility to better compete with Tesla Inc. Mr Yoshinaga sees advantages in sticking with a single nameplate.\n\n\"If there's already an attractive Subaru model, for example the XV crossover, and if a customer in Beijing wants one but is only allowed to buy an electric vehicle, if there's no electric version then he can't buy it,\" he said at the carmaker's headquarters in Tokyo. \"Providing the choice of an EV means the customer can still desire the same Subaru.\"\n\nSubaru is prioritising spending on electrification over other technologies, like autonomous driving and connected cars, as it races to bring a plug-in hybrid model to market next year and an all-electric vehicle by 2021. The company is budgeting 134 billion yen (S$1.67 billion) on research and development in the 12 months through March 2018, more than double what it spent in the year ended March 2014.\n\nSubaru's spending on R&D is still less than the big Japanese carmakers that are also stepping up efforts to produce electric vehicles. Toyota Motor Corp, which owns a 16.9 per cent stake in Subaru, plans to spend 1.05 trillion yen on R&D in the current fiscal year and Honda Motor Co will invest 750 billion yen.\n\nToyota aims to introduce a global electric vehicle model and Honda unveiled an all-electric version of its Clarity sedan last month. Honda has also said it plans to set up a joint venture with Hitachi Automotive Systems Ltd to develop and produce motors for electric cars.\n\nWhile Mr Yoshinaga said he's not against a partnership for the all-electric vehicle, simply adding an electric powertrain to one of Subaru's existing vehicles would make a tie-up unnecessary. Instead the key will be the selection of suppliers for the battery and motor. A decision on this will have to be made in about a year, he said. He mentioned Panasonic Corp and Samsung Electronics Co among possible partners.\n\nSubaru can take this approach because what defines the brand now is safety, not the boxer engine that is currently found in its entire lineup of only petrol-powered vehicles, according to Mr Yoshinaga.\n\nThe XV crossover, called the Crosstrek in the US, and the Impreza sedan were awarded the top prize this year with the highest score ever in the state-run Japan New Car Assessment Programme, which included tests for crashworthiness and pedestrian protection. The Impreza also received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's highest safety standard this year in the US.\n\nSubaru's EyeSight driver-assist system comes a close second in terms of R&D spending, although Mr Yoshinaga said he would seek to limit any increase in the price of the technology to enable the carmaker to offer the same safety suite across all models.\n\nEyeSight is the first driver-assist setup to use only stereo cameras to detect objects such as vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, according to the company. It's due to be updated this year with added functionality for autonomously following a car on congested highways, and a further upgrade in 2020 plans to add fully autonomous highway driving, including the capability to change lanes.\n\nThe carmaker is considering Autoliv Inc's cameras for EyeSight as it looks for options beyond Hitachi Automotive, which has been a supplier for almost a decade, people with knowledge of the matter said this month.\n\nSubaru needs to cast a wide net when looking at suppliers to find the best balance of quality and cost, Mr Yoshinaga said in response to a question about the carmaker's choice for technology vendors including the EyeSight system.\n\nThe company continues to increase its relationships with overseas firms, he said. In the area of connected cars, in particular, the CEO said he favours partnerships with companies in the US because the technology there is more highly developed.\n\n\"We need to work with parts makers on joint development right from the start,\" said Mr Yoshinaga. \"If we don't, we won't be able to keep up in this era of rapid change.\" BLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Transport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nMOST POPULAR\n\n1\n\nSingapore is most expensive city for HNWIs to live well for third year in a row: report\n\n2\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price on debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\n3\n\nNTT DC Reit IPO on Jul 14 broadens AI-related opportunities on SGX\n\n4\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\n5\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/d86f025277331bdd39221165d10d6e124c9e9785f8e397b5adf3f64f4847f9ab?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "The XV crossover (above) and the Impreza sedan were awarded the top prize this year with the highest score ever in the state-run Japan New Car Assessment Programme, which included tests for crashworthiness and pedestrian protection."}]}

One possible explanation is that the malicious software (malware) harms older versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system, which most Americans have replaced. Perhaps many users in other countries have not. Whatever the explanation, this is not the end of Internet threats.\n\nThe unmistakable lesson of recent years is that the Internet is a double-edged sword. Despite enormous benefits - instant access to huge quantities of information, the proliferation of new forms of businesses, communications and entertainment - it also encourages crime, global conflict and economic disruption. The drift seems ominous. The Russians, it is widely agreed, hacked into the computers of the Democratic National Committee, raising fears that the US presidential election was compromised. In Dallas, hackers turned on the city's emergency sirens for more than an hour. Cyber thieves stole US$81 million from Bangladesh's central bank, though some of the money has apparently been recovered.\n\nWe are dangerously dependent on Internet- based systems. All these incidents threatened the social fabric of the victimised societies. If the Russians hacked the Democrats, who might be next? Could whoever triggered Dallas' sirens turn off the traffic lights or the local power grid? How safe are electronic financial transfers?\n\nRansomware validates these fears. What was stunning is how quickly it spread. One estimate had it quickly migrating to 150 countries and affecting 200,000 computers. Despite the rapid response - the discovery of a so-called kill switch in the malware that deactivated the virus - the basic message remains: Much health care, transportation and ordinary business might close if deprived of Internet access, whether by hostile governments (North Korea?) or cyber criminals.\n\nThis makes the Internet a weapon that can be used against us - or by us. In a presentation to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Daniel Coats, the director of national intelligence, put it this way: \"Our adversaries are becoming more adept at using cyberspace to threaten our interests and advance their own; and despite improving cyber defences, nearly all information, communication networks and systems will be at risk for years.\"\n\nThe trouble is that we are aiding and abetting our adversaries. We are addicted to the Internet, and refuse to recognise how our addiction subtracts from our security. The more we connect our devices and instruments to the Internet, the more we create paths for others to use against us, either by shutting down websites or by controlling what they do. Put differently, we are - incredibly - inviting trouble. Our commercial interests and our national security diverge.\n\nThe latest example of this tension is the so-called Internet of Things or the smart home. It involves connecting various devices and gadgets (thermostats, lights, cameras, locks, ovens) to the Internet so that they can be operated or monitored remotely. This would be a major Internet expansion and moneymaker.\n\nMORE SMART HOMES\n\nOne consulting firm, Ovum, forecasts that from 2016 to 2021, the number of smart homes worldwide will rise from 90 million to 463 million, with the largest concentrations in the United States and China. Ovum anticipates that each smart home will have nearly nine separate devices attached to the Internet and that the global total will hit four billion by 2021.\n\nAll this increases the vulnerability of Americans and others to cyberattacks. To be sure, the Internet of Things will be fitted with security protections. But as we have seen, mistakes and gaps occur. Or hackers circumvent security firewalls. The growth of the Internet of Things creates more avenues and opportunities for hostile nations or rogue hackers to penetrate various cyber defences.\n\nThe Coats presentation makes this explicit: \"In the future, state and nonstate actors will likely use (Internet of Things) devices to support intelligence operations . . . or attack targeted computer networks.\"\n\nJust how we can or should regulate the tension between our commercial interests and our strategic security is not clear. But we cannot even start a conversation if we do not admit that the tension is real, and is getting worse all the time.\n\nInstead of candor, we compartmentalise. We lavish praise on our cyber capitalists - Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and others - for their accomplishments while conveniently forgetting that the same technologies also make us less safe.

Now, they are steering the country's second-biggest maker of generic drugs through its first overseas acquisition in its 88-year history.\n\nSawai Pharmaceutical Co, which plans to complete its US$1 billion purchase of the generic drug business of Minnesota-based Upsher-Smith Laboratories Inc next month, forecasts sales growth at the US business to reach 13 per cent annually through 2021. The US growth would provide a new boost for the Japanese firm, which has over the last 15 years seen revenue jump more than sevenfold to 132.4 billion yen (S$1.65 billion), according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nAs Sawai expands in the US, it faces rising competition from Indian and Chinese makers of low-cost copycat medicines and political pressure on the drug industry to curb prices. The Osaka-based drugmaker is counting on Japan's reputation for high-quality therapies coupled with Upsher-Smith's local expertise to navigate the world's largest pharmaceutical market.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Consumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/f756a01bc59f2f2d26e05c7e58168346eb364111d23f1b592f11f372bf7bf14e?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "\"Upsher-Smith has a very good eye on selecting products and pricing them to a level which can bring sufficient profit to the company,'' President Mitsuo Sawai said in an interview in Tokyo last week. \"We have manufacturing technology that enables us to bring down cost and want to combine it.''"}]}

It can survive only if it exits the business that brought it success and reinvents itself.\n\nIndia's outsourcing boomed in the late 1990s run-up to the Y2K crisis because there was an urgency in updating corporate IT systems to fix a bug dealing with the difficulty that some computers might have had with dates beyond Dec 31, 1999. Once chief information officers (CIOs) became comfortable with having their systems maintained from across the globe, they started outsourcing large-scale projects to Indian companies, and billion-dollar contracts were announced almost every week.\n\nBut with the advent of tablet computers, smartphones and their applications in the 2010s, users gained access to better technology than the companies' IT departments could provide. They could download cheap, elegant and powerful apps to their mobile devices that made their corporate systems look primitive.\n\nVia cloud computing, companies such as Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google began to take over the functions of data centres. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey Bezos owns The Washington Post.) So CIOs lost power, and the importance of outsourcers declined. The billion-dollar outsourcing contracts evaporated.\n\nModern-day applications also do not require large teams of engineers doing software development: They are user-customisable and can be built by anyone with basic programming skills. To offer more value, the outsourcers worked to reduce costs by improving back-end processes. They offered low-cost offshore development and cheap labour in the United States, and this fomented a backlash by displaced workers.\n\nThe same technology advances that decimated the Indian advantage offer a new opportunity that could allow the Indian IT sector to reinvent itself and even gain the support of Americans who have been rallying against it. The opportunity is to help United States modernise its ageing infrastructure and enable it to bring manufacturing back from China. Technologies such as robotics, artificial intelligence and inexpensive and powerful sensors enable development of smart cities and automated factories, and a wholesale upgrading of national infrastructure.\n\nRobots, for example, have advanced so far that they can now do the work of humans in manufacturing. With the computing advances and dramatic price drops of hardware components such as a core part of most robots' inner workings, the single-axis controller, robots have acquired the dexterity to assemble circuit boards and build cars. They now cost less to operate than the wages of workers in China. And connected devices and sensors in the Industrial Internet of Things enable monitoring of every aspect of a manufacturing plant's operations.\n\nChina is well aware of the threat to its industry and is taking the lead in building zero-labour manufacturing plants, with robots doing practically all of the work. But its robots have no advantage over American robots - all of them work equally hard and consume nothing more than energy. Manufacturing can now return to American shores without raising costs.\n\nThere is, however, an obstacle. American businesses are not geared to take advantage of manufacturing robots because they simply do not have the know-how.\n\nThis is where India's outsourcers could help. They could master the new technologies and help American firms design new factory floors and program and install robots. They could provide management consulting in optimising supply chains and inventory management. And they could manage manufacturing plant operations remotely.\n\nThis is a higher-margin business than the old IT services. And Americans would cheer India for bringing manufacturing back to their shores rather than protest its taking their IT jobs away.\n\nNo, there will not be as many jobs in each manufacturing plant as there were before. But many new high-paying jobs would be created to build factories and manage them.\n\nIt is also possible to build smart cities, with sensors monitoring every aspect of a city's functioning, including parking, traffic congestion, lighting, waste management, pollution and water leaks. The installation and design of these require managerial and analytical skills; their monitoring functions are no different from those of managing data centres.\n\nAnd then there are opportunities to create applications that can revolutionise fields such as health care and education, and to build technologies for the underprivileged - something that Silicon Valley's entrepreneurs do not focus on because they do not understand the dire needs. These are all things that Indian IT companies can do.\n\nIt is not that Indian companies do not recognise the threat. Tech Mahindra's chief executive, CP Gurnani, told my class at Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering in Silicon Valley on May 1 that he was working hard to change the focus of his company from services to technology products and to solve problems outside information technology. He talked about the rapidly changing markets and the urgent need for his company to build offerings in areas such as health care, manufacturing, retail and managed services.\n\nWill India's IT sector finally wake up and smell the opportunity? It remains to be seen. One thing is certain: The backlash will build if it does not - and the Indian IT sector will accelerate its decline into oblivion.

Strong and clear mandate for Michel Barnier,\" Mr Barnier's deputy Sabine Weyand tweeted.\n\nGerman foreign ministry state secretary Michael Roth said as he arrived for the meeting in Brussels that Brexit was a \"lose-lose situation\" for everyone.\n\n\"We all have to prepare for very difficult negotiations,\" Mr Roth told reporters.\n\n\"We have two years time, the clock is ticking and we have to start working focused.\"\n\nMr Barnier's Brexit mandate on Monday comes from \"negotiating directives\" approved by the EU 27 ministers.\n\nThey were based on guidelines that EU leaders adopted in just four minutes - one for each decade of Britain's membership - in a rare show of unity for the often divided bloc.\n\nThe EU insists on making \"sufficient progress\" on three key divorce issues before talks can start on a future UK-EU trade deal.\n\nThese are the rights of EU citizens in Britain and British citizens on the continent; London's exit bill; and arrangements for the border between Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland.\n\nBritain however wants the divorce settlement and the future relationship to be discussed in parallel.\n\nBarnier told EU colleagues on May 3 he does not expect negotiations to begin until mid-June when he hopes Britain's post-election political climate will be more favourable to reaching an agreement.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, who triggered the divorce process on March 29, said \"the next five years will be among the most challenging in our lifetime\".\n\nMrs May took over from David Cameron who resigned after a slim majority of British voters shocked the world last June when they chose to leave the bloc over complaints on immigration and other issues of sovereignty.\n\nBut the most contentious issue threatens to be the exit bill.\n\nBrexit minister Mr Davis reiterated an earlier threat to quit the talks if the EU does not moderate its demands.\n\n\"We don't need to just look like we can walk away, we need to be able to walk away. Under the circumstances, if that was necessary, we would be in a position to do it,\" he said.\n\nLuxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn warned Britain that while it will leave the EU in 2019, it could be paying up for years more on financial obligations it agreed to while a member of the EU.\n\n\"That goes until 2020 and of course beyond,\" Mr Asselborn said, referring to the seven-year budget Britain agreed to with the other EU states in 2014.\n\nMr Barnier has already outlined a provisional timetable leading up to the formal exit in two years.\n\nHe hopes for an agreement on the first phase between October and December 2017, then a launch of the second phase between December 2017 and spring 2018, then finalisation of a Brexit deal towards October 2018.\n\nThe aim would be to have the ratification process for the deal completed by March 2019, three months before the next European Parliament elections.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

He travels on Tuesday to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank at the end of a stopover lasting 28 hours.\n\nMr Netanyahu and his wife Sara, as well as President Reuven Rivlin and members of the Israeli cabinet, were at Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport to greet Mr Trump and first lady Melania in a red carpet ceremony after what is believed to have been the first direct flight from Riyadh to Israel.\n\n\"During my travels in recent days, I have found new reasons for hope,\" Mr Trump said in a brief speech on arrival.\n\n\"We have before us a rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace to this region and its people, defeating terrorism and creating a future of harmony, prosperity and peace, but we can only get there working together. There is no other way,\" he said.\n\nMr Trump's tour comes in the shadow of difficulties at home, where he is struggling to contain a scandal after firing James Comey as FBI director nearly two weeks ago. The trip ends on Saturday after visits to the Vatican, Brussels and Sicily.\n\nDuring his two days in Riyadh, Mr Trump received a warm welcome from Arab leaders, who focused on his desire to restrain Iran's influence in the region, a commitment they found wanting in the Republican president's Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama. He also announced US$110 billion in US arms sales to Saudi Arabia.\n\nIsrael shares the antipathy that many Arab states have towards Iran, seeing the Islamic Republic as a threat to its very existence.\n\n\"What's happened with Iran has brought many of the parts of the Middle East toward Israel,\" Mr Trump said in public remarks at a meeting in Jerusalem with Mr Rivlin.\n\nHe also urged Iran to cease \"its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias\".\n\nBut Iran's freshly re-elected pragmatist president, Hassan Rouhani, said regional stability could not be achieved without Iran's help, and accused Washington of supporting terrorism with its backing for rebels in Syria.\n\nHe said the summit in Saudi Arabia \"had no political value, and will bear no results\".\n\n\"Who can say the region will experience total stability without Iran? Who fought against the terrorists? It was Iran, Syria, Hezbollah and Syria. But who funded the terrorists?\"\n\nMr Rouhani also said Iran would continue a ballistic missile programme that has already triggered US sanctions, saying it was for defensive purposes only.\n\nEarlier, at the airport, Mr Netanyahu said Israel hoped Mr Trump's visit would be a \"milestone on the path towards reconciliation and peace\".\n\nBut he also repeated his right-wing government's political and security demands of the Palestinians, including recognition of Israel as a Jewish state.\n\nMr Trump has vowed to do whatever is necessary to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians - something he has called \"the ultimate deal\" - but has given little indication of how he could revive negotiations that collapsed in 2014.\n\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters en route to Tel Aviv that any three-way meeting between Mr Trump, Mr Netanyahu and Mr Abbas was for \"a later date\".\n\nWhen Mr Trump met Mr Abbas this month in Washington, he stopped shortly of explicitly recommitting his administration to a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict, a long-standing foundation of US policy.\n\nMr Trump has also opted against an immediate move of the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a longtime demand of Israel.\n\nA senior administration official told Reuters last week that Mr Trump remained committed to the measure, which he pledged in his election campaign, but would not announce such a move during this trip.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel authorised some economic concessions to the Palestinians that it said would improve civilian life in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority and were intended to respond to Mr Trump's request for \"confidence-building steps\".\n\nThe United States welcomed the move but the Palestinians said they had heard such promises before.\n\nMr Trump will have visited significant centres of Islam, Judaism and Christianity by the end of his trip, a point that his aides say bolsters his argument that the fight against Islamist militancy is a battle between \"good and evil\".\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": []}

His first foray into this field involved the supply of servo motors.\n\n\"Two friends started a company called Servo Dynamics in 1986 and, after I graduated, they encouraged me to join them. After two years, I bought them out,\" he said.\n\nServo motors are motors equipped with a feedback system to rotate or position parts of a machine with great precision. They can be found in a host of devices and applications, including semiconductor production lines, industrial machinery, robots, surgical and medical devices, as well as printing and textile machines.\n\nISDN Holdings - where ISDN is an acronym for International Servo Dynamics Network - was listed on the main board of SGX in November 2005. It obtained its dual listing on HKEx in January this year. The group has a market capitalisation of about S$85 million and HK$446 million (S$79 million) on the respective bourses.\n\n\"It was always my dream to go public, but I didn't think that we would be able to come this far,\" Mr Teo said. \"From about 20 subsidiaries when ISDN listed on SGX, we have grown into a group of more than 60 companies as at the end of last year. And our Hong Kong listing has opened another door - it provides us with access to a different capital market, and the opportunity to boost our profile internationally.\"\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore, ISDN comprises 66 subsidiaries with sales offices spanning the region - China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.\n\nOver the last 30 years, the group has evolved into a multinational, one-stop shop for engineering solutions. Its offerings include customised design and assembly of motion control systems - such as high-tech hinges, locks and fasteners, as well as precision gearboxes.\n\nThese systems are typically used for factory automation in a broad range of industries, including semiconductor, mobile communications, telecommunications, data centres and railways.\n\nISDN also formulates and assembles various industrial computing hardware and software products to meet specialised customer needs.\n\n\"It was just a two-man show when we first started - me and a clerk. Today, we have nearly 850 employees, of which nearly half are sales and engineering staff, and our customers number more than 8,000,\" Mr Teo said. \"In our first year, we chalked up S$200,000 to S$300,000 in revenue. By 2014, we had crossed the S$200 million mark.\"\n\nBy the end of 2016, ISDN had achieved record revenue of S$258 million, and a net profit of S$10 million. The bottom line would have been S$13.2 million, if not for expenses incurred in its Hong Kong listing.\n\nThe group's business focus remains predominantly China, which accounted for 70 per cent of group revenue in 2016. Hong Kong contributed 5.8 per cent, while Malaysia and Singapore accounted for 2.4 per cent and 14.3 per cent respectively.\n\n\"There's huge potential in North Asia, as China transitions from a labour-intensive economy to a high-tech one. The domestic economy may have slowed, but the next growth leap is definitely coming,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nThe operating landscape in this part of the world presents both challenges and opportunities, he noted. Competition has intensified as the range of solutions increases and more players enter the fray.\n\nMeanwhile, the trend of automation in China's industrial sector continues to gather pace. The government's \"Made in China 2025\" plan, which promotes Industrial 4.0 concepts and robotic applications, has encouraged Chinese companies to move up the technology chain.\n\nThis has spurred upgrading of manufacturing processes through increased use of robotics, which in turn has stoked demand for motion control and other specialised engineering solutions. The sectors experiencing robust growth include mobile e-commerce, mobile technologies, as well as electric vehicles, and the batteries that power them, he added.\n\nAccording to Zion Market Research, the global motion control market was valued at US$16.5 billion in 2016. It is expected to generate revenues of US$22.8 billion by the end of 2022, growing at a compounded annual rate of more than 5.7 per cent between 2017 and 2022.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific's motion control market dominated overall demand last year, and it is the fastest-growing region, due to rapid industrialisation in developing economies such as India, China and Indonesia, the market research firm said.\n\n\"The use of motion control technology in medical, energy and infrastructure sectors is increasing, while prospects in the smartphone segment remain robust - there's still a fairly long runway,\" Mr Teo noted.\n\nAnd ISDN's broad customer profile - ranging from the smartphone and semiconductor industries to the medical, oil and gas, textiles and packaging sectors - helps the group diversify exposure and mitigate cyclical swings in any segment, he added.\n\nApart from China, ISDN will continue to expand its footprint in South-east Asia, building on opportunities in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.\n\n\"South-east Asia offers enormous potential, and is part of China's 'One Belt, One Road' strategy. Many Chinese state-owned enterprises are constantly looking for opportunities in this region, particularly in infrastructure projects,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nHarnessing hydropower\n\nIn Indonesia, ISDN is focusing on hydropower. It has amassed a combined installed base capacity of 180 megawatts (MW) for its portfolio, with 130MW located in North Sumatra and more than 40MW situated in Sulawesi.\n\nThe company has started constructing two mini hydropower plants in North Sumatra, and expects to begin building a third in North Sumatra, and a fourth in Sulawesi, by year-end. The biggest of these plants, with a capacity of 4.6MW, will be commissioned in early 2018. The other three plants, each with a 10MW capacity, will be ready by 2019.\n\n\"The essence of hydropower lies in motion control - controlling water to turn it into energy. Hydropower is a mature technology, and a natural progression for us,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nIndonesia's hydropower potential is estimated at about 75,000MW, with untapped resources concentrated on the islands of Sumatra, Java and Sulawesi, according to data from the International Hydropower Association.\n\nHydropower development will be driven in part by the government's target to raise the share of renewable energy production to 15 per cent from 7 per cent of generating capacity by 2025, data from market entry services firm Emerhub showed. The current installed capacity for all hydro-plants is more than 4,000MW, or just over 5 per cent of the total hydro energy potential.\n\nIn February, to boost funding sources for its push into hydropower generation as well as strategic technology partnerships in its core motion control and engineering services division, ISDN took a 50 per cent stake in corporate finance firm Emmett Capital Pte Ltd.\n\n\"This provides us with financing options for different stages of our business development efforts, and allows us to share resources with our partners, in particular, local SMEs that are hungry for capital to fund innovations and international expansion,\" Mr Teo said.\n\nLooking ahead, challenges abound, but worry is not a word in his vocabulary.\n\n\"There can be 1,001 things to worry about, at any moment of every day,\" he grinned. \"The marketplace is so dynamic, you don't know what's going to happen next. You can plan and invest, but things may not turn out as you expect. Our group is well-diversified - we don't have all our eggs in one basket, and this will cushion against any negative surprises.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nSingapore proposes to bar convicted money launderers from directorships\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:48 PM\n\nChina clears Synopsys\u2019s US$35 billion Ansys buyout in US win\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nSingapore shares hit new high; STI up 0.5%\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:51 PM\n\nPartners Group transfers Techem stake to its infrastructure fund\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:41 PM\n\nThree Singapore gencos to study carbon capture and storage to decarbonise power sector\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:00 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM", "images": []}

But Gen Prayuth's show is just one of many examples of how embedded the junta has become in Thai society.\n\nThailand's military government has acknowledged it wants to weaken political parties and maintain permanent influence over future elected governments, partly through a new constitution approved by Thailand's king last month.\n\nBut data compiled by Reuters shows the military is not just trying to influence Thailand's political life. It is leaving an imprint on nearly every institution of Thai society, with brass hats far more entrenched in senior positions than under previous military governments.\n\nThe military now controls 143 out of 250 parliamentary seats. Under the previous junta after the 2006 coup, the military held 67 out of 242 seats.\n\nThe Cabinet is stacked with soldiers. Out of the 36 Cabinet members, 12 have a military background. In 2006, only four military officers were among the 37 Cabinet members.\n\nThe military is also entwined with the powerful monarchy - the name of Gen Prayuth's show is derived from the philosophy of the late king Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died last October after seven decades on the throne.\n\nMore than half of the 13 members of the Privy Council, the body that advises new King Maha Vajiralongkorn - himself a former soldier - are military men. It was just under half in the previous Council.\n\nCinema and television stations are increasingly showing pro-military themes and the school curriculum features military slogans.\n\n\"The military coup of 2014 offered the armed forces the chance to put in place a wider footprint and they are doing so,\" Paul Chambers, a professor at Naresuan University and an expert on the Thai military, told Reuters. \"A younger generation of retired military officers are, since the end of 2016, sitting on the Privy Council.\"\n\nThe public does not appear too concerned. The government says military recruitment numbers doubled in 2017 from the previous year and attribute that to public approval of their hard-line tactics in breaking a political impasse that had persisted for years.\n\nPolls backed by the military government show Thais are content with military rule, although no such polls have been published in recent months.\n\nPerhaps more revealing than a military government stacked full of military men is the number of orders issued by the junta: 358 in total since 2014.\n\nThe orders aimed to impose discipline on every aspect of Thai public life. They ranged from making seatbelts mandatory for passengers in the backseats of cars to holding parents accountable for student fights.\n\nThe junta has also launched disciplinary initiatives such as a hotline to deal with misbehaving Buddhist monks and so-called \"attitude adjustment\" programmes for drunk drivers.\n\nThe campaign has covered everything from a crackdown on taxi gangs at airports to a clean-up of street food stalls, the latter with mostly mixed results.\n\nArmy spokesman Winthai Suvaree said those efforts by the junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), have improved Thailand.\n\n\"Overall, people are satisfied with concrete changes in the society,\" Mr Winthai told Reuters. He did not specifically address the militarisation of Thai society.

So for a new entrant to come in and take money, they take it off an existing player,\" media analyst Peter Cox told AFP. \"So that's what Google and Facebook have done . . . therefore there's not much cake left for firstly the newspapers, but now increasingly television stations as well.\"\n\nLocal providers can no longer count on the \"rivers of gold\" print classifieds to boost income, with digital advertising not yet able to bridge the gap. Fairfax, a takeover target of US private equity giant TPG Capital and investment firm Hellman & Friedman, said last month it was axing a quarter of its newsroom to save A$30 million annually in the latest round of redundancies.\n\nNews has also announced severe cost-cutting, while the country's third-ranked commercial broadcaster the Ten Network is on the ropes after posting dire half-year losses, citing poor advertising spend.\n\nA battle is also taking place to win readers. Fairfax, News and ABC are the most-read news websites in Australia, but Daily Mail, The Guardian and the BBC - which all have bureaus in Sydney - are making inroads.\n\nThe British titans were the fifth, sixth and seventh-most read, according to March data from audience measuring service Nielsen.\n\nRMIT University's Alexandra Wake, a former journalist, cautioned that although the foreigners have produced award-winning work, they could not comprehensively cover Australia because of their smaller footprint.\n\nThe local media cuts meant they too would struggle to cover the country with the same depth and breath as they had in the past, she said. \"The problem is of course, they (foreign media) have very different interests to Australian interests.\n\n\"If we want a system of democracy as we currently do in Australia where people are required to be informed to make a decision, we need a variety of Australian voices actually telling us what's going on.\"\n\nHer plea to support public interest journalism is reflected in Canberra. Opposition politicians this month pushed for a probe into the role of government and laws in ensuring independent and diverse media.\n\n\"If (newspaper publishers) are to survive 10 to 15 years from now, basically they won't be publicly listed and they'll have a rich benefactor,\" Mr Allen said. \"News Limited have one (Rupert Murdoch) currently, Seven West Media (chairman Kerry Stokes) have one currently, but they won't last forever.\" AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nConsumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/d6fde136b688847c1b6174dbb8d46f0186b55ee4c3d6d42f2b7b28f4ed1b4449?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "With the market near-saturated, analysts say US and UK media giants, with their deep pockets and mostly free online content, are eating into the advertising revenue of Australia's local media."}]}

Other airlines also face headwinds\n\nNisha Ramchandani\n\nPublished Mon, May 22, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nCathay Pacific\n\nFollow\n\nRestructuring\n\nUnder pressure\n\nSingapore\n\nCATHAY Pacific confirmed on Monday that it would lay off some 600 staff in its biggest cost-cutting exercise in two decades, as it looks for ways to stem losses and claw its way back to profitability.\n\nIt is not the only one facing turbulence; despite historically low oil prices, a number of airlines are facing strong headwinds, ranging from deteriorating yields to government policies.\n\nAt Cathay Pacific's headquarters in Hong Kong, around 190 management and 400 non-managerial staff will be made redundant; the numbers represent 25 per cent and 18 per cent of management and non-managerial positions respectively, the airline said in a statement.\n\nNo frontline employees, pilots or cabin crew will be hit, but the group will push for productivity improvements; meanwhile, it will also restructure its cargo unit.\n\nThe airline's chief executive Rupert Hogg, who assumed the role on May 1, said: \"We've had to make tough but necessary decisions for the future of our business and our customers. As we look to the future, we will have a new structure that will make us leaner, faster and more responsive to our customers' needs.\"\n\nShares in Cathay Pacific rose HK$0.26 (S$0.04) in response, and closed at HK$11.58 on Monday.\n\nSouth China Morning Post reported that the carrier is in the early phase of a three-year transformation programme and is seeking to save HK$4 billion in that time frame.\n\nThis comes after the carrier posted its first annual loss in eight years in March, sinking into the red with losses of HK$575 million for 2016; in the year-ago period, it made profits of HK$6 billion.\n\nIts bottom line was hit by fuel hedging losses, a decline in business travel and an eroding market share arising from the rapidly expanding Chinese carriers.\n\nEndau Analytics' aviation analyst Shukor Yusof expects more job cuts are in the offing: \"I don't think 600 out of over 30,000 would help them very much. But they've taken the right step. Labour costs are among the highest at Cathay Pacific compared to many carriers around the world, not just the region.\"\n\nAmid over-capacity, the Hong Kong carrier is likely to end up cutting capacity and downsizing its network, he said; this means cabin crew and pilots could also be affected down the line.\n\nWorking more closely with shareholder Air China is another avenue Cathay Pacific should consider in its restructuring, he suggested.\n\nSingapore Airlines (SIA) has also embarked on a wide-ranging review of its business to reposition itself for long-term growth, as competition remains stiff in both the premium and budget segments.\n\nLast week, the Singapore carrier revealed a surprise S$138.3 million fourth-quarter loss, which sent its share price reeling.\n\nIt announced that it would re-integrate SIA Cargo back into the group. The majority of SIA Cargo's nearly 900 employees will be retained in the new cargo division; some will be transferred to other divisions or elsewhere in the SIA group.\n\nDBS Group research analyst Paul Yong, who has a target price of S$10.10 per SIA share, said: \"While (the business review) may pay off in the longer term, we remain cautious on the near-term earnings outlook for SIA, as its flagship passenger business continues to face stiff competition and soft yields, leading to lower profitability.\"\n\nShares in SIA continued to fall on Monday, sliding 19 cents to close at S$9.79; it had shed 78 cents last Friday.\n\nMr Shukor said the yield decline will probably \"get worse before it stabilises\", and that demand for the airline's premium seats has fallen since the financial crisis in 2008/2009.\n\nEven with burgeoning travel demand, premium carriers in the region such as Cathay Pacific and SIA are grappling with deteriorating yields, cost pressures and tough competition from Chinese and Gulf carriers.\n\nBuoyed by cheaper fuel prices and new, fuel-efficient aircraft, long-haul, low-cost carriers could also add to the headaches faced by full-service carriers. Norwegian, for instance, is set to start direct flights out of Changi Airport to London from September, a route now operated by SIA and British Airways.\n\nMeanwhile, SIA's budget arm Scoot will commence long-haul flights to Athens from June; it is set to add another route, possibly to Honolulu, by year's end. Over in Malaysia, AirAsia X will start flying to Honolulu mid-year and is eyeing more routes in the West.\n\nDubai's Emirates hasn't been spared either. Earlier this month, it reported an 82 per cent nose-dive in full-year profits, partly due to recently implemented travel policies banning carry-on laptops on flights between the Middle East and the US. As a result, Emirates has had to reduce flight frequencies on five of its US routes, citing waning demand.\n\nQantas, on the other hand, is reportedly projecting its second best annual profit this year, having kick-started its own transformation programme back in 2014.\n\nOne bright spot for now is that jet fuel prices are still relatively low, although they are widely expected to rise again.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (Iata) has projected that the world's airlines will rack up US$29.8 billion in collective profits this year. However, 60 per cent of the industry profits will be driven by North American carriers, thanks to recent consolidation.\n\nAsia-Pacific carriers, once the industry's star performers, are expected to contribute to just 20 per cent of industry profits this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Opec and other global producers such as Russia had agreed to reduce production in the first six month of this year, and the decision to extend the cuts will be taken when they meet in Vienna at the end of the month, Mr Al-Falih said.\n\n\"We think we have everybody on board,\" Mr Al-Falih said in an interview with Bloomberg television in Riyadh on Saturday. \"Everybody I've talked to indicated that nine months was a wise decision.\" Mr Al-Falih was speaking as Donald Trump started a visit in Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, on his first overseas trip as US president.\n\nNational representatives from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and officials from several non-members discussed in Vienna on Friday the outlook for rising US shale oil production, which has been diluting the price impact of their production cuts. The producers, who together account for about half the world's oil supply, have seen the initial price boost from their historic agreement fade as shale companies deployed more rigs and raised the country's output to the highest since 2015.\n\nOfficials at the Vienna meeting were relieved that two outside energy consultants had estimates for growth in average US crude output of 450,000 to 500,000 barrels a day this year, lower than the 562,000 barrel-a-day forecast from Opec's own analysts, said two delegates.\n\nOpec and other producers who agreed to the cuts last year are not targeting any specific oil price, Mr Al-Falih said. \"Everybody wants the extension, as we realise we have not achieved the objective of bringing global inventories down to a five-year average,\" he said.\n\n\"Opec and non-Opec countries are working together, and that should encourage investment. My objective is clarity of where the market is going so that people invest, and I am less concerned about prices over the next 12 months than I am over the next 3 years, when supply will be short, demand will be approaching 100 million barrels a day,\" he said.\n\nWhile news of a proposal for a 9-month extension of output cuts helped send prices to a two-week high on Monday, crude remains stuck near US$50 a barrel, less than half the level traded in 2014. Inventories in 35 of the world's most industrialised nations - the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development - were just above 3 billion barrels in April, or about 307 million above their five-year average, data from the US Energy Information Administration shows.\n\nInventories are decreasing, crude demand is rising and the global economy is doing well, Mr Al-Falih said on Saturday.\n\n\"OECD and non-OECD floating storage has been offloaded into tanks and consumed.

The system is intended to reduce duplication and promote efficiency. The Defense Department is the largest single consumer of fuel in the world. Each year, it buys about 100 million barrels of refined petroleum for its aircraft, warships, tanks and other machines.\n\nThe practice of exploiting fuel revenue to plug unrelated gaps in the defence budget has escalated in recent years, prompting allegations - and official denials - that the accounts are being used as a slush fund.\n\nPentagon officials defended the arrangement. Congress has routinely approved their requests to skim off the fuel-purchasing accounts as a straightforward way to balance the Defense Department's books. Lawmakers, however, are increasingly questioning the budgeting methods that have enabled the Pentagon to accumulate large windfalls from fuel sales in the first place. The obscure accounting policy exemplifies the enormous scale and complexity of the US military's business operations, and how waste and inefficiency in the defence bureaucracy can dwarf what Washington spends on other parts of the federal government.\n\nIn recent months, for example, the Pentagon has struggled to explain to Congress why it buried an internal study that exposed US$125 billion in administrative waste, including sky-high salaries for legions of defence contractors. Such fiscal problems are deeply rooted. For the past quarter-century, the Defense Department has failed to meet a congressional mandate to clean up its books so it can pass an audit - the only federal agency that has failed to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon is preparing for a military build-up. President Donald Trump has said he will ask Congress to add US$54 billion to next year's defence budget, about a 10 per cent spike over current spending caps. Some senior leaders with the armed forces accused the Pentagon of intentionally overbilling the Air Force, Navy, Army and Marine Corps for fuel and pocketing the difference to pay for other priorities.\n\n\"We've been complaining about this,\" said Ray Mabus, who served as Navy secretary for eight years during the Obama administration. \"But if we do it too loudly, oh man, they come back on us really hard.\"\n\nOfficials with the Navy, who have been the most vocal in their opposition, said the pot of money derived from fuel sales is known as a \"bishop's fund\", an unofficial reserve account controlled by the office of the defence secretary. \"Another word for it is 'slush fund',\" said Mr Mabus, who left office in January.\n\nHe and other officials said artificially high fuel prices have left the Navy, at times, with less money for military training, operations and maintenance. The Air Force and Army have not complained publicly about the arrangement. The Pentagon acknowledged that it accumulated US$5.6 billion in \"enterprise gains\" from fuel purchases between 2010 and 2016, but said the surplus was the result of falling oil prices in an inherently volatile market.\n\n\"What has happened in the last two years is we have been blessed by lower fuel prices,\" Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work said. \"Sometimes you overestimate what the price will cost and you get an asset, and sometimes you underestimate and you get a deficit.\"\n\nMr Work denied that the Pentagon had a \"bishop's fund\" or a deliberate strategy to inflate the price of fuel. \"I vehemently disagree with that characterisation,\" he said, adding an expletive for emphasis. John Roth, the Pentagon's acting comptroller and chief financial officer, said it would be impossible to hide a multibillion-dollar slush fund from Congress. He said the Pentagon must receive approval from four different legislative committees whenever it wants to spend money from fuel savings on other programmes.\n\n\"I have an enormous number of outside people looking over my shoulder,\" Mr Roth said. \"The thought that I could somehow establish some sort of reserve in some manner, shape or form and hide it from everyone else just doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nCongress has approved the Pentagon's requests to tap its fuel revenue to pay for shortfalls in other programmes. Legislative aides said they did not think that the Defense Department was intentionally manipulating fuel prices. At the same time, Congress has heightened its scrutiny of how the pool of excess cash has materialised.\n\nIn reports commissioned by Congress since 2014, the Government Accountability Office has found that the Pentagon has done a poor job of projecting its annual fuel budget and how much petroleum it would actually consume in a given year. Lawmakers have also asked the Pentagon to give back some of the surplus. In 2015, they forced the Defense Department to return US$1 billion and reduced the budgets for other military programmes by US$2.6 billion to reflect lower-than-expected fuel costs.\n\nAnd in approving a defense authorisation bill last year, the Senate Armed Services Committee concluded in a report that it was \"concerned about the quality and transparency\" of the Pentagon's methodology for setting fuel prices. The Defense Department purchases all of its fuel centrally through the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), which then resells it to the branches of the armed forces.\n\nInstead of operating like a neighbourhood gas station and changing its resale prices daily or weekly, however, the DLA charges a standard price for fuel that is supposed to remain fixed for an entire fiscal year. The purpose is to make budgeting easier and to cushion the armed forces from wild swings in commodity markets. Gains and losses are absorbed by the DLA in a revolving account known as a working-capital fund. It is supposed to break even over time.\n\nFrom 2001 until 2009, the system worked as intended, even when oil prices skyrocketed. The DLA's energy revenue and expenses largely balanced out. The armed forces bought fuel from the DLA at rates that roughly tracked what commercial airlines were paying for jet fuel on the open market, plus a modest mark-up - averaging around 11 US cents a gallon - to cover overhead costs, according to a Navy analysis of fuel data.\n\nBut starting in 2010, a large spread developed. The DLA fixed its standard fuel price at rates that were often much higher than what the airlines were paying - sometimes US$1 or more a gallon.\n\nAll told, the DLA charged the armed forces about US$23 billion more for fuel between 2010 and 2016 than what airlines would have paid on the open market, according to a review of Pentagon purchasing data.\n\nThomas Hicks, who served as the Navy's deputy undersecretary for management until February, said that Navy officials began raising questions about the discrepancy in 2011 during meetings with the DLA and the Office of the defence secretary.\n\nThose officials responded that the differential was necessary to upgrade distribution centers and other infrastructure, Mr Hicks said. But when pressed for data to justify the price hikes, their numbers didn't add up, according to Navy officials. \"They never gave us anything that was plausible.\"\n\nPentagon officials said the comparison between what the armed forces and commercial airlines paid for fuel was misleading. They said about three-quarters of the US$23 billion difference paid for overhead expenses and specialised military fuel requirements that airlines do not have to worry about. The officials acknowledged that the remainder of the spread - about US$5.6 billion - amounted to a fuel-savings windfall. They said the savings piled up because energy prices had dropped more than expected and stayed low.\n\n\"These last couple years have been a bit anomalous in that we've actually had fuel savings, which we would consider fortuitous,\" Mr Roth said. \"It is no question, the last two or three years, we're riding the same wave all of us do when we go get gas and it's now cheaper than it was.\"\n\nThe military's standard fuel price is set by the Pentagon's comptroller in consultation with the DLA and the White House Office of Management and Budget. Although it is supposed to remain fixed for 12 months at a time, the price can be adjusted if energy markets spike up or down.\n\nThe Pentagon, however, has even tried to raise its fuel price when energy markets were flat or declining, documents show.\n\nIn April 2013, for example, Mr Roth notified the armed forces in a memo that the Pentagon's comptroller would raise the standard price of fuel the next month by 27 per cent, from US$3.73 to US$4.72 per gallon.\n\nThe memo said the unplanned increase was necessary \"to ensure the continued solvency\" of the Pentagon's working-capital fund for fuel. But fuel prices on the open market had been going in the opposite direction. Commercial airlines were paying US$3.05 a gallon in April 2013, down about 10 per cent from a year earlier, according to data from the federal Bureau for Transportation Statistics.\n\nThe unexpected price hike provoked an uproar from the armed forces. Two days later, Mr Roth abruptly cancelled the price increase. A follow-up memo stated that the decision was made \"in response to revised business and economic assumptions\". Mr Roth said he did not recall the memos or the exact circumstances of the 2013 price gyrations.\n\n\"We'd have to go back and look at it,\" he said. \"If we changed a decision that quickly, that didn't reflect particularly great decision-making.\"\n\nAlthough his memo suggested that the working-capital fund for fuel was in danger of becoming insolvent, documents show that, one year later, it had actually become overly flush with cash - even without the price hike. In April 2014, after noticing that the fund had an excessive balance, Congress ordered the Pentagon to withdraw US$347.5 million from the account to pay for an array of unrelated operational expenses at the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the US Special Operations Command and other agencies. In 2015, as petroleum prices on the open market were plunging, the working-capital fund amassed an even bigger surplus. That year, documents show, the Pentagon dipped into the fund five times, transferring a combined US$1.2 billion to other military accounts.\n\nAbout US$80 million went to buttress a star-crossed Defense Department effort to train and equip a new Syrian army dedicated to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, records show. The money was intended as a last-ditch boost for the programme, which had already cost US$500 million and was designed to train 5,400 rebel forces but was struggling to produce results.\n\nSix months later, despite the extra money, the Pentagon scrapped the programme. In the end, only 150 Syrian fighters were trained. All but a handful of those were captured or killed by Al-Qaeda, or deserted.\n\nSeparately in 2015, documents show, the Pentagon transferred US$450 million from the fuel fund to the Defense Health programme to help rescue a prescription-drug plan for troops and their families.\n\nThe drug plan was deeply in the red. Officials had been slow to respond to a flood of bogus claims for pain medications submitted by insurance scammers. By the time the Pentagon caught on, it was stuck with a bill for an estimated US$1.7 billion in fraudulent claims, according to defence auditors.\n\nIn 2016, fuel prices on the open market plummeted even more, enabling the Pentagon to build an even bigger surplus in the working-capital fund. That year, documents show, the Pentagon dipped into the fund six times for a total of US$3 billion.\n\nAmong other expenses, about US$1.4 billion went to cover financial shortfalls from US military operations in Afghanistan. A resurgence by the Taliban prompted the Obama administration to keep thousands of additional US troops in the war zone. Extra money was also needed for ammunition, spare parts, drones and contractors, according to the documents.\n\nAll told, the Pentagon has withdrawn a total of US$5.9 billion from the working-capital fund since 2011, according to figures provided by the Defense Department. Almost all of the surplus was due to fuel savings, defense officials said.\n\nMr Roth said it was common practice to transfer money among operating accounts to balance out manageable shortfalls and surpluses that invariably arise during a fiscal year.\n\nWhen fuel prices spike upward, he said, the Pentagon sometimes must raid other accounts to pump more money into the working-capital fund for fuel. That happened in 2012, when officials covered a US$1 billion fuel deficit by tapping surplus money budgeted for Afghan security forces.\n\nCongress \"expects us to solve most of our problems ourselves without coming back and asking them for more money\", he said. \"Their default position is, 'Hey, you're big boys and big girls. . . Somewhere in that enterprise you must have some extra money to pay for whatever shortfall you have'.\" Mr Roth said the money transfers can work both ways.\n\nWhile the armed forces may complain about having to pay too much for fuel, Mr Roth said, excess money in the fund is often rerouted to other accounts that directly benefit the military services. In 2016, for example, the Pentagon used about US$186 million in fuel savings to cover shortfalls in the Navy's ship-maintenance programme and the cost of an extended mission for the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group in the Middle East, documents show.\n\nHe denied the Pentagon was intentionally manipulating its fuel prices so it could build up a slush fund. \"It's not a bishop's fund and we don't keep a bishop's fund,\" he said. \"If I was that smart to predict oil prices that far ahead of time, I wouldn't have this job. I'd be out there making a hell of a lot more money.\" WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/5250e080c71d00b413e794a8692d11837e99840b8906e71d239ef7d3c87067a0?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Since 2015, the US Defense Department has tapped surpluses from its fuel accounts for US$80 million to train Syrian rebels, US$450 million to shore up a prescription-drug programme riddled with fraud and US$1.4 billion to cover unanticipated expenses from the war in Afghanistan"}]}

And it means standing together against the murder of innocent Muslims, the oppression of women, the persecution of Jews, and the slaughter of Christians.\"\n\nMr Trump's \"America first\" philosophy helped him win the 2016 election and has rattled allies who depend on US support for their defence.\n\nThe president, who is struggling to contain a brewing political scandal at home, made it clear in his address that Washington would partner the Middle East but expected more action in return.\n\n\"Terrorism has spread across the world. But the path to peace begins right here, on this ancient soil, in this sacred land,\" he said in Saudi Arabia, the first stop on a nine-day tour that includes Israel, Italy and Belgium.\n\nThe speech is part of an effort to redefine his relationship with the Muslim world after Mr Trump frequently attacked Muslims on the campaign trail last year and tried to ban many from entering the US.\n\nThe approach was also designed to contrast with former US president Barack Obama, whom Mr Trump has criticised for his handling of the fight against the Islamic State militant group.\n\n\"We are not here to lecture, we are not here to tell other people how to live, what to do, who to be, or how to worship,\" Mr Trump added.\n\n\"But we can only overcome this evil if the forces of good are united and strong, and if everyone in this room does their fair share and fulfils their part of the burden ... the nations of the Middle East cannot wait for American power to crush this enemy for them.\"\n\nMr Trump received a warm welcome from Arab leaders, who set aside his campaign rhetoric about Muslims and focused on his desire to crack down on Iran's influence in the region, a commitment they found wanting in Mr Obama.\n\nThe US and Gulf Arab countries agreed on Sunday to coordinate their efforts against the financing of terrorist groups, a key White House objective. They will establish a centre aimed at cracking down on the ability of Islamic militants to spread their message.\n\nMr Trump's welcome in the region was put on display during a series of individual meetings with Arab leaders.\n\nHe praised Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, telling him: \"You have done a tremendous job under trying circumstances.\"\n\nReinforcing his theme of US economic deals, Mr Trump told Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani they would discuss \"lots of beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the United States.\"\n\nTo Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, Mr Trump declared that the two nations had a lot in common and \"there won't be strain with this administration.\"\n\nAnd in a meeting with the emir of Kuwait, Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the American president noted that Kuwait bought large amounts of US military equipment. The Kuwaiti leader referred to Mr Trump as \"my brother\".

A key reason is the shortage of bitcoins, compared to large supplies and stocks of gold.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, the creator of the virtual, digital \"cryptocurrency\" in 2009, devised \"Blockchain\", a technical network that limited the issuance to a maximum of 21 million bitcoins. So far, only 16.4 million are currently in circulation, according to specialist dealers. Bitcoin's small market capitalisation of US$32.8 billion thus compares with central bank gold holdings of 1.1 billion ounces worth US$1.35 trillion and estimated official and private gold stocks of 5.6 billion ounces worth around US$7 trillion.\n\nWhile gold supplies leak on to the market when prices rise, Bitcoin in contrast, is an illiquid, exceedingly volatile market. The price has soared by 377 per cent in the past twelve months, but daily fluctuations have invariably been 5 per cent or more, dealers report.\n\nA major reason for the recent price surge, is the growing market concern that investigations into US President Donald Trump's links with Russia and a potential lame duck administration, could be bearish for equities. There are also hopes that the Security Exchange Commission will allow the formation of a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that will boost demand and large numbers of Japanese investors have been selling yen and buying bitcoins.\n\nFinally demand in China for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has soared in the past year, according to traders. Some individuals and corporations have used them to avoid exchange controls and transfer money to counterparties in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe fear of outside, novice investors is that the market is complex and supplies could suddenly increase and knock the price. Participants in the market are unconcerned and regard Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies as the natural development from the ideas of economist Friederich Hayek who recommended private currencies more than 40 years ago. Mr Hayek was concerned that central banks were printing money irresponsibly and the consequences would be inflation, financial booms, busts and recessions such as 2007 to 2009. To achieve a sound virtual private currency, Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) devised an open-source, peer-to-peer technological network, \"Blockchain\".\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation says that Blockchain is a public ledger for all past and present Bitcoin transactions. By tracing the history of each single coin in the network since its creation to the latest owner, any participant can tell who owns Bitcoins, and how many.\n\nInherent in the technology is cryptography which uses sophisticated mathematical equations (algorithms) and secret keys to encrypt and decrypt data. A bitcoin wallet is an application that stores, sends and receives bitcoins. Individuals or companies can \"mine\" Bitcoins if they understand the complex technology.\n\nA Texan \"miner\" told The Business Times that he can only mine tiny fractions of Bitcoins over lengthy periods and this illustrates the tight control of new supplies. Bitcoin can be sent anywhere, anytime, (almost) for free, and with little regard for national borders or government/bank-imposed restrictions, states the Foundation. Increasing numbers of vendors are accepting Bitcoin as payment.\n\nThere are several hundred cryptocurrencies. The total market capitalisation, including Bitcoin, is worth only US$68 billion and the other main ones are Ripple and Ethereum. The Blockchains of different cryptocurrencies usually vary: they may have different rules, transaction times, security algorithms and so on, states the Foundation. But the basic rule is that nobody, in particular, is in charge of a cryptocurrency which is only manifested in records of transactions on a public digital ledger.\n\nThere are also several technical reasons why Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies have soared, maintains Stephen Macaskill, CEO of the Digital Asset Exchange in Auckland New Zealand. Participants in Bitcoin market have been seeking \"scaling\" solutions to increase the liquidity of the Bitcoin market. Recently a scaling solution, \"SegWit\" was implemented on Litecoin, another cryptocurrency. SegWit is a possible stepping stone to scaling bitcoin, Mr Macaskill says.\n\nEntrepreneurs are also beginning to raise hundreds of millions in cryptocurrencies for new projects via Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). The only way you can invest in them is if you own bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nAn International Monetary Fund (IMF) paper states that \"virtual currencies offer many potential benefits, including greater speed and efficiency in making payments and transfers - particularly across borders. It finds that blockchains are \"an innovative decentralised means of keeping track of transactions in a large network\". But the IMF also states that \"virtual currencies pose considerable risks as potential vehicles for money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion and fraud. Risks to financial stability may eventually emerge as the new technologies become more widely used.\"\n\nRegulation of the market of some 700 cryptocurrencies, is expected to tighten. Crime agencies are concerned that cyber criminals, who hacked and crashed Microsoft programmes, demanded ransoms in bitcoins.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As he recalls it: \"The owner said, 'I don't have a job for you.' I said, 'I'm not leaving.' He asked me, what can I do?\"\n\n\"Whatever you want,\" he replied. \"Wash dishes. Clean floors.\" He did all that - and also made a mean Israeli salad.\n\nFast forward 28 years. The peripatetic Mr Zlotnitsky, now 50, has started several companies, including a real estate company and a Maryland-based software firm.\n\nBut it's his foray into airline travel that got my attention. He is not only an example of the rich contributions that immigrants bring to America. His is also a tale of the thankless frustrations that go with building a business.\n\nAnd what with all the horror stories about fights, riots, even scorpions, on the airlines recently, I thought his little project to bring peaceful sleep to airline travellers was timely. The entrepreneur has helped invent an airplane pillow with the kitschy name of JetComfy.\n\nJetComfy reminds me of those wacky late-night ads hawking offbeat contraptions such as the Veg-O-Matic, Pocket Fisherman and Inside the Shell Egg Scrambler.\n\nLike entrepreneur and TV marketer Ron Popeil, Mr Zlotnitsky is always thinking of the next thing.\n\n\"I wasn't the brightest guy. But I've always been this guy who was thinking outside the box. I don't believe in 'no'.\"\n\nThe airspace for plane pillows is as crowded as the skies. The horseshoe pillow has been around for decades. A former Virgin Atlantic flight attendant, a few years back, invented a J-shaped pillow.\n\n\"Airlines are cramming you in and there is less space and less everything,\" he said. \"At least you want to sleep normal.\"\n\nMr Zlotnitsky and a business partner have invested three years and US$350,000 to create the JetComfy. The pillow is the size of a purse and sells for US$39.99.\n\nAbout 10,000 units have been sold since it went on sale in January. Mr Zlotnitsky said he has plans to open the first JetComfy comfort sales centre in Dulles International Airport in August and hopes to expand to 25 locations at larger airports in a year.\n\nThe pillow is available now on Amazon Prime and at Luggage Plus stores and will be offered online by Walmart later this month.\n\nIt weighs less than half a kilogramme and measures 24 by 14 centimetres. It looks nothing like a pillow - more like a foam headrest attached to a short pole supported by the arm of your seat.\n\nMr Zlotnitsky is betting that, among the more than three billion people who fly every year, there is enough of a market for him to sell millions of JetComfys.\n\n\"We plan to sell over 350,000 units by mid-2018 in the US alone,\" he said. \"We are working to start distribution is Europe, China, Australia and the Middle East.\"\n\nJetComfy all started on a diving trip with his wife to Bora Bora in 2014. As they were exiting the Air Tahiti jet, he heard a passenger named David Brecht, a battery engineer from San Diego, call it the \"worst flight ever\".\n\nAt the hotel bar later, the two decided to team up to bring restful sleep to those who can't afford to buy spacious first-class seats. Mr Zlotnitsky's idea was to re-create the comfort of your chin resting in the cup of your hand with your elbow resting on the desk or table.\n\n\"That's the natural position,\" he said. \"You tell somebody to rest their head, and that's what they are going to do.\" They created mock-ups out of cardboard. They drew designs on toilet paper. They bought \"selfie sticks\" for the pillow stand. They Skyped between Maryland and San Diego. They bought a used 3-D printer for US$2,300. They bought used airline seats on eBay to test their designs. They bought foam, aluminium, plastic. They pulled all-nighters.\n\n\"Dave is the geek that can take my ideas and make it happen. I am the guy taking it to the business. We spent almost two years building this crazy thing.\" They tried out several names: EZ Rest (using Mr Zlotnitsky's initials); EasyComfy.

That is troubling, because that violent housing cycle helped to produce the Great Recession and financial crisis of 2007-2009. We need to understand it all if we are going to be able to avoid ordeals like that in the future.\n\nBut the explanations for what happened in housing are not, I think, to be found in the conventional data favoured by economists but rather in sociologically important narratives - like tales of getting rich through \"flipping\" houses and shares of initial public offerings - that constitute the shifting mentality of the era.\n\nConsider the data for a moment. It shows us that extreme changes took place but doesn't tell us why.\n\nReal home prices rose 75 per cent from February 1997 to December 2005, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, corrected for inflation by the Consumer Price Index. And then, from 2005-2012, real prices reversed course, falling to just 12 per cent above their 1997 level.\n\nIn the years since 2012, they have climbed 29 per cent, about halfway back to their 2005 peak. This is a roller coaster in national home prices - it has been even scarier in some more volatile cities - yet we have no clarity on why it happened.\n\nThe problem for economists is that these changes don't correspond to movements in the usual suspects: interest rates, building costs, population or rents.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index for Rent of Primary Residence, compiled by the US Bureau of Labour Statistics and corrected for inflation, went up only 8 per cent in 1997-2005, so unmet demand for housing services can't explain the huge increase in real home prices.\n\nIt doesn't explain the 29 per cent rise in real home prices since 2012 either, because inflation-adjusted rents increased only 10 per cent in that period. So what has been driving the wild ride in home prices?\n\nI believe the price swings have something to do with the changing mentality of the times, changes caused by narratives that have gone viral and swept across the population.\n\nLooking for answers in such popular stories contrasts starkly with the prominent approach of modelling people as if they react logically to economic forces. But a less orthodox approach can be quite useful.\n\nOne thing is clear: The prevalent narratives of 1997-2005 did not include the concept of a housing bubble, not at first. A computer search using ProQuest or Google Ngrams shows that the phrase \"housing bubble\" was hardly used until 2005, the end of the boom.\n\nWhat is a bubble? It typically includes the notion that, spurred by the public's expectation of ever further price increases, demand eventually reaches levels that cannot be sustained, and so the enthusiasm wanes and the bubble collapses. But that thought was just not on many people's minds then, the evidence suggests.\n\nInstead, during the 1997-2005 boom there were multitudes of narratives about smart investors who were bold enough to take a position in the market. To single out one strand, recall the stories of flippers who would buy a house, fix it up, and resell it within months at a huge profit.\n\nThese stories appear to have been broadly exciting to people who didn't flip houses themselves but who appear to have begun to think that stretching a little and buying a house with a large mortgage would make them wise investors.\n\nIn his book The Complete Guide to Flipping Properties published in 2004, Steve Berges extolled what he called \"the OPM principle\", meaning \"other people's money\".\n\nHe wrote: \"Your objective is to control as much real estate as possible while using as little of your own capital as possible.\"\n\nIn other words, borrow as much as you can. He wrote about the upside of leverage but not about the perils of leverage during the kind of big price drops that were just around the corner.\n\nIt can take a long time for narratives like this to grip the popular imagination. Flipping was \"a thing\" in the condominium conversion boom of the 1970s and '80s. The idea then was this: Big-time converters with deep pockets would buy apartment buildings and convert the rental apartments to owner-occupied condos, selling units to diverse individuals, some of them flippers. For public relations purposes, converters would offer to sell at reduced prices to renters already living in a building, and typically to some outsiders, too.\n\nThis generated buzz. When renters and speculators flipped their purchase contracts at a big profit, sometimes using borrowed money for downpayments to flip multiple units without actually even closing on the condos, it was thrilling. It seemed that anyone with energy and initiative could get rich doing this.\n\nSome people eager to make quick profits bought Donald Trump's well-timed 2004 book, Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life, written with Meredith McIver. Some enrolled in the less well-timed Trump University, which emphasised real estate investment in 2005, at the very end of the housing boom; it shut down, amid lawsuits and recrimination, in 2010.\n\nNarratives about flipping weren't restricted to real estate. Just after the time of the condo boom, stories of rapid buying and selling of initial public offerings took off as well.\n\nAs with the condo promoters, IPO underwriters would sell some shares below market prices to customers, who might then \"flip\" the IPO for a quick profit.\n\nThe promoters of condo conversions and IPOs were onto something. By giving discounts to buyers who would make a high return, they captivated the nation with tales of people who had no advanced degrees or hefty resumes but made fortunes anyway.\n\nBy now, the notion of getting rich by flipping houses is entrenched. I searched Amazon for books on \"flipping houses\" and came up with 328 hits, most written in the past few years.\n\nBuying and rehabbing existing houses for resale is a legitimate business. But many of these books make extravagant pitches and seem aimed at inspiring amateurs to plunge into risky ventures.\n\nThe public fascination with speculating in housing has been held in check by regulators empowered by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, but that restraint is tenuous with the election as president of a real estate promoter intent on reducing regulators' power.\n\nThese narratives are still potent and could easily spur further spirals in the housing market.

They also get to enjoy arts performances across a myriad of genres.\n\nHead of Mapletree's group corporate services Wan Kwong Weng says the midday performances, which range from traditional Chinese music to hip hop dance, are popular with the crowd.\n\nThe performances are part of Mapletree's signature programme Arts in the City (AITC), which started in 2013 and is organised in collaboration with the National Arts Council (NAC). Charlotte Koh, deputy director of the arts and culture development office at NAC, says: \"Our wish is to have arts in every firm's and individual's DNA. Arts feeds and opens the mind and changes the way we see the world. It equips us with skills for a future-ready workforce.\"\n\nHowever, the road to raising public awareness was not always a smooth one. \"Some firms will not think of supporting the arts as they don't think it fulfils their social mission . . . the older generation also prefers to give to other causes linked to education and alleviation of poverty,\" she says.\n\nHence NAC is on the move to spread awareness by collaborating with firms such as Mapletree.\n\nThrough initiatives such as AITC, groups such as Nadi Singapura and The Royal Dance-Off get a platform to reach out to locals.\n\nMs Koh says: \"We have to put in a business case and explain to the firms that they can use the arts as a platform to engage the PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians). It can also enliven the environment and is a gift to the community. For instance, Mapletree has supported the arts and this support stems from the desire to add vibrancy to their properties.\"\n\nEfforts seem to have paid off. Research conducted last year by NAC found that 63 per cent of multinational corporations and 47 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises which had not previously given to the arts said they would consider doing so.\n\nTo encourage giving, the Cultural Matching Fund (CMF), administered by NAC, provides one-to-one matching of private cash donations to eligible arts and heritage groups.\n\n\"We want to have a shared ownership with the arts groups,\" says Ms Koh. \"So far, the initiative has been successful. If you look at the trend of giving, in 2012-2013, tax deductible donations have always been in the range of S$28-29 million. But after CMF was implemented, in the years 2014 and 2015, the amounts received were S$55 million and S$149 million respectively. The big jump in the Jubilee year, when giving was at an all-time high, can be attributed to the establishment of two new arts institutions and the increased awareness of the CMF.\"\n\nOne arts group that has benefitted from CMF is The TENG Company. Temasek Holdings has been its patron since 2015 as it saw in TENG \"homegrown talent with the potential to develop a uniquely multi-cultural Singaporean sound that is fresh and inspiring\", says Robin Hu, head, sustainability & stewardship group, at Temasek.\n\n\"Temasek cares about the well-being of our community and has been supporting the nurturing of young talent through arts and music endowments since 2011,\" says Mr Hu.\n\nYang Ji Wei, executive director of The TENG Company, says: \"The CMF has helped to lighten the load of fundraising for the company and enables us to expand our efforts in performance, education and research.\"\n\nTo bring the arts to all Singaporeans, NAC also spearheaded initiatives such as Arts in Your Neighbourhood to reach people in the heartlands and Silver Arts for the seniors.\n\n\"We have a department set up to just focus on engaging communities through the arts. At NAC, we believe in artistic excellence and creating access in the work that we do. So the activities we do at the heartlands are still of good quality,\" says Ms Koh.\n\nThe efforts have helped shape people's perception that the arts is not an esoteric subject just for the rich. Looking ahead, NAC wants to make the arts more accessible to marginalised communities and persons with disabilities.\n\n\"So in future, when we have a show or movie screening, we want to have people who can sign so that the hearing impaired can enjoy as well . . . but this year, we want to focus on bringing films to nursing homes - something we hope to introduce in this year's Silver Arts festival. We not only screen the movie for the seniors who may not be mobile at the nursing homes, we also bring in the producers of the show to explain.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

only Kyle MacLachlan, who returns in his role as FBI special agent Dale Cooper, was able to have a single read of the entire script.\n\nAlthough viewers have known since the beginning of the second season who killed Laura Palmer - a high school student whose shocking murder launched the plot - an air of mystery lingers.\n\nMost of the show's original cast members have returned to reprise their characters' roles nearly a quarter-century after the second season wrapped.\n\nDirector David Lynch, who co-created the early '90s series, also returned to direct the reboot of the cult series, his first major project since he directed the film Inland Empire 11 years ago.\n\nBut no matter how the third season of Twin Peaks plays out, the show has already cemented its status as a TV masterpiece.\n\n\"David Lynch proved that there wasn't just one way of making television,\" said Damon Lindelof, creator of the hit TV show Lost, at a Showtime preview segment.\n\nContemporary to The Cosby Show and Roseanne, Twin Peaks emerged as unclassifiable - a series whose narrative style, rhythm and music took a striking departure from standard TV fare toward a more cinematic feel.\n\n\"You felt like watching a movie, but a movie that went on for hours and hours,\" Lindelof said.\n\nNeither soap opera nor crime series - but simultaneously a bit of both - the show defied all labels, adding to its recipe for success a pinch of the supernatural.\n\nMadchen Amick, who plays the waitress Shelly Johnson, told the magazine Entertainment Weekly that the show \"gave the audience what they were craving, which was intelligence and mystery and something different.\"\n\nCINEMATIC TELEVISION\n\nThe enigmatic series deliberately left gray areas when traditional television took pains to avoid them.\n\nEach episode lasted about an hour, \"but it actually necessitated discussion following it,\" Lindelof said.\n\nThe show quickly gained a loyal fan base, which has grown decades later thanks to a new generation of devotees who took to binge-watching episodes.\n\nFor MacLachlan, \"the fans kept the memory alive and they're about to be rewarded.\" \"I hope that they're going to be happy with what we've done.\"\n\nWhen the actor went to work on other shows - including the hits Desperate Housewives and Sex and the City - he said writers would often come to him to sing the praises of Twin Peaks.\n\n\"The writers would say to me: 'I didn't really think it was possible to do this, but because of Twin Peaks, suddenly I felt empowered, this is my vision.'\"\n\nBut Gary Edgerton, a television expert at Butler University, said that while the show was in some ways \"unlike anything that had been on television before,\" the influence of shows like The Sopranos was \"even more significant.\"\n\n\"The idea of cinematic television really found its footing and became much more realized when the emphasis went away from broadcast networks and went into the cable and satellite sector,\" Edgerton said.\n\nThere, he said, \"audiences were relatively smaller, although still substantial, and the show runners had great ambitions in realising television as art.\" \"But the question is, would we necessarily have had a Sopranos on television if we didn't have Twin Peaks?\"\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nLifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c50b96f33e744690d27a2d23f8ca55040b5492df9210dd1561e97a86325f829c?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Twin Peaks, the quirky TV show turned cult classic that gave way to a new age of television, makes its hotly anticipated return on Sunday, nearly three decades after its debut."}]}

It was the biggest such inventory since SteelHome began compiling the data in 2004.\n\nIron ore traded on the Dalian Commodity Exchange rose 0.6 per cent to 477 yuan per tonne.\n\nIron ore for delivery to China's Qingdao port slipped 1 per cent to $61.60 a tonne on Thursday, according to Metal Bulletin.

They have both given Indonesia's a \"positive\" credit outlook, signalling chances of an upgrade in the near future.\n\nThe central bank on Thursday announced its decision to keep its policy interest rate unchanged, citing a number of risks including a \"big chance\" US interest rates will rise in June.\n\nIndonesia's current account deficit shrank to one per cent in the first quarter, Mr Warjiyo said, significantly smaller than the deficit in 2013, which was more than 4 per cent, which had led to heavy capital outflows and a more than 20 percent drop in the rupiah currency.\n\nSouth-east Asia's largest economy also has ample foreign exchange reserves, he said, adding that 90 per cent of companies are currently compliant with BI's mandatory hedging rules for foreign debt, making currency mismatch risks low.\n\nMeanwhile, Indonesia's financial market has grown considerably, and the domestic foreign exchange market is now around five times bigger than in 2013, the deputy governor added.\n\nIndonesian officials told S&P officials who visited Jakarta earlier this year that the credit rating agency was already late making an upgrade. S&P does not disclose the timing of revisions to ratings.\n\nS&P's last statement on Indonesia's sovereign ratings in June 2016 mentioned worsening corporate credit quality as the main reason for holding back an upgrade.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c3394e1d0e46c41340a70b9be972d391f83520813c18a6065ab771e772b59ba8?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Indonesia's central bank has urged credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) to raise its rating for Indonesia's sovereign debt from junk bond status to reflect a number of recent reforms."}]}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/international/saudis-said-forge-us6b-lockheed-deal-littoral-ships", "site_title": "Saudis said to forge US$6b Lockheed deal for littoral ships", "publish_date": null, "content": "Saudis said to forge US$6b Lockheed deal for littoral ships\n\nPublished\n\nFri, May 19, 2017 \u00b7 03:26 AM\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nFollow\n\n[WASHINGTON] Lockheed Martin Corp has reached a US$6 billion deal to sell Saudi Arabia four of its Littoral Combat Ships as US President Donald Trump travels to the kingdom, people familiar with the transaction said.\n\nThe final letter of agreement includes a better-armed version of the ships, support equipment, munitions and electronic-warfare systems, according to the people, who asked not to be identified in advance of an announcement that may come as early as Saturday morning Washington time. That's when Mr Trump is scheduled to arrive in Riyadh on the first leg of an eight-day trip that will take him across the Middle East and to Rome.\n\nThe Trump administration is promising to improve relations with the Saudis that were strained under former President Barack Obama. For its part, Saudi Arabia has pledged to buy billions of dollars of US military equipment in the next decade and invest about $40 billion from its sovereign wealth fund in American companies.\n\nThe littoral ships, designed for shallow coastal waters, are part of a package of agreements on weapons sales that already had been approved in late 2015 by the US State Department, which oversees the Foreign Military Sales program. Congress also approved the sale, but it wasn't completed under Mr Obama. From 2009 to 2016, the Obama administration approved US$115 billion in potential sales to the Saudis.\n\nSaudi Embassy spokesman Nail Al-Jubeir didn't return an email and phone call seeking comment. Lockheed spokesman John Torrisi said in an email that \"Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government decisions, and the status of any potential discussions can be best addressed by the US Government.\"\n\nThe announcements will include a letter of agreement completing a sale approved in August 2016 for about 115 M1A2 tanks made by General Dynamics Corp, as well as munitions, and heavy equipment recovery systems, according to two of the people. A formal agreement is expected for Lockheed to sell more Pac-3 Patriot hit-to-kill missiles, which already have been approved by Congress.\n\nIn addition, announcements are expected on intentions to proceed with a number of deals. They include a multibillion-dollar program to upgrade Saudi Arabia's military command-and-control structure and the sale of about 60 UH-60 helicopters from Lockheed for about US$5 billion, according to one of the people.\n\nAlso anticipated is an announcement of the Saudi intention to buy Lockheed's Thaad anti-missile system, which intercepts incoming missiles at higher altitudes than the Patriot. Thaad already has been sold to the United Arab Emirates, the first international customer, and its deployment by the US to South Korea has created tension with China.\n\nBut the highest-profile deal will be for the modified Littoral Combat Ships, known as \"Multi-Mission Surface Combatant Ships,\" that were first proposed by the Obama administration in late 2015. It would be the first international sale of the vessel, which includes munitions such as Raytheon Co's Evolved Sea Sparrow air defense missile.\n\nThe Saudi-bound ships are better-armed - and thus more expensive - versions of the Littoral Combat Ship, which has drawn withering criticism from some lawmakers and Pentagon testing officials in recent years over its reliability and its capacity to survive in combat.\n\n\"I have seen most of the same details, and they make sense,\" John Cappello, a senior fellow for Middle East issues and missile defense issues, with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said of the planned deals in an email. \"Missile defense is a Saudi priority, and we have been trying to get them to improve capability, especially naval capability, for some time,\" he said.\n\nUntil recently, the Saudis were prepared to sign a letter of agreement for two vessels, but that's been increased to four, said a US official. Lockheed says on its website that the modified version includes over-the-horizon missiles, remotely fired 20mm guns, the capability to fire Sea Sparrow anti-aircraft missiles and a new torpedo defense system.\n\nParts of the package may draw congressional criticism. A resolution to block the tank sale was introduced in September by several US senators, including Rand Paul of Kentucky and Chris Murphy of Connecticut.

The IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics say biosimilars could save healthcare systems in the United States and Europe's top 5 markets as much as 98 billion euros (S$151.6 billion) by 2020.\n\nSamsung Bioepis, part of South Korea's top conglomerate Samsung Group, develops copies of complex biotech drugs and has found early success in beating rivals to market with its versions of some of the world's top selling drugs.\n\nIts Remicade biosimilar is already selling in the European Union, while its biosimilar of Amgen's rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel is also selling there.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Consumer & Healthcare\n\nUK agrees deal with Vietnam to remove pharmaceutical trade barriers\n\nJul 14, 2025 08:21 AM\n\nChina biotech\u2019s stunning advance is changing the world\u2019s drug pipeline\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:24 AM\n\nWith medical costs under the microscope, IHH Healthcare group CEO continues to eye expansion\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWith franchising experience from Popeyes, Fei Siong Group takes Encik Tan to Indonesia\n\nJul 13, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nKraft Heinz explores grocery business spinoff worth up to US$20 billion: source\n\nJul 12, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nPopiah king Sam Goi makes mandatory offer for rest of PSC at S$0.40 a share\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:53 PM\n\nEven 190% tariffs can\u2019t shake US shoemaker\u2019s reliance on China\n\nJul 11, 2025 11:31 AM\n\nLevi sees revenue growth offsetting most of tariff impact\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:15 AM", "images": []}

We expect the airport will be functioning normally by the start of summer,\" said Mr Millo.\n\nCatalonia's regional government, which is pushing for the wealthy region to break away from Spain and form its own country, accuses the central government of \"sabotaging\" the growth of Barcelona airport to ensure it does not surpass Madrid airport in passenger numbers.\n\n\"For them, Barcelona airport is a subsidiary airport. I am convinced that this situation would be unthinkable in Madrid,\" said the minister in charge of infrastructure in the Catalan government, Josep Rull.\n\nSpain's central government argues that the new rules, designed to tackle \"foreign fighters\" returning from Iraq and Syria, has affected all Spanish airports.\n\nBarcelona airport was especially affected because it has experienced strong passenger growth recently, it added.\n\nBarcelona airport handled 44.1 million passengers last year, an 11.2 per cent increase over the previous year, according to Spanish airport operator Aena.\n\nThe Schengen zone includes 22 EU countries, plus Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.\n\nAFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nMaritime, aviation sectors can learn from each other in tackling conflict risks, climate change: transport leaders\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:51 PM\n\nMusk says he does not support merger between Tesla and xAI\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:32 PM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM", "images": []}

She also rejected the continent's proposed negotiating schedule and pledged to stop \"making vast annual contributions\" to Brussels.\n\nMs May set out her Brexit goals in black and white, a critically important move given that talks with the EU could begin as soon as the day after the June 8 election.\n\nAssuming opinion polls are correct and her Tories are re-elected, the document will form the blueprint that guides the government through Brexit in 2019 and out to 2022.\n\n\"The negotiations will undoubtedly be tough, and there will be give and take on both sides, but we continue to believe that no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK,\" according to the manifesto released in the northern town of Halifax.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Ms May said \"every vote for me and my team is a vote that will strengthen my hand in those Brexit negotiations.\"\n\nThe willingness to walk away from the talks without a deal risks unnerving businesses concerned that failure to agree to a pact would expose them to sweeping tariffs and cost them easy access to their biggest market.\n\nFor Ms May, the threat sends a message to the EU not to try to punish the British for their decision given how many of the region's exporters rely on the UK\n\nThe manifesto also committed a Conservative government to reducing net migration to the \"tens of thousands,\" maintaining as frictionless a border as possible between the two Irelands and protecting British rule of Gibraltar.\n\nOn the controversial matter of the Brexit bill, Ms May would \"determine a fair settlement of the UK's rights and obligations.\"\n\nThe document also promised a \"deep and special\" trading relationship with the EU and accords with other countries based on the idea that there should be \"as few barriers to trade and investment as possible\".\n\nNine trade commissioners would be dotted around the globe and the government would aim to replicate all existing EU free trade deals. The Conservative Party also repeated that Ms May wants to discuss the terms of divorce such as the bill in tandem with a future trade agreement in order to wrap up the talks by the March 2019 deadline. EU officials, by contrast, say they won't debate commerce until differences over the bill, the Irish border and citizens' rights are resolved.\n\n\"We want fair, orderly negotiations, minimising disruption and giving as much certainty as possible - so both sides benefit,\" the manifesto said. \"We believe it is necessary to agree to the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within the two years allowed.\"\n\nAll Conservative lawmakers - whether they voted to leave the EU or remain at last year's referendum - will be bound by policies contained in the manifesto. This will make it harder for Tories to rebel against key parts of Ms May's strategy.\n\nThe focus on winning back sovereignty from the EU means the manifesto undermines speculation in some quarters that Ms May will soften her ambitions for Brexit if returned to power.\n\nBy maintaining an uncompromising line, Tories are hoping to dispel any complacency among their voters. Ms May's party is as many as 20 points ahead of their nearest rival, Labour, in opinion polls.\n\nThe risk, though, is that her counterparts in the other EU 27 members remember the rhetoric of the campaign trail and hold it against her.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, for example, had a warning of her own for Ms May.\n\nBritain, she said on Wednesday, will be made to pay a price if it limits immigration from the region after 2019.

As the 19-nation eurozone has returned to growth and inflation increased - overshooting the target in February before falling back in March and April - calls from politicians and economists in some countries have grown for an end to the easy-money policy.\n\nFinancial markets have closely watched the carefully-weighed language of ECB statements for any hint as to when it could begin \"tapering\" (winding down) its bond-buying, a step policymakers say must come before any rise in interest rates.\n\nAttention has so far focused on the council's assessment of the \"balance of risks\" to growth in the euro area, which ECB President Mario Draghi has in recent months maintained remain \"tilted to the downside\" even as the outlook has brightened. Other members of the governing council disagree, with the accounts noting that in April \"some members considered that the risks to real GDP could now be characterised as broadly balanced\".\n\nIf conditions continue to improve, \"due consideration would need to be given to adjusting the present formulation of the Governing Council's forward guidance,\" its regular statements about the future course of monetary policy.\n\nIn his press conferences, Mr Draghi has long maintained a formula promising interest rates \"at present or lower levels\" if needed to react to an economic shock.\n\nThe debate on the governing council is now whether to eliminate the reference to possible lower interest rates, which observers would see as a hint that an announcement on winding down bond-buying was around the corner.\n\nWhile the ECB is \"more upbeat\" about growth, \"critically this has not translated yet into a change of assessment for the inflation outlook,\" analyst Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight commented. \"It could be touch and go as to whether the ECB could move to a more balanced policy stance at its June meeting,\" he added.\n\nWhen the bank does eventually change its policy, \"communication should be adjusted in a very gradual and cautious manner,\" governing council members agreed.\n\n\"Premature and unwarranted\" removal of its support to the economy could nip the recovery in the bud, along with the bank's chances of reaching its just-below-2-per cent inflation target, they added.

The US$110.5 million price tag includes the buyer's premium.\n\nAt least 14 works from the Brooklyn-born artist were on sale at Christie's and Sotheby's this week.\n\nThe subject of much of his work - ordeals endured by blacks in America - is finding renewed resonance in the wake of nationwide US protests since 2014 about the shootings of unarmed black men by police.\n\nRival auction house Christie's sold Basquiat's \"La Hara\" - a 1981 acrylic and oil-stick of an angry-looking New York police officer - for US$35 million on Wednesday, eclipsing its US$22-28 million estimate.\n\nPablo Picasso holds the world record for the most expensive piece of art ever sold at auction.

The new company is wholly owned by the government.\n\n\"Expertise, supply chains, customer lines, finance, R&D infrastructure and more need to be developed,\" said Paul Sullivan, a Middle East expert at Georgetown University. \"These are not things you can start overnight. They will need lots of outside help at first, but with the right training and education, investments and business development it is possible.\"\n\nMr Trump is visiting Saudi Arabia this week on his first overseas trip as president. Executives from Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Honeywell International are some of the companies due to send executives to Riyadh with Mr Trump for a business summit.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the top purchaser of US weapons, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It has switched the focus of its military spending to more-offensive programmes, including items intended to boost the attacking capabilities of warplanes such as precision air-to-ground missiles and advanced guidance systems, according to a study by IHS Jane's.\n\n\"While the kingdom is one of the world's top five spenders on security and defence overall, only around 2 per cent of our military procurement is domestic,\" deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is also the country's defence minister, said in the statement.\n\nThe company is part of Prince Mohammed's plan to wean the Saudi economy off its reliance on revenue from oil exports by 2030. The wealth fund said SAMI will directly contribute around 14 billion riyals (S$5.2 billion) to the Saudi gross domestic product by 2030, invest more than 6 billion riyals in research and development \"and create over 40,000 jobs, many of which will be in the engineering and technical fields\".\n\nUnder Prince Mohammed's Vision 2030, 50 per cent of Saudi Arabia's military \"procurement spending will be localised\", PIF said.

Fast forward to 2017, and she has a handful of singles to her name, some of which have made it to Billboard's Hot 100 and feature collaborations with international names.\n\nLast year, she released Blow Your Mind (Mwah), a catchy dance pop song that helped her break into the US market. Then in January this year, her name popped up in US charts again with EDM hit-maker Martin Garrix's song Scared To Be Lonely, which featured her distinctively deep and throaty vocals. The song also peaked at second place in several dance charts in Europe.\n\nOne of the songs on her debut, eponymous album, which will be released on June 2, will feature perhaps her most exciting collaboration yet - with Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.\n\n\"That was really exciting for me but also very scary - working with someone so inspiring and such an amazing artist and someone I've looked up to,\" the 21-year-old gushes during an interview at JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach earlier this month. She later performed five songs at an intimate showcase there.\n\n\"I feel very lucky to have worked with someone so big and so inspiring so early on in my career - and someone I've learnt a lot from.\"\n\nAs with most of her already-released songs, the upcoming album will revolve \"a lot around love and loss and heartbreak\", she shares. \"I guess that's where I am right now and I feel like I owe it to myself and my fans to be as honest as possible and as much as an open book.\"\n\nLipa describes her music as \"dark pop\". Which, to her, means essentially pop songs with other influences such as hip hop.\n\n\"It's really about making a song you can dance to but also when you listen to the lyrics, you will find something that is quite heartfelt and sad,\" she explains, adding that it is sort of like \"dance crying\".\n\nShe notes: \"I really admire the honesty and truthfulness in being able to talk about sad experiences and finding inspiration from darkness.\"\n\nThe daughter of a musician, Lipa was exposed to music from a young age. When her family moved from London to Kosovo in her early teens, she realised how much she missed performing (based on her experiences at theatre school which she had attended on weekends).\n\n\"I wanted to really pursue (music as a career) but there weren't enough opportunities there - and I couldn't do it on a global scale,\" she offers. \"So I said to my parents I was going to go back to London at 15 and go back to theatre school and keep doing more music and post more covers.\n\n\"When I decided that I was going to move away from home so young ... That was a defining moment for me,\" she adds. \"It was at that point where I realised I was the only person to go out there and get it and it helped me really set my intentions on my goal and not lose sight of that. And that is what I essentially did.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the opening of the Singapore Pavilion in the Venice Biennale last week, he banged on the janggu (Korean drum) while his team members carried out a traditional procession to launch his 17-metre Phinisi ship. It involved spinning rocks and circling the vessel three times.\n\nZai, 52, said he was channelling a spirit of Dapunta Hyang, the 7th century ruler of South-east Asia, to partake in the blessing ceremony. The historical figure was responsible for the spread of Buddhism in the region. However, little is known of Dapunta Hyang today, prompting Zai to focus his decades-long research on the forgotten maharaja.\n\nZai is not alone in his interest in forgotten histories, rituals and traditions. As it turned out, several Venice Biennale artists have also turned to these themes - an antidote perhaps for these anxious, uncertain times.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant unlimited access?\n\nBecome a premium member in 2 minutes to unlock all content, and more.\n\nMonthly recurring\n\nS$9.90\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nsave 50%\n\nYearly recurring\n\nS$4.95\n\n/\n\nmonth\n\nBilled yearly\n\n118.8\n\nS$59.40\n\nUnlock premium\n\nCancel anytime\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Lifestyle\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nNCSS rallies partners to better engage volunteers\n\nApr 12, 2023 05:01 PM\n\nThe Social Kitchen sets up shop at Bank of Singapore\n\nApr 04, 2023 07:23 PM\n\nRunning towards a zero-waste future\n\nApr 02, 2023 04:12 PM\n\nCMC\u00a0Markets partners Sophia Women to drive financial literacy for women\n\nMar 15, 2023 05:47 PM\n\nWhat is corporate purpose?\n\nMar 15, 2023 04:24 PM\n\nDocumenting yesteryear\u2019s retailers\n\nNov 24, 2022 05:30 PM\n\nDesign solutions for unusual home layouts\n\nNov 17, 2022 05:00 PM\n\nRECOMMENDED", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/7e8f7571d965094ee18a30e45a3d7b58517bc1e59a558843cf86e2f97141f985?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Zai Kuning (centre, seated) bangs the janggu (drum) while his team members perform a ship-launching ritual at the opening of the Singapore Pavilion at the Venice Biennale."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/8639aba26213cc5a95c6ad204062fcd661234f5a7760966449bbc3bd3ededbfc?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "At the Russian Pavilion, Grisha Bruskin's sprawling multimedia installation creates a picture of a world under constant surveillance."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/e272c369d998c7f2def8efc690e1d00b76841606e21014b94a5dced5adacd80b?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "At the Italian Pavilion, artist Roberto Cuoghi has installed dozens of Christ-like sculptures placed on ancient crosses or futuristic rooms - a statement on man's need to find meaning through spirituality through the ages despite the progress of science."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/d5032feb06486284aa965d022ff5bacb1d06fd3fa0894519dcb68f9c1b67ed26?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Damien Hirst's Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable is an elaborate hoax in which he claims to have salvaged priceless artefacts from an ancient shipwreck, But the so-called treasures include a Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Transformer sculptures covered in coral."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/e180e5df3a75d51fb7774056c55a25ef1a63cc308cba80778e269945a95e7a9b?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Damien Hirst's Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable is an elaborate hoax in which he claims to have salvaged priceless artefacts from an ancient shipwreck, But the so-called treasures include a Mickey Mouse, Goofy and Transformer sculptures covered in coral."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c453c4c8c6b4051afb63084c6cc72ac44cdbea4529db95677c8663a24aab844a?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Tracey Moffatt explores the migrant experience through her extraordinary photos and videos."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/18574940004e5e29e5782411623d420048028597c0e5bf3d79a44f0cca6f38fb?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "At the Hong Kong Pavilion, Samson Young pokes fun at the popularity of 1980s \"charity singles\" such as We Are The World and Do They Know It's Christmas?."}, {"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/14667bfe6b2e30210c600b3408f19cee18b3503e9942bc5f071e82422179a5ab?q=20&w=3&h=2&f=webp", "alt_text": "Helmi Yusof"}]}

As Mr King sees it, as long as countries such as the United States and Britain continue to run large and persistent trade deficits while countries such as China and Germany continue to run large and persistent trade surpluses, the global economy and the global financial system will remain fundamentally unstable and susceptible to another crisis.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in International\n\nUK pledges \u00a370 million to Singapore\u2019s green energy push in South-east Asia\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:29 PM\n\nEU to push for deal with US, to avoid prohibitive tariff\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nSovereign wealth funds fear missing China tech boom, survey says\n\nJul 14, 2025 09:05 AM\n\nBYD aims to triple Saudi footprint after Tesla enters market\n\nJul 14, 2025 04:20 PM\n\nThailand eyes Middle East market to make up for Chinese tourists\n\nJul 14, 2025 03:55 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nThailand mulls zero duty for more US goods to win tariff deal\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:07 PM\n\nChina exports beat forecasts in June after US tariff truce\n\nJul 14, 2025 12:41 PM\n\nRECOMMENDED", "images": []}

The US administration's protectionist policies and softer data have been the primary drivers.\"\n\nStill, the fall was not all-encompassing.

While it might appear impossible at the moment, there are early signs pointing to leading cities having a \"car-lite\" future. Today we are seeing commuters walking or cycling more, and electric bicycles and kick scooters becoming common modes of personal transportation.\n\nTechnology also means we can now plan our travel, share trips and achieve much higher levels of efficiency and service without the need for more cars. The car-lite movement is seeking to shift city-state transportation towards a more integrated, greener, co-sharing model with citizen-focused mobility solutions.\n\nImplementing policies that reduce car dependency and increase car-free areas is becoming more common. This is evident especially in Europe where major cities such as Madrid, Hamburg, Copenhagen and Brussels have all banned cars from some inner city areas, and are building more bicycle lanes to connect the city with the suburbs. While Singapore is a leader in urban transportation mobility, it still devotes a significant amount of resources to building roads. As of 2013, roads account for 12 per cent of Singapore's land area, only a little under housing, which takes up 14 per cent, according to official data.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nWant the full story?\n\nBecome a premium member to unlock this article, and more.\n\nPick a plan\n\nAlready have a subscription?\n\nLog in\n\nmore in Columns\n\nWhy Americans and Europeans disagree about globalisation\n\nJul 14, 2025 05:23 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nTrump is sowing confusion in the markets\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nDoes working from home kill company culture?\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nWhy Buldak ramen is an US$8 billion brand\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nOn Lego, love and friendship\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nCompanies are getting worse at\u00a0laying people off\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:41 PM\n\nIssue 154: Temasek\u2019s SIA burden; MAS evolves climate investing approach\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 PM", "images": []}

Still, a couple of wine writers have recently tried to make the case that bad wine should be tolerated, if not embraced. They argue that it can't be entirely bad if it appeals to large numbers of people. Drinking bad wine encourages the love of all wine, and, really, nothing is harmful about bad wine, so why not live and let live?\n\nI'm all for peaceful coexistence. I would never fault people for the wines they choose to drink, or for not making good wine a priority in their lives. But if you do care about drinking good wine, then you ought to take serious issue with these arguments, as I do.\n\nJust as important, these articles suggest that wine critics should not make reasoned aesthetic judgments about good and bad. Instead, critics should encourage drinking wine of any kind on the theory that wine culture will ultimately benefit from the quantity consumed rather than the quality.\n\nAside from its patronising nature, such a position conflates the role of the critic, whose aim is to encourage judgment and discernment, with an industry mouthpiece, whose role is to encourage sales. Critics, and all wine journalists, should owe no allegiance to the wine industry, nor accept the notion that consumption of any wine achieves a sort of ultimate good.\n\nThe best way to improve the quality of what you drink is to think of wine as food. Simply applying the same aesthetic, medical, ethical and moral judgments to wine that many people do to food, as I suggested, results in drinking better wine.\n\nCoincidentally, a few weeks after my piece, the Opinion pages of The New York Times published \"Ignore the Snobs, Drink the Cheap, Delicious Wine\".\n\nIn it, writer Bianca Bosker made the case that wine lovers should not shun \"processed wines\", products made of industrially farmed grapes, which are manipulated and tailored to fit predetermined specifications based on audience research.\n\n\"These maligned bottles have a place,\" Ms Bosker wrote. \"The time has come to learn to love unnatural wines.\"\n\nThe piece was adapted from her entertaining book, Cork Dork: A Wine-Fueled Adventure Among the Obsessive Sommeliers, Big Bottle Hunters, and Rogue Scientists Who Taught Me to Live for Taste.\n\nMs Bosker argued that applying technology to wine has democratised it by improving its quality and making what she called good wine accessible to more people at lower prices.\n\n\"Thanks to pumps and powders, drinkers who can't splurge no longer have to settle for plonk,\" she wrote. \"The gap between fine wine and commercial wine is shrinking as producers use chemical shortcuts not only to avoid blatant flaws, but also to mimic high-end bottles.\"\n\nThis argument is wrong in almost every way.\n\nFirst of all, additives and manipulation didn't improve the general level of wine. Science did. For centuries, nobody understood how winemaking worked. Fermentation was largely a mystery, as were the reasons that wine spoiled.\n\nScientific breakthroughs revealed the role of yeast in fermentation and explained how bacteria converted harsh malic acid into softer lactic acid, which makes many red wines and some whites easier to drink. Science uncovered the pernicious effects of unwanted microbial activity in wine, the harm that comes from prolonged exposure to air and warmth and the benefits of scrupulous attention to cleanliness in winemaking. This all resulted in fewer flawed wines.\n\nTechnological improvements were beneficial, too. Refrigeration helped to make fresh, fruity white wines, as did the wide availability of stainless steel.\n\nYet the technology for manipulating textures and flavours, and for taking away alcohol, hasn't improved wine. It's just made it more formulaic, like soft drinks and other beverages, by streamlining production for consistency and stability. It's like saying the development of Wonder Bread made bread better.\n\nAdvancements for eliminating flaws in wine, like volatile acidity, have not improved. Unpalatable wines are just less bad. There's a difference.\n\nFinally, the notion that manipulating cheap wine to mimic high-end bottles benefits consumers is laughable. Knockoff wines sell, but the American wine industry also craves critical approval.\n\nImitation high-end wines may satisfy many people, but they are commodities, no more worthy of applause than the imitation designer bags sold on Canal Street.\n\nEsther Mobley of The San Francisco Chronicle tried to split the difference. The wine world is not divided between the extremes of processed \"Frankenwine\" and natural wine, which Ms Bosker's piece called \"the 'it' staple of trendy tables\".\n\nMs Mobley correctly made the point that between these extremes lies a multitude of wines that are all over the processing spectrum.\n\nShe suggests that people should not liken the additives in wine to those in food because they are not harmful to the health, certainly not on a par with eating chickens \"jacked up on antibiotics their entire lives\".\n\nShe does not refer to farming practices though, which can leave low levels of pesticide residues in wine. The verdict is not clear on how harmful these might be to humans, though no doubt exists that such chemicals are harmful to the vineyard workers who must apply them.\n\nMs Bosker and Ms Mobley found common ground in their hope that processed, manipulated wines would serve as gateway bottles for the next generation of wine lovers.\n\nThis is a position that I have never understood. I don't believe that the wine industry cares about \"oenophiles\", a word that is as snobbish as it sounds. It doesn't produce millions of bottles of bad cheap wine because it wants to develop knowledgeable, judicious wine drinkers. It makes junk wine because it sells like junk food.\n\nI take issue with people who ought to know better, those who confuse the differences between bad and good wines, and critics and industry promoters.\n\nAnyone who is in the business of examining wine critically needs to actually be critical, not simply validate consumer choices, and looking at wine critically means understanding the chasm between mass-produced wine products and wines that are an expression of a place, a people and an aesthetic.\n\nAbout a month ago, Batya Ungar-Sargon, a journalist who was writing about this wine tempest for the VinePair website, asked how I would feel if the great wines of the world, often scarce and expensive, could be analysed by laboratories and duplicated in quantity.\n\nI said I thought it would be horrible. Yes, wines that few people are able to taste would instead be widely available, their complexities sampled by many rather than a privileged few.\n\nYet such reproductions would completely change the experience. Good wine is, by nature, fleeting, mysterious, ever-changing, subject to the imperfect, unpredictable nuances of weather, place and human judgment. It changes continually, reacting to temperature and touch, food and mood, its years in the bottle and its minutes in the glass. It is beyond reproduction.\n\nIt's the unknown that makes fine wine, not the elimination of flaws or the popularity of flavours.

Add a protectionist / isolationist tone to what remains of the policy agenda and America's star appears to be fading faster than either the optimists or pessimists thought possible.\"\n\nEquities\n\nThe Singapore stock market showed some resilience when it shed 35 points but recovered to close at 3,221.66 for a net loss of only 2.44 points. In the broader market, 275 counters closed lower, compared to 167 gainers.\n\nThere were 13 stocks down for every two up at 9.02am on Thursday, an unusually lopsided opening for the market.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Hang Seng fell 0.62 per cent, or 157.11 points, to close at 25,136.52.\n\nRisk owners may have been particularly quick to unload given the strong rallies since Mr Trump's election in November 2016.\n\n\"The latest crisis hitting the Trump administration has provided investors with an excuse to take profits on markets that are already trading at at least 12-month highs,\" Credit Suisse head of South-east Asia research for private banking Kum Soek Ching said. \"Allegations of the Brazilian President's role in a cover-up scheme also stoked fears of renewed political crisis in Brazil, adding to the risk-off mood in the Asian markets.\"\n\nCurrencies and rates\n\nIn the currencies market, the US dollar took a beating, falling against other key currencies.\n\nThe greenback was trading at 112.1 yen at 8pm, coming off from 112.05 yen in New York. The US dollar fell to 0.8997 euro, and 0.7727 against the British pound.\n\n\"Sustained Trump-related political woes (impeachment chatter) dragged Eurozone/US equities lower, depressed the US Treasury curve further and took the US dollar-Japanese yen below 111.00 as the greenback retreated against its G10 counterparts and the yen gained universally on a safety bid,\" OCBC analyst Emmanuel Ng observed.\n\n\"On other fronts however, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar also underperformed across the board as risk aversion began to materialise.\"\n\nAlthough the US dollar has weakened, significantly smaller risk appetites could limit how much Asian currencies can strengthen against the dollar, Mr Ng said.\n\n\"Contagion on the risk appetite front may thus increasingly put a floor on US dollar-Asia,\" he said.\n\nBut economists do not see any major change in fundamentals, even for the US economy.\n\nBank of Singapore chief economist Richard Jerram noted that the US Federal Reserve has not been depending on expectations of big changes in fiscal policy to set interest rates.\n\n\"Rate hike expectations have understandably dipped, but this just looks like a short-term knee-jerk reaction,\" Mr Jerram said. \"The Fed is still likely to hike rates again in mid-June. US dollar has naturally sold off along with the shift in the expectations for the Fed, but we do not expect this to run.\"\n\nMark McFarland, Union Bancaire Privee's chief economist for Asia, highlighted that US consumer confidence remains relatively strong, while earnings-friendly tax cuts are still making their way through the legislative process regardless of what happens with President Trump. Even if the Fed delays its pace of interest rate increases, that might be good for Asia.\n\n\"What's interesting in the relationship between US interest rates and emerging markets is that when interest rates are not expected to rise quickly, that's usually good for emerging markets in Asia,\" he said.\n\nGold\n\nGold eased slightly on profit taking on Thursday, coming off 0.17 per cent to US$1,258.76 just after 5pm.\n\nCIMB economist Song Seng Wun, however, said that gold has been relatively resilient given all the uncertainties and volatility.\n\n\"Gold, all through the last few months, has held up well whether there's risk on or risk off, because there's still enough of fear out there for people to hold on to gold as an insurance policy, even through the French election,\" Mr Song said.\n\n\"Enough things on the economic and political fronts give people that nagging fear that I should still have a bit stashed away in gold,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/supermarkets-pushing-fresh-food-boundaries", "site_title": "Supermarkets pushing fresh food boundaries", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSupermarkets pushing fresh food boundaries\n\nWinning grocers understand that fresh food is where shoppers will be won or lost.\n\nPublished Thu, May 18, 2017 \u00b7 09:50 PM\n\nSupermarkets\n\nFollow\n\nIT'S tough to get ahead in the grocery business today. Shoppers are disloyal, discounters create mounting price pressures and customers demand more in quality and service.\n\nThis drama is playing out in many countries, but we decided to take a closer look at the situation in Australia, where we surveyed more than 2,500 supermarket shoppers. Our findings were unsettling: More than 80 per cent of respondents told us they routinely cross-shop and spend almost 40 per cent of their grocery budgets outside of their primary supermarkets.\n\nTo win shoppers, grocers need to lower prices while raising quality and service, and they need to adapt costs to fuel these investments. But earning customer loyalty also requires a differentiated proposition, beyond price - and all signs point to fresh food. In our survey, high-quality fresh food ranked at the top, tied with price, as the most important criterion for choosing a grocery store. Fresh food sales have grown 2.5 times faster than sales of dry groceries in Australia.\n\nShoppers told us that buying fresh food is the main reason for 65 per cent of visits to their primary store. During those trips, they typically also buy non-fresh items. So the prize for getting the fresh proposition right extends beyond that department, having a halo effect.\n\nGlobal retailers are investing in a range of tactics. Many have created in-store theatres to showcase their fresh offerings, with chefs preparing sushi, for example, or baking bread from scratch. Others offer locally sourced or organic produce. In addition, winning companies are adding ready-to-eat salads and other prepared meals, and employing specialists to answer shoppers' questions about such matters as cheese pairings. Others have rebuilt their supply chains to deliver fresh food from farms to stores, in record time.\n\nBut while the fresh food section may hold great promise for differentiation, it has traditionally been less pro\ufb01table than other departments, due to higher costs in shrinkage, store labour, rent and merchandising. How, then, do supermarkets invest for differentiation without hurting their pro\ufb01t margins?\n\nThe best grocers thoughtfully de\ufb01ne a clear strategy for balancing customer differentiation and profit imperatives. With an average of 820 fresh SKUs (stock keeping units) in each store, US discounter Trader Joe's simple, low-price, high-quality selection is designed to keep its costs low. By comparison, Whole Foods Market stocks an average of more than 3,000 fresh SKUs. This broad assortment is designed to deliver high sales. While these grocers have taken decidedly different routes, both earn high marks for customer advocacy.\n\nAfter de\ufb01ning a strategy, winning grocers understand that they need to break down the silos and ensure highly effective cross-functional collaboration among merchandising, supply chain and store operations.\n\nGrocers also need to take a whole-store view of fresh economics - for example, factoring in the implications of an in-store bakery on total basket size and transaction numbers. Acknowledging that the fresh food department could make less money, the best grocers also identify the decisions that will help them beat the odds, such as when to bake the doughnuts to take advantage of optimal store traf\ufb01c. Many of these decisions can only be made at the local level, so the head of\ufb01ce needs to empower local store managers.\n\nBased on our research and work with companies, we identi\ufb01ed four areas of focus for any grocer hoping to make traction in fresh food. Let's look at them one by one.\n\nFOCUS AND LOCALISE\n\nA wide product range builds credibility with the customer, but it will increase the store's supply chain, in-store labour and shrinkage costs. The answer is to pick the spots to differentiate. Beyond the core 50 to 100 items, localise your assortment. The best retailers now employ advanced analytics techniques to mine basket and loyalty data, to understand where to make the smart trade-offs in assortment.\n\nGrocers will need to work with suppliers to ensure produce is delivered in the right quantities to match the velocity of sales. They should also install \ufb01xtures that are best suited for the pace of turnover. Trader Joe's \ufb01xtures are narrow but well stocked, creating a sense of abundance without contributing to waste.\n\nWinning means allocating your best people to fresh food, providing them with the right tools and training, and rewarding them accordingly. An important component: Invest in a dedicated training team that travels to stores to build employee's capabilities and identify improvement opportunities.\n\nWhole Foods has set the standard in store labour by paying above-average salaries to attract and retain the best people, operating its stores as a series of product teams and providing incentives based on team and individual performance, down to the lowest-level employees. It also collects daily data on store and team sales, product costs and store pro\ufb01tability, making that information available to staff to spur continuous improvement.

US International Trade Commission (USITC) staff will hear testimony from both companies and from Bombardier customer Delta in the case.\n\nBoeing alleges that Bombardier's new 100-150 seat CSeries jetliners are being dumped below cost in the US market and are unfairly subsidised by Canadian taxpayers. Delta agreed last year to buy dozens of CSeries planes at a price that Boeing says was well below Bombardier's cost and risks eroding future sales of its 737 and new 737 MAX narrowbodies.\n\nBombardier has countered that the petition would have a serious impact on airlines, innovation and competition in the aerospace industry.\n\nThe case has increased trade tensions between the United States and Canada - along with disputes over Canadian softwood lumber and US milk protein products - as both countries prepare for a possible renegotiation of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) under the \"America First\" trade policy of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Commerce Department is expected to proceed with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy claims, trade lawyers and experts said.\n\n\"Commerce is going to go forward, there's no doubt about it,\" said William Perry, a Seattle-based trade lawyer and a former USITC staff attorney.\n\nThe investigation is the latest to hit Bombardier after Brazil launched a trade dispute against Canada at the World Trade Organisation, similarly alleging unfair competition.\n\nBrazilian officials welcomed the US probe as support to the south America country's claim that Canada's support for Bombardier's CSeries undercuts the market for commercial jets made by Brazilian rival Embraer.\n\nThe Commerce Department investigation into Boeing's claims could be cut short if the USITC rejects it in a vote expected on June 12. If the trade body allows the probe to continue, the department would then need to determine any preliminary anti-subsidy duties by around July 22, with a deadline for preliminary anti-dumping duties around October 3.\n\nThe department last month began collecting duties averaging 20 per cent on imports of Canadian softwood lumber, saying that the product's origin from public land amounted to an unfair government subsidy.\n\nBoeing said in its petition that Bombardier, determined to win a key order from Delta after losing a competition at United Airlines, had offered its planes to the airline at an \"absurdly low\" US$19.6 million each, well below what it described as the aircraft's production cost of US$33.2 million.\n\nBombardier has dismissed Boeing's US$19.6 million figure as \"absurd\". Boeing's 737-700 model, similar in size to the larger CSeries CS300 jet, has a current list price of US$82.4 million, with the new 737-MAX 7 priced at US$92.2 million. Sales discounts from list prices are typically 40 per cent to 50 per cent in the industry.\n\nBoeing has said it competed for last year's Delta order against the CSeries CS100 with used 717s, which it no longer makes, and used jets from Embraer since Delta was only ready to pay a low price and wanted smaller jets than its more modern 737.\n\nIn April 2016, Bombardier won the Delta order, its biggest yet, for 75 CS100 jets, worth an estimated US$5.6 billion based on the list price of about US$71.8 million.\n\nIn its complaint against Bombardier, Boeing argued that the CSeries programme would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a US$2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. If the Commerce Department's investigation finds that duties on the Bombardier aircraft are warranted, those would likely be imposed on Delta.

GEM is a group of arts and entertainment companies with offices in the United States and China.\n\nGEM, through its subsidiary Fei County Wonder Stone Characteristic Town Development, secured an additional 10-year operating rights to Wonder Stone Park, a historical park showcasing uniquely formed, naturally occurring stone boulders and rocks native to the Shandong region in China.\n\nGEM, which owns an 80 per cent stake in Fei County Wonder Stone, now holds a 50-year operating rights in the park. It also owns a hotel situated in the park.\n\nCommenting on the rationale to raise Imperium Crown's acquisition stake in GEM, its executive chairman and chief executive officer Wan Jinn Woei said the park is an attractive new project for Imperium Crown, \"given the rising popularity of cultural tourism in China and the park's well-developed infrastructure and amenities\".\n\n\"Increasing our stake in GEM reflects our confidence in the park's tourism potential and also our intention to deepen our involvement in the operations and assets under GEM. This allows us to better anticipate and address any risks arising from the localisation of operations there,\" he added.\n\nThe long-stop date for the proposed acquisition has been extended to end-Septemberand the purchase consideration for the group's enlarged stake in GEM shall be funded by a combination of proceeds from capital fund-raising and/or bank financing, and the company's internal funds.\n\nImperium Crown will convene an extraordinary general meeting \"in due course\" to seek shareholders' approval for the proposed acquisition.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Singaporeans surveyed see the risk of greater trade barriers as the biggest source of domestic uncertainty.\n\nBut Mr Issel said economic growth has not been derailed by the threats of trade protectionism, following the Brexit vote and the US elections.\n\nClients have been advised to tweak portfolios by reducing exposure to regions such as Asean - which may be squeezed by tensions between major trade nations - and to hedge against currency positions. But making larger changes to their portfolio would be \"too early\" at this point, he said.\n\nThe Swiss private bank also warns that while investors are planning to shift more aggressively into cash, according to the UBS poll, that strategy is expected to yield negative returns amid rising global inflation.\n\nThe survey showed 77 per cent of Singapore millionaires polled by UBS said cash offers security, on par with the global average of 75 per cent. Eddie Gan, UBS's market head for Singapore at the wealth management arm, said Singapore clients' have less than half of their holdings in cash, but it remains \"higher than what we would prefer\".\n\nMr Issel said: \"About a year ago, people were fighting deflation. But the tables are turning, including in Japan. It's not hyperinflation, but it's coming up.\n\n\"It's the same amount of cash, but it doesn't buy you the same number of beer bottles.\"\n\nNearly 80 per cent of Singaporean millionaires are confident in their ability to assess financial risks, showing more confidence than their Hong Kong and Japan counterparts. But it reflects how Singaporean investors believe the domestic market would be a safe option in a time of flux.\n\nMillionaires in Singapore are also among the most likely in the world to view technology positively, holding the view that innovations such as Big Data, artificial intelligence, and robotics, can make the world a better place.\n\nAmong Singaporean millionaires, 85 per cent of them believe that democratic elections contribute to stability. Yet, over 80 per cent believe stronger, more powerful leaders are most effective over the long term - the highest figure globally.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The problem for landlords is finding someone to replace them.\n\nA growing number of unoccupied older properties caused the overall office vacancy rate to climb to 5.8 per cent at the end of the first quarter from 3.9 per cent a year earlier, according to data compiled by Deloitte LLP. That was the biggest increase since 2009.\n\n\"The demand for new space is still there; the demand for second-hand space isn't necessarily as hot,\" said Shaun Dawson, a research manager at the firm.\n\nInvestors pulled back from London real estate immediately after last year's Brexit vote, fearing that the UK's departure from the European Union would cause a collapse in demand for office space. While high-profile lease agreements by companies including Apple Inc and Deutsche Bank AG have helped ease concerns since the June 23 vote, the latest data from Deloitte show there are limits to the market's recovery.\n\nThe amount of office space available to rent climbed 36 per cent in 2016 and by a further 19 per cent in the first quarter, Deloitte said in a report published on Wednesday. That's almost entirely made up of space that has become available as a result of companies downsizing or moving offices, the data show.\n\nUBS, for example, completed a large office move last year, vacating several older buildings in favour of a single new London headquarters.\n\nThe amount of office space under construction in central London fell 6 per cent to 13.1 million square feet in the six months through March, the first drop recorded by the biannual survey since September 2014. That was after developers completed 3.9 million square feet of new office space in the period, the most Deloitte has recorded since 2004.\n\n\"We have started to see developers hold off,\" Mr Dawson said, citing increasing construction costs and weaker demand because of political uncertainty. \"We are feeling that post-Brexit blip.\" British Land Co, the UK's second-largest real estate investment trust, committed to redeveloping 100 Liverpool Street before it had secured a tenant after the building's main occupier, UBS, vacated the property at the end of 2016.\n\n\"There is going to be uncertainty ahead and it's going to be very hard to call,\" chief executive officer Chris Grigg said Wednesday on Bloomberg TV when asked about Brexit. \"There's going to be continued polarisation: if you've got something that is average, I think you're going to struggle.\"\n\nBritish Land published its full-year earnings on Wednesday. The landlord fell as much as 2.5 per cent, the most since March 30, in London trading.\n\nBLOOMBERG\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nCenturion shares jump more than 5% as group anticipates \u2018significant increase\u2019 in H1 profit\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:52 PM\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM", "images": []}

Petrol and distillate stocks also dropped.\n\n\"A triumvirate of draws for crude, gasoline and distillates is a supportive influence for prices,\" said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.\n\nEven as inventories are drawing down, US crude production has climbed 10 per cent since mid-2016 to 9.3 million barrels per day, close to levels from top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. That has kept inventories relatively high, with many analysts saying Opec's efforts have not yet borne fruit.\n\nThe Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (Opec) and other key producers will gather in Vienna on May 25 to decide whether to extend output cuts of 1.8 million bpd that started in the first half of 2017. Riyadh and Moscow say they should be extended until March 2018.\n\n\"The recent stance of Saudi Arabia and Russia on supporting an extension of the production cut deal by another nine months is favouring oil prices,\" said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy's Global Gas Analytics in London.\n\nHe cautioned, however, that the market may expect deeper cuts to keep prices elevated, particularly with US production still rising.\n\nThe EIA forecasts US production to average nearly 10 million bpd by the end of 2018.\n\nJefferies analysts lowered their oil price forecasts due to the rise in US production, cutting its Brent price estimate for the second half of 2017 to US$59 per barrel from US$61 previously.\n\nLibya also plans to restart production.
