The survey also revealed new orders slowed and export orders stalled.\n\nThe private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers'index, focusing on smaller companies, made even sorrier reading for global firms reliant on China's giant market for everything from consumer items, to cars and commodities. It showed conditions deteriorated for a 15th straight month.\n\nChina posted economic growth of 6.7 per cent in the first quarter - its slowest since 2009, and there are nagging doubts about the authorities' ability to engineer a turnaround without fuelling debt.\n\nWhereas speculation has hardened in recent weeks that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a policy meeting on June 14-15, some Fed policymakers have said they remain concerned about uncertainties in China and a possible British exit from the European Union in a vote later this month.\n\n\"Globally growth is still slow, so while the Fed is keeping an eye on inflation in the US we don't believe policy makers will hike rates in June,\" Ms Lim said.\n\nAn article in the People's Daily last month sparked speculation that Beijing is shifting to a more cautious policy stance.\n\n\"Today's PMI figure rules out the possibility of imminent broad-based monetary policy easing\" in China, ANZ economists said in a note to clients.\n\nIn Japan, factories grappling to recover from the earthquakes in the southern manufacturing hub of Kumamoto were also knocked by a sharp contraction in external demand.\n\nThat showed up in the Markit/Nikkei Japan PMI, which fell to 47.7 in May on a seasonally adjusted basis - the fastest contraction in three years - from 48.2 in April.\n\nThe yen's recovery to an 18-month high against the dollar last month has also clouded the outlook for Japan's exporters.\n\nAnd the fragility of domestic demand is expected to force Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to announce later on Wednesday a delay a planned sales tax increase.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, conditions were patchy at best.\n\nEven in India, the world's fastest growing big economy, manufacturing activity increased at a tepid pace as output growth softened for the second month in a row.\n\nSouth Korea's manufacturing activity improved slightly last month, with the Nikkei/Markit PMI at 50.1 from 50.0 in April, with new export orders up a little. More alarmingly, separate data showed South Korea's exports unexpectedly fell 6.0 per cent last month with shipments to China, its biggest customer, contracting 9.1 per cent on-year.\n\nIn Taiwan manufacturing activity deteriorated for the second month in a row with new orders falling at their fastest pace in three months.\n\nAnalysts say weak global demand will continue to pressure corporate earnings and overall economic activity in the region.\n\n\"Earnings growth has peaked out, because (Japanese) companies are no longer benefiting from a weak yen. If profits continue to fall, companies could put the brakes on capex,\" Hiroaki Muto, economist at Tokai Tokyo Research Center, said.\n\nAustralia, at least, was faring better, with data released earlier in the day showing the economy accelerating at its fastest annual pace in three years in the first quarter.\n\n\"Looking ahead, while we expect a modest improvement in global demand to support Asian manufacturing in the coming quarters, the pace of recovery is likely to be gradual,\" said Krystal Tan, Asia economists at Capital Economics.\n\nREUTERS\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nInternational\n\nIndia's cooling inflation prompts rate cut calls\n\nJul 15, 2025 06:11 PM\n\nThailand to pick rate-cut advocate Vitai Ratanakorn as central bank chief\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:23 AM\n\nChinese firms rush to buy Nvidia H20 AI chips as sales set to resume\n\nJul 15, 2025 12:49 PM\n\nChina\u2019s economy slows as consumers tighten belts, US tariff risks mount\n\nJul 15, 2025 11:25 AM\n\nSuspended Thai PM asks court for more time to respond to ethics case\n\nJul 15, 2025 04:21 PM\n\nMalaysia\u2019s trade growth target achievable despite US tariffs: minister\n\nJul 15, 2025 03:23 PM\n\nMalaysia has not found any evidence yet of illicit chip smuggling, minister says\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:43 PM\n\nAustralia and China call for more dialogue, cooperation at leaders\u2019 meeting\n\nJul 15, 2025 01:12 PM", "images": []}

But it is expected to pursue the kinds of licensing deals it negotiates with companies that make Windows-powered computers.\n\nCreating a common platform for a wide range of companies to create and market mixed reality gear promises to bring down prices for altered reality gear while enriching variety in the marketplace.\n\nMicrosoft in March began its first shipments of its HoloLens to application developers, staking its place in what is expected to be an emerging computing platform.\n\nAt a recent Microsoft Build developers' conference, the company showed some of the possibilities for HoloLens - such as giving users a view of Mars that up to now could only be seen by space vehicles, and an inside view of the brain by medical specialists aiming to deal with a cerebral tumour.\n\nAiming to encourage new applications for the device, Microsoft noted that developers can create \"new mixed reality\" with holograms to enable users to see and experience things in new ways.\n\nThe holographic capabilities in the Microsoft gear can open doors for developers to augment tasks from complex surgery to motorcycle design, according to the company.\n\nMarketers predict virtual headsets will soon top wish lists for kids and young adults from Silicon Valley to Hong Kong.

It conceded there were corruption problems in the industry but said these did not justify murdering reporters.\n\n\"He has also, in effect, declared open season to silence the media, both individual journalists and the institution, on the mere perception of corruption,\" the NUJP said in a statement.\n\nThe Philippines is one of the most dangerous nations in the world for journalists, with 176 murdered since a chaotic and corruption-plagued democracy replaced the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos three decades ago.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in his home town of Davao to introduce his cabinet on Tuesday night, Mr Duterte suggested the majority of those victims were partly to blame.\n\n\"Most of those killed, to be frank, have done something. You won't be killed if you don't do anything wrong,\" said Mr Duterte, who will be sworn into office on June 30.\n\nLuis Teodoro, deputy director of the Manila-based Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility, described Mr Duterte's comments as \"distressing\" and said they sent a signal to would-be killers that it was okay to murder in certain circumstances.\n\n\"When you say corrupt journalists can be killed, that is a very clear message,\" Mr Teodoro told AFP.\n\nThe New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned Mr Duterte's remarks.\n\n\"What he has done with these irresponsible comments is give security officials the right to kill for acts that they consider defamation,\" its South-east Asian representative, Shawn Crispin, told AFP from Bangkok.\n\n\"This is one of the most outrageous statements we have ever heard from a president in the Philippines.\" Mr Duterte on Tuesday also raised the case of Jun Pala, a journalist and politician who was murdered in Davao in 2003.\n\nGunmen on a motorcycle shot dead Mr Pala, who was a vocal critic of Mr Duterte.

Revenue fell S$23.2 million in 2015 from S$40 million in 2014. The declines were due to a slump in the construction sector, less upgrading by households, inventory write-offs and discounts given to customers.\n\nFor the half-year, audit firm BDO, engaged to perform certain limited tests on revenue and cost numbers, found that S$4.3 million of revenue in the period should not have been recognised as such.

In the case of the Ise Shima summit, the form and atmosphere of the debate pointed to shifts in the global balance of power.\n\nIt would be wrong to argue simply that the pendulum is swinging back from the East to the West since Japan is an Asian power (albeit an \"honorary Westerner\" in some regards). But the balance of economic power and cultural weight does appear to be moving again in a westerly direction. There was more confidence and cohesiveness among the G-7 leaders during the Ise Shima summit than has been observable in recent years; ever since, in fact, the global financial crisis of 2008 inflicted a savage blow to the world economy and upon the notion of Western supremacy.\n\nJapan provided competent leadership, especially in Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's chairing of the pinnacle meeting of political leaders where he emphasised the three (essentially Western) values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law that bind the G-7 nations together. In so doing, he not only distanced Japan from China - which is in danger of being ostracised for neglect of these values - but also implied that Japan is committed to observance of all three: a triumph of common principle over common ethnicity and geographical location.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Increased economic vigour in South-east Asia might be seen as beneficial for Singapore, the financial hub at its centre. But could it also threaten that hub status?\n\nInvestment is increasingly flowing into regional centres such as Ho Chi Minh City, Manila and Jakarta (not to mention further-flung places such as Hong Kong and Sydney). So when top business leaders arrive in Kuala Lumpur for the World Economic Forum on Asean in June, many will be wondering whether Singapore will be among those to benefit from the birth of the AEC.\n\nThe 2008 global financial crisis continues to impact financial centres such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Increasingly stringent regulatory regimes have added to compliance costs and impacted the growth of the wealth management and financial services sectors. In addition, China's rebalancing of its economy, the world's second largest, has affected the export growth of countries that are highly dependent on Chinese demand for oil, metals, raw materials and machine tools.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Geography and history have left a deep imprint on the country's relations with the continent. The English Channel - that thin stretch of water only 32km wide at its narrowest point - has enabled the UK to avoid foreign invasion and occupation for almost 1,000 years. The UK could long steer clear of deep and permanent engagement on the European mainland, intervening primarily when a single power - whether France, Germany or the Soviet Union - threatened to conquer all of continental Europe.\n\nFollowing World War II, closely allied with the United States and at the hub of the (British) Commonwealth, the UK still aspired to play a world role as an independent state. It thus initially stayed out of both the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Economic Community.\n\nDespite finally entering the EU in 1973, the UK never became fully reconciled to its European vocation. Its relations with the EU remained fraught, notably during the prime ministership of Margaret Thatcher. Then, as, after the Cold War, the rest of the EU forged closer political integration, it increasingly became a semi-detached member, opting out of both the euro and the Schengen Area.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAI is killing the Web.

If last year, the drubbing the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) faced in assembly elections to Bihar and Delhi pointed to its dim future at the national level, the recent elections to four major states have given it a new lease of life. The new optimism has to be tempered with caution as there are three years before the next general election in 2019. Moreover, important elections to state assemblies taking place in 2017 and 2018, closer to the general election, will give a better indication of the way the wind is blowing.\n\nThere were surprises in each of the four major states, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Assam that went to the polls. In Tamil Nadu, J Jayalalithaa, amma or mother to her followers, beat her main rival, the DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), narrowly. In West Bengal, the Trinamool Congress led by Mamata Banerjee won a two-thirds majority. Kerala followed its usual trend of alternating power between the Congress-led UDF (United Democratic Front) and the Communist-led LDF (Left Democratic Front) by voting in the communists after five years of UDF rule. Assam saw the BJP-led coalition coming to power for the first time in the north-east.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAI is killing the Web.

Asia's strength comes in spite of an atmosphere of mediocre global output. But as the region faces strong global headwinds, it must make increased efforts to boost productivity through a recommitment to structural reforms.\n\nNew ADB (Asian Development Bank) research demonstrates that in the absence of stronger efforts at reforms, potential growth - that is, the maximum level of economic output consistent with full employment and stable inflation in the absence of any pickup in the pace of reforms - in many Asian economies is likely to be lower than the period immediately before the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).\n\nWhy is it useful to acknowledge the challenge of declining potential growth? For one thing, when a country's actual growth is below potential it would be appropriate to use monetary and fiscal stimulus to raise the actual growth to be closer to the potential. On the other hand, if actual growth is at or near potential, structural reforms to increase potential should take priority over stimulus by monetary or fiscal policies.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAI is killing the Web.

But with the agenda centring on further integration of the Asia-Pacific tourism market, and how a wider range of industries can leverage tourism, its relevance to Singapore becomes clearer and a little closer to home.\n\nAsean's focus on trade growth often shrouds another critical contributor to its economic development - the increasing intra-regional people flow and the tourism dollars that follow. Latest data from the World Travel and Tourism Council show that travel and tourism directly contributed 4.8 per cent to South-east Asia's gross domestic product, supported 11.2 million jobs and generated US$49 billion in investment in 2014.\n\nHowever, tourism is more than just holidays; it can also be serious business for corporates in the local market. This is certainly true for Singapore, particularly corporate tourism stemming from the meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) sub-sector, which contributes more than 30 per cent of Singapore's total tourism receipts.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in Columns\n\nAI is killing the Web.

Debts totalling \u00a3347 million had driven the company to the edge of the abyss, endangering more than 4,000 British jobs. As one researcher noted at the time: \"In the digital era where 73.4 per cent of music and film are downloaded or bought online, HMV's business model has simply become increasingly irrelevant and unsustainable.\"\n\nTwo years later, not only is HMV still standing but it also has been able to turn a profit from all 140 remaining UK outlets. Recently, it edged out Amazon to become the UK's leading physical music retailer. HMV's return from the brink can largely be credited to cost-cutting measures by restructuring firm Hilco Capital, which bought the company after it entered administration.\n\nBut trimming the fat is only part of the story behind this unlikely turnaround. In addition to capitalising on the vinyl renaissance, HMV has drawn in UK customers with more than 500 in-store signings and performances.

Given the five-year election cycle in India, the event's importance lies in the fact that it's a sort of mid-term report card for the government.\n\nMr Modi has failed to live up to expectations of being a \"big bang\" reformer; instead he seems more of an incremental reformer going forward with a series of \"small bangs\". Despite that, some of his government's achievements are worth highlighting. India's gross domestic product (GDP) for the fiscal year which ended on March 31 was up 7.6 per cent, making it the fastest-growing major economy in the world, overtaking China.\n\nInflation has gone down by almost half compared with a couple of years ago, with food inflation at its lowest in a long time. Mr Modi has had his share of luck with petroleum, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of Indian imports, being priced at historic lows over the past two years. The government has yet to fully pass on this saving on imports to consumers. Instead most of the savings have been used to shore up India's public finances. India's budget deficit has shrunk to 3.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year ending March 31, from 4.4 per cent the previous year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With parliament now in recess and both sides in full-time campaign mode with the finish line on the horizon, European leaders are also beginning to prepare for the prospect of Brexit, potentially the worst reversal for the EU in its more than half century history.\n\nThe central concern in Brussels and European capitals is not just that the UK's departure would weaken the EU, but also that it would significantly disrupt for years to come the currently 28 member states' balance of power, inner workings and policy orientations. Discussions in Europe in recent days have therefore centred on two main levels: firstly, how to respond to the possible political trauma and financial market turmoil in the immediate aftermath of the June 23 vote, and, secondly, in the weeks and months beyond how best to emphasise the resilience and integrity of the continuing EU project.\n\nIn the immediate term, European leaders have postponed a regular EU summit of national leaders previously scheduled for June 23-24 until later in the month (June 28-29).

Indeed, they are generally expected to attend board meetings at least every quarter, sometimes every two months. This is in addition to their commitment to committee meetings. Collectively, this adds up to a significant amount of time and resources, especially if the company is actively engaged in corporate transactions.\n\nIn this context, to expect directors to meet on every decision is not reasonable, especially where it is administrative in nature. For instance, where the board may have already discussed and formed a preliminary view on a decision pending confirmation of certain facts by management, a further meeting may be unnecessary if the subsequent information addresses the earlier concerns and does not change the preliminary view.\n\nFor this reason, the practice of using written resolutions occurs in almost all publicly listed or private companies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The stock market has staged a dramatic comeback since the February lows but, on a longer-term chart, it's stuck. It's been almost a year since stocks have recorded new highs, something that's highly unusual. According to one research firm, Cornerstone Macro, the broad Standard & Poor's 500 records an average of 20 new 52-week highs every year. Think about it this way, almost all Americans who check their retirement accounts daily have woken up to a losing hand every day since last July.

Their compact size, usually as small as a plum, means they can be attached almost anywhere, from the top of a motorcycle helmet, the handle bar of a bicycle, the strap on a backpack, or even on the bodies of adrenaline junkies such as skydivers, skiers and divers.\n\nThe point-of-view footage taken offers a unique view of any activity, and the most well known company behind action cameras is GoPro. But while GoPro is known for supplying equipment used in extreme-action videography, it is also known for its high prices of over S$300 for a basic set-up. Throw in the need for waterproof casing, microSD cards and other accessories, and it adds up.\n\nThe same also goes for action cameras by many other companies, which is what makes the ViDi action camera such a draw.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The good news is that most strokes are potentially preventable. Preventing stroke in those who have never had stroke previously is called \"primary prevention\" whereas stroke prevention in prior stroke patients is called \"secondary prevention\". While most people will associate strokes with older people, strokes can also occur in younger individuals.\n\nHeart to brain\n\nIf you feel your heart \"fluttering\" away or have bouts of breathlessness, do not pass it off as anxiety. It may be a harbinger of a potentially life threatening condition. Atrial fibrillation (AF), an abnormal heart rhythm which increases the risk of blood clot formation in the heart, is a major cause of stroke. In those over the age of 60, about one in 10 will develop AF. However, AF can also occur in younger people, especially those with excessively high thyroid hormones.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Ssangyong Tivoli Diesel is a powerful yet economical alternative to the petrol version of this compact crossover from Korea.\n\nLike the petrol unit, the turbodiesel also has a displacement of 1.6 litres. Unlike the petrol engine though, the diesel has loads more torque - 300 Newton-metres to be exact. Yet, a typical diesel characteristic is the low power - 115 hp - which means the Tivoli Diesel is a COE Cat A model.\n\nMated to a six-speed automatic transmission to drive the front wheels, it has excellent low-end oomph and moves off effortlessly from stationary. It also performs at higher speeds, thanks to the six well-spaced gear ratios. Noise, vibration and harshness or NVH levels are surprisingly good too, with diesel clatter mostly inaudible except when the engine fires up. Best of all, Ssangyong claims that the 1,390 kg Tivoli Diesel consumes just 5.5 litres per 100 km, or an impressive 18.2 km per litre under the combined cycle.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cars with six seats are rare, and it is safe to say you can't think of more than six such models offhand. The Honda Edix from the mid-2000s is one of them. This MPV was boxy but stylish, and it fits three passengers across two rows. The new Honda Jade RS is also a six-seater but instead of 3-3, it has a 2-2-2 configuration. And if you want further confirmation that the Jade is not the Edix's successor - spiritual or otherwise - you only have to look at its sporty styling, which means it is the replacement of the Stream compact MPV instead.\n\nThe Jade has the sleek profile of a sports tourer, with a low belt line and big wheels. Its interior is even more distinctive. The second row is a pair of captain seats with an aisle in between. For a cosier juxtaposition, they can also be merged laterally.\n\nBehind them are two individual seats meant for children or smaller adults but can also accommodate taller occupants, thanks to a cleverly designed tailgate hinged deep into the roof for better headroom.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
