The dish gets its Korean American leanings from head chef Jachin Tan's time spent in California at Le Cordon Bleu College of Culinary Arts. Although a relatively new dish on the la carte menu, it's already rivalling the duck confit as one of its bestsellers.

His baked mentaiko lobster is an East-West marriage of milky sweet lobster halves topped with a voluptuous blanket of cheesy homemade mayonnaise and spicy cod roe, and should be a refreshing seafood alternative to those tired of the annual glut of red meats and turkey on the dinner table.\n\nMarket rate, available as dine-in or takeaway from Restaurant Home, 392 Upper Bukit Timah Road, The Rail Mall, from now till Jan 1.

Best eaten doused with additional buah keluak-tinged gravy and a tasty stuffing that rolls together buah keluak, minced pork and local spices.

European sharing plates restaurant Spathe Public House has come up with The Traveller, an unusual Singaporean take on traditional French roasted pigeon. A gamey whole pigeon is marinated in sambal paste for 24 hours before it is roasted in the oven, resulting in a fragrant, fiery winning dish. The dish also comes with garlic fries and a homemade sambal mayonnaise so addictive, it is a Christmas wish come true when head chef Claudio Sandri lets on that he'll also be bottling it for retail ($8 for 150ml).\n\n$28 for the sambal roasted pigeon, available as takeaway or dine-in at Spathe, 8 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-01 from Dec 16 to 25 (dinner only on Dec 24 and 25).

But fret not if you don't have an Eurasian grandmother who can whip this up for you.\n\nDamian D'Silva of heritage gastrobar, Immigrants, has made the dish accessible to all in his takeaway version available this Christmas. His recipe works in pork and bacon bones, roast pork and potatoes in a spicy yet tart curry gravy flavoured with vinegar and mustard.\n\n$30 for a portion that feeds four, from Immigrants Gastrobar, 467 Joo Chiat Road.

Former IT professional turned food entrepreneur Keith Lee individually blowtorches each slab of his signature roast pork - think of it as a drier, more crisp version of sio bak - until it crackles on each bite. The meats come in two versions, original or herb-marinated, and mustard and apple sauce are complimentary, while a special Christmas roast sauce is an additional order. Round off the whole package with handmade mince pies ($2 each) served with luscious lashings of brandy butter. With this much goodness going on, it's too bad Christmas only comes around once a year.\n\nThe crackling roast pork is available in three sizes, large ($120) extra large ($150) and supersize ($180). Place orders by calling or sending an SMS to 91195994 or email enquiry@keithkin.com at least a week in advance.

Pan Pacific Hotel serves theirs up with subtle Asian inflections this year. Unlike most hams, their version is not overly salty, and the accompanying pineapple chutney seasoned with chilli, coriander and white vinegar. The hotel's executive chef Vincent Aw says the acidity of the pineapple neutralises the sweetness of the honey glaze and saltiness of the ham. Sounds and tastes good to us.\n\nS$120 for 2kg, available for order and takeaway at the Pacific Marketplace, Level 1 of Pan Pacific Singapore. For enquiries or to order, email\n\ncelebrate.sin@panpacific.com\n\nor call 6826 8240, or head to their online store,\n\nwww.pacificmarketplace.sg\n\nThai\n\nTom yum turkey\n\nIF you're the kind of person who likes to add a bit of spice to everything, then you'd probably get a real kick out of The Glass House's Thai-inspired tom yum turkey, specially created this year. A whole turkey is first marinated in a melange of Thai condiments such as lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and fish sauce before being roasted and served with a tom yum tinged gravy on the side. The modern Asian-fusion restaurant has also come up with a laksa variation that is first bathed in fragrant coconut curry broth, baked until tender and then served with yet another round of laksa gravy. A generous helping of baby carrots, new potatoes and brussels sprouts help to keep any pangs of guilt at bay.\n\n$140 per turkey, available from today till Dec 24 from The Glass House at Hotel Fort Canning, 11 Canning Walk. Order must be made three working days in advance, call 6559 6760 or e-mail\n\nfnb@hfcsingapore.com\n\nIndian\n\nTurkey Raan and turkey pankhi\n\nORDERING a whole turkey for a cosy gathering can sometimes mean having to eat leftovers for the rest of the week, but smaller parties can now be spared with Tandoor restaurant's turkey raan and turkey pankhi creations. Suitable for health-conscious eaters, the turkey pankhi is a turkey breast stuffed with lightly spiced cream cheese and mushrooms and grilled in the tandoori oven.\n\nThe turkey raan is a whole turkey leg prepared in the traditional Raan style - the Indian equivalent of an English Sunday roast, that is marinated and cooked slowly over a whole day - resulting in a juicy, aromatic leg that debunks all notion of turkey as dry, tasteless meat. Both portions are equivalent to about a quarter of a whole turkey and will feed two just nicely as a main course.\n\nThe turkey pankhi and turkey raan, both $32, and a whole tandoori turkey, $88, are available as both dine-in dishes or for takeaway at Tandoor at the Holiday Inn Singapore Orchard City Centre. Takeaway orders must be made three days in advance. For reservations and orders, call 6733 8333.\n\nTandoori turkey\n\nIT'S not quite new but it's been so well received, the tandoori turkey phenomenon looks like it's here to stay. And who better to get your feast from than Indian fine dining stalwart, the Song of India? Just for the festive season, the restaurant's executive chef Munjanath Mural has created a stuffed tandoori turkey, first marinated in a special homemade tandoori paste and slowly cooked to perfection in a clay tandoori oven. Or go the whole hog and opt for its more lavish varient, a whole turkey stuffed with a flavourful morel mushroom biryani for that extra oomph.\n\n$109 for a whole tandoori turkey or $129 for a whole turkey stuffed with morel biryani, available from Dec 20 to 26 from the Song of India, 33 Scotts Road. Two days advance booking required. Place orders by calling 6836 0055 or 6235 9604.\n\nIndonesian\n\nTurkey Bumbu Rojak\n\nFOR this Christmas only, Indonesia-born Eugenia Ong, one-half of the veteran chef duo behind Indo-European restaurant Table at 7, is offering a turkey alternative to the traditional Indonasian dish of ayam bumbu rojak, or chicken with spicy sauce. Her version comprises young turkey breast first stuffed with a free range chicken egg, claypot-roasted next and then braised in a smokey bumbu rojak sauce, a lighter version of rendang - the latter move to prevent the meet from drying out, she says. The turkey breasts come vacuum packed for fuss-free reheating, and can keep for up to a week refrigerated. The approximately 1kg portions are designed for people with small families of two or three in mind, says Ms Ong.\n\n$58 from Table at 7, 7 Mohamed Sultan Road #01-01.

A thin layer of ultra fluffy creme diplomat blankets the cake's surface with a Santa and reindeer-studded White Christmas snowscape bound to induce all sorts of warm and fuzzy feelings.\n\n$62 for a 1.2kg cake available only on request from Prive Cafe from now till Dec 31. Two to three days advanced notice required. Call 6776 0777 for enquiries and orders.\n\nCaulaincourt logcake\n\nALWAYS one to raise a toast to local heritage, Tiong Bahru Bakery's Parisien head baker Gontran Cherrier takes on board familiar Asian ingredients such as mango jelly and Jasmine tea in his limited edition logcakes for the season.\n\nNamed after an idyllic tree-lined street in Paris' Montmartre neighbourhood, the Caulaincourt logcake works in hazelnut dacquoise, chocolate ganache, mango jelly and a subtle perfume of Jasmine tea mousse and should please dinner guests Asian and Caucasian alike.\n\n$45 for a cake that feed 5 to 6 people, available from Tiong Bahru Bakery outlets in 51 Eng Hoon Street and Basement One Raffles City Shopping Centre from Dec 15 to 31.

The agreement provides for Oxley Ruby to have sole and absolute discretion to develop the land in any manner it deems appropriate, and at its own cost.\n\nOxley Ruby will bear all state development charges up to a maximum aggregate amount of RM12 million, while Peninsular will bear 30 per cent of any amount beyond the first RM7 million.\n\nIn return, Peninsular will be entitled to 30 per cent of the gross development value of the project, of no less than RM200 million (S$77.7 million).

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/taking-leaf-ceylon", "site_title": "Taking a leaf from Ceylon", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nTaking a leaf from Ceylon\n\nTea has shaped both the land and economy of Sri Lanka since the mid-19th century, and the tradition continues today. By Cheah Ui-hoon\n\nPublished Fri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE morning starts early at Nuwara Eliya, the highlands of central Sri Lanka. Just after 5am, the horizon of misty mountain is visible tones beneath the intensifying orange sky. As the sun rises, the landscape sharpens in detail: sloping hills neatly divided into green rectangles, evenly terraced to the top; single storey houses painted in bright red, blue or green and yellow, planted at the base of the hills.\n\nIn another couple of hours, women - with long cloths draped from their heads down their backs - would be dotting the terraced hills to handpick the first flush of tea leaves, following a tradition started over a century ago.\n\nNuwara Eliya, which used to be called Little England, is where the country's highest elevation tea plantations are and where much of the landscape and the rhythm of life has been unchanged since the time a Scot, James Taylor, introduced commercial tea planting in 1867.\n\nThe 1,868m-high locale yields the finest and most delicate variety of Sri Lanka's famed Orange Pekoe tea, out of the six types of tea - categorised from low country to high country teas - in the country. With its golden colour and distinct full-bodied flavour, and its artisanal processing, Ceylon tea is considered a premium brew in the world of teas.\n\nRight now, though, this sumptuous image of breaking dawn is enjoyed from Nuwara Eliya's only tea factory turned boutique hotel. Heritance Tea Factory Hotel has been converted from an actual tea factory built in the 1930s - the only hotel of its kind here. It enjoys an almost 100 per cent occupancy year-round for its 60-odd rooms - such is the allure of Nuwara Eliya, both for its tea estates and mountainous, English-countryside ambience where night temperatures drop below 20 degrees celsius.\n\nIn its tea factory days, the four floors of the Hethersett Tea Factory - whose teas were auctioned in Mincing Lane, London - held lines of troughs for the withering of freshly-plucked tea leaves. When it became a hotel, the walls of galvanised iron corrugated sheets were reinforced (the original beams are painted green, and the reinforcements red), so that the open floors could be partitioned into luxurious rooms. Some of the original machinery parts of the factory have been tastefully re-used as d\u00e9cor for the tea-themed look of the hotel. The hotel has even hosted a right royal guest: Britain's Prince Charles paid a visit in 1992 when it first opened.\n\nThe conversion is beautifully done, but what's more fascinating is the knowledge that there are more like it - hundreds around the country - which are still very much in operation, whetting your interest in just how the Sri Lankan tea industry works.\n\nFor an idea of what it means to wither leaves, and then crush, dry and sort them, visit the little showroom cottage on the hotel grounds which takes you through the tea production process. Or better still, arrange to visit one of the many plantations and tea factories in the highlands.\n\nFinlays is one of the bigger corporate plantations in Nuwara Eliya, and the factory still processes tea using orthodox methods. This means the additional crushing of tea leaves with a machine called the rotorvane, explains Lasantha Samarakoon, the superintendent of Finlays. \"It's like a beef mincer - crushing the tea so that the flavour is released,\" he explains. The other tea processing method is CTC (cut, tear and curl).\n\nWe dunk tea bags in hot water every time without giving it a second thought, and we've all also heard variations of the story of how tea was discovered (when a few leaves dropped into some Chinese emperor's cup of hot water and voila!), but modern day tea drinking, the beverage which helped build and bring down empires and industries, is not as easy as plucking and drying leaves and bagging them.\n\nTea processing is all about getting that balance of moisture in the leaves right, coaxing just enough of the flavour and tannin out. \"Once you harvest the leaves, the enzymic reaction begins,\" says Mr Samarakoon. After the plucking, the leaves are put in a trough and withered - by running hot air through them for a couple of hours - to remove about 80-90 per cent of the moisture so that the leaves' sap can be concentrated, otherwise it starts draining away.\n\nTea is plucked in the morning, and the processing starts by noon. The entire process of drying, cleaning and grading will be finished by 6am the next day - when the dried tea is stored into foiled paper sacks and is ready to be auctioned off in the next couple of weeks.\n\nEach tea plucker plucks 20kg of tea leaves a day, and they have to be the first flush - which is the bud and two leaves around it. \"Beyond the third leaf, it's not desirable for tea anymore,\" says Mr Samarakoon.\n\nThe whole agricultural and commercial management of tea plantations is an artful combination of science and maths. The interval for plucking for each bush is one week, for instance, because if a bush is over-plucked, then you're going to run out of bushes which need about two and a half months to grow to the next level. \"We want to leave four to five generations in a bush - that's the most cost-efficient,\" he adds.\n\nThe science and maths of tea processing is even more impressive when you learn about the lesser known art of blending and packaging. This we find out in Colombo, where tea is still sold through an efficient and transparent auction system - again a traditional system which continues to serve the country's tea industry well.\n\nEvery estate - there are some 600 in Sri Lanka - numbers its teas according to variants like plots and lines, because the terroir affects the bush, even on the same estate. And every week, almost 100 per cent of Sri Lanka's tea is sold in the tea auction held at the Sri Lanka Chambers of Commerce building.\n\nLike any art auction, the tea auctioneers rapidly rattle off lots and prices, and tea buyers, many of whom even don ties, sit in an amphitheatre-style lecture hall indicating their bids. Thousands of tea varieties are sold and bought each week, because almost every tea that we drink - regardless of brand or type - is a blend of two or more different leaves from different estates.\n\n\"We could blend something stronger with something lighter, to balance out the taste, or sometimes clients want a stronger colour, especially if they're drinking tea with milk,\" says Ranjith Gunathunge, one of the executives and tea tasters at Tea Tang Pvt Ltd.\n\nThe tea blenders at Tea Tang, owned by BP de Silva in Singapore, get close to 2,000 teas a week which they have to taste and then grade according to their standards. The tea blenders are also the ones who attend the tea auctions every week. Besides getting the right leaves for the blends they want - certain markets want teas with stronger colour, or more robust tastes - they also have to be sensitive to pricing. \"The auctions also mean that we generally know which markets other companies are catering to,\" explains Mr Gunathunge. Tea Tang blends and packages the teas sold by the Sri Lankan Tea Board, and its corporate client list includes Raffles Hotel in Singapore.\n\nSri Lanka is the only country where almost all of its teas are sold by auction, ensuring that the estates get the best prices for their teas. The industry is also the most well-regulated, and the system ensures that the estates get their money within a week of the auction. \"It's a highly transparent system that we have, and it rates as the largest in the world for a single origin,\" points out Hasitha De Alwis, director of the Sri Lanka Tea Promotion Board.\n\nTrundling back down from Nuwara Eliya to Colombo, on the very jam-packed roads and often caught behind a gaily-coloured Tata lorry, one can't help but marvel at how tea - the planting of it, its processing, and how it provides the country a strong export income - has shaped both the land and the economy of Sri Lanka since the mid-19th century.\n\nFormerly British plantations might now be owned by Sri Lankan corporates and the government (after a nationalisation exercise in the 1950s), but the plantations still retain their English estate names such as Hatton and Somerset, and the highlands, their English countryside character.\n\n\"Tradition is the most suitable word that can explain tea in the Sri Lankan context,\" pronounces Mr De Alwis, who had done much to promote the export of Ceylon teas since the 1970s. Now, against newer tea-producing countries such as Kenya which is able to use machines for the planting and plucking, Sri Lanka has to strive to add value to its handpicked teas - to make sure that the sun isn't yet setting on this industry which provides it both the hard income, but also the soft romance of a bygone era.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the last survey, 60 per cent did.\n\nAsked how they thought their own business would fare next year, only 57 per cent said they expected it to grow, down from 74 per cent in the last survey.\n\nCPA Australia said in the survey report: \"The drop in confidence is a surprise, given that independent expert forecasts for the Singapore economy in 2014 are quite robust.\"\n\nIts chief executive Alex Malley attributed the significant dip in confidence levels to global economic volatility stemming from slower growth in China and other external factors.\n\nOf those who believed their business would grow, 62 per cent said the growth would come from increased sales; about a third said it would come from improvements to their business model.\n\nOn the other hand, businesses that do not expect to grow next year cited increasing costs and falling sales as factors.\n\nMr Malley said: \"While confidence is down, the sector seems to be showing enormous resilience, with more than a third of small businesses surveyed still saying they intend to add staff in 2014.\"\n\nIndeed, 35 per cent of small businesses say they are looking to hire next year; 52 per cent say no changes would be made to their headcount, and 7 per cent expect to trim their employee numbers.\n\nBusiness priorities remain largely unchanged, with small businesses listing revenue growth, customer retention and new customer marketing as their top three priorities.\n\nAnother survey, the SME Development Survey released last week by DP Information Group, concluded that as more Singapore small businesses respond to the government's call for higher productivity, labour tightening and lower costs, realising their plans for revenue growth is going to get tricky.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of the sample in this survey of 10,000 small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) expect to notch up double-digit growth. This is a record low in the 11 years the survey has been carried out.\n\nAnother 44 per cent expect flat growth.\n\nHo Meng Kit, chief executive officer of the Singapore Business Federation (SBF), said: \"It is quite clear that SMEs have been grappling with operational challenges as a result of tight manpower constraints and escalating business costs. Hence, in their day-to-day 'fire- fighting' mode, they have little bandwidth left to implement productivity improvements and plan for business expansion overseas.\n\n\"This has resulted in lower turnover and profitability.\"\n\nGan Kwok Yee, co-founder of cocktail bar Jigger & Pony, told The Business Times that escalating business costs in the next year are certainly a concern for small businesses.\n\nShe said an F&B business like hers faces mounting costs in shophouse rental and in wages from the tight labour market.\n\nHowever, she said the business has more control over its wage bill than its rental, \"by focusing on training and increasing our team's skillsets and productivity\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Distrust because there has been talk of these \"currencies\" being used to anonymously buy things such as guns and drugs from sites such as Silk Road and Black Market Reloaded. And disdain because peer-to- peer cryptocurrencies do not have a central bank backing their value. Bitcoins don't exist physically; they are just computer files, and algorithms have capped the total number of Bitcoins that can be \"mined\" by computers solving complex cyptographic problems at 21 million in order to prevent \"inflation\". Also, unlike real world coins, each Bitcoin can be \"broken\" down into 1,000 \"pieces\" for payment purposes.\n\nBitcoin was first \"developed\" in 2009 by a little- known cryptographer going by the name \"Nakamoto\". Its attraction is easy to understand. Existing online payment systems such as PayPal and credit cards always take a cut either from the buyer or seller.\n\nBitcoin looks attractive because there are no middlemen involved and hence no cuts. Bitcoin fans also celebrate the fact that there is no central bank-type authority regulating the currency. However, as a senior official of the Bank of England said recently, \"economies perform better when they have managed monetary policies\" that only a central bank can provide.\n\nBitcoin has a lot of potential if it can come out of the shadows. For example, it cannot be forged or stolen. However, for it to become mainstream, central bank authorities and Bitcoin supporters would have to develop a consensus on how it can be integrated into the global currency system. The US Senate recently held a series of hearings on Bitcoin to explore how federal regulators can oversee this new form of online payment and, if possible, co-opt it into the overall banking system. US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke has said that Bitcoin and its analogues \"may hold long-term promise, particularly if the innovations promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system\". Richard Branson has announced that his commercial space company Virgin Galactic will accept Bitcoin for trips into space.\n\nDuring the hearings, US Senator Mark Warner observed that Bitcoin could \"dramatically transform\" the role of central banks. There are several exchanges where one can \"trade\" Bitcoin, with BTC China reported to be the world's biggest. Following the US Senate hearings and the statements from top bankers and officials, prices shot up to US$900 for one Bitcoin; early this year, one Bitcoin could be had for just US$40.\n\nSome analysts are talking in terms of the value hitting US$1,000. Singapore, with its status as an important global financial centre, will have to closely monitor these developments and start planning for ways to not only integrate Bitcoin, if needed, but also profit from the move. As technology trends go, things will move very fast if Bitcoin gets the blessing of the US Fed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/different-shares-trust", "site_title": "Of different shares of trust", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nOf different shares of trust\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 26, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT trades like a real estate investment trust (Reit), and often emulates its characteristics, but business trusts (BTs), sometimes loosely labelled the \"poorer cousin\" of Reits, operate very differently from Reits.\n\nBroadly speaking, the key differentiating factors between Reits and BTs lie in their development restriction, gearing limit, and minimum distribution payout.\n\nTaking development restriction as an example, Reits have a development cap of up to 10 per cent of its asset value. In addition, they have to maintain a minimum distribution of at least 90 per cent of distributable profits, which in turn grants the vehicle tax transparency. Finally, Reits have a gearing limit of 35 per cent of assets, and 60 per cent of assets if they have a credit rating.\n\nOn the other hand, BTs have no development restriction, gearing limit, or minimum distribution payout. Instead, these are bound by the trust deed, which many BTs have fashioned after Reits.\n\nCroesus Retail Trust, for instance, has a development limit of 20 per cent. The trust, which is the first Asia-Pacific retail business trust with an initial portfolio located in Japan, listed in May this year. It intends to distribute at least 90 per cent of its distributable income, and its asset leverage limit is set at 60 per cent.\n\nPerennial China Retail Trust on the other hand has undertaken to distribute at least 50 per cent of its distributable profit. Asset leverage limit has been set at 60 per cent of trust property; it does not have a development cap.\n\nIn these cases, the respective managers believe that having a higher development limit and higher gearing ratio would enable them to offer higher growth and upside through development.\n\nThe problem is that investors compare the yield of BTs with Reits, said Pua Seck Guan, executive director and chief executive of Perennial China Retail Trust Management.\n\n\"The problem we face today is that investors use yield to measure share price. So when you have development projects and you have growth, the market discounts it,\" said Mr Pua.\n\nDespite its apparent similarities - both distribute dividends on a regular basis - BTs were originally created to target infrastructure companies.\n\n\"The philosophy the regulator had when the BT regime was started, is to target infrastructure companies which have very high depreciation,\" said Tan Kok Huan, managing director, asset-backed structured products, capital markets group, at DBS Bank.\n\n\"If you stay as a company, you can pay very little dividends because the depreciation would eat into your profits. Companies won't pay more than accounting profits, as depreciation is an accounting expense. However, a trust allows you to pay more than accounting profits and that's one of the key advantages of BT,\" he said.\n\n\"At the end of the day, people looking at BT must understand and appreciate the underlying asset and business,\" he added. Interestingly, having a BT framework in tandem with a Reit framework is what enabled stapled hospitality trusts to list.\n\n\"(A) landmark project was in 2005, when we worked on the CDL Hospitality Trust. Reits are not supposed to have very operational assets. We studied how hotel Reits are structured in the US and had extensive discussions with regulators. In the end we chose a stapled structure, as we needed to consider the options available in the event there is no master lease,\" said Jerry Koh, partner at Allen & Gledhill LLP.\n\nHaving a BT stapled to the Reit allows the BT to hold and operate the assets, or have a master lease between the Reit and the BT and have the BT operate the assets.\n\n\"Being able to use the stapled structure enabled us to undertake hotel Reits . . . We created something that was unique in Singapore to allow the hotel structure. That was significant,\" he said.\n\nFor investors, knowing BTs from Reits, and discerning one type of Reit from another, is important.\n\nWhen investing in hospitality Reits, investors should look at the rental formula under which the Reit is getting its cash flows, said Galen Lee, managing director, head of South-east Asian real estate, at UBS Bank.\n\n\"The less variability in a hotel Reit's cash flows, for example by structuring a high fixed rent with a low variable rent component, the lower the risk in a hotel Reit. Conversely, a hotel Reit with a large proportion of cash flows tied to the operating performance of the underlying asset will be viewed by investors as being more risky,\" he said.\n\n\"Investors should also look at what the managers of stapled securities are looking to do in terms of undertaking more development activities or leverage via the business trust side of the business, as this may increase the risk profile of the vehicle.\"\n\nFor other Reits, investors should focus on the fundamental real estate portfolio, and take the mentality that they are buying a piece of real estate via the equity markets, said Mr Lee.\n\n\"For example, when property investors buy commercial properties they look at capitalisation rates (cap rates) as a key valuation metric,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nCap rate is the net property income divided by the purchase price of the assets.\n\nBut given that the markets value a Reit through the capital markets, it is possible to compute its implied cap rates by dividing the Reit's net property income over the sum of its equity market capitalisation plus its debt.\n\n\"This is because an investor who theoretically buys up all the Reit's units and all its debt will own all the financial claims on the underlying properties. Investors can then assess whether this implied cap rate is attractive relative to other Reits and whether it's in line with the cap rate prevalent for that asset class and geography,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nTaking this approach cuts through the differences between Reits, given that different Reits have different gearing levels, varying cost of debt, different fee regimes, income support and other structural differences. All of these factors impact a Reit's distribution yield and risk profile.\n\n\"Investors will therefore look at other factors than just a Reit's distribution yield when evaluating it.\n\nLikewise they will need to look beyond whether an acquisition is yield accretive, especially if it results in excessive leverage or if the target property is a higher risk market,\" added Mr Lee.\n\n\"Reits have no construction risk. They should be largely or fully leased out whereas a developer may end up building empty condos or offices and valuations can move quite sharply. So these two are very different animals. The fact that they are trading so closely means that investors are still seeing Reits as no different from a developer stock, which is not meant to be,\" said Wen Khai Meng, chief executive officer, CapitaLand Singapore.\n\n\"This is a problem to the extent that managers react to investor demand. I'm supposed to be an income-producing stock, but my shareholders insist I must grow, so you are forcing a camel to run like a horse.\n\n\"But people forget the risk (of Reits) is also lower as the leases are locked in at least for a period of time. People look at returns and they forget about the risk.\"\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM:Mindy Tan and Ong Chor Hao (BT Newsdesk), Eugene Teo (BTDigital), Yvonne Poh (BT Subs Desk), Khairie Rahmat (BT Art), Yen Meng Jiin (BT Photo)\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

As at 2012, he held more than 20 per cent of Neptune, which in turn controlled 50 million shares of Blumont and a 1.7 per cent stake in LionGold. He declined to comment.\n\nMs Quah held a 2.15 per cent interest in Blumont as at March 18 and is chief executive of Ipco International, which held a 9.7 per cent stake in Blumont as at March 2013. Sun Spirit is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ipco and a stakeholder in both Blumont and LionGold. Ms Quah could not be reached for comment.\n\nMr Chen is director of business and corporate development at LionGold and is one of Asiasons' largest shareholders, with a 2.09 per cent stake as at March 28, 2013.\n\nInteractive Brokers' case is the latest shot to be fired in the wake of October's penny sell-off, when sudden drops in the share prices of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold on Oct 4 led to rare intervention measures by the Singapore Exchange and a subsequent run on small counters.\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Singapore Exchange have said they are reviewing the circumstances surrounding the trading of those stocks.\n\nDays after her assets were frozen, Ms Quah on Nov 20 filed a suit in the United Kingdom against Goldman Sachs International, claiming that the bank had been unreasonable in how it demanded the repayment of a $61 million loan facility for which her holdings in the three stocks had been pledged as collateral.\n\nAccording to UK court documents that BT saw, Ms Quah said about 28 million of her Asiasons shares and 29 million of her LionGold shares had been force-sold from Oct 2 to 23 for a total of $19.4 million.\n\nBlumont executive director James Hong Gee Ho and LionGold independent director Ng Su Ling have also filed suits in the UK against Goldman on allegations similar to Ms Quah's. Neither could be reached for comment.\n\nMs Quah and Mr Hong are represented by barristers' chambers Thirty Nine Essex Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs declined to comment.\n\nShares in Asiasons closed flat at 13.5 cents yesterday.

Nonetheless, he treats each one like it were his first because every joint project is a valuable opportunity to breed \"creative thinking and interesting new music\".\n\nThis time, he is working with jazz musicians from Russia, for the Russia-Singapore Jazz Symphonia which will run at the 700-seater concert hall at School of the Arts (SOTA) later tonight.\n\nIt all began when he was commissioned to put together a jazz concert by a Russian businessman named Evgeny Tugolukov.\n\nThe latter had befriended Monteiro at one of his concerts about a 11/2 years ago, and later introduced him to some of the top jazz musicians in Russia when Monteiro visited Moscow earlier this year.\n\n\"At first, I thought to do a jazz concert, but then I thought why not do one that's half symphonic jazz instead, since that's something rarely or probably never even heard of in Singapore,\" says Monteiro.\n\nSo for the first half of the concert, the jazz musicians on stage will be joined by a full symphonic orchestra to play some improvised jazz music.\n\nThe line-up includes three of Monteiro's original pieces - Overture in C, Olympia, and Another Time, Another Place - as well as a nine-part symphonic suite by Russian composer Enri Lolashvilli titled Nostalgia.\n\nAs for the second half, Monteiro has decided to stick to a more traditional jazz concert format, where his quartet will take the stage with two Russian jazz musicians and play a mixture of five or six jazz compositions. One of the two musicians is famed Russian trumpeter Vadim Eilenkrig, while the other is saxophonist Igor Butman, whom former American president Bill Clinton once commented \"may be the greatest living jazz saxophone player, who happens to be a Russian\".\n\nWhen asked why these two musicians were picked above all the other jazz players out there, Monteiro explains: \"We (jazz musicians) all aspire to the geniune standard set by New York and American jazz musicians for all their years, and we all aspire to play authentically.\n\n\"These musicians, they are very authentic... and they play at a level that's comparable to New York - the mecca of jazz,\" says Monteiro.\n\nThe Russia-Singapore Jazz Symphonia runs tonight at 8pm at the SOTA Concert Hall.

And I remember the modern designs that coexist with traditional architecture, but I don't remember all these high-rise buildings. I remember how clean Singapore was, and how I thought Changi Airport was the most beautiful airport I've personally ever been in.\"\n\nJust earlier this week, Dr Ward-Steinman finally made his long-awaited trip back to Singapore, for the world premiere of his 2012 composition titled Singapore Sonorama, at the Esplanade Concert Hall.\n\nThe 16-minute commissioned piece with four parts honours different elements of Singapore - the Merlion, Malay culture and folk song Dayung Sampan, Little India and the music of tabla drums, and finally Chinatown. The work is part of a concert titled Circus Maximus by the local wind orchestra The Philharmonic Winds, which started in 2000 and currently has over 50 active members. Circus Maximus is titled after a 35-minute composition of the same name, by American composer John Corgliano. The piece is also known as Symphony No 3 for Large Wind Ensemble, and is made up of eight movements in total.\n\nIt was written with the composer's intention to give audiences a \"surround sound\" experience, says conductor Leonard Tan, who is also the music director of The Philharmonic Winds. Hence, musicians will be positioned not just onstage but off as well. \"Just planning this particular concert took a lot of logistics, and I think that has taken more energy and time than the rehearsals themselves,\" says Dr Tan.\n\nIn addition to a the full-sized wind band on stage, there will be 12 trumpeters sitting among the audience around the concert hall, a saxophone quartet and double bass at circle one, two horns on circle two, as well as two percussionists plus a clarinet at circle three. Not to mention the marching band that's scheduled to come in at one point of the show. \"It's experimental, yes, but we've done experimental works before. After all we started out with a desire to do something different, and not repeating and replaying all the tired old band stuff,\" says Dr Tan.\n\nAlso in the music programme will be the celebratory piece of Richard Wagner's 200th birth anniversary titled Huldigungsmarsch for military band in E flat major, WWV 97 (or March of Homage), Lament for Wind Orchestra by the Korean-Japanese composer Chang Su Koh, and Satiric Dances (for a comedy by Aristophanes) by Norman Dello Joio.\n\nCircus Maximus runs at the Esplanade Concert Hall on Dec 1 at 8pm.

The 38-year-old was driving home one night while listening to the BBC World Service radio station, when a short blurb came on about a man in Berlin who had been cured of HIV.\n\n\"It made me wonder if I had just heard a fictional story. He almost seemed like a mythical creature of sorts. So I called my old friend (Dzul Sungit) who lives in Rotterdam, and I said I'm coming to Berlin. I don't know why, I just want to find out more about The Berlin Patient,\" says Tang, a trained filmmaker who is currently a producer at HBO Asia.\n\nSo a few months later, he hopped on a plane to Berlin, and began a journey that would eventually result in his upcoming documentary, I Hugged The Berlin Patient.\n\nThe film premieres next Monday at The Grand Cathay, and standard tickets are priced at $30, while VIP tickets are $100. All net proceeds will be donated to Action for AIDS.\n\nThe Berlin Patient refers to Timothy Ray Brown, who was cured of HIV in Berlin in 2007. The bone marrow transplants that were meant to treat his acute myeloid leukaemia ended up getting rid of his HIV as well.\n\nUp till 2010, no one even knew his name, because Brown was an extremely private person, says Tang. So when they first got to Berlin, they didn't do it with the intention of putting together a documentary at all.\n\n\"My co-director, Dzul, said he was just going to roll the camera, and if I was not interesting, he would stop rolling. But he never did,\" says Tang, who is currently in his sixth year of remission from Hodgkin's lymphoma - cancer of the lymph nodes.\n\n\"When we arrived in Berlin, we didn't know people, we didn't know the language, we basically funded it ourselves. It was really a leap of faith of some kind... But we realised that, at worst, nothing would happen and we would have a holiday,\" he adds.\n\nAnd during that first week, things did not go very smoothly. Tang spent most of his time walking around the city wearing a placard with the German words \"Wissen sie, wer The Berlin Patient ist\" or \"Do you know who The Berlin Patient is?\", and he grew increasingly frustrated when no one seemed to have heard of this elusive man.\n\n\"But one day something happened, and it all kind of fell into place suddenly. I remember it was on a day that was quite auspicious, the 10th of October, so like a perfect 10,\" he laughs.\n\n\"Certain things happened. Whoever we wanted to get in touch with somehow got back to us, so we realised we couldn't stop rolling.\"\n\nThough Tang refuses to reveal too many details about the rest of his journey, the title of the film already gives away the ending - that he did get to meet the man in the end, after a few months of searching, a lot of faith, and help from kind strangers in a foreign land.\n\nI Hugged The Berlin Patient may sound like a potentially preachy, video-version of a motivational speech, but Tang insists that the last thing he wants is for his audience to spend the hour and a half in tears. Instead, he hopes the film will come across as quirky and light-hearted.\n\n\"It's not disease-specific. It's just about hope. It's just watching something uplifting. It's not as heavy as some people think because it's set against the backdrop of a medical, HIV or cancer thing. It's not heavy at all. And it's in that sense very Singaporean and global in its theme,\" says Tang.\n\nrachloi@sph.com.sg\n\nThe world charity premiere of I Hugged The Berlin Patient runs on Dec 2 at 8.30pm at The Grand Cathay.

The Japanese capital's properties also stand to receive a windfall of about 152 billion yen from the 2020 Olympic Games, according to International Olympic Committee.\n\n\"Investor perception of Japan Excellent's profitability is improving in tandem with the office space market,\" said Mikio Namiki, an analyst at Mizuho Securities Co in Tokyo. \"The bonds are also offering a spread that is quite attractive to investors which have seen yield premiums decline across the board.\"\n\nThe spread on the Tokyo-based Reit's 1.01 per cent notes due 2016 dropped 28 basis points since the offering in October 2011 to 20 basis points. Japan Credit Rating Agency Ltd ranks the company AA-, its fourth-highest investment grade. The spread for Japan's similarly-rated issuers plunged 36 to seven in the period, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.\n\nJapan Excellent has 29 billion yen of bonds outstanding, including 12 billion yen maturing in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The fund's weighted average fixed coupon declined to 1.2 per cent from 1.45 per cent in the last quarter of 2010, the data show.\n\n\"The overall office market is improving which is positive for the Reit market,\" said Kenta Anami, general manager at the finance and accounting department of Japan Excellent. \"We refinanced the debt earlier because we see now as a good timing.\"\n\nMr Abe's economic stimulus campaign includes monetary stimulus to encourage finance activity. Stepped-up borrowing by Japanese companies has to translate into increased capital spending for the measures to succeed in ending deflation and reviving the economy.\n\nThe volume of real estate transactions in Tokyo jumped 58 per cent to US$15.6 billion in the first nine months of this year, according to a report by Jones Lang LaSalle. That's US$400 million short of New York, which ranked second with US$16 billion after a 16 per cent decline. Paris was fourth with US$10.9 billion, while London topped the list with US$23.2 billion.\n\nTokyo's office vacancy rate, a measurement of unoccupied space, dropped to 7.56 per cent last month from 7.9 per cent in September and was at its lowest since June 2009, according to broker Miki Shoji Co. The gauge reached a record 9.43 per cent in June 2012.\n\nCommercial land values in Japan's three biggest metropolitan areas rose for the first time since 2008 this year, gaining 0.6 per cent, according to the land ministry's annual land survey report released in September.\n\nJapan's property-related securities may also receive an infusion from the country's pension assets. An expert panel recommended that the 121 trillion yen Government Pension Investment Fund diversify its investments into other financial products, including Reits, where returns may be higher than on local sovereign bonds, according to a report released by the advisory group on Nov 20.\n\n\"We see a growing possibility of GPIF investment in Reits via baby funds with outsourced specialist management,\" Tomohiro Araki, a Tokyo-based senior analyst at Nomura Securities Co, wrote in a report on the same day. The pension fund's Reit investment would help lift land values, Mr Araki said in the report.\n\nJapan Hotel Reit Investment Corp raised 2.5 billion yen of 0.89 per cent bonds due 2016, at a yield premium of 60 basis point over the yen swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JCR has an A rating on the fund, its fifth-lowest investment grade.\n\n\"Hotel assets tend to be riskier than offices,\" prompting investors to seek higher returns, said Roko Izawa, a Tokyo-based analyst at Standard & Poor's. \"There are operational risks such as fluctuation in occupancy rate and seasonality.\"\n\nJapan Retail Fund Investment Corp, Japan's third-biggest Reit, said on Nov 22 it hired Mitsubishi UFJ, Morgan Stanley Securities Co and Mizuho Securities Co to handle a 10-year bond sale. The fund last offered debt in 2007.\n\n\"A majority of Japan's Reits have recently had their cost of debt reduced because of an improving market condition,\" S&P's Mr Izawa said. \"They want to lock down the cost of funding because the outlook for interest rates is not clear.

He added that, apart from product quality, \"we're also convinced our local presence makes all the difference to success: REC is excellently positioned to serve the local market, having established its own factory at the centre of the action - right in Singapore - to produce high-performing solar panels for the Asia region.\"\n\nREC's integrated plant here produces the complete wafer, cell and solar panels, and is the group's only remaining solar panel facility since it shut its entire Norwegian manufacturing operations last year due to global overcapacity and falling demand.\n\nLast month, REC effectively split into two companies: REC Solar, comprising its solar panel operations and distribution, is headquartered in Singapore, while REC Silicon, producing advanced silicon materials for customers in the solar and electronics industry, has its HQ in the US.\n\nREC said that at Sheng Siong's Mandai distribution centre, its solar panels will cover 11,000 square metres of the rooftop and create a 1.2MW power plant that will generate enough energy to meet at least 11 per cent of the facility's electricity needs. It will also offset at least 730 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.\n\nAt the Singapore Sports Hub, its 7,000 sq m of rooftop installation will not only produce solar energy, but act as a sunshade for the roof, thus reducing the heat conducted to the building. \"The system will generate over 919,100 kWh of energy every year, enough for approximately 183 Singapore households, and will mitigate around 459 tonnes of CO2 annually,\" it added.\n\nThe facility will reap tremendous benefits from the 25-year power output warranty of the REC solar panels, said Mr Grar\u00e9. \"Thanks to the reliability of REC solar panels, Phoenix Solar can guarantee the Sports Hub stable electricity prices over a time horizon of over 20 years, with no upfront investment.\"\n\nBy year-end, total solar capacity here is set to double to 20MW or more. And with Singapore moving to incorporate solar energy into the power system, the Energy Market Authority (EMA) is raising the current cap on intermittent generation sources (including from solar) from 350MW currently to 600MW (representing 10 per cent of current peak electricity demand here) as a first step.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The government had pinned its hopes on offsetting those losses with record 22.3 per cent growth from January to October in tourism, a sector accounting for 9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), and big infrastructure spending.\n\nThat could be wishful thinking. About 16 billion baht (S$626 million) has been lost through holiday cancellations this month alone, just as peak season begins, says the Tourism Ministry.\n\nThe protests could also add to delays in the injection of two trillion baht into the economy through infrastructure projects that have been on ice for months, bogged down in legal limbo from an opposition party challenge.\n\n\"Real concerns come via further delays in infrastructure spending and impact on tourism, the two most likely drivers of Thai GDP next year,\" Credit Suisse economist Santitarn Sathirathai wrote in a research note. \"These two components are likely to be sensitive to political and government stability,\" he said, adding that a snap election could return a weaker coalition that would struggle even more to push through big spending plans.\n\nThe baht, now the fourth-weakest in Asia, is another factor. Even before the protests, it looked vulnerable to the US Federal Reserve's expected winding down of its US$85 billion a month monetary stimulus measures.\n\nThe monthly correlation between the baht and two-year US Treasury yields has been at record highs, which means the currency already looks ripe for a fall when the Fed eases its stimulus measures. So foreign investors who poured into Thailand over the past six months as they avoided more troubled markets such as Indonesia and India now have two reasons to leave: higher US rates and domestic political concern.\n\nBut political turmoil isn't always a drag on the economy which has weathered eight years of on-off chaos. Each time, Thailand's financial markets typically swoon and rebound.\n\nThe bloodiest political violence in a generation erupted in April and May 2010, but foreign inflows nearly doubled that year; stocks rocketed 40.6 per cent and the economy bounded ahead by 7.8 per cent, its best growth in 15 years. Private investment jumped 14 per cent and exports rose nearly 30 per cent. Tourists returned to Thai beaches in near-record numbers, up 12 per cent that year.\n\n\"The majority of foreign investments are not in Bangkok,\" said Teeranan Srihong, president of Kasikornbank pcl, referring to the manufacturers at the heart of Thailand's economy whose factories stud surrounding provinces. \"Thailand will be an attractive destination for foreign investors over the long term.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

With this scheme, IE Singapore will help local companies become more globally competitive by boosting access to liquidity to help support new business ventures in less familiar, possibly riskier markets.\"\n\nIt will be IE Singapore's first scheme to address the non-payment risks of overseas issuing banks.\n\nCredit guarantees are currently issued by multilateral development banks such as ADB against non-payment risks by banks in emerging markets. Such guarantees are used by Singapore-based banks to provide financing to Singapore companies trading with buyers from emerging markets.\n\nIE Singapore said Singapore is the single biggest beneficiary of the ADB-TFP. The volume of Singapore trades backed under the initiative has jumped nearly 400 per cent since 2010, hitting a record US$1.7 billion last year.\n\nBut the guarantees have not been enough to meet market demand because of credit limits.\n\nThe situation is also not helped by the stricter banking rules introduced following the global financial crisis, which makes banks even warier of risks, said Swiss Re's head of credit & surety, Andreas Hillebrand.\n\nSteven Beck, ADB's head of finance, said so far ADB-TFP, which was started in 2007, has not seen a default under its scheme.\n\nIE Singapore said the risks of dealing with banks in emerging markets tend to be harder to assess, which \"can be a real constraint to trade\". At the same time, it noted that the Republic's trade with the emerging markets has been growing three times faster than its trade with the advanced economies.\n\nThe TFS will address market gaps in trade financing for Singapore companies in emerging markets, IE Singapore said.\n\n\"Under this scheme, IE Singapore will share the risk on credit guaranteed and provided against non-payment risks of overseas issuing banks with the ADB and Swiss Re,\" it said. \"This in turn facilitates Singapore exporters' receipt of payments for transactions with buyers from emerging markets.\"\n\nMr Seow said IE Singapore is teaming up with ADB and Swiss Re in the scheme because it saves the trade promotion agency the trouble of starting one afresh.\n\nThe partnership is also part of Singapore's move to anchor and expand the presence of agencies and firms such as ADB and Swiss Re here, which will benefit Singapore's economy, he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also names positioned to capitalise on structural industry upcycles are Golden Agri-Resources Ltd and Jardine Cycle & Carriage.\n\nStocks to avoid are Indofood Agri Ltd, OCBC Bank and Far East Hospitality Trust.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The report said this reflected the better-educated profile of recent cohorts of older residents and tripartite efforts to better equip them to continue working.\n\nProfessionals, managers and executives (PMEs) also account for a bigger share of the resident workforce as the education and skills profile of the workforce improves. PMEs make up 31.1 per cent of the resident workforce this year, up from 27.4 per cent a decade ago.\n\nThe report said full-time working residents' nominal median monthly income jumped 6.5 per cent over the year to $3,705 in June. Real median income growth picked up from 2.5 per cent in 2012 to a preliminary 3.9 per cent this year, as inflation eased. \"Cumulatively, the median income (including employer CPF contributions) of full-time employed residents rose by 27.9 per cent or 5 per cent per annum from 2008 to 2013,\" the report said.\n\nIn real terms, median income grew by an estimated 9.7 per cent or 1.9 per cent yearly in this period, faster than the 7 per cent or 1.4 per cent annually in 2003-2008.\n\nThe increase over the decade was a preliminary 17.4 per cent, or 1.6 per cent yearly.\n\nThe report said income growth at the 20th percentile broadly kept pace with that of the median in the recent five years, with the former's monthly income jumping 26.6 per cent from $1,489 in 2008 to $1,885 in 2013, or 4.8 per cent yearly.\n\nThe real increase is an estimated 8.6 per cent, or 1.7 per cent yearly.\n\n\"This outweighed the real income losses of 0.6 per cent or 0.1 per cent per annum from 2003 to 2008, resulting in growth of 7.9 per cent or 0.8 per cent per annum over the decade,\" the report said.\n\nNoting that the median real wage growth was 1.9 per cent a year in 2008-2013, against 1.7 per cent for lower-income workers, Mr Heng said: \"We must push harder to improve their (lower-income workers') wages faster and sustainably.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/theres-potential-lower-utility-costs", "site_title": "There's potential for lower utility costs", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThere's potential for lower utility costs\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 28, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT is heartening that electricity rates here, both for homes and industries, have eased by some 10 per cent according to industry estimates, thanks largely to the intense competition among gencos, all under different owners, including foreign ones. Increased power supplies, including recently started liquefied natural gas imports, have helped.\n\nBut LNG supplies per se have not directly impacted power prices. It is just that Brent crude prices, to which LNG supplies are pegged, have eased recently. PNG prices, on the other hand, are pegged to high sulphur fuel oil prices. Simply put, consumers here have since July been paying for power generated using both PNG and LNG feedstock, which means they bought power on the back of a \"blended\" or combined PNG/LNG price.\n\nPower aside, there is however, still the bugbear of other costly utilities, such as steam, needed by the petroleum/chemical plants on Jurong Island. Unlike in the case of electricity, such utilities, including cooling water, cannot be transported over long distances. There are also a limited number of such utility players on the island, with dedicated supply pipelines tying them to their respective customers, and vice-versa. From just Sembcorp originally, recent new suppliers of steam and other utilities like cooling water there are YTL PowerSeraya and Tuas Power, the latter from its new clean coal/biomass complex.\n\nAs utilities account for a big chunk of operational costs, big users such as the mega petrochemical/refinery complexes of Shell and ExxonMobil, have resorted to building in-house utilities plants. Recent complaints of costly utilities have come from European producers to Japanese ones, with the latter claiming they are paying even more here than back home.\n\nBut the gencos' counter is that they are simply passing through their higher fuel costs. Utility costs here are higher relative to other countries because the latter have access to either natural energy resources or cheaper energy feedstock. Unlike say, some bigger Asian consumers, Singapore is just too small a buyer to be able to negotiate or exact lower gas prices from its suppliers. The Republic also does not have other renewables such as solar power, or nuclear, in its energy mix at this point to help it reduce costs.\n\nStill, with natural gas currently the dominant feedstock accounting for 86 per cent of power/utility production here, any attempts at reducing utility costs will, for now, have to centre around the fuel. The growth of a LNG hub here, with potential for cheaper spot cargoes; supply contracts priced off gas indices rather than current oil-based ones; plus new potential cheaper supply sources such as US shale projects, could help. Singapore's attempt, through Temasek-owned Pavilion Energy, to be involved in every aspect of the global gas trade, including directly in the gas fields, is also promising.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By and large, the departure of the retail investor in droves over the past six weeks - possibly because confidence has taken a hard knock following what has become known as the \"penny stock saga\" - and the draining of liquidity out of the local market that started six months ago because of US tapering fears seem to have knocked life out of the stock market.\n\nThis made for another largely featureless week, one in which dealers found themselves having to trade on their own in order to try and supplement declining incomes, or sit there and stare at the trading screen while waiting for inspiration that never came.\n\nBlue chips epitomised the slowing the market is experiencing - the Straits Times Index (STI) yesterday fell 10.02 points to 3,176.35, reversing almost all of Thursday's gains. The index rose four points for the week; for the year to date, it is up nine points.\n\nBanks led Thursday's bounce together with Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic. Yesterday, losses recorded by the two Jardine heavyweights took 1.3 points off the STI, while falls in United Overseas Bank and OCBC Bank took a further six points.\n\nTrading in the latter part of the week was affected by the closure of Wall Street for Thanksgiving on Thursday. Liquidity has been a problem for many weeks now - in yesterday's session though, 1.5 billion units worth $1.1 billion were done, a modest improvement over Thursday's $692 million.\n\nActivity in penny stocks has dropped off just as sharply. According to conventional market wisdom, the loss of interest in low-priced issues started in early October when the trio of Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold crashed 90 per cent in a day and were suspended by Singapore Exchange, then classified as designated securities. Upon relisting, they popped back into play before having the brakes slammed on them when regulators announced they were investigating trades in the trio.\n\nStill, despite the sharp drop-off in penny activity, there were bright spots. Mermaid Maritime, for example, saw its shares rise four cents over the week to 41 cents. The offshore oil and gas firm on Wednesday announced that net profit for the year ended September almost quadrupled to US$15.4 million from a year earlier.\n\nDealers have also singled out Keppel Corp as being a relative outperformer, holding steady in the face of overall weakness. It rose three cents to $11.31 yesterday and is up 69 cents or 6.5 per cent for the year.\n\nIn its Strategy 2014 report yesterday, OCBC Investment Research said the outlook was slowly and gradually improving.\n\n\"The recent 3Q13 corporate results in Singapore also point to a cautiously optimistic guidance from companies and high single-digit earnings growth is likely for 2014,\" said the broker. \"The Singapore market, based on the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI), is currently trading at 13.7x FY14 earnings and we believe this is reasonable. The recent historical PER (2007-now) ranges from as low as 9x during the 2008 financial crisis to as high as 18x, but the average is hovering slightly above 14x. In addition, price-to-book is not demanding at 1.35x and average dividend yield is decent at 3.3 per cent.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apparently it's not that big a deal if you happen to be one of the hundreds of people who have booked the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class.\n\nDaimler South-east Asia, the distributor of Mercedes-Benz, would not confirm the number, but BT understands that close to 400 orders have been taken for the latest version of its flagship luxury limousine.\n\nTo be launched to 1,000 guests here tomorrow, the three available variants for now - the S350 CDI, S400 Hybrid, S500 - are priced between $450,000 and $600,000 (including COE) approximately.\n\nInterestingly, a surprisingly sizeable number of the higher-end S500 model with a V8 engine has been snapped up - one-quarter of all bookings compared to less than 10 per cent previously.\n\n\"This group of customers has seen their wealth grow exponentially because of asset inflation, so $500,000 is not considered a major expense,\" said one observer. \"But not only Singaporeans have benefited; it's a worldwide phenomenon.\"\n\nBut in Singapore the price of an S-Class can be almost treble because of the progressive registration tax structure introduced in February this year. And along with the vehicle financing restrictions implemented at the same time, buyers have to stump up about $250,000 in cash because of the 50 per cent cash downpayment required for cars with an open market value of more than $20,000.\n\nThis is unlikely to be a problem for S-Class buyers, however, who traditionally include owners of small and medium-sized enterprises, and CEOs and the top management of MNCs and other corporations.\n\n\"For some of them, the S-Class is a car that they must have because of its branding and status,\" said the observer. \"Its reputation is such that it is the undisputed champ in this segment when it comes to comfort and luxury.\"\n\nPart of its large clientele and loyal following can be attributed to the fact that the S-Class was one of the earliest full-sized luxury saloons to go on sale in Singapore. It gained popularity among the well-heeled as the Mercedes-Benz 280S in the 1960s, at a time when there was virtually no competition as a status symbol in its class.\n\nIn its run-out year this year, the S-Class notched up sales of only 88 units in the first nine months, compared with its traditional rival, the BMW 7 Series, of which 209 units were registered in the same period, while the corresponding figure for the Audi A8 was 38 units.\n\nLast year, about 350 units of the S-Class were sold, and at its peak, this outgoing model racked up sales of 850 units in 2007, one year after its launch.\n\nIn general, launches of popular makes and models in Singapore tend to elicit a good response despite the prohibitive taxes and high COE premiums.\n\nIt is said that the Lexus ES mid-sized luxury sedan, for example, managed to net more than 100 bookings nearly two months ago at its introduction, while the facelifted Mercedes-Benz E-Class found favour with slightly more buyers when it was introduced in March.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Six months ago, only 49 per cent predicted global improvement versus 14 per cent that saw a decline.\n\nViews on local economies also improved, with 48 per cent of regional respondents seeing a better domestic economy compared to 39 per cent six months ago. But the percentage of respondents who saw declining local economies also picked up, to 19 per cent from 10 per cent.\n\n\"That declining trend is very much influenced by two markets, Indonesia and Malaysia,\" said Harsha Basnayake, managing partner for transaction advisory services in Asean for Ernst and Young.\n\n\"Indonesia, there is an overhang because of the impending elections. People are expecting things to go a little bit more moderate than what it has been.\n\n\"Malaysia, the corporate sentiment has been quite low. It's surprisingly low even when we look at the overall statistics, because there is a lot of focus that is shifting away from growth and towards maintaining the status quo.\"\n\nSingapore corporates saw a significant improvement in sentiment, with views on an improving local economy growing to 37 per cent from 18 per cent six months ago, while declining views fell to 13 per cent from 28 per cent.\n\nThat optimism has led to a renewed focus on growth. In the region, 55 per cent of companies said they would focus on growth over the next 12 months, compared to 39 per cent in April.\n\nSentiment in the rest of the world seemed to be in sync, with 56 per cent in Singapore and 57 per cent globally also focused on growth.\n\nAcquisitions are also gaining prominence. Forty- one per cent of South-east Asian companies expect to pursue acquisition over the next 12 months, from 29 per cent in April.\n\nSingapore is one of the most eager markets in the region for acquiring, with 50 per cent of respondents looking at acquisitions, compared to 44 per cent six months ago.\n\nSingapore companies were looking most at China, Myanmar, India, Vietnam and Indonesia.

What is missing is the whole ecosystem. We have our network (and) our understanding of customers.\"\n\nStarHub's approach stands in marked contrast to rival SingTel's, which has busied itself with buyouts, from the US$321 million takeover of mobile ad firm Amobee to its $12 million purchase of HungryGoWhere.\n\nInstead, StarHub will use the partnership approach on multiple levels, spreading the start-up load among app developers, VC funds and higher education institutions. Its e-book venture, Booktique, was also a result of a partnership, Mr Tan said. Now, StarHub plans to focus on applications that address the increasing overlap between the home and office space, as well as on the retail and hospitality sectors.\n\nWhile StarHub still co-invests in start-ups, it plans to offer other forms of support as well, especially through the MediaHub building, which is scheduled for completion in Q1 2016 and has an estimated gross floor area of 21,400 sq m. Space will be allocated to start-ups that need room to incubate their ideas. \"All start-ups need Internet service (and) mobile services, so we can give them support in terms of infrastructure,\" Mr Tan said.\n\nElsewhere in the MediaHub, StarHub will house other facilities critical for its push into relatively uncharted territory - a social media analytics lab, big data platform and an \"adaptive\" production studio. There, StarHub hopes to refine features that will keep its pay-TV customers loyal in an age where television content is increasingly fragmented and available for free.\n\nThe key to remaining relevant, Mr Tan believed, is interactivity. \"People still like to watch things at the same time but the problem is that there is no conversation,\" he said. The conversations being analysed by the social media lab will help to shape \"live\" TV production in MediaHub's studio.\n\nOn the hardware end, the MediaHub will house a new central office - an exchange facility - for StarHub in 2016. It will be the telco's first in the western region, which will join the existing ones in the central and eastern parts of Singapore.\n\nMinister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim was the guest of honour at the groundbreaking ceremony.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/one-started-it-all", "site_title": "The one that started it all", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe one that started it all\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 26, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH a total market capitalisation of almost $61 billion as at November, Singapore's Reit and business trust (BT) market has come a long way.\n\nBut ask pioneers who helped seed the ground at the turn of the century, and they would be quick to point out that the successes enjoyed by today's Reit and BT market is the result of great perseverance and forward planning by the regulators, authorities and players involved.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid in 1999 when the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) first released guidelines for the formation of S-Reits, recalled Michael Smith, head of Asia ex-Japan real estate investment banking at Goldman Sachs.\n\nWhile this paved the road for S-Reits, the issue of tax transparency was not addressed initially, said Mr Smith, who was part of the working group that lobbied for regulators and issuers to devise the Reit framework.\n\nIn 2001, CapitaLand was the first to try to roll out a Reit - SingMall Property Trust (SPT) - under the new regime. \"It made sense for us. We had a lot of assets on our balance sheets and our debt was relatively high. From a developer's perspective, we want to go for an asset light model and create a stream of management fee income,\" said Wen Khai Meng, chief executive at CapitaLand Singapore.\n\nSPT faced a host of challenges from the onset however. This included constraints within the regulatory framework, tax transparency issues, and overcoming market perception of its viability.\n\nThe final blow came during SPT's IPO, when out of the 530 million units offered to the public, only 80 per cent were subscribed for. SPT's flotation was thus cancelled.\n\nUpon returning to the drawing board, the team realised that extensive education exercises for investors and the articulation of a business and growth strategy would be crucial.\n\nAddressing the question of total returns was key, said retail mall veteran Pua Seck Guan, who was then chief executive officer of the manager of the SPT, and later CapitaMall Trust Management.\n\nOne of the actions taken by the management involved freeing up some 50,000 sq ft from Junction 8's entire office tower and transferring it to its lower retail levels. This translated to rentals increasing by four or five times.\n\nThe term \"decanting\" was thus coined, as was the term \"asset enhancement initiative\" (AEI). Both terms are now used frequently within the industry.\n\nIndeed, the Reit platform instilled a form of discipline in the management team, forcing them to continuously look to their real estate to generate value for their shareholders, said Mr Pua.\n\nWhen the restructured CapitaMall Trust (CMT) returned to the market eight months later, it successfully raised $379 million as the first S-Reit listing.\n\nSignificantly, the Reit was complemented by a favourable tax ruling by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS), which stated that Reits did not have to pay taxes at the vehicle level if it distributed a minimum of 90 per cent of its distributable profit.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that CapitaLand, as the sponsor of CMT, was committed to the Reit's growth, said Tan Kok Huan, managing director, asset-backed structured products, capital markets group, at DBS Bank.\n\nIn addition to seeding the Reit with properties that had asset enhancement potential, CapitaLand supported CMT in its acquisition of IMM from a third party by providing a backstop. This meant that if CMT was unable to get unitholders to approve the fundraising, CapitaLand would backstop and acquire the property, thus giving CMT the certainty to bid for the property.\n\nCMT paved the way for other Reits. Since its listing, the market has moved from one milestone to another, including the first S-Reit with foreign assets in 2003 (Fortune Reit), the first commercial Reit listing in 2004 (CapitaCommercial Trust), the first business trust in 2006 (Pacific Shipping Trust), and the first stapled-security, CDL Hospitality Trust in 2006.\n\nToday, Singapore is Asia's largest Reit market excluding Japan, with market capitalisation having grown 32 times from 2003.\n\nPRODUCTION TEAM:Mindy Tan and Ong Chor Hao (BT Newsdesk), Eugene Teo (BTDigital), Yvonne Poh (BT Subs Desk), Khairie Rahmat (BT Art), Yen Meng Jiin (BT Photo)\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The strong demand allowed it to price the five-year sukuks tighter with a profit rate of 3.039 per cent. Islamic bonds do not allow interest.\n\n\"It was priced tighter because of support from sukuk and traditional bond investors,\" the source said.\n\nThe sukuk was sold in the Middle East, Europe and Asia.\n\nNet proceeds from the sale of the sukuk will be used by Ooredoo for general corporate purposes, including re-financing existing indebtedness.\n\nBookrunners for the deal are DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, QInvest and QNB Capital.\n\nDBS's ties with Ooredoo go back to 2009 when it became the only Asian bank to underwrite Qatar Telecom's inaugural US dollar bond issue. It was then the first international bond deal for a telecommunications company out of the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states.\n\nQatar Telecom rebranded Qtel as Ooredoo in February this year. Ooredoo, which means \"I want\" in Arabic, is the biggest phone operator in Qatar, the host of the 2022 soccer World Cup.\n\nOoredoo has stakes in Singapore's Asia Mobile Holdings (AMH) and Indonesia's Indosat.\n\nOoredoo has a 25 per cent stake in AMH, with the remainder owned by Singapore Technologies Telemedia (STT). AMH, incorporated in 2007, is the preferred investment vehicle for both Ooredoo and STT for investing in mobile operations in the Asia Pacific region, according to Ooredoo's website.\n\nAMH has a 56.55 per cent stake in StarHub, which equates to an Ooredoo effective stake of 14.14 per cent.\n\nReports said that a lot hinged on how Ooredoo's inaugural sukuk sale went, and some Qatari companies can now be expected to proceed with fund-raising given the strong interest from investors.\n\nQatar's government and companies are tapping debt markets as the nation embarks on US$138 billion of investments by 2016, said a Bloomberg report.

DBS will accept all valid tenders at the initial distribution rate of 4.7 per cent per annum, amounting to $805 million.\n\nOn the seemingly moderate response, a DBS spokeswoman said that over 70 per cent of investors who submitted applications opted for a rate of 4.7 per cent, at the bottom end of the tender range.\n\n\"Unlike other issues that are open to all qualifying investors, our tender offer was made available only to a select group, namely holders of DBS's existing $1.7 billion preference shares. In addition, we are aware that the current mandates of some institutional investors might not have allowed them to buy Basel III instruments,\" she said.\n\nChng Sok Hui, DBS chief financial officer, said that the innovative transaction aimed to achieve several objectives simultaneously. \"We enhanced the regulatory capital base by replacing non-qualifying preference shares with Basel III-compliant capital securities at the same dividend/distribution rate.\n\n\"At the same time, we wanted to give investors in the existing preference shares an opportunity to reinvest in the new capital securities. We are pleased that so many of the investors in these existing preference shares took note of DBS Bank's continuing right to redeem the existing preference shares and chose to express an interest to remain investors in the DBS Group by responding positively to this innovative tender offer that marks our first Basel III issue.\"\n\nThe spokeswoman added that both securities were priced at 4.7 per cent yield to first call date. \"However, the new capital securities have only 5.5 years to the first call date, whereas the existing preference shares have almost seven years to the first call date. The shorter tenor to call is worth 42 basis points.\"\n\n\"On that basis, the new capital securities represent good value relative to the existing preference shares,\" she said.\n\nAs for whether there would be another exchange for the preference shares that were not tendered, she said that depending on market conditions, \"we will study all available options\".\n\nIn 2010, the bank also sold a retail tranche of $800 million 4.7 per cent preference shares. In all, DBS has about $4 billion of capital securities which are not Basel III-compliant. Under the transitional Basel III rules, 10 per cent would not qualify as Tier 1 capital each year starting from January this year.\n\nDBS said that the perpetuals are expected to be issued on Dec 3. Moody's Investors Services has rated them Baa1 (hybrid). Fitch Ratings has rated them BBB (expected) as it will confirm the ratings after the issue date.\n\nDBS will be sending confirmations to holders as to whether their existing preference shares have been accepted for exchange. Holders should also check their CDP statement.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/wealth/wealth-investing/banking-3-rights", "site_title": "Banking on the 3-Rights", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBanking on the 3-Rights\n\nRight price, right business and right management are key, writes GENEVIEVE CUA\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 26, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFUNDS which profess to be absolutely return-oriented typically wield a number of tools to achieve this - cash, short sales of securities, market timing and derivatives, for instance. Not so for Yeoman Capital Management. The home-grown firm, whose flagship fund has an enviable 16-year track record, eschews cash and market timing in its quest for absolute returns. Instead, the Yeoman 3-Rights Value Asia Fund relies on old fashioned, long-only value stockpicking, and stays fully invested at any single point in time. So far, the results have been rewarding. In the current year to end-October, the fund has generated returns of 19.34 per cent, compared with the MSCI Far East ex Japan index return of 3.45 per cent.\n\nSince its inception in October 1997, the fund has achieved cumulative returns of more than 638 per cent, compared with the index return of 110 per cent. This translates to a compounded annual return of 13.3 per cent. An investor who put in $100,000 at inception would have seen his funds grow to more than $738,000 - a tidy nest egg.\n\nYeo Seng Chong, Yeoman's founder and chief executive, says undervaluation is the \"prime and only motivation for investing''. \"If we can't get undervaluation, we don't participate. The undervaluation is measured in terms of PE (price earnings multiple), dividend yield, free cash flow and discount to balance sheet book value. We also look at return on equity to make sure our stocks have capital efficiency.\n\n\"We have a track record and returns consistent with our methodology. Because we have not used cash as a buffer or timing tool, what you see today in performance is entirely due to security selection and portfolio construction.''\n\nThe basic premise is to view stocks as operating businesses. Risk is then defined not as price volatility but as the probability of a company going bust, and avoiding such instances that may result in \"total and permanent impairment'' of capital. The firm's discipline revolves around what Mr Yeo calls the three \"Rs''. These comprise the right price - that is, the share price should be below the assessed fair value. The second \"R'' is the right business, where companies should show a reasonably strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, a long operating and listing history and a track record of financial solvency. Businesses must be \"stable and staple''. \"Concepts work when there is a frenzy and investor hunger for them, but we're not sure it can be sustained, so we look for a business or product that is stable, that the real world might want.''\n\nThe third \"R'' is right management, with competent and honest people at board and management levels. Stocks are sold once valuations hit or exceed fair values. Industries the fund is currently exposed to include pharmaceuticals, textiles and apparel and electronic equipment.\n\nA commentary on Yeoman's website explains its approach: \"If we have the comfort of time on our side and the stocks that we own are backed by real businesses generating adequate earnings relative to our price at entry and the cost of the company's capital employed, then we are getting richer by the day, no matter where the market goes.\n\n\"If we get the '3-Rights' right, time is our friend. In the short term, price and value may not converge but over the longer term they surely must.''\n\nPoint of connection\n\nMr Yeo says that well before he founded Yeoman, he understood the connection between operating businesses and listed equities. He spent more than three decades in the public and private sectors before he started Yeoman, including stints in Centrepoint Properties, Metro Holdings and Singapore Technologies.\n\n\"I recognised that there is a certain logic that joins people who work in portfolio management dealing with listed equities, and people in the private arena. There is a point of connection that I saw ever so clearly - the economics of businesses, the profits generated and returns are important.\n\n\"Second, the price that you pay to acquire a business is important. And the management, whether you employ your own or take managers from a joint-venture partner. In the case of a private business, these factors are negotiated. In the public arena, the market gives you a traded price.\n\n\"We apply the private business approach and ported it to the public world. We look for businesses with the right economics, that are undervalued relative to the assessed merits of the business, and they must have management that are able to safeguard the interests of shareholders and ensure that the hoped-for benefits eventually accrue to us.''\n\nThe fund invests in around 70 stocks. Diversification is a key principle. On an equally weighted basis, the exposure to a single stock comes to about 1.4 per cent. \"If something doesn't work out in one stock and we suffer permanent and total impairment, we would have lost 1.4 per cent. But if the remaining stocks work out, and typically we pay 50 cents on the dollar - that is, we assess that the stock is worth $1 and we pay 50 cents - ... the loss would be more than covered.\n\n\"A lot of people spend time picking that one winner that makes a killing. We think that's best left to the person with a strong imagination. As stewards of other people's money, we can't take liberties. As we work on probabilities, this method of investing is very good. The reward is maximised through the '50 cents on the dollar' approach. Value will be realised at some point. Should something come up to hurt us, the loss is well contained.''\n\nWhile the strategy has generated consistent outperformance - the fund has outperformed the index in 13 out of 16 calendar years - it does not shield investors from short term losses. The worst year, for instance, was 2008 where the fund suffered a 47 per cent loss, compared to the index's loss of 48 per cent.\n\nStill, over its 16-year history, it has generated positive returns two-thirds of the time, compared with the index, which has chalked up positive returns 50 per cent of the time. Interestingly, the portfolio beta on a one-year basis is 0.55, which suggests it is less volatile than the market. Beta is a measure of risk or volatility relative to the market.\n\nInvestors therefore will have to be patient and take a longer horizon of at least three to five years. The fund, which has some $117 million in assets, has mostly individual investors. Institutions at the moment account for roughly 10 per cent. These include a family office and trusts. The fund is open only to accredited investors, and the minimum investment amount is $250,000.\n\nSays Mr Yeo: \"Not all investors will find us suitable. We tell people our methodology. We make no promises on short-term price movements; investors will have to be prepared to take short-term fluctuations.'' It would appear that Yeoman's clients understand this as there were no redemptions during the 2008 crisis. This helped the fund to avoid having to sell shares at low valuations to meet redemptions.\n\nHe adds: \"This is one benefit of a 16-year track record. We have every confidence in the way we've invested and what we've achieved. We look forward eagerly that clients will benefit, that over the future they'll be better off than today.'' An annual management fee of 1 per cent applies. There is also a performance fee of 15 per cent, subject to a high water mark. The latter means the fund has to exceed the previous high for the fee to be charged anew.\n\nThere are also early exit charges if investors hold for less than three years. The charge starts at 7.5 per cent for the first year, and reduces to 2.5 per cent by the third year. There is also a 1.5 per cent redemption charge that is paid to the fund to cover transaction charges such as brokerage costs.\n\ngen@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That would make it the world's second-largest gambling destination after Macau.\n\nSo far, the cities of Tokyo and Osaka have garnered much of the attention, but even towns like Sasebo, a once-proud shipbuilding centre in southern Japan, and the ageing port city of Otaru to the north, are hoping to set up casinos to draw tourists, generate tax revenues and reverse demographic decline.\n\n\"Hot springs, Japanese cuisine, Mt Fuji and geisha (female entertainers) - these traditional Japanese things alone are not enough,\" said Kanekiyo Morita, a hotel executive who has proposed a pyramid-shaped casino in Atami, a hot springs town in central Japan. \"Japan's population is rapidly declining and, for tourist towns, getting foreigners to visit is extremely important.\"\n\nLicensing matters\n\nLawmakers are planning to submit an initial bill aimed at legalising casinos by Dec 6 - when the current session of parliament ends - and enact concrete laws in 2015. The bill is thought to have a decent chance of passing with the business-friendly Liberal Democratic Party in power and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe backing the move.\n\nThe lawmakers have proposed two types of licences - one for large integrated resorts run by global operators featuring convention and entertainment facilities in addition to expansive gambling floors, and another for more compact gambling resorts in the countryside.\n\nBut they have also recommended that Japan limit the number of licences, prioritising locations promising the biggest economic impact and with the capacity to attract overseas tourists.\n\n\"I don't mean to negate Tokyo and Osaka,\" said Keiichi Kimura, who heads a consultancy and advises local governments and casino operators interested in Japan. \"But it's just not right to be focusing the debate on those two places only.\"\n\nLas Vegas Sands Corp and MGM Resorts International have made it clear that Osaka and the Tokyo region are their primary targets.\n\n\"These are the locations you can drive that kind of business tourism into and are known as commercial and financial hubs,\" George Tanasijevich, president of Las Vegas Sands unit Marina Bay Sands, told Reuters after a presentation in September in which he showed a mock-up for a casino resort on Tokyo Bay.\n\nWhile lawmakers have not indicated how many locations would be given the right to develop a casino, some politicians involved in the discussions have suggested that one or two licences might be allocated to big cities and one or two to regional economies.\n\nIn Sasebo in Nagasaki Prefecture, business and political leaders want to secure one of those spots for a proposed casino alongside the windmills and canals of Huis Ten Bosch, a theme park modelled on a 17th century Dutch town.\n\nThe complex, which would include a hotel and entertainment facilities in addition to gaming tables and slot machines, would generate nearly US$1 billion in annual revenues, the local group estimates, jolting new life into a region that once had a vibrant manufacturing sector but is increasingly reliant on tourism. The plan is to attract tourists from nearby South Korea, China and Taiwan in addition to locals.\n\n\"Tokyo shouldn't absorb everything,\" said Hideo Sawada, the chairman of travel agent H I S, which owns Huis Ten Bosch. \"We need balanced growth between Tokyo and the local cities.\"\n\nIn contrast to the massive resorts of Las Vegas and Singapore, aspiring hosts outside the big cities are looking to the more compact facilities of Europe as a guide.\n\nThe German spa town of Baden-Baden, which also has casinos, is serving as a model for casino proponents in two traditional hot springs towns - Atami, in Shizuoka Prefecture, and Naruto, in south-western Japan's Tokushima Prefecture.\n\nCasinos Austria AG and Switzerland's Grand Casino Luzern are both considering entering the Japanese market with a local partner but don't have billions of dollars to spend. To cut costs, they could use existing hotels and buildings.\n\n\"There are buildings that could be re-utilised and rejuvenated in Japan. That's a key feature of the European model,\" Grand Casino Luzern CEO Wolfgang Bliem, who recently spoke at casino conferences in Naruto and Tokyo, told Reuters. \"The casino operation should blend into the community.\"\n\nBig-ticket casinos set up in recent years have cost billions of dollars. The Marina Bay Sands, built on the mouth of the Singapore River, cost US$6 billion while the Sands Cotai Central that opened in Macau last year cost US$5 billion. Las Vegas magnate Steve Wynn has said his new Macau luxury resort, set to include a large lake with dancing water fountains and air-conditioned gondolas, will cost US$4 billion.\n\nThe northernmost island of Hokkaido is shaping up as one of the key casino battlegrounds with three locations - the port towns of Otaru and Tomakomai and Kushiro on the eastern coast - officially putting themselves forward as aspiring hosts.\n\nHokkaido, which draws tourists seeking a cooler location in the summer and skiers in the winter, has been cited by casino executives as one of the most attractive spots outside Tokyo and Osaka, along with the beaches of Okinawa in the south.\n\nCaesars Entertainment Corp said both Hokkaido and Okinawa were on its radar screen. It has visited officials in Kushiro, a Hokkaido city of 200,000 that is proposing a casino built around a hot springs resort that would also promote the culture of the indigenous Ainu people.\n\nCaesars is qualified to run a casino in Japan regardless of whether it is \"an urban resort in Tokyo or Osaka, a beach resort in Okinawa, or a mountain resort in Hokkaido\", said Steven Tight, head of the company's international development division.\n\nEconomic stimulation needed\n\nCasinos Austria is one of the global casino operators that has shown an interest in Otaru, a harbour town whose proximity to Sapporo, the biggest city on Hokkaido, is considered a key asset in the casino stakes.\n\nWhile Otaru attracts nearly seven million tourists a year, too many pass through, spending a fraction of what they would if they stayed overnight. Otaru mayor Yoshiharu Nakamatsu thinks a casino - perhaps one along the town's canal district or inside a retired cruise ship in the harbour - would change that.\n\nWithout a catalyst, he warns Otaru faces a bleak future. A third of its residents are above the age of 65, well above the national average and the highest among cities in Hokkaido. \"Our economy faces a negative spiral,\" he said in an interview last month. \"Otaru is not the only place with these problems.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

It is no longer a forbidding bookend to the grand axis of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. Now it feels like an extension of the park itself. The nearby Unisphere seems to be on display inside, so clear is the view through the glass curtain wall of the museum's facade.\n\nDaylight fills the new atrium, a space made possible by the removal of the ice rink that once shared the building. The light is gentle, softened and diffused by a great rectangular lantern suspended from the ceiling. Composed of 12 rows of angled, translucent glass panels, the lantern is reminiscent of lamps designed by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Except that it is 30 feet high.\n\nAdmirers of the museum's revered and quirky centrepiece - the Panorama of the City of New York, a 1-to-1,200 scale model of all five boroughs, constructed for the 1964-65 World's Fair - will find another reason to celebrate.\n\nThe Panorama can now be entered directly from the main lobby through a glass doorway that offers an intriguing glimpse of Coney Island, Sea Gate and Gravesend Bay.\n\nThe lobby floor was reset at the equivalent of sea level on the model, meaning that this five-foot-nine-inch reporter looks down on Brooklyn from the scale-model altitude of about 7,000 feet.\n\nTom Finkelpearl, the executive director of the Queens Museum (it shed \"of Art\" in the renovation), said he was in love with a shallow cascade of four steps, in a broad U-shape, that divide the lobby and create an informal sunken amphitheater. Museumgoers have already gravitated to these impromptu benches without prompting, voting with their seats.\n\nThis is a long way from where matters stood in January 2005, after museum and city officials decided to part ways with the architect Eric Owen Moss, to his dismay and evident surprise. Mr Moss had won a competition in 2002 to reimagine the museum, which was squeezed awkwardly into the New York City pavilion from the World's Fair of 1939-40.\n\nThat threw the choice of a new architect to a pilot procedure called the Design and Construction Excellence Program. Under one part of this programme, the city enters into standing procurement contracts with a short list of architectural firms, chosen for the quality of their work.\n\nThen, for the next couple of years, the Department of Design and Construction, together with the city agencies that are its clients, can call on any of those firms, as needed, to work on municipal projects.\n\nDavid Burney, the commissioner of design and construction, said the programme typically saved up to nine months from the process of securing architectural services. What's more, it all but ensures that the work will be handled by well-regarded, innovative designers.\n\nGrimshaw Architects, an international practice based in London, was on this list in 2004, as a joint venture with Ammann & Whitney of New York.\n\nMark Husser, the managing partner of Grimshaw's New York office, had worked under the federal design excellence programme on a courthouse in Denver when he was with the firm of Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum. So he was already convinced of the value of such an approach.\n\n\"That programme transformed America's investment in federal buildings and obviously became a prototype for cities and municipalities,\" Mr Husser said. \"When it became public that this would be part of the Bloomberg administration's design initiative, we were very interested.\" But Grimshaw had not yet designed any museums in North America.\n\n\"I hadn't heard of them,\" Mr Finkelpearl allowed.\n\nGrimshaw won the museum over.\n\n\"Grimshaw produced a menu that enabled Tom and his people to think through what they wanted to do with their money,\" Mr Burney said. He distinguished this approach from architectural competitions that leave clients trying to figure out how to pay for a highly publicised design, whether it serves their needs or not.\n\nMr Burney said his agency did not necessarily look to a firm's experience with a given building type when making a choice. \"We try to avoid the siloing of architects,\" he said.\n\nThe city's design excellence programme, which was in its experimental phase when the Queens Museum job came along, is now standard operating procedure. Six firms are currently eligible for projects worth US$15 million or more: Allied Works Architecture, BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group, Ennead Architects, Steven Holl Architects, Studio Gang Architects and TEN Arquitectos.

The first of the three tank barges - the largest-ever built by VT Halter Marine - was delivered on Nov 8.\n\nEarlier this month, ST Engineering reported a 10.3 per cent fall in net profit to $131.4 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30, on the back of weaker profits in its aerospace and land systems businesses.

But now, instead of a computer being unable to process \"00\" as the year \"2000\", the bogeyman of machinery is an actual man. Several men, in fact, wearing the same Guy Fawkes mask and threatening to wreak havoc on the digital economy that underpins the physical one.\n\nLike so many Agent Smiths in The Matrix, hackers have manifested themselves in a seemingly unending series of iterations all over the ether of the Internet. They are unrelenting and numerous, most of the time thought of as a collective and faceless menace.\n\nOne of them might have been unmasked earlier this month, and just yesterday, faced the court for the second time in connection with the hacking of the Ang Mo Kio town council website. As the police investigation runs its course, some imponderables might be answered.\n\nBut perhaps the larger point is that this is hardly a country-specific phenomenon.\n\nOne after another this year, key institutions of developed countries have fallen prey to hacking activities.\n\nThe websites of Australia's police force and the Reserve Bank of Australia were attacked just last week. Before that, more than 170 other Australian websites were defaced.\n\nIn March, hackers paralysed the computer networks of South Korea's banks and two of its broadcasters. This is the only Asian country in the OECD's top 10 most-wired countries apart from Japan - a fact of little consolation to anyone in South Korea or to anyone else aspiring towards its level of development.\n\nGallingly enough, just this month, a report prepared for US President Barack Obama by his Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found that: \"The federal government rarely follows accepted best practices.\"\n\n\"It needs to lead by example and accelerate its efforts to make routine cyber attacks more difficult by implementing best practices for its own systems,\" it added.\n\nIn the wake of the cyber attacks, the common reasoning among bureaucrats and executives globally has run along the lines of resource allocation. Of course, there will be a worse outcome, they will say. The question is, can we afford it?\n\nIt is worth considering if the risk - a function of expected loss and the probability of the loss happening - is being mispriced. The motives of hackers are no longer solely financial. Now they are opaque, ideological, constantly in flux and sometimes even non-existent.\n\nIt is perfectly legitimate to weigh the cost of a bad outcome against the cost of defending against that outcome. But the formula must be re-examined. If a cyber defence budget does not allow for irrationality or randomness in its calculation, it will be of little use. In order to play a game, both sides must understand the rules. And the rules have changed. Or maybe there aren't any rules.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The G Restaurant Awards were held earlier in May this year.\n\nFor the wine awards, more than 200 labels from over 12 countries were submitted by 31 importer-distributors for judging. A panel comprising 14 of Singapore's seasoned palates, such as Edwin Soon, Tan Kah Hin and Tan Ying Hsien, then evaluated the wines over two intense days of blind tastings to select the G Top 100 Wines for 2013.\n\nThe results were revealed before a crowd of more than 200 guests gathered at the V on Shenton show suites last night. Among the dignitaries in attendance were Ambassador of Italy to Singapore, HE Paolo Crudele and High Commissioner of the Republic of South Africa to Singapore, HE Hazel Francis Ngubeni.\n\nFrom the top wine list, 12 wines further received special accolades from the judges, such as the title of Most Drinkable Red Wine for the Sato Pinot Noir 2011; the Red Wine of the Year for the Vega Sicilia Alion 2007; the White Wine of the Year for the Churchview Estate The Bartondale Reserve Chardonnay 2011; and Sweet Wine of the Year for the Disznoko, Tokaji Aszu, 5 Puttonyos 2005.\n\n\"It's a definitive and authoritative list that will serve all wine enthusiasts well - whether one is an aficionado or just starting to appreciate wine,\" says Sylvester Ng, project editor of The Peak Selections: Gourmet and Travel.\n\nTop 12 list from the G Top 100 Wines for 2013\n\n1.

Only the owners of F&N's $108.25 million of 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 and $200 million of 6 per cent notes due 2019 had rejected the deal two weeks ago; holders of the $150 million of 3.62 per cent notes due 2015, $50 million of 2.54 per cent notes due 2015 and $220 million of 2.48 per cent notes due 2016 approved it.\n\nF&N will now have to decide how to deal with the bondholders who, by rejecting the deal, appeared to be calling F&N's bluff of a possible strategic default. If it chose to default, F&N could suffer consequences elsewhere, but would not have to pay bondholders as much.\n\n\"Now that the approval of this series of bondholders has been obtained, the F&N board should try its level best to work out an amicable solution as soon as possible to resolve the deadlock involving the two other series of bondholders who had earlier rejected the offer,\" corporate lawyer Robson Lee said. \"Certainty on the proposed divestment of F&N's property business is important for investors who intend to trade on F&N's shares.\"\n\nF&N shares closed unchanged at $5.72 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

OrangeTee estimates that one in five flats in Singapore are now sold at zero COV or even negative COV.\n\nOng Kah Seng, the director at R'ST Research, noting the moderation in resale prices, said: \"But that said, I think the BTO flats will cater to those who really want to have a more affordable option.\"\n\nEugene Lim, a key executive officer at ERA Realty, said, however, that demand from singles has not been met, so there will be continued oversubscription for two-room flats in this BTO exercise.\n\nIn Woodlands, HDB is offering 993 units of two- to five-room flats for the Admiralty Grove project between Woodlands Avenue 6 and Woodlands Drive 62. (See map for the prices at each project.)\n\nHougang Meadow along Upper Serangoon Road will have 732 flats, comprising studio apartments, three-room and four-room flats.\n\nThese two projects are expected to be popular, primarily because they are near MRT stations.\n\nHDB is also launching two projects in Jurong West: Boon Lay View and Yung Kuang Court.\n\nBoon Lay View, bounded by Jurong West Avenue 2, Corporation Road and Boon Lay Avenue, will have 810 homes. These will range from three-room to 3-Gen units.\n\nMs Li said the 3-Gen flats in Boon Lay could attract a fair bit of interest; it is only the second time the government has put such units on the market.\n\n3-Gen flats were launched alongside five-room flats in Yishun at the last BTO exercise to keen interest.\n\nAt Yung Kuang Court between Corporation Road and Yung Kuang Road, there will be 528 four- and five-room flats.\n\nThe biggest project by number of units offered yesterday was West Ridges @ Bukit Batok along Bukit Batok Road, with 1,578 two- to five-room flats.\n\nThe sixth and final BTO launch yesterday was EastLawn @ Canberra, located near Sungei Simpang Kiri and Sembawang Road, with 337 four and five-room flats.\n\nThe 3,974 SBF units are spread across 24 towns or estates, including Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Central and Queenstown. Prices start at $73,000 for a studio apartment and go up to $485,000 for an executive flat. Among them are two units at The Pinnacle @ Duxton, which Mr Lim thinks will be hotly contested because of their potential for capital appreciation in the resale market.\n\nThe launches yesterday brought total BTO supply this year to 25,139 flats. Together with balance and additional two-room flats from previous exercises, HDB has released 33,568 flats for sale this year.\n\nIn January, another 3,150 BTO flats in Bukit Batok, Jurong West, Punggol, Serangoon and Woodlands will be made available.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

DBS was the sole arranger of the issue.\n\nPrivate bank clients made up 98 per cent of investors while 99 per cent of the bonds were sold in Singapore.\n\nIncluding the latest deal, the property company has this year raised $600 million from the local debt market.\n\nThe shoebox apartment specialist has of late ventured overseas.\n\nEarly this month it acquired three freehold and three leasehold adjacent parcels of land in London's Royal Docks area.\n\nThe Royal Wharf development site, which was purchased at \u00a3200 million (S$405 million), yields an effective gross area of about 363,000 square metres.\n\nOxley has said that it intends to develop the parcels, which stretch for about 500 metres facing the River Thames, into more than 3,400 homes, along with a mix of commercial, retail, leisure and educational facilities.\n\nThis came hot on the heels of a ramp-up in overseas acquisitions over the quarter. In July, Oxley unveiled separate acquisitions of three plots of land in Cambodia.

The president of one of the companies, Hua Yuan Property Company Ltd's Ren Zhiqiang, said in a posting on an Internet microblogging site that he's considering whether to pursue legal action against the broadcaster.\n\nCCTV has attracted attention internationally this year, with reports that previously targeted global companies operating in China, including Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd over quality and service issues, and Starbucks Corp over pricing.\n\nThe row over the broadcast comes as home prices in large Chinese cities have set records, despite a four- year-long government campaign to cool the property market, raising concerns over a potential price bubble. Officials at CCTV weren't immediately available for comment early on Tuesday.\n\nIn the broadcast that aired on Sunday, CCTV cited calculations by a Beijing-based lawyer, Li Jinsong, as showing 45 listed property firms were among developers that should have paid more than 4.6 trillion yuan in land taxes from 2005 to 2012. According to the calculations, the authorities collected only 800 billion yuan for the period.\n\nOther companies named in the report include China Vanke Co Ltd, the country's largest property developer by sales, and Agile Property Holdings.\n\nFitch Ratings said in a report on Monday that land taxes payable in future aren't a major concern for the Chinese property developers on which it issues ratings. \"The payables arise from the timing gap between when property is delivered and taxes are paid, and the practices of developers in this regard are normal and consistent in China,\" the ratings agency said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This was largely a result of most segments expanding amid improved demand.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde: \"This is the strongest increase since November 2010, suggesting the sector is enjoying something of a renaissance after a couple of years that can only be described as utterly miserable.\"\n\nCiti economist Kit Wei Zheng noted that the pick-up in electronics industrial production was in line with more upbeat global leading indicators of electronics demand.\n\nIn particular, the semiconductor segment - which accounts for one-fifth of all manufacturing output - expanded 20.3 per cent in October.\n\nBut economists from UOB and CIMB told BT that the climb in electronics output stemmed largely from base effects.\n\nSaid UOB's Francis Tan: \"I think we more or less expected this (year-on-year surge in electronics output), because it's due to the low base seen this time last year, so it's not a stellar result actually. (But) electronics is certainly ticking upwards and on a recovery trend - it's just that the trajectory is slower with a gently rising slope.\"\n\nAdded CIMB's Song Seng Wun: \"The base effect inevitably exaggerates the extent of the recovery, but I think the data still points to clear signs of improvement (in electronics). We can quibble about the magnitude (of such a recovery), but the direction is there, and that's important.\"\n\nBoth economists expect the electronics sector to continue to post double-digit increases in output in the coming months - lifting overall industrial production growth as a result - mainly because of a low base recorded in the latter part of 2012 and the beginning of this year.\n\nThe transport and engineering sector also gave a leg-up to October's numbers, expanding 8.9 per cent from a year ago. Supported by higher contributions from rig building projects, the marine & offshore engineering segment expanded 17.8 per cent. In contrast, the land and aerospace segments declined 3.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent, respectively.\n\nOutput of the precision engineering cluster grew 5 per cent from a year ago, buoyed by higher output in the machinery & systems segment. Output of the remaining clusters - chemicals, general manufacturing and biomedical manufacturing - fell a respective 0.9 per cent, 1.6 per cent, and 2.3 per cent in October compared to a year ago.\n\nSaid OCBC economist Selena Ling: \"This data set confirmed that the biomedical cluster is currently undergoing a soft patch, but the electronics recovery theme is intact. (The growth in manufacturing output) should continue to pick up momentum in 2014 as the global economy, particularly the G3, stages a stronger recovery.\n\n\"We are looking for Singapore's manufacturing growth to more than double from our forecast of 1.4 per cent year-on-year in 2013 to 3.7 per cent year-on-year in 2014,\" said Ms Ling.\n\nEDB said that after adjusting for seasonal factors, industrial production was unchanged month-on-month in October. Excluding biomedical manufacturing, output would have grown 0.2 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Typically, Wild Rice takes a well-loved fairy tale and rewrites it with a local setting, politically incorrect jokes and gender-bending characters.\n\nUnfortunately, not all pantomimes are created equal. And this year's Jack & the Bean-Sprout suffers from a somewhat draggy script and some half-baked jokes.\n\nIf not for the presence of a few strong comic actors, who miraculously turn passable jokes into good ones, the eye-popping production design and Ivan Heng's directorial embellishments, this Jack could have been a humdrum affair.\n\nTroubles begin early when kopitiam assistants Siew Dai (Jo Tan) and Kopi Gao (Candice De Rozario) attempt to warm up the audience with jokes that fail to take off. Trying to milk humour from mispronouncing \"trial\" as \"tra-yel\" can only go so far; mixing up \"huat\" with \"what\" and \"Ah Kow\" with \"a cow\" is a bad idea.\n\nFortunately, Caleb Goh as the lead Jack holds the stage well, as does Darius Tan as Jack's diva-esque mother. It's perhaps apt that Siti Khalijah plays the goose that lays the golden eggs, while Karen Tan plays the Golden Hits Harp - these comedians are worth their weight in gold. The script is credited to Joel Tan, but it's not uncommon for the cast and director to generate some of their own jokes during rehearsals.\n\nProduction design is uniformly strong, though this reviewer particularly loves Ian Bailie's Pop Art set design that turns Jack's Hougang estate into a candy-coloured wonderland.\n\nIf you're not too critical about your entertainment, you'll certainly have a jolly good time.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/property/new-wave-us-mortgage-trouble-threatens", "site_title": "New wave of US mortgage trouble threatens", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNew wave of US mortgage trouble threatens\n\nHome equity lines of credit could deal another blow to nation's top banks\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 27, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[NEW YORK] US borrowers are increasingly missing payments on home equity lines of credit they took out during the housing bubble, a trend that could deal another blow to the country's biggest banks.\n\nThe loans are a problem now because an increasing number are hitting their 10-year anniversary, at which point borrowers usually must start paying down the principal on the loans as well as the interest they had been paying all along.\n\nMore than US$221 billion of these loans at the largest banks will hit this mark over the next four years, about 40 per cent of the home equity lines of credit now outstanding.\n\nFor a typical consumer, that shift can translate to their monthly payment more than tripling, a particular burden for the sub-prime borrowers that often took out these loans. And payments will rise further when the Federal Reserve starts to hike rates, because the loans usually carry floating interest rates.\n\nThe number of borrowers missing payments around the 10-year point can double in their eleventh year, data from consumer credit agency Equifax shows. When the loans go bad, banks can lose an eye-popping 90 cents on the US dollar, because a home equity line of credit is usually the second mortgage a borrower has.\n\nIf the bank forecloses, most of the proceeds of the sale pay off the main mortgage, leaving little for the home equity lender.\n\nThere are scenarios where everything works out fine. For example, if economic growth picks up, and home prices rise, borrowers may be able to refinance their main mortgage and their home equity lines of credit into a single new fixed-rate loan. Some borrowers would also be able to repay their loans by selling their homes into a strengthening market.\n\nBut some regulators, rating agencies, and analysts are alarmed. The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a regulator overseeing national banks, has been warning banks about the risk of home equity lines since the spring of 2012. It is pressing banks to quantify their risks and minimise them where possible.\n\nAt a conference last month in Washington, DC, Amy Crews Cutts, the chief economist at consumer credit agency Equifax, told mortgage bankers that an increase in tens of thousands of homeowners' monthly payments on these home equity lines is a pending \"wave of disaster\".\n\nBanks marketed home equity lines of credit aggressively before the housing bubble burst, and consumers were all too happy to use these loans like a cheaper version of credit card debt, paying for vacations and cars.\n\nThe big banks, including Bank of America Corp (BOA), Wells Fargo & Co, Citigroup Inc, and JPMorgan Chase & Co have more than US$10 billion of these home equity lines of credit on their books each, and in some cases much more than that.\n\nHow bad home equity lines of credit end up being for banks will hinge on the percentage of loans that default. Analysts struggle to forecast that number.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, losses will edge higher from current levels, and will be entirely manageable. But the worst-case scenario for some banks could be bad, eating deeply into their earnings and potentially cutting into their equity levels at a time when banks are under pressure to boost capital levels.\n\n\"We just don't know how close people are until they ultimately do hit delinquencies,\" said Darrin Benhart, the deputy comptroller for credit and market risk at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Banks can get some idea from updated credit scores, but \"it's difficult to ferret that risk out,\" he noted.\n\nWhat is happening with home equity lines of credit illustrates how the mortgage bubble that formed in the years before the financial crisis is still hurting banks, even seven years after it burst. By many measures the mortgage market has yet to recover: The federal government still backs nine out of every 10 home loans, 4.6 million foreclosures have been completed, and borrowers with excellent credit scores are still being denied loans.\n\nBanks have some options for reducing their losses. They can encourage borrowers to sign up for a workout programme if they will not be able to make their payments.\n\nIn some cases, they can change the terms of the lines of credit to allow borrowers to pay only interest on their loans for a longer period, or to take longer to repay principal.\n\nA BOA spokesman said in a statement that the bank is reaching out to customers more than a year before they have to start repaying principal on their loans, to explain options for refinancing or modifying their loans.\n\nBut these measures will only help so much, said Ms Crews Cutts. \"There's no easy out on this.\"\n\nBetween the end of 2003 and the end of 2007, outstanding debt on banks' home equity lines of credit jumped by 77 per cent, to US$611.4 billion from US$346.1 billion, according to FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) data, and while not every loan requires borrowers to start repaying principal after 10 years, most do.\n\nThese loans were attractive to banks during the housing boom, in part because lenders thought they could rely on the collateral value of the home to keep rising.\n\n\"These are very profitable at the beginning. People will take out these lines and make the early payments that are due,\" said Anthony Sanders, a professor of real estate finance at George Mason University who used to be a mortgage bond analyst at Deutsche Bank.\n\nBut after 10 years, a consumer with a US$30,000 home equity line of credit and an initial interest rate of 3.25 per cent would see their required payment jumping to US$293.16 from US$81.25, analysts from Fitch Ratings calculate. That's why the loans are starting to look problematic: For home equity lines of credit made in 2003, missed payments have already started jumping.\n\nBorrowers are delinquent on about 5.6 per cent of loans made in 2003 that have hit their 10-year mark, Equifax data show, a figure that the agency estimates could rise to around 6 per cent this year. That's a big jump from 2012, when delinquencies for loans from 2003 were closer to 3 per cent.\n\nThis scenario will be increasingly common in the coming years: in 2014, borrowers on US$29 billion of these loans at the biggest banks will see their monthly payment jump, followed by US$53 billion in 2015, US$66 billion in 2016, and US$73 billion in 2017.\n\nThe Federal Reserve could start raising rates as soon as July 2015, interest-rate futures markets show, which would also lift borrowers' monthly payments. The rising payments that consumers face \"is the single largest risk that impacts the home equity book in Citi Holdings\", Citigroup finance chief John Gerspach said on an Oct 16 conference call with analysts.\n\nA high percentage of home equity lines of credit went to people with bad credit to begin with - over 16 per cent of the home equity loans made in 2006, for example, went to people with credit scores below 659, seen by many banks as the dividing line between prime and sub-prime. In 2001, about 12 per cent of home equity borrowers were sub-prime. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

But the pace of growth slowed in many places. Those gains are also a double-edged sword. Rising values are essential for the approximately seven million Americans whose mortgages are larger than their homes are worth. But housing affordability has suffered as a result, just as interest rates have moved significantly higher.\n\nNew regulations slated to take effect in January could also make it more difficult for many potential home buyers to qualify for a loan.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that the recovery in home sales has at least stalled,\" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics.\n\nReal estate had been a source of strength for the nation's economy after spending years in the rubble of the financial crisis.\n\nThe housing market was ground zero for the dangerous combination of insatiable demand and shady lending that triggered the country's financial crash. Many economists believe the recovery will not be sustainable until the sector is fully healed. Analysts had predicted that rising home prices, record-low mortgage rates and growing consumer demand would galvanise the industry, rebuilding household wealth and creating new jobs.\n\nThe housing market has made significant progress since bottoming out in 2009. The S&P/Case-Shiller index showed that home values are now on par with prices in 2004. The number of homes lost to foreclosure dropped 39 per cent in September compared with a year ago, according to CoreLogic. Owners are increasingly paying their mortgages on time. In the Washington region, prices gained 7 per cent in September from a year ago.\n\nBut other data released this week showed the sector is losing some of its lustre. Contracts to buy existing homes fell for the fifth straight month in October.\n\nMany analysts blame this on the rise in mortgage rates. Their unexpected climb began in late spring and undermined the real estate market's strength. From March to September, the average rate on a 30-year fixed loan shot up a percentage point, to nearly 4.5 per cent. Rates have since eased back down to 4.2 per cent, but analysts say it is unlikely they will return to last year's rock-bottom levels.\n\n\"Home buyers are trying to digest that,\" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. \"That has sucked some of the momentum out of the housing recovery, no doubt about it.\"\n\nThe run-up in rates was due in large part to Federal Reserve policies. The central bank helped push down long-term interest rates by buying US$85 billion a month in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities. But officials began suggesting in the spring that the economy could soon be strong enough for them to begin winding down that program. The prospect spooked investors, sending stock markets plunging and bond yields soaring - pushing up interest rates in the process.\n\n\"Everything hinges on the ability of the Fed to manage long-term rates higher,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"If they're not able to manage that, then the recovery is going to be disappointing.\"\n\nThe rapid increase in mortgage rates not only dampened enthusiasm among traditional home buyers, but it also turned away real estate investors who are often the primary bidders in hard-hit neighbourhoods. The declining stock of distressed properties combined with higher rates has made real estate a less attractive proposition for both institutional and mom-and-pop investors. In addition, the increase in rates choked off the refinancing business.\n\nThe Fed has since attempted to walk back some of its statements. Chairman Ben Bernanke and his nominated successor, Janet Yellen, have emphasised that the central bank is committed to supporting the recovery. And even after the Fed ends its bond-buying programme, short-term interest rates will likely remain near zero throughout next year.\n\nBut the housing market is poised to face a new headwind: New rules slated to take effect in January could make it more difficult for potential home buyers to qualify for a loan. The regulations require lenders to ensure that no more than 43 per cent of borrowers' income is being used to pay down debt, among other things.\n\nSome economists say the housing recovery won't be derailed by these speed bumps. A pickup in hiring, resilient consumer spending and a moderation in interest rates should keep the sector humming at least through the end of the year.\n\nBut it is no longer expected to be the driver of growth that many had predicted. Some analysts doubt those strong gains will ever materialise. Others have merely pushed their forecasts out another year.\n\n\"I still think housing is going to be a big plus for the economy,\" Mr Zandi said. \"But the timing is more questionable.\" - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This year's 15,000 traders consist of 3,500 new traders, 3,000 dormant traders who resumed trading and 8,500 traders who trade continuously.\n\nThe absolute number of forex traders, both retail and professionals, may have shrunk but volumes have exploded, driven by technology and the Internet, said Mr Yohannan.\n\nSingapore this year leapfrogged Japan to become the third-largest FX centre in the world - after London and New York - and the largest in Asia. Global banks, sovereign wealth funds and multinationals are increasingly basing their regional or treasury headquarters here.\n\nThe latest survey by the Bank for International Settlements noted that the average daily FX turnover volume here grew 44 per cent to US$383 billion in April this year, from US$266 billion in April 2010. Global turnover growth was 35 per cent during that period.\n\nGlobally, forex trading averaged US$5.3 trillion per day in April, up from US$4 trillion in 2010 and US$3.3 trillion in 2007.\n\n\"We're seeing a very healthy increase in the number of traders,\" said Mr Yohannan. \"OANDA is seeing double-digit growth in clients and volume.\"\n\nThe global financial crisis and the eurozone's troubles and then this year's turmoil in the currencies of several emerging markets, such as the Indonesian rupiah and India's rupee, as well as \"Abenomics\" attracts traders as volatility offers profit opportunities.\n\n\"Volatility is what retail FX traders look forward to as does the industry,\" he said.\n\nOANDA's success in attracting retail customers is a result of its transparent business model, he said.\n\nThe firm does not charge any commission; it makes money from quoting a spread to customers. Put simply, it means OANDA enjoys wholesale prices like banks while charging clients retail rates.\n\nClients fall into three categories - full-time traders, professionals such as doctors who trade as a sideline and newbies such as housewives, he said.\n\nIn fact, the fabled Japanese housewife Mrs Watanabe has long been a fixture of the industry. Japan has the largest retail forex market in the world, though trading volumes fell in the second half of this year as the yen stabilised.\n\nForex trading is not for the faint-hearted, though. In the second quarter of 2013, US forex brokers reported that 35 per cent of retail forex traders made money, with 65 per cent experiencing losses.\n\nMr Yohannan said there is no public data for Singapore, but added that the number of OANDA's traders who are profitable is very high relative to the industry. Clients are encouraged to start with small trades, and can practise on OANDA's demo platform free for life, he said.\n\nThe firm has a host of risk controls, he said. Leverage is 50 to one, which means the trader can bet up to $50 for every $1 he puts in. This compares with 25 to one for Japan and 400 to one in Australia.\n\nMr Yohannan said some 70-80 per cent of OANDA's customers' trades are in euro/dollar, followed by the aussie and yen. Customers from Hong Kong, China and India sometimes trade gold, too.\n\nSingapore residents make up about 60 per cent of its clients, with the rest from all over Asia, he said. The Asian business makes up 40 per cent of the group total. Incorporated in 1995, the group has offices in Chicago, London, Singapore, Tokyo, Toronto and Zurich.\n\nExpansion in Asia and partnerships with banks and brokers are next year's priority, he said.\n\n\"We already have Japan, we want to seriously make a foray into a few other markets; geographic expansion is one significant strategy for 2014, we do think we're something of a well-kept secret,\" he said.\n\nIn particular, he is looking to expand to other South-east Asian markets, Australia and New Zealand. OANDA will also do more in Japan, he said.\n\nThe firm wants to expand some of the channels that it has to reach out to more customers and is looking at partnership opportunities with banks, brokers and other financial institutions, he said.\n\nNegotiations with potential partners, including Singapore banks, are at a \"very high level\", he said.\n\nAs the Internet became widespread in 1995, OANDA was the first to make comprehensive currency exchange information available over the Internet. According to the group website, \"OANDA Rate\u00ae\" data has become the touchstone for corporations, tax authorities, auditing firms and even central banks.\n\nOANDA was co-founded by Michael Stumm, a professor of computer engineering at the University of Toronto, and Richard Olsen of The Olsen Ltd, an econometric research and development firm.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In light of this, PwC called for it to be extended, given that many companies are still in transition and need the support that PIC offers.\n\nBesides recommending these tune-ups for PIC, PwC also suggested that the government liberalise the restrictions on the enhanced tax deductions to include research and development (R&D) undertaken overseas.\n\nUnder the PIC scheme, companies which undertake R&D are eligible for an enhanced tax deduction of 400 per cent for up to $400,000 of eligible R&D expenditure. Beyond that limit, an enhanced deduction of 150 per cent of the balance of the qualifying R&D expenditure is available - but only if the R&D is done in Singapore.\n\nPwC said that some R&D, by their very nature, must be carried out at least partly overseas. \"An example of this would be in the pharmaceutical industry, where R&D conducted in connection with clinical testing of a new drug often needs to be conducted outside Singapore, simply because of the required population size for conducting a statistically significant clinical trial.\"\n\nFor R&D costs incurred overseas, a company would be able to claim that enhanced tax deduction of 400 per cent for the first $400,000 in expenditure; for R&D expenditures incurred overseas beyond that sum, the deduction is only 100 per cent, not 150 per cent.\n\nIn contrast, a company in another industry in which it is possible to do all R&D within Singapore shores would not be bound by such a restriction in terms of tax deductions. \"Such (an) anomaly should be properly addressed,\" said PwC.\n\nThe firm has also proposed new ways to manage costs for individuals, going beyond its usual exhortation to the government to \"stop allowing individuals to use CPF savings to finance property and investments (since this) results in an asset-rich, cash-poor retirement and contributes to an artificially inflated market for property\".\n\nAs telecommuting and home offices become more widespread, PwC suggested that those who work from home be given personal tax relief, as their home and resources are partially used for employment purposes. Britain and the US have such reliefs in place to allow for deductions for work-related expenses, such as business telephone calls and additional utilities.\n\nPwC has also called for progressive, structural tax changes to be considered over giving out of one-time rebates, \"(which have) now happened so regularly in recent years that (they are) becoming something of an expectation\".\n\n\"Rather than giving another one-time rebate . . . those revenues could be used to help the lower-income group through a more structural change in the tax rates,\" said PwC.\n\nIt proposes that the lowest two tax bands be abolished. This will do away with the 2 per cent on income from $20,000 to $30,000 and the 3.5 per cent on income from the $30,000 to $40,000 bands. \"Alternatively, channelling the surplus into more GST rebates and offsets for lower earners would make the tax structure more progressive.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But that conservative stance has nevertheless allowed SPH to maintain annual returns of about 4 per cent from the funds, he said.\n\nMr Lee addressed concerns that the company's cash is yielding slow returns by noting that despite some short-term pains, SPH is focused on the long term.\n\n\"Some of these investments that we make have a fairly long gestation period,\" he said, adding that \"when we invest in technology platforms . . . it takes many years for them to return a profit\".\n\nMr Lee also acknowledged that the past year has been challenging for the company as net profit declined. He noted that the yield from digital products is significantly lower than for print products, but he sees that as a necessary investment in the future as print circulation continues to come under pressure.\n\nPrint circulation for SPH's newspapers fell over the past year, but digital circulation grew for most products to increase overall subscriptions.\n\nThe Straits Times, SPH's flagship product, had 449,200 total subscriptions as at August 2013, of which 116,900 were digital.\n\nAll of these are \"part of the changes we are facing\", Mr Lee said.\n\nShareholder Vincent Tan asked if the company has to put more effort into making its core newspapers more relevant to its readers, and whether some of its costs, such as overseas correspondents, still make sense.\n\nMr Lee assured him that addressing relevance is a top priority for management.\n\nBut he also stressed that the company, which is actively trying to contain costs, does not want to sacrifice quality simply to cut expenses.\n\n\"We are a newspaper for the whole of Singapore and Singapore is closely engaged with the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nHe also rejected a suggestion to pursue a more aggressive share-buyback programme, saying that core business growth should be the focus of the company rather than more immediate returns.\n\n\"This is positioning SPH for the future,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nShares in SPH closed at $4.26 yesterday, up 0.2 per cent or one cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The FIPB had initially given its verbal approval in October. SIA will now need to seek further approvals, such as a no-objection certificate from India's Ministry of Civil Aviation and a scheduled air operator's permit from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation.\n\nTata will have a 51 per cent stake in the New Delhi-based airline, while SIA will hold 49 per cent.

At the same time, nine out of 11 sectors have scaled down on expansion plans.\n\nThe dip in capacity utilisation might have prompted the move as companies producing at close to full capacity slipped to 24 per cent from 28 per cent in the previous quarter. Almost half of the manufacturers are operating within 61-80 per cent capacity.\n\nConsumers were likewise less confident about the coming months, their concerns centred mainly on expectations of higher prices. Some 88 per cent of respondents - the most since Q2 2011 - expect this will happen soon. Low-income, urban and eastern (states') consumers were the most apprehensive.\n\nThe Consumer Sentiments Index (CSI) dipped for the second consecutive quarter to 102 points from about 110 points. Mier said confidence remains, given the CSI registered above the 100-points threshold.\n\nEven so, the survey indicates consumers plan to ease up on spending because of job and income concerns. Respondents revealed less ambitious shopping plans and a lower appetite for houses, cars, furniture, washing machines, televisions and personal computers.\n\nThat said, automotive sales for the year to end-September were 6 per cent higher, and industry players remain confident of achieving record sales this year.\n\nThe central bank has projected economic growth next year will remain robust at 5-5.5 per cent.\n\nBut in the remaining months of 2013, there are signs aplenty of higher prices.\n\nIn an effort to curb the budget deficit and public debt, Putrajaya has said it will further reduce fuel subsidies next year. Electricity rates are also scheduled to rise by as much as a fifth according to the energy minister, while assessment charges for Kuala Lumpur property owners are being revised upwards.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Dr Balakrishnan pointed to a decision at the Warsaw climate conference that paves the way for international coordination of efforts to help vulnerable countries deal with future climate-related harm they say is inevitable. This new mechanism, to be set up by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, aims to deal with \"loss and damage\" from climate change.\n\nHe also referred to existing agreements to curb emissions to keep global temperature rise to within 2 degrees Celsius by 2100; and the establishment of institutions such as the Green Climate fund, to disburse public finance for climate aid to poor and vulnerable countries up to 2020.\n\nNonetheless, he cautioned: \"We've set up deadlines, institutions, mechanisms. But guess what? All of these are empty shells - meaning unless in the next two years we can make tough, hard decisions, the deadlines, funds, mechanisms will just remain negotiating (tools). The political capital, the real money, isn't there yet.\n\n\"That's why I'm pessimistic. But my own sense is at some point the world will face enough disasters, and people will come to their senses, and they will put political pressure on politicians to do the right thing. But it may not happen quickly enough.\"\n\nSingapore, however, is unique in that its very vulnerability has made it acutely conscious of environmental impacts since its conception as a sovereign state almost 50 years ago, Dr Balakrishnan noted.\n\n\"In the case of water, we've taken a strategic vulnerability and converted it to a strategic opportunity. Because we are painfully aware of our vulnerability in water, we've committed to achieving self-sufficiency well before 2061 (which is when Singapore's water agreement with Malaysia runs out.) Ten years ago, the application of reverse osmosis allowed us to recycle and desalinate water at a viable price, and that has given us great confidence that we can achieve self-sufficiency in water,\" he said. \"That's how we need to approach environment challenges: converting them to business opportunities.\"\n\nDr Balakrishnan also noted that governments have to create a sense of long-term stability and regulatory certainty, without which problems relating to climate change at a global level, or transboundary haze at a regional level, will not be resolved.\n\n\"Today, most of us are not aware of the sources or origins of products we use, or the impact of their production processes on our children's future. But increasingly, I believe people are going to demand answers and that will put political pressure on politicians to make the right decisions, and on businesses to do the right thing in the long term.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They only declined in Wenzhou.\n\nFormer Premier Wen Jiabao in March stepped up a three-year campaign to contain price gains, ordering cities with excessive increases to raise downpayments. China's 35 provincial-level cities have set annual home-price targets this year by mostly capping local income growth.\n\nThe new round of local government measures are more \"symbolic\" rather than having a real impact on the market because second-home buyers only account for about 10 per cent of home sales, the Centaline researcher said.\n\nThe northern city of Shenyang and the eastern cities of Nanchang and Xiamen also said on Tuesday they will raise second-home downpayments.\n\nHome prices in Nanjing jumped 13 per cent last month from a year earlier, while Hangzhou rose 6.7 per cent, according to SouFun Holdings Ltd, China's biggest real estate website owner. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The mainboard-listed company's two 60-metre anchor handling tug-and-supply vessels will be deployed immediately after the group takes their delivery next month and in January. The first vessel will be deployed for at least a year in the Middle East, with a sale-and-purchase option exercisable after the charter period.

Revenue for the quarter fell 69 per cent year on year to $7.7 million as a result of the spin-off of Norr Offshore Group and a significant drop in contributions from subsidiaries.

This was despite registering a 12.4 per cent drop in revenue to $146.6 million, due mainly to lower revenue recognition for ongoing projects than in FY 2012.

Since 2009, Geodis has been leasing space at GLP Park Pudong Heqing in Shanghai.\n\n\"We have been very satisfied with their extensive network, high-quality facilities and professional service. GLP is the first place we look when we expand in China,\" SK Yeung, managing director of Geodis Wilson Greater China, said.\n\nMeanwhile, the launch of GLP's China-focused logistics infrastructure fund (CLF Fund 1) will be transformational for the company.\n\nThe fund, which is the largest of its type in the world, is focused on the development of logistics infrastructure in China. GLP will seed the fund with land to support 1.8 million sq m of leasable area. In addition, a US$1 billion credit facility has been secured from China Merchants Bank to fund development activity in China.\n\nAs the asset manager, GLP will retain a 56 per cent stake in the fund. Equity commitments to the fund stand at US$1.5 billion, with a total investment capacity of US$3 billion over a period of three years.\n\nFollowing the launch of the fund and the recently announced sale of nine properties to GLP J-Reit, GLP's fund management platform stands at US$11.4 billion of assets under management, up from US$2.6 billion a year ago.\n\nOn the portfolio front, China registered a strong quarter of leasing in Q2, with 575,000 sq m of new and expansion leases, up 60 per cent year-on-year.

Mid-term elections will also play out in the United States, as will the parliamentary elections for the European Union (EU).\n\nMr Franklin said that incumbent governments are in a shaky position in some of these countries, and fringe parties have emerged and could do well. In India, for instance, firebrand opposition leader Narendra Modi could become the country's next prime minister.\n\n\"He is undoubtedly a controversial figure and will certainly shake things up in India,\" said Mr Franklin.\n\nThe political and social unrest that erupted this year in countries such as Brazil and Turkey is likely to spill over into the new year. The Economist expects more countries than before to make it to its 2014 \"Most Risky List\", a ranking of social-unrest hotspots.\n\n\"The reasons for this are many, but include the impact of the austerity and recession, as well as dissatisfaction with mainstream politics,\" said Mr Franklin.\n\nMajor shifts are also likely on the economic front next year, with a lot of good news expected to come from the rich world rather than the emerging markets.\n\n\"Since the economic crisis (of 2009), the rich world has been in huge trouble and the emerging world has been the dynamo (of growth). Now, a number of emerging economies are experiencing a difficult period - and this is certainly true for places like Brazil and India,\" Mr Franklin suggested.\n\nBut the US economy is doing better. It is tipped to do well next year, helped in part by its banking system remaining resilient to shocks from the eurozone.\n\nJapan's prospects for the year also appear brighter, boosted by Abenomics; even Europe is growing, albeit slowly.\n\nInterestingly, another factor working in favour of the US economy's resurgence is the emergence of shale gas as a major energy source. Mr Franklin said that besides making a difference to the cost of production in the US, it will make the US a net energy exporter - zipping ahead of Russia and also Saudi Arabia as the world's overall largest energy producer, taking into account both oil and gas.\n\nThis will trigger knock-on effects in the US economy and provide a psychological boost to the country's overall resilience.\n\nThe Economist expects that investment interest will rediscover the rich world as an attractive destination, rather than send funds into emerging markets. This will be important for countries such as Singapore, which is very sensitive to trends in global trade, he said.\n\nThe magazine predicts that Singapore will grow by 3.8 per cent next year, as a resurgence among the advanced economies bump up global trade volumes, even though Asia may slow down.\n\nTopping the list of big sporting shows next year is the football World Cup hosted by Brazil. Russia will host the Winter Olympics and Scotland, the Commonwealth Games.\n\nMr Franklin believes that while the Winter Olympics will be Russian President Vladimir Putin's opening to showcase his country to the world, all eyes will be on Brazil's big event. Cynics have questioned the samba nation's ability to host the event - not least because of its poor infrastructure and social unrest - but Mr Franklin is confident that the South American nation will be able to pull it off.\n\nHe is, however, doubtful that the country's success with the World Cup will be enough to save Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's job when the country holds its elections next year - even if there may be some economic returns from the huge investments the country made to host the soccer extravaganza.\n\nMr Franklin, also the editor of The Economist's World in 2014, was in Singapore to host and speak at a gala dinner to launch the publication.\n\nAsked for his tip on who will win the World Cup next year, the Briton confidently predicted that England - no surprises here - will lift the trophy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, many will struggle to even pinpoint it on a world map.\n\nIt is South Sudan, going by The Economist's Top Growers for 2014 list. Occupying the top spot, this landlocked East African economy, which depends on oil for reportedly more than 90 per cent of its revenue, is predicted to grow its gross domestic product (GDP) by 35 per cent.\n\nThe resumption of oil production earlier this year - after it was halted in January 2012 over a disagreement with Sudan, from which it split in 2011 - will be a huge boost to its economic growth.\n\nRanked second on the magazine's 2014 list of 12 runaway economies is Mongolia, expected to clock another double-digit year with 15.3 per cent growth, buoyed by a mining boom.\n\nAnd third is Macau, projected to achieve 13.5 per cent GDP growth thanks to its gaming and tourism revenues.\n\nIndeed, The Economist's list features mostly resource-rich developing or until recently war-torn countries that one would not usually associate with high economic growth.\n\nSpeaking at The Economist's The World in 2014 gala dinner in Singapore on Tuesday, Mongolia's President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj expressed confidence that his country would continue to record sterling growth next year and thereafter, having already grown 17 per cent last year and 13 per cent this year.\n\n\"The World Bank and IMF (International Monetary Fund) predict that Mongolia can keep that pace of two-digit growth for the coming 20 years,\" he said.\n\nThe most surprising omission from the 2014 list was China, absent for the first time. Its GDP growth next year will not be shabby - at 7.3 per cent - but is still not good enough for it to be among the 12 fastest-growing economies.\n\nIts maturing, slower-growing and middle-income economy is on a general downward trend as a new generation of leaders shifts the country from a focus on low-value-added exports and government stimulus to a self-sustaining economy powered by consumer demand, The Economist said.\n\nChina's Special Administrative Region of Macau sticks out among the top three for being neither resource-rich nor energy-producing, but its casino and tourism industries are expected to hum.\n\nAnother economy of note on the list is Bhutan, which is projected to grow by 9 per cent. More popularly known for its Gross National Happiness than its GDP, its economy is expected to do well from its hydroelectricity exports to India.\n\nAlthough Singapore did not make it into the list of 12 for 2014, it is expected to achieve a sustainable growth rate of 3.8 per cent next year. The Economist expects the trend of rising trade within Asia, which has helped Singapore grow even as Western economies have struggled, to be rebalanced next year as emerging economies slow down and developed economies recover. It will be Singapore's opening to reap dividends from the surge in global trade.\n\nThe magazine said of Singapore: \"Manufacturing, though less significant than in most Asian countries, will remain a force behind growth, and the economy will continue the climb back towards its robust growth rates of old.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is the first time that the URA has attempted this with two adjacent parcels, although, it had earlier this year conducted simultaneous tender closings for three executive condominium (EC) sites. The three EC sites were in different areas - two in Punggol and one located near Jurong Country Club.\n\nThe top bid for both sites was put up by Kingsford Development, at $522.43 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), which translates into $258.8 million for Parcel A and $201.6 million for Parcel B.\n\nParcel A has a land area of 165,125 sq ft and is located next to Rio Vista condo, while Plot B has a land area of 128,644 sq ft.\n\nKingsford Development beat the second highest bids for Parcel A and Parcel B by 16 per cent and 12.7 per cent respectively.\n\n\"While the bids seem bullish amid current buying sentiment, it indicates the developer's intention to land bank, to cement its position, and to minimise price competition it could potentially face in the vicinity,\" said Chia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International.\n\nKnight Frank Singapore's research head, Alice Tan, had pointed out earlier that there were currently eight private housing projects being built within a two-kilometre radius of the two sites. As at end-September, when the sites were launched, about 85 per cent of the total 4,840 units from the eight projects had been sold.\n\nNotably, both parcels drew bids from five common participants, namely Kingsford Development, EL Development, Meteorite Land Singapore, MCL Land (Brighton), and a joint-venture between Verwood Holdings, Intrepid Investments and TID Residential.\n\nAccording to Joseph Tan, executive director, residential, at CBRE, the differential between the top bid and the second highest bid for both plots is \"not surprising\", given that Kingsford Development is a \"fairly new entrant who wants to compete with mainstream developers to shore up their landbank\".\n\nThat being said, the latest tender result shows a trend of foreign developers continuing to outbid local players, pointed out Christine Li, head of research at Orange Tee.\n\n\"One of the reasons could be the continued availability of liquidity in the financial market which encourages foreign players to take on higher risks,\" she suggested.\n\nBased on Kingsford Development's website, the developer is based in Shenyang, China. Given that the real estate market in Shenyang has slowed down quite significantly over recent years, this move could be read as Kingsford diversifying their real estate portfolio outside its home country, she added.\n\nWhile Kingsford Development has been relatively active in recent land tenders here - it also bid in the last EC site tenders where all three parcels closed on the same day - it is probably best known for winning the site at Hillview Avenue, which was subsequently developed into the 512-unit Kingsford @ Hillview Peak.\n\nParcel A's second highest bid was put up by EL Development, at $450.36 psf ppr. The lowest bid was put up by CEL Residential Development, at $321.33 psf ppr.\n\nParcel B's second highest bid was put up by Maxdin and SingHaiyi Residences ($463.52 psf ppr), while the lowest bid for the parcel was put up by MCL Land (Brighton), at $318.96 psf ppr.\n\nColliers' Ms Chia estimated the breakeven cost for the proposed developments on both sites to be in the range of $860 to $920 psf. As such, the selling price could start from $1,000 psf.\n\nOrange Tee's Ms Li said that she expects the developer to sell its projects from $1,050 psf. Currently, transactions in the vicinity range from $950 to $1,000 psf.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tomorrow, investors will be able to check if they have unclaimed assets at the www.sgx.com/mygateway website, using their NRIC or passport number. Investors can also call 6589-8039 during office hours on weekdays and on Saturday morning.\n\n\"We are highlighting this as part of our investor-education efforts,\" said SGX head of sales and clients Chew Sutat yesterday.\n\n\"Many investors in Singapore have a short-term trading mentality. They don't think about dividends,\" he added.\n\nUnclaimed dividends come about when investors do not opt for them to be directly credited to their bank accounts, preferring instead to receive a cheque in the mail. About one in four investors have not signed up for SGX's direct crediting service.\n\nThe investors then forget that they have cheques to be cashed. For example, one investor had travelled often and did not have time to open his letters.\n\nAnother investor, retiree Madam Loh, 65, told SGX that she did not pay much attention to her investments over the years and had missed the cheques.\n\nThousands of shareholders do not cash their dividend cheques every year, SGX said.\n\nBut after six years, unclaimed dividends will be returned to the listed companies which distributed them. Currently, SGX is holding on to $53.7 million of dividends for 74,000 investors - around $726 per investor on average.\n\nSGX said most investors with unclaimed dividends have less than $1,000 to claim back. Five per cent have unclaimed dividends of between $1,000 and $5,000, and 2 per cent have more than $5,000 of unclaimed dividends. One investor has unclaimed dividends of $1.2 million.\n\nMeanwhile, SGX is also holding on to $14.6 million of unclaimed SingTel shares and dividends belonging to 15,000 investors without Central Depository (CDP) accounts.\n\nThe telco had held its initial public offering (IPO) in 1993, and Singaporeans could buy shares using their Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings. But some did not follow through after the IPO to open a CDP account.\n\nIn the 20 years since 1993, after the shares were placed to Singaporeans at $2 a share, SingTel had paid out dividends of about $2.50 per share and it is currently trading at about $3.70 a share - an annualised return of almost 6 per cent a year, Mr Chew noted.\n\nDue to privacy laws, SGX cannot approach brokers or CPF Board to get the latest contact details of the investors.\n\nIn some cases, SGX just has their NRIC numbers. In the last few months, however, it has managed to contact some and return $4 million of unclaimed assets.\n\nDavid Gerald, CEO and president of investor lobby group Securities Investors Associations of Singapore (Sias), said it is encouraging to hear of real-life examples of investors who invested in shares for the long run and enjoyed good returns.\n\n\"Share investing is a crucial part of financial planning, and investors should monitor their company's corporate actions and developments,\" he noted.\n\nThe site and hotline to check for unclaimed assets will begin operating today at 8.30am. SGX will waive the administrative fee for the reissuance of dividend cheques and dividend crediting until Jan 26, 2014.\n\nClarification: In the above story, we gave the wrong impression that some unclaimed SingTel shares were bought with Central Provident Fund monies. The Singapore Exchange has pointed out that the affected shares were bought with cash only, which means the CPF Board is not involved in any way.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/privilege-choice", "site_title": "The privilege of choice", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe privilege of choice\n\nTaste, bouquet and provenance excite us in varied ways, writes NK YONG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 28, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHY do we like the wines that we do? Simple. They are enjoyable to drink, with or without food. What makes them enjoyable is the real question. \"What makes them lovely to drink - at least to me?\" Not as easy to answer as it looks. We drink wine to accompany a meal, or we drink it (often) for the sheer pleasure of drinking a good, or hopefully, a great wine. The pleasure comes from a combination of the taste on the palate and the aromas which waft upwards from the rear of the nasopharynx into the nose, as well as the cerebral from the barrage of messages emanating from the sensory receptors in the mouth and nasopharynx. On occasion, this barrage can be quite overwhelming. It can reduce you to a humble silence or even to tears.\n\nA wine does not need to be great or even \"near-great\" to be a likable drink. Even the simplest of wines such as a Mouton Cadet, can be a nice drink - it is easy to understand why, because this wine like others in the same genre is commercially produced to a fixed style and quality. You cannot go wrong. Better than nothing - unless it has suffered from poor storage.\n\nFreshness, fruit, balance, harmony and finally finesse - if all these attributes check out as expected, the wine should appeal. Not necessarily. The other night I had a glass of a New World Sauvignon Blanc, no it was not Cloudy Bay but from around there, and it was so pronouncedly New World sauvignon blanc, \"Chinese gooseberry\" that it was like wearing it as a badge.\n\nIt was well made, in fact rather pleasant to drink notwithstanding that New World SB is not my favourite grape. I just happen to find the strong, rather penetrating, aroma of New World Sauvignon Blanc not particularly attractive, a little too much of a good thing. It is a familiar sensory or cortical phenomenon (I am not sure which or a combination of both) that there are some initial \"favourites\" which one tires of in time.\n\nWe do not drink wine by \"numbers\". Most certainly not by \"scores\". One's overall sensory reception accompanied by the cerebral interpretation and evaluation combine to produce an impression either favourable, or otherwise. One makes a recording cerebrally, registering the overall effect and score, hopefully consigned to long-term memory.\n\nWhat about fruit? We expect ripe fruit, perfectly ripened fruit, and that the vinification was according to acceptable practice and standards. Sometimes the vagaries of the weather during the growing or the ripening periods may result in uneven ripening of the fruit, this being something over which the winemaker has no control. BUT he can control the selection of the fruit, discarding unevenly ripened fruit and concentrating on or near fully 100 per cent ripe fruit. And the degree to which such selection is made is a function of the standard to which the grower aims. Perfection is expensive.\n\nI place great store on the freshness of a wine. It is the most important quality, even above colour and aroma. Without freshness the aroma, taste, length etc. have no foundation. Absent or deficient freshness are warning signs. Poor quality or poor storage. Exactly the same as the quality you look for when you buy seafood! Except that it is evaluated in a different way. With fish you check on the smell, the feel of the flesh. At least, that was how I was taught when I had to cycle to the fresh-foods market during the Japanese occupation of Singapore!\n\nThe freshness referred to in connection with wine is the same kind of mouth-feel that one gets after eating a perfectly ripe, juicy orange. The whole mouth is left feeling clean, refreshed and even tingling, just impatiently waiting for the next mouthful. It makes you reflexively reach out for the glass to take another swallow, to repeat the experience, to convince yourself that it is real.\n\nAs to whether \"freshness\" is a function of the presence or absence of acidity or minerality is a debate I am not qualified to answer. Adequate level of acidity is certainly needed but acidity by itself is not the full answer.\n\nMinerality has been cited. The trouble with that is the definition of minerality. Sometimes, one reads that minerality refers to the content of traces of metal in the wine, especially if it is known that the vines have been grown on soil containing good amounts of minerals - calcium, iron, etc. One of the difficulties readers (me amongst them) have is to grasp the meaning of some highly imaginative descriptive phrases used in some wine notes about the taste of iron in the wine. Not having ever licked on an iron rod makes it difficult to describe what it tastes like!\n\nAfter freshness, the other attributes are simpler. Density, concentration, balance and harmony and finally the finish. A few days ago I opened a bottle of Propriedad 2003, Palacios Remondo, the Rioja wine made by Alvaro Palacios, who has now taken over the family winery in Rioja, Baja. With a cepage of Tempranillo principally, with Garnacha, Mazuelo and Graciano, it is an attractive easy-drinking wine. Lots of fruit, very ripe and lush, with very pleasing freshness on the palate and good acidity.\n\nThere was good density and concentration of fruit, and a medium finish. It did show some complexity but it finished short on the middle palate. It was well-made, it was an attractive drink and left the palate sufficiently refreshed, but in the end it lacked sufficient interest. The remaining one-third of wine in the bottle was re-corked and drunk a few days later. It had faded. A good but not a great bottle, not meant for long ageing. A simple bottle made to give pleasure, for easy and early drinking especially with meals.\n\nNot that there is anything wrong with the wine. Propriedad and lots of wines like it are inexpensive, good everyday-drinking wines, giving pleasure and doing what they are meant to do, but ageing into complex wines is not their function.\n\n\"In some bottles there is the soil of a place, and in that soil, there is a soul\" - Roger Scruton. Propriedad may not qualify to be included in \"some bottles\" but it has its place as a nice wine for a simple dinner.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another sold food packaging. Two were sisters-in-law of an insurance executive who died in the World Trade Center on Sept 11, 2001.\n\nWith no Washington experience or deep-pocketed backers, these family members of victims of a 2009 plane crash near Buffalo, New York, channelled their grief and rage for four years to win US rules reducing pilot fatigue and improving training and qualifications. They outmanoeuvred industry opponents spending millions on lobbyists.\n\nThe rules, the last of which was announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Nov 5, will cost airlines US$7 billion over 10 years to add training, hire more pilots and adjust flight schedules, according to government estimates.\n\n\"We learned and realised very early on that you're not going to go cry on someone's desk and get something done,\" Scott Maurer, a regional sales manager at Sealed Air Corp whose daughter Lorin, 30, died in the crash, said in an interview. \"You have to have a plan and you have to conduct it in a business-like manner.\"\n\nA core of 5-10 family members, aided by an extended circle that swelled to as many as 40, bird- dogged lawmakers and agency heads until they got what they wanted, according to interviews with five participants as well as politicians and government officials.\n\nSome members of Families of Continental Flight 3407 came to Washington more than 60 times, paying their own way.\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Deborah Hersman, whose job includes working with crash survivors, said she'd never seen such persistent advocacy by families.\n\n\"They opened up people's minds, and they opened up offices, and they opened up priorities that even the NTSB probably couldn't have,\" she said in an interview.\n\nFlight 3407, operated by Pinnacle Airlines Corp's Colgan unit, was nearing Buffalo from Newark, New Jersey, at 10:17pm on Feb 12, 2009, when it pitched up violently. The plane slowed, lost lift and plunged into a neighbourhood in Clarence Center, New York. All 49 people aboard and a man on the ground died.\n\nThe investigation at first focused on the snow falling that night and other pilot reports of icing.\n\nThe families heard a different story after arriving at an NTSB hearing starting May 12, 2009: a captain with a history of failing skill tests who'd barely slept the night before triggered the accident by overreacting to a cockpit alarm. The co-pilot had earned US$16,000 the prior year and taken a red-eye flight the night before reporting to work.\n\nConvinced there were systemic safety shortfalls in the regional-airline industry, the families that week fanned out across the halls of Congress, a five-minute taxi ride from the NTSB's conference room.\n\nOne of their first meetings was with Senator Byron Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who was chairman of the aviation rulemaking subcommittee.\n\nMr Dorgan told them about his mother, who was killed by a drunk driver in 1986, the now-former lawmaker said in an interview. As the driver's case wound through court, Mr Dorgan attended every hearing to send a message, he said.\n\n\"My advice is you've got to show up,\" he told the group. \"The world is run by those who show up. And show up at everything.\" So they did.\n\nLed by Kevin Kuwik, a buzz-cut assistant basketball coach at the University of Dayton who won a Bronze Star for Army service in Iraq, they became experts in the minutiae of influence and the technical side of airline operations.\n\nMr Kuwik's girlfriend was Mr Maurer's daughter Lorin. His father, Edward, was mayor of the western New York town of Lackawanna and served in the Erie County legislature. That gave the group contacts with the Buffalo area's congressional delegation and with Senator Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat who ranked third in the body's leadership.\n\nThe two sisters brought their own connections. Karen Eckert and Susan Bourque lost their sibling, Beverly Eckert, an advocate for Sept 11, 2001 attack victims who had met only days before the accident with President Barack Obama.\n\nMs Beverly Eckert, whose husband, Sean Rooney, died in one of the World Trade Center towers, served on the Family Steering Committee of the 9/11 Commission and was a familiar figure on Capitol Hill.\n\nStaff members would say hello to Susan and Karen because they looked so much like their golden-haired sister and offer to assist, the sisters said.\n\n\"When we did get to see the member of Congress and talked about Beverly, they always had nice things to say,\" Ms Bourque said. \"It really helped.\"\n\nEven as doors opened, roadblocks appeared. While the House had passed an aviation safety bill by a 409-to-11 vote in October 2009, the measure stalled in the Senate.\n\nAirlines and their trade groups began lobbying to mute the measures, according to reports and public filings.\n\nThe Regional Airline Association, the Washington-based trade group representing carriers like Colgan, hadn't lobbied since 1999. In 2010, it spent US$160,000 lobbying on the safety measures and other issues, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington.\n\nLarger carriers such as FedEx Corp and American Airlines parent AMR Corp, along with their Washington-based trade group, Airlines for America, reported spending more than US$50 million on lobbying in 2010. All the carriers said they lobbied on the safety proposals without detailing how much was spent on specific issues.\n\nWhile the airlines said they supported improved safety and pilot training, they argued in government filings that measures sought by the families would be too costly and wouldn't have prevented the crash.\n\nGoing against such well-financed opposition, the families found they could wield their own brand of political muscle.\n\nThe regulations that emerged addressed what the families saw as the biggest issues underlying the Colgan crash: old rules that allowed pilots to fly tired, outdated training requirements and standards that allowed pilots to carry passengers after failing skill tests. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

A number of KL high-end, high-rise properties have been going at more than RM1,000 psf.\n\nThe steep price increase in such a short period may not be sustainable for a number of reasons, including the lack of commerce in Johor Baru. To date the bulk of Iskandar investments has been centred on real estate as developers from Kuala Lumpur as well as overseas made a beeline for the new hotspot.\n\nTake Country Garden Holdings which acquired 22.25 hectares in Danga Bay for nearly RM1 billion. In August, it launched with much fanfare its integrated development which has an estimated gross development value of RM18 billion.\n\nIt put up a large portion of the development for sale - a method used by developers in mainland China - selling 6,000 units, or about two-thirds of the 9,000 apartments, within a month. Malaysian media reported that at least one in four buyers is from China.\n\nWith the pipeline of units coming from Country Garden and other developers in the next two to three years, people are beginning to see Iskandar as more of a \"property play\".\n\nRHB pinpointed Medini as likely to experience a slowdown in home sales in the near term as buyers react in knee-jerk fashion to the property cooling measures.\n\nStill, the node may not be very badly affected given the many incentives and exemptions accorded to it by the federal government. Current exemptions include bumiputra quotas, and minimum price restriction for foreigners. Medini property buyers could also be excluded from paying RPGT if the Iskandar Regional Development Authority is successful in pushing for an exemption to ensure the special node continues to be favoured by investors.\n\nThere is no denying that the tighter guidelines in Budget 2014 have had a dampening effect as purchasers exercise more caution but RHB said the RPGT was \"still bearable\" for locals since the 30 per cent maximum rate only applies for disposals within the first three years. It noted, however, that some consolidation in property demand and prices can be expected. Based on past experience, the market could take a quarter or two to adjust to the regulatory changes.\n\nThe research house has singled out UEM Sunrise, Sunway and Mah Sing as property companies under its coverage with the biggest exposure to Iskandar in terms of gross domestic value and landbank area.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They face structural tasks that include melding frequent-flier plans and deciding on a regional-jet fleet, as well as details such as picking an aircraft paint scheme.\n\nAmerican will need to avoid technological pitfalls like the computer failures that snarled flights at United Continental Holdings Inc after its 2010 tie-up, while also making good on a pledge to achieve US$1 billion in cost savings and new revenue. The closing of the US$17.7 billion merger and AMR's Chapter 11 exit will come on Dec 9, the company said on Wednesday.\n\n\"What we'll see is the beginning of announcements of what the integration teams have been putting together,\" said George Hamlin, president of Hamlin Transportation Consulting in Fairfax, Virginia. \"Doug Parker's team has been quite eager to consummate the merger for some time.\"\n\nMr Parker, 52, began pursuing American shortly after the carrier's bankruptcy filing on Nov 29, 2011. Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR agreed to the merger in February, and the airlines worked towards a September closing until the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the deal on Aug 13. A settlement in that case was reached on Nov 12, and US Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan approved that accord on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will be among the first to feel the effect of the new company's arrival. The combined carrier will become American Airlines Group Inc on Dec 9, and the shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market with the ticker AAL.\n\nEquity in the merged airline will be distributed then, with 72 per cent going to AMR creditors, including stakes totalling 23.6 per cent for American employees and management, and at least 3.5 per cent for existing AMR shareholders. Stockholders in Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways will get the rest.\n\nPay raises and other contract changes agreed to earlier for all employees will take effect that day as well, as part of the merger agreement the airlines unveiled in February.\n\nSome changes visible to travellers, such as combining loyalty programmes, won't come for months. For example, United, formed in the October 2010 merger of UAL Corp and Continental Airlines Inc, didn't have a unified website until March 2012.\n\nOther steps, including US Airways' shift to the American-led Oneworld marketing group from Star Alliance, should happen during the first quarter, according to the airlines.\n\n\"I suspect they are going to go dark for a while until they have something to talk to the consumer about,\" said Jay Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive who now runs Shorewood, Wisconsin-based aviation consultant IdeaworksCompany. \"Right now they don't. To talk in that situation creates nothing but problems for customer-facing processes.\"\n\nAmerican and US Airways will take \"the first step in being a single airline for customers\" on Jan 7, US Airways president Scott Kirby said on a Nov 12 conference call. \"We're going to have a more seamless customer interface\" to announce that day, he said, without providing specifics.\n\nTodd Lehmacher, a US Airways spokesman, and Mike Trevino with American, declined to provide a timetable for the integration or discuss what the airline will announce on Jan 7.\n\nOne early move will be the sharing of airline booking codes so the carriers can put travellers onto each other's flights. Later, fliers will be able to earn and redeem reward miles on either airline before a single programme is created when American and US Airways begin operating as one carrier.\n\n\"'You want your miles in our family' is the message,\" Mr Hamlin said in an interview. \"They'll say, 'We're about to begin a new year and you need to put your miles in at least one of them' because, hopefully by the end of 2014, the programmes will be together.\"\n\nIn airline mergers, frequent fliers typically have their miles rolled together into one account at the surviving carrier.\n\nAmerican and US Airways will function separately until the Federal Aviation Administration approves unified operations, probably near the end of 2014. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The sub-committee is led by Quek See Tiat, chairman of the Building and Construction Authority.\n\nThe sub-committee reviewed the Code, which was issued here in 2009 and based on the Code of Ethics issued in 2006 by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) of the International Federation of Accountants.\n\nThe IESBA Code was revised in 2009, and the consultation paper noted that some audit firms in Singapore already ensure that their procedures comply with the revised IESBA Code as part of their internal controls.\n\nThe sub-committee said that it was looking to adopt all the revisions in the revised IESBA Code to \"maintain respected international benchmarks in Singapore\".\n\nIt is also looking to retain and remove some of the Singapore provisions. In considering these, its approach has been to adopt the revised IESBA Code as far as possible and move away from local modifications except where there is an identified deficiency or where the Singapore provision is needed to provide certainty.\n\nThe consultation paper is available on ACRA's website (www.acra.gov.sg).\n\nThe public consultation exercise runs from Nov 29, 2013, until Jan 10, 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The homes were built from 2007 through 2011, he said, without disclosing their value.\n\n\"This type of sale is going to be our typical bread and butter in years to come,\" Mr Barba said.\n\nThe rental market in Spain, which has one of Europe's highest home ownership rates, may double in coming years as government spending cuts, a 26 per cent jobless rate and subdued mortgage lending make it more difficult for Spaniards to buy dwellings, according to Irea, a debt-restructuring firm that has advised on 22 billion euros (S$37.3 billion) of refinancing.\n\nIncreasing demand for rental properties is prompting foreign funds to invest in Spain's unsold homes, which may total 1.3 million units, according to Idealista.com, the country's largest real estate website. New York-based Blackstone Group LP, which has bought about 40,000 homes in the US, agreed in July to purchase 18 apartment blocks from the city of Madrid for 125.5 million euros. New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Madrid-based Azora Capital SL agreed in August to pay about 20 per cent more than the minimum asking price for 32 social-housing developments sold by Madrid's regional government.\n\n\"There are very good investors for this type of product and we've already seen purchases by Blackstone and Goldman,\" Mr Barba said.\n\nHIG Capital LLC, a Miami-based private-equity firm, agreed in August to buy a majority stake in a portfolio of around 1,000 homes from Sareb. The transaction, known as Project Bull, valued them at about 100 million euros.\n\nNot all of the sales have gone smoothly. Blackstone, the world's largest private- equity firm, and Goldman dropped out of an auction for 1,458 homes in Madrid, leaving them unsold, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Funds are being selective, focusing on homes with tenants and rental income in urban areas like Madrid, Fernando Encinar, co-founder of Idealista.com, said in an interview in September.\n\nThe investors' strategies in Spain differ from the US, where they have targeted mainly foreclosed single- family properties, renovated them and sought tenants. In both countries, they're aiming to buy cheaply and bet on increased rental demand as more people struggle to qualify for mortgages.\n\nSareb failed to attract high enough bids for its Corona office portfolio, its first attempt to sell commercial real estate assets, and cut the size of the package offered from seven to four to make it easier to sell, three people familiar with the matter said last month.\n\nSpain set up Sareb last year to absorb 50.8 billion euros in real estate assets from lenders including the Bankia group, which took state aid. Sareb may close the sale of Corona this year after choosing two bidders to submit binding offers by the end of next week, Mr Barba said. Madrid-based Aguirre Newman SA is advising Sareb on the sale of the portfolio of office buildings in central Madrid.\n\nSareb has raised 1.7 billion euros so far this year, beating its 2013 target of 1.5 billion euros, Deputy Economy Minister Fernando Jimenez Latorre said at a conference in Madrid last week.

Valuer Jones Lang LaSalle will value Tianda and issue a report in due course, Pteris said.\n\nLike its purchase of the previous stake in Tianda, Pteris will issue new shares to satisfy the deal, after the proposed consolidation of five shares, at 13 cents each, into one. Post-consolidation, shares will be issued at 65 cents apiece.\n\nUnder the terms of the reverse takeover, Pteris will issue 230.8 million pre-consolidation shares amounting to $30 million. Another $7.2 million will be raised at a later date, subject to various conditions including profitability.\n\nAnother $3 million is to be satisfied by the issuance of shares subject to the result of ongoing arbitration proceedings involving Pteris and a Middle East project. The final $1.1 million will be satisfied, subject to the settlement of claims relating to outstanding payments due from third parties.\n\nPteris used to be known as Inter-Roller Engineering Limited, and was a market darling. At its height, shares traded over $1.30 each in 2007. But in 2008, it made a net loss of $3.1 million, hit by higher costs and project delays. In 2012, Pteris was also hit by a volatile global economy and project delays, reporting $29.6 million in losses.\n\nPteris currently runs baggage handling and air cargo handling systems, among others. It posted a loss of $12.6 million for the first nine months of the year, down from a loss of $23.2 million a year ago.\n\nRevenue fell 35 per cent to $32.8 million from $50.6 million a year earlier. The company had cash and equivalents of $11.1 million as at end-September.\n\nWhen the reverse takeover was announced, some shareholders had grumbled about the valuation.\n\nPteris' net asset value stood at 9.6 cents a share as at end-September, or $52.7 million. The terms of the reverse takeover are at 13 cents a share. But in its 2012 annual report, Pteris revealed that independent valuers had revalued its leasehold building - understood to be their headquarters at 28 Quality Road - to $53 million, compared with the $18 million that the building was held at cost on its books.\n\nThis would boost its restated net asset value (RNAV) to $87.7 million, or 16 cents a share, 23 per cent higher than the RTO price. In addition, the company also has outstanding arbitration and settlement claims.\n\nWhen contacted yesterday, Pteris's second largest shareholder, non-executive director Winston Tan Tien Hin, who has a deemed stake of 10.5 per cent in the company, told The Business Times: \"The RTO pricing is too low.\" Mr Tan has been accumulating shares in the company.\n\nBut fellow shareholder, private investor Mano Sabnani, told BT that the key issue was not the valuation, but \"whether Pteris can survive on its own or whether it needs a stronger partner\".\n\n\"A smallish company incurring losses like that in a big boys' game can't survive for long,\" he said.\n\nThe RTO is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.\n\nPteris closed unchanged at 13.1 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its leaders are clear-minded about their goals, yet conscious of China's enormous challenges, and committed to reforms.\"\n\nSpeaking in Mandarin, Mr Lee also gave his take on the Third Plenum, a key Chinese policy meeting that ended earlier this month.\n\n\"Changes announced at the Third Plenum reflect the commitment of China's leaders to reforms that will sustain China's growth for the future,\" he said.\n\nBut he advised that a long-term view of China needs to be taken, as China's challenges are complex and some issues cannot be resolved in a hurry. He cited how sentiments on the meeting, as well as markets, swung from high expectations to disappointment at a vaguely worded initial communique, to praise again after a detailed reform plan was announced.\n\nThe Singapore government is continually updating and enhancing its partnership with China, he added. Companies here, meanwhile, must also adapt to China's changing needs and circumstances, he said.\n\nMr Lee cited Cordlife Group, a provider of umbilical cord blood and tissue banking services, gearing up to take advantage of the relaxation of China's one-child policy.\n\nCompanies must also develop staff to understand the language, customs, traditions and business practices of China, he said.\n\nBusiness China was set up in 2007 by Mr Lee's father, former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, and former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao to create a network for Singaporeans who can connect to China economically and culturally. Yesterday, the younger Mr Lee took over from his father to become the organisation's new patron.\n\nThe Business China Awards are jointly presented by Business China and OCBC Bank to recognise businessmen, professionals and organisations for contributing to Singapore-China relations. This year, they went to former Jiangsu province party secretary Liang Baohua, Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao, and Charles Wong, co-founder of homegrown shoe retailer Charles & Keith.\n\nMr Liang, 68, is recognised for his role as China's key representative in developing the Suzhou Industrial Park, a joint venture between Singapore and China started in 1994. Mr Liang was cited for supporting the park through thick and thin.\n\nLianhe Zaobao was honoured for becoming one of the top Chinese news websites in the world. It is well read online by the mainland Chinese and its website has daily page views of four million in 2011, Business China said.\n\nMr Wong, 39, is cited for raising the profile of Singaporean entrepreneurs in China and creating business opportunities for both countries.\n\nHis company, Charles & Keith, opened its first store in China in 2010, in Raffles City Shanghai. Today, it has 63 stores there across big cities like Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Nanjing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is a short-term alleviation and it is no more than that,\" said Mehdi Varzi, a former official at the state-run National Iranian Oil Co.\n\nIn the meantime, Iran is deploying more vessels to help store oil at sea and to enable it to conclude discreet sales by transferring cargoes to customers' ships in mid-ocean without having to enter port, the sources say.\n\nWith its tanker fleet boosted by newly built vessels from Chinese yards, Iran is shipping crude to countries including China, India and Syria. \"Iran will try and export its crude to any country that will accept it and if that involves methods to conceal how it is done, they will do it,\" said Mr Varzi, who now runs an energy consultancy in Britain. \"Any country would do the same if they faced Iran's horrendous economic situation.\"\n\nThe deal struck in Geneva leaves US and European oil sanctions in place for six months, although an easing of a ban on European ship insurance may ease the transport of current oil exports to Iran's big Asian customers. \"They desperately need as many tankers as they can get hold of as they are producing more oil than they can shift which is a big problem for them,\" one European based trade source said.\"Iran is also trying to use vessels not previously associated with them to take the heat of their main domestic fleet.\"\n\nForeign shipping companies, fearing a loss of business in Western nations because of sanctions, have backed off from deals with Iran. This has put the onus on Iran's main tanker operator, NITC, but sanctions have restricted its access to insurance and the certification that allows its ships to call at major ports.\n\nAmong vessels now being used by Iran are some previously controlled by Irano Hind, an Indian-Iranian joint venture recently wound up due to sanctions, trade sources said. The former company's fleet included at least three oil tankers.\n\nTrade sources said one of those vessels, the Ramtin, which shipping databases showed was now Iranian-flagged, had made at least one ship-to-ship transfer off the coast of Singapore and Malaysia last month. Ship-tracking data showed the vessel had called at Iran's Larak Island oil terminal in September. Ramtin's India-based manager, Marian Ship Management, could not be reached for comment.\n\nShip-tracking information shows that Iran has aimed to provide assistance to its main regional ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as civil war grinds on.\n\nAnother former Irano Hind vessel, the Iranian-flagged Tour 2, delivered crude oil to Syria last month, port loading and ship tracking data showed. The vessel's Iran-based owner, Auris Marine, could not be reached for comment.\n\nA further three tankers controlled by NITC also made deliveries to Syria last month, data showed.\n\nA senior NITC official told Reuters: \"We are doing the same as we have done in the past three years - transporting oil.\"\n\nSeparately, the Falcon Pride oil tanker has made regular runs between Iran's Assaluyeh anchorage to the port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), carrying Iranian light oil, known as condensate, ship tracking and trade sources said.\n\nUS and EU measures have already reduced Iran's oil exports by more than half from pre-sanction levels of about 2.2 million barrels per day, costing Iran billions of dollars in lost revenue a month. But Iranian officials say they are learning to get round sanctions, which they reject as unjustified.\n\nTrade sources said the NITC tanker Honesty made a ship-to-ship (STS) transfer with a foreign-owned vessel in September in an STS area within Dubai's anchorage waters. \"STS transfers around the UAE are another method to offload oil. Whether the oil is immediately sold or held until a buyer can be found depends on the deal but it gets a cargo off their hands,\" a Middle East based trade source said.\n\nA source at Dubai's Maritime City Authority said the port's priority was ensuring there were no accidents or pollution in its waters and it did not check the source of the oil.\n\nThe NITC official, who declined to be named, said the group were not doing many STS operations these days. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The Chinese \"bad bank\", which is revving up for a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO), has recently been doing brisk business by borrowing cheaply from other banks and using those funds to buy up companies' short-term loans to each other. In doing so, it has found a way to square China's dreaded \"debt triangles\".\n\nCinda was originally set up to take on bad loans racked up by China Construction Bank. In recent years, however, it has made an increasing amount of its money by restructuring inter-company debt. It's the only one of China's four bad banks which is allowed to buy debt from non-financial companies. These kinds of assets have grown from nothing three years ago to the majority of its distressed debt holdings at the end of June.\n\nHere's how it works: First, Cinda borrows from a bank, typically for around 5-6 per cent, according to people familiar with the situation. It then finds a company with a customer which can't pay its trade bills - say, a cement maker that is owed cash by a real estate developer. Cinda buys that receivable for a small discount to its face value. The developer puts up collateral or secures a third-party guarantee, and its debt to the cement maker becomes a loan from Cinda.\n\nEveryone seems to gain. The cement maker gets its cash back and the developer buys itself some time - though at a price. Cinda's loans carry an average interest rate of around 14 per cent, according to the company's IPO prospectus.\n\nAfter deducting expenses and bad-debt provisions equivalent to around 2 per cent of the loan, Cinda emerges with roughly a 6 per cent spread - more than twice what Chinese banks earn on traditional lending. Because Cinda's own balance sheet is leveraged, it earns an attractive return on equity of around 30 per cent.\n\nCompanies aren't the only ones taking advantage of Cinda's strategy. Some \"trust\" vehicles, which gather and reinvest funds from the wealthy, have brought in the bad bank to help them pay back investors when developers which have borrowed from the trusts get into trouble. That exposes Cinda to the risk it gets stuck with collateral such as land and buildings, but having its own real estate division at least means it can put those to use.\n\nThe mystery is why China's banks don't get into this lucrative game themselves. One reason may be that many of the afflicted companies are real estate developers, and regular lenders are under orders to limit their exposure to the industry.\n\nAnother is that banks would rather lend to Cinda, since they can class such loans as \"interbank\" exposures. These incur a lower capital charge than corporate credits, and aren't included in banks' loan-to-deposit ratios, which are capped by regulators.\n\nMoreover, structuring these loans is time-consuming, and requires expertise that China's commercial lenders don't readily have. Even Cinda currently goes mainly for large receivables - its restructured assets are on average around 100-200 million yuan (S$20-40 million) each.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, the Cinda model is basically helpful, since it eases one of China's most worrying trends: companies racking up debt to each other in the form of unpaid bills. Accounts receivable among Chinese companies have grown substantially faster than GDP since 2010, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. If the cement maker gets its cash back from the property developer, it is more likely to pay its own suppliers and lenders, and the risk of contagion is reduced.\n\nCan this profitable trade continue? It can so long as China's financial system remains essentially closed. First, banks have to keep supplying Cinda with cheap loans. That, in turn, means they must be able to draw on their own cheap funds - most notably consumer deposits. As China's market develops, and new funds offer savers alluring alternatives, that sure source of low-cost funding will fade. But for the foreseeable future, depositors will keep unwittingly funding troubled companies' bailouts - and Cinda's earnings.\n\nThe writer is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.\n\nThe opinions expressed are his own.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price in debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nJane Street deposits US$567 million so it can resume India trading\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:48 PM\n\nBank of Japan is said likely to consider raising inflation forecast\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM", "images": []}

We have not been affected and everyone can still move around town as usual.\"\n\nTom Ng, director of Tong Seng Produce, which imports 40 per cent of its rice from Thailand, said that his company was on standby to turn to other markets should supply be affected at any time.\n\nAmong Tong Seng's many products is the Songhe brand of rice, which is harvested all year from north-east Thailand.\n\n\"Our suppliers in Thailand have not informed us of any impact to our supply. In any case, we have many alternatives such as rice from Vietnam, India, Japan and the US. We can increase our imports from those countries even at short notice, to make up for any shortfall,\" he said.\n\nThis week's protests in Bangkok are the largest since tens of thousands took to the streets in 2010 to protest against the previous government of former premier Abhisit Vejjajiva. That year, more than 90 people died and over 2,000 were injured during the unrest.\n\nYesterday, protesters stormed more government ministries and even forced the evacuation of the Department of Special Investigation, the country's top crime-fighting agency.\n\nWhile the scenes have remained largely peaceful so far, the images of flag-waving protesters and armed riot police officers - and the fact that Ms Yingluck has implemented the Internal Security Act - have spooked thousands of tourists into staying home.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, the Tourism Authority of Thailand highlighted that all tourist attractions in Bangkok remained open.\n\nBut if things get worse, it could spell trouble for the tourism industry in Thailand as the kingdom enters its peak travel season. A record 22.3 million travellers made their way to the Land of Smiles last year, with the tourism industry contributing 7.3 per cent to the nation's gross domestic product.\n\nA spokesman for Singapore Airlines (SIA) said that it has received \"a small number of calls\" from passengers keen to postpone their travel to Bangkok, which is one of the most popular travel destinations for Singaporeans. SIA flights between the two cities are operating as per normal.\n\nBudget carriers Jetstar, Tigerair and Scoot also said that flights have carried on as planned. \"In fact, flights from Singapore to Bangkok are mostly full,\" noted a Scoot spokesman.\n\nWhile passengers are presently subjected to fees if they change their travel dates, Tigerair said that it would waive this fee if the situation deteriorates and the government issues an official travel warning.\n\nMeanwhile, the airlines are advising passengers to arrive early for their flights at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport because of possible traffic congestion from the demonstrations.\n\nAccording to local travel and tour agencies Chan Brothers and Dynasty Travel, there have been no cancellations for travel plans to Bangkok as yet.\n\nChan Brothers, which has six travellers in Bangkok at the moment, said that tours are going ahead as planned, although customers have called to get updates on the situation.\n\nCommunications manager Jane Chang said: \"It could be most of customers are adopting a wait-and-see approach as political protests in Bangkok have been an annual affair for some time now.\"\n\nThe travel agency is also encouraging tourists to buy travel insurance and register online with Singapore's Foreign Affairs Ministry so that they can be contacted in case of an emergency. Travellers on its flexi-holiday offerings are given a 24-hour hotline number for support.\n\nThe political turmoil has played havoc with Ms Yingluck's travel plans, too. The 46-year-old leader was to have made a two-day visit to Singapore this week for a retreat with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, but this has since been postponed to next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A man and a woman wake up in bed. He, a model husband, serves her breakfast. She, a beautiful wife, smiles gratefully. But when he leaves for work, she opens her door for another man.\n\nWhat follows afterwards is totally unexpected.\n\nWhen the husband catches them in bed together, the lover flees and leaves his suit behind. The husband, instead of showing his anger, coolly devises a plan to punish her. The suit left behind by the fleeing lover is to become the \"guest\" of the house. He wants her to talk to it, feed it, and even take it for walks.\n\nThe suit becomes a permanent reminder of her crime. Slowly but surely, it destroys the both of them. The Suit is the last title in the triumphant Three Titans of Theatre series presented by the Esplanade and the Singapore Repertory Theatre. And though it is less spectacular and showy than the series' two previous productions, Shun-kin and Musashi, The Suit haunts and taunts you in a way the other two don't. Why did the husband (played by Ivano Jeremiah) not simply lash out at his wife (Nonhlanhla Kheswa) when he first caught them? Why did he bottle up his hurt and let it gnaw at the marriage in the long run? The background for the play's psychological complexity is the apartheid era of the 1950s South Africa, and its setting of Sofiatown, a Johannesburg township, where the whites are trying to evict the blacks for living too close to the white working-class areas.\n\nThe play never makes explicit how the subjugation of black people inspired the husband - a good, honest man by anyone's yardstick - to devise a passive-aggressive punishment for his wife. But one can deduce from the few clues scattered throughout about the beatings and violence carried out by whites on the blacks.\n\nThe Suit is originally a short story by South African writer Can Themba. It has been adapted for the stage by the great English director Peter Brook. In the hands of the minimalist master, the story is told with great spareness and austerity - with a bare bones set, a cast of four actors, and three live musicians.\n\nBut this lack of embellishments helps the play achieve the opposite of what most literary adaptations are accused of: Disappointing the boundless imagination of the original stories' readers by providing in the adaptation too many visual and physical details.\n\nBrook's simplicity allows you to instead focus on and contemplate - with startling clarity - the follies of the heart.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But whether this can be sustained and become a powerful fund-raising tool for Singapore-based start-ups remains to be seen.\n\nAccording to crowdfunding platform Crowdonomic.com, a record amount of money has been raised by Singapore-based campaigns this year, and this amount doubles on a monthly basis. The number of Singapore-based supporters is growing as well.\n\nIn March, Singaporean film The Body raised US$29,050 via global platform Indiegogo. In April, senior-friendly smartphone Silverline bagged US$54,001. And the following month, US$107,730 was pledged to the S377A Constitutional Challenge.\n\nBut some observers are cautious about continued high-octane growth, citing Singapore's small market and slow adoption rates as limitations to crowdfunding's potential. But they agree there is a role for crowdfunding in Singapore as it can complement venture capitalists (VC) in supporting start-ups.\n\nCrowdfunding, which has more than 800 global online platforms today, allows anyone to raise funds for anything - profit ventures, creative ideas or personal needs - in exchange for rewards. A campaigner sets a funding goal and deadline. If people like the campaign, they can pledge money to make it happen.\n\n\"As of now, crowdfunding here is very much in its infancy stage. It is still a fairly new concept to non-techies since its introduction in 2012,\" said Kelvin Koh, co-founder of PixBento, a photo-sharing app and Singapore's top crowdfunded campaign (US$3,220 raised) on a local platform.\n\nPirate3D, having raised US$1.44 million for its 3D printer The Buccaneer, is Singapore's top crowdfunded campaign on a global platform. It is also the only Singapore-based company that earned a spot (No 20) on Entrepreneur Magazine's 2013 list of Top 100 Crowdfunded Companies.\n\n\"Apart from Pirate3D, I don't think there has been any other high-profile product or service that got funded,\" said Julian Low, entrepreneur-in-residence at Red Dot Ventures.\n\n\"Most other campaigns from Singapore have small goals attached and thus expect small successes,\" said Mohamed Rushdy, co-founder of crowdsourcing learning portal Twofold. \"Additionally, the Singapore market is far too small for a business model that crowdsources funds or talent to be sustainable.\"\n\nJeffrey Paine, founding partner at Golden Gate Ventures (GGV), agreed: \"The density of interesting projects coming from Singapore is limited.\"\n\nOne reason for this, said Mr Koh, is that software start-ups - the bulk of tech start-ups here - are unlikely to crowdfund because of the low financial requirements in building a website or app.\n\n\"Local culture also differs from that in the US. Asians in general fear failure and will perceive risks in funding an idea or project online,\" said Ben Chew, founder of HR consulting firm Startup Jobs Asia.\n\n\"I don't think crowdfunding has really even taken off in Singapore. Even within the start-up community and early adopters, the buzz is somehow missing,\" said Alok Mishra, co-founder of B2B mobile advertising app Notiphi.\n\n\"I think the problem lies in the fact that (No 1 platform) Kickstarter is a lot larger than the next biggest platform. And Kickstarter requires you to have a US or Canadian presence, so it's disadvantageous to non-Western tech companies, many of which are innovative and competent in their own right,\" Mr Low said.\n\nTo address this gap, more crowdfunding platforms have been staking their presence here to attract local campaigners. Singapore-based platforms ToGather.Asia and Crowdonomic.com launched in 2012 and 2013. Australia's Pozible will be setting up office here in December, said its co-founder, Alan Crabbe.\n\n\"Our focus is helping to build a strong creative industry in Asia, and we feel Singapore is fast becoming a creative capital,\" said Mr Crabbe. He cited the first ever-win at Cannes by a Singaporean, the country's art and writers festivals, and tech and creative projects as signs that Singapore's creative stature is rising.\n\nFor Crowdonomic.com, its launch was driven more by a problem at home.\n\n\"Early-stage capital formation is an extremely inefficient process in Singapore, and often businesses that get funded are those that have the best connections or luck, but not necessarily those that deserve funding the most,\" said founder-CEO Leo Shimada. \"Crowdfunding solves this problem by making access to capital a more efficient and merit-based process.\"\n\nIn short, it allows start-ups to experiment and test market demand, raise awareness, obtain feedback to improve or validate an idea, and acquire first followers and customers.\n\n\"While the spirit of giving - which is at the core of crowdfunding - has always been strong in Singapore, crowdfunding growth has been supported by the increasing sophistication of platforms and quality of campaigns,\" he said.\n\nJumping on the crowdfunding bandwagon next is new local start-up Clickdrive, which plans to raise funds for its \"next-generation open platform for smart driving apps\" on Indiegogo.\n\nSaid CEO Mark Sutheran: \"The advantages of crowdfunding vs seed funding for consumer products derive from pitching your dream directly to the customer rather than via individuals who only focus on ROI (return on investment). We like the idea that the final product will be shaped very much by the audience for whom it is intended.\"\n\nOn why he chose Indiegogo over a local platform, Mr Sutheran said the more established global platforms have a proven record of delivering \"six and seven-figure campaign numbers\".\n\nBut for PixBento's Mr Koh, it was Crowdonomic.com's service orientation that distinguished it from traditional platforms, which are usually more focused on campaign listings.\n\n\"Unlike the mainstream websites which are overcrowded, the guys behind Crowdonomic.com are proactive and always available for help. They regularly correspond with us on our progress and provide tips on how to run our campaigns more effectively,\" he said. \"They also invite campaigners to their events, which leads to more local exposure and eyeballs on our start-up.\"\n\nSimilarly, Pozible offers value-added services, such as custom feedback on campaigns, regular workshops and integration with multiple payment systems like Bitcoin. In fact, these help boost the Australian-based platform to one of the top three platforms globally, Mr Crabbe claimed.\n\nSo, is crowdfunding likely to replace venture capital in the near future?\n\nObservers disagree, and say both are complementary tools especially for early-stage start-ups.\n\nSaid Notiphi's Mr Mishra: \"VCs come with resources who are knowledgeable about their respective fields in which they invest, and keep up with new developments in a systematic manner. It's just not possible for crowds to be equally well informed.\"\n\n\"Crowdfunding for equity may impact traditional venture capital funding, but I don't think venture capital will be replaced,\" Mr Crabbe said. \"VCs will still provide access to networks, mentorship and experienced entrepreneurs.\"\n\n\"Venture capital rounds are getting larger and fewer, so for crowdfunding to raise hundreds of millions of dollars in funding - I doubt that would be possible,\" Mr Low said.\n\nBut he also said his firm has funded a few Kickstarter and Indiegogo campaigns, in a sign that a new breed of VCs has emerged. According to Entrepreneur Magazine, as the number of crowdfunding platforms continues to rise and competition for investor attention intensifies, more VCs now spend time poring through online platforms to identify promising companies.\n\n\"Start-ups could benefit most from a combination of crowdfunding, which brings the wisdom of the crowd, and top-tier VCs, who bring their wealth of business-building experience,\" said Mr Shimada.\n\nConcurring, Mr Koh said: \"Crowdfunding is a good alternative to initial seed money and to jump-start a production from ideation without losing equity. But it's mostly a one-time relationship. VCs are there for the longer mile. Not only do they invest and become part-owners of the business, they advise and provide networks to potential customers, buyers and subsequent fundings if necessary.\"\n\nA start-up cannot crowdfund for the long run, he added.\n\nUltimately, observers say there is growth potential for crowdfunding here, given its location at the centre of crowdfunding networks in Asia and the increased convenience in online spending.\n\n\"But the result will not be immediate. More education of the public on crowdfunding first needs to be in place,\" said Startup Jobs Asia's Mr Chew.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even the FTSE ST China Index, which tracks the performance of around 30 stocks with businesses in China, is down five points month-on-month to 226 points. Mid-cap and small-cap indices were also down for the month.\n\nSaid a trader: \"We're still waiting for the next catalyst. Things are very quiet on my end. The PSLE examination is over, friends are taking the opportunity to get out of Singapore . . .\n\n\"Investors are looking elsewhere. Increasingly I'm looking at Malaysia and Hong Kong. There is no theme here. The only theme still going is business trusts and Reits (real estate investment trusts). But that's about it.\"\n\nAs of yesterday, the three stocks that added the most value over the month were blue chips DBS Bank and Keppel Corp, and hotel play Shangri-La Asia.\n\nDBS added $1.1 billion of market value (+2.6 per cent), Keppel added around $800 million (+4.2 per cent), and Shangri-La added around $600 million (+8.9 per cent). DBS, along with the other two local banks, outperformed in their third quarter results. Keppel Corp has benefited from contract wins. Shangri-La shares have been climbing up after a low in October.\n\nBut a sizeable amount of total market capitalisation was wiped out by other STI component stocks. The three stocks that lost the most market value over the month were Jardine Matheson (-6.1 per cent, -$2.8 billion), Jardine Strategic (-4.3 per cent, -$2 billion) and Thai Beverage (-11 per cent, -$1.5 billion).\n\nOther STI stocks that shed a few percentage points of value included StarHub, Hutchison Port Holdings Trust, CapitaLand, Global Logistic Properties, Hongkong Land, Jardine Cycle & Carriage and ST Engineering.\n\nAn outlier counter is C&G Environmental Protection Holdings, which develops and operates waste-to-energy plants in China. It doubled in value in the course of the month, adding $195 million of market capitalisation in the process. It had gone from 20 cents a share in October to 40 cents a share yesterday. Shanghai-listed Nanhai Development is proposing to acquire C&G's main Chinese waste-to-energy business and assets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For example, both the Philippines and Thailand have regulations for Reits in place. India has also joined the fray, with market regulators expected to issue final guidelines on Reits early next year.\n\nReits tend to do best when located in the jurisdiction where their physical assets are found, given that investors will be more familiar with the assets. As other Reits jurisdictions develop, there will be less incentive for real estate players in these markets to leave home and come to Singapore to list.\n\nSingapore Reits venturing overseas may also have to compete against these Reits for assets. \"There will still be opportunities for Singapore Reits to acquire overseas assets, but they will always be competing against the local Reit market which may trade at a lower cost of capital because of investor familiarity,\" said Michael Smith, head of real estate investment banking in Asia ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThat said, the asset diversity of the Singapore Reits sector is seen helping it stay ahead despite the increasing competition. \"In Singapore, our Reits are buying everywhere, including Europe, US and Vietnam, and investors appreciate it. So I think for regional Reits, Singapore will continue to have the competitive edge,\" said Tan Kok Huan, managing director, asset-backed structured products, capital markets group, at DBS Bank.\n\nTaking Croesus Retail Trust (CRT) as an example, Mr Tan noted that while Japan has a larger Reit market than Singapore, CRT listed here because it has an Asia-Pacific mandate that was not confined to just Japanese assets. CRT's pipeline of assets with right of first refusal is all in China.\n\nThe regulatory regime in Singapore also remains attractive and does not impose any restrictions on ownership of foreign assets.\n\n\"Singapore is currently the only market where you can list purely offshore assets. If somebody wants to list purely offshore assets and that country doesn't have a Reit or BT market, Singapore is the natural choice,\" added Mr Tan.\n\nIt is for this reason that Fortune Reit, which holds a portfolio of retail malls and properties in Hong Kong, was able to successfully list on the Singapore Exchange in 2003, just two years after the first Reit in Singapore was successfully launched.\n\nIt helps that Singapore's tax regime does not impose further taxes once an entity has been taxed in a country with a headline tax rate of 15 per cent or more, he noted.\n\nFor that reason, Reits and business trusts holding purely foreign, or a mix of local and foreign, assets proliferate the Singapore market today. These include Ascendas Hospitality Trust with an Australia-based portfolio; Religare Health Trust which is entirely based in India; Mapletree Greater China Commercial Trust; and Croesus Retail Trust which has 100 per cent of its assets based in Japan.\n\nSingapore-based Reits are able to employ tax efficient structures to hold assets overseas, such as the Asset Backed Structure in Malaysia, or the Managed Investment Trust regime in Australia, said Jerry Koh, partner at Allen & Gledhill. Still, there are issues facing the Singapore Reits sector that may need addressing.\n\nThe top issue for most players is the sunset clause attached to the tax incentives here. For instance, the existing income tax, stamp duty, and GST concessions for listed Reits were renewed for an additional five years at Budget 2010, to March 31, 2015.\n\nIn addition, the Foreign-Sourced Income Exemption income tax, which previously did not have a sunset clause, was, as of 2010, subject to a sunset clause of five years till March 31, 2015.\n\nExtending this will provide certainty, particularly for investors, given that the incentive for individuals to receive distributions tax free is a powerful incentive, noted market watchers.\n\nIt might also be timely to relook the development limit imposed on Reits. Currently, Reits are only allowed to hold up to 10 per cent of their total assets in development.\n\nSing Tien Foo, associate professor at the department of real estate, National University of Singapore, pointed out that such a low development limit benefits larger Reits over smaller ones.\n\n\"If you look at Australia for example, there is no constraint on development, and the market sorts it out. Reits with a lot of development activities are seen to be more risky, and the market is efficient enough to differentiate this,\" he said.\n\nSingapore's small size is also a natural constraint. But this does not mean that there is no longer scope for local assets to be fed into Reits or business trusts.\n\n\"Because Singapore is a very finite island, of course some say there's limited 'Reitable' property, that's why they have to go overseas,\" said CapitaLand Singapore chief executive Wen Khai Meng.\n\n\"But I still think there are still a lot of opportunities because the population is still growing, the economy is expanding, and there's going to be a lot more shopping malls, hotels, offices, industrial buildings, business parks and logistics warehouses, etc. In addition, we have a lot of government buildings and HDB car parks which could well be put into a Reit.\"\n\nOn the business trust end, there are plenty of opportunities to list marquee assets, said DBS' Mr Tan.\n\n\"What would be great is listing our marquee assets with household brands. Asset classes like telecoms, train stations, power assets, ports and utilities give you very stable cash flow. Thailand has their skytrain, Hong Kong has their telecom (HKT Trust).

They are focused on property development and property investment in China's Guizhou province.\n\n\"The switch was timely then as it allowed the group to evaluate and access the assets within the Trechance Group, cherry picking only the properties that are of better value and development potential,\" Mr In told BT.\n\nHe added that the acquisition of Trechance Holdings, completed on Oct 29, underpinned CSH's commitment to the China real estate market and its aspiration to become a regional real estate player.\n\nIn August, CSH said it was looking to raise up to $14.7 million in a rights issue, and had partnered global construction player China Gezhouba Group Corporation to further its plans to become a regional real estate player.\n\nCSH shares closed 25 per cent higher at half a cent yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Other detainees included church lay workers, social workers and professionals.\n\n\"Just weeks before the arrests, I had seen a production by the Third Stage,\" he recalls. \"The play was about the Social Development Unit, the organisation that's supposed to encourage Singaporeans to date and get married... The play was completely harmless, so I could not imagine how these people could be a threat to society.\"\n\nHe would also not have imagined then that he would one day take on the lead role in Square Moon, a new political play written by one of the former detainees, Wong Souk Yee.\n\nWong was a co-founder of the now-defunct Third Stage. She was detained in 1987 for over a year for being suspected of conspiring to overthrow the government. Square Moon is inspired by the 2008 escape of terrorist Mas Selamat as well as her own experiences being detained without trial.\n\nWong says: \"You could say that I write from a certain 'privilege' of having experienced something most people haven't. I have an insight into the psyche of detainees because I've been there myself.\"\n\nSquare Moon took a long and winding route to the stage. Written last year, it was supposed to have a private reading at the Substation but that was cancelled. The Substation said it had \"been advised on the content of the play\" and decided not to allow it.\n\nSquare Moon was also set to be staged at the M1 Fringe Festival earlier this year, but that too got canned. Wong subsequently submitted the script to the Media Development Authority (MDA) and was given the approval three months later to stage it.\n\nNow Square Moon is set to open at the University Cultural Centre on Dec 20 with director Peter Sau at the helm and a cast of familiar faces that include Neo Swee Lin, Zelda Tatiana Ng, Erwin Shah Ismail, Hemang Yadav and Koey Foo.\n\nWong says: \"I'm glad it's been given the green light by the MDA, but I won't stop worrying until I see it on stage.\"\n\nThe story centres on a government political opponent (played by Lim) who is arrested and detained without trial. He engages a lawyer (Ng) but she too is detained under suspicion of conspiring with him. As a new government sweeps into power, Lim is released but Ng remains in prison. More surprises ensue.\n\nDirector Sau, who was approached by Wong and fellow ex-detainee Chng Suan Tze to be involved, says all the cast and crew members have agreed to work for a small token fee since the play is not getting government funding. Sau says: \"I wanted to direct the play even though I'm not getting a full fee because I believe it's an important subject. Our younger generations should not be allowed to forget this chapter. In order for us to move forward, we must know our history better.\n\n\"I'm also doing it because I studied under the late playwright and director Kuo Pao Kun from 2001 to 2003. He too was detained without trial in 1976 under the Internal Security Act and he never spoke about it. He would want me to direct this.\"\n\nSquare Moon will be staged at University Cultural Centre Theatre, 50 Kent Ridge Crescent, National University of Singapore, on Dec 20, 8pm and Dec 21, 3 and 8pm.

The acquisition resulted in the group becoming the largest holder of Peruvian anchovy quota and a leading producer and exporter of fishmeal and fish oil in the world.\n\nRevenue was HK$8.7 billion, a 9.2 per cent decline from HK$9.58 billion in FY2012. This was attributed to the fall in revenue from the frozen fish SCM division as a result of the lower average selling price of products.\n\nGross profit fell 25.8 per cent from HK$1.89 billion to HK$1.4 billion, in line with lower revenue and higher fixed costs.\n\nChina Fishery, which is 70 per cent owned by Pacific Andes, also posted its full-year results ended Sept 28, 2013.\n\nIt reported a net profit of US$83.8 million, up 7.3 per cent from US$78.12 million last year.\n\nRevenue went down 8.1 per cent to US$555.01 million.\n\nRevenue slipped largely as a result of a significant reduction in total allowable catch in the 2012 second fishing season in the Peruvian anchovy fishery, as well as a drop in revenue from the contract supply business due mainly to lower average prices of various products.\n\nRevenue from China Fishery Fleet fell 44 per cent, from US$49.9 million to US$27.9 million, due primarily to the strategic decision of not operating the fishing fleet in the South Pacific Ocean.\n\nDespite this, the group's newly established fishing operations in Namibia contributed positively to the performance of CF Fleet, while Peruvian fishmeal operations benefited from higher average selling prices of fishmeal and fish oil.\n\nPacific Andes' earnings per share for the full year were HK16.18 cents, up from HK15.54 cents. China Fishery's earnings per share were 5.33 US cents, down from 6.55 US cents.\n\nPacific Andes declared a dividend of 0.30 Singapore cents per ordinary share, while China Fishery declared a dividend of one Singapore cent for FY2013.\n\nNg Joo Siang, executive director and chairman of the group, said: \"The group will focus on the realisation of synergies and cost savings from Copeinca in the year ahead. The Peruvian fishmeal operation is our engine for growth. The substantial improvement in total allowable catch for the current and upcoming fishing seasons certainly will add an extra boost to this engine.\"\n\nHe added that the group will also explore the possibility of increasing the value of the catch by promoting Peruvian anchovy for direct human consumption, as it presents a long-term value proposition for the overall growth of the group's business.\n\nThe group will also retain Copeinca's listing status on Oslo B\u00f8rs in this period when it is considering various strategic options for improving the group's organisational and capital structures.\n\nThe Pacific Andes counter was flat at 12.9 Singapore cents, while China Fishery's stock closed down 0.5 cent to 39.5 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Jordanian flag carrier, which is pursuing the search for a partner and more aircraft purchases, has also had to absorb a drop in tourism from the Arab Spring uprisings in the region last year as well as workers' demands for higher salaries.\n\nMr Hadidi said a bond may be preferable over a sukuk because Jordan lacks experience with the Syariah-compliant securities. While the carrier didn't specify the duration of the bond, the security may pay a rate of about 5 per cent to 5.5 per cent as a five-year dollar bond, according to Amol Shitole, an India-based credit analyst at SJ Seymour Services Pvt. \"The implicit support from the Jordanian government would be the mainstay for this credit,\" Mr Shitole added.\n\nThe publicly traded company aims to quadruple capital from 84.4 million Jordanian dinars (S$149 million) in a private listing by the first quarter of next year, Mr Hadidi said.

If it's not going to be really, really successful, I don't think people are going to be falling over themselves to do that.\"\n\nLinc Energy said that it has seen keen interest from both local and offshore investors.\n\n\"We're gaining some very strong cornerstone investor interest in the region,\" its managing director Peter Bond told The Business Times in an interview.\n\nEarlier this week, the firm lodged its prospectus with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\n\nIts change in listing venue comes as Australian interest in resources and mining stocks, which dominated listings on the ASX over the past few years, wanes.\n\nShares of companies in the energy and resources sector on the ASX, especially small caps, have been hurt by weak commodity markets.\n\nAt the same time, SGX has been actively courting listings in the sector in the past few years.\n\nIn September, it introduced new mainboard listing rules for mineral, oil and gas companies to allow those not yet in production but with market capitalisation of not less than US$300 million to list.\n\nLinc Energy had a market capitalisation of A$520.5 million (S$595.2 million) as at Nov 15 on the ASX, and recorded a loss of A$63.8 million in its 2013 financial year.\n\nThe firm produces oil in the US, and owns undeveloped coal and shale resources in Australia. It also possesses unique underground coal gasification technology.\n\nMr Bond said that Linc Energy had chosen to list on SGX because of the latter's ability to tap international capital, as well as the increasing orientation of the firm's business towards Asia.\n\nLinc Energy also intends to move its regional head office and trading operations here, and will have 10 people in its newly set up Singapore office by next month for a start. Its headquarters in Brisbane has a headcount of 120.\n\n\"It seems logical that as the division grew that we started to look at being traded in Singapore,\" said Mr Bond.\n\nAlthough the mineral and oil and gas sector on SGX is still a fledgling one, he sees a first-mover advantage. \"We saw an opportunity to be first movers into an emerging index that we'd like to be part of and help set the trend on, where there are a number of investors starved of opportunity,\" he said.\n\nThe other main exchange in the region, the Hong Kong Exchange, is too China-centric, he said, reflecting general sentiment in the market.\n\n\"There are a lot of big companies that listed in Hong Kong in the last two to three years that simply have not traded well,\" he added.\n\nSingapore has become the preferred location in the region for resource stock listings, said Petra Commodities' Mr Migliucci. \"There's no doubt that SGX is becoming one of the favourite locations for resource companies, especially for the ones that have an Asian focus. Where it may lack in industry understanding, SGX makes up in scarcity value.\"\n\nBut he cautioned that more needed to be done for the cluster to continue to grow on the exchange, such as developing a pool of credible research analysts who cover these stocks.\n\n\"It's not just listing. It's the after-market trading. What happens one week, one month or one year after IPO? If you don't get a proper credible research analyst supporting the IPO story, it runs the risk of becoming an orphan stock.\"\n\nMr Bond also had a suggestion for SGX: simplify the process of listing.\n\n\"My prospectus is the largest prospectus ever listed in Singapore (with) 1,500-1,600 pages,\" he said. \"The same prospectus in Australia would be 10 per cent of that size.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was unclear if the remaining two bidders submitted final bids.\n\nSociete Generale's Asian private bank unit manages about US$13 billion, below the US$20 billion mark that the industry has come to see as necessary for critical mass in the region.\n\nEconomic growth has led to a surge in Asian millionaires and billionaires.

Chefs whipped up a variety of small bites. Dapper personnel distributed gift bags loaded with leather wallets and certificates marking the occasion.\n\nSingapore Airlines is reputed to treat its passengers regally, but not like this. Weeks after announcing that the Singapore-Newark, New Jersey, route that reigned as the globe's lengthiest non-stop flight would be \"retired\", the company was holding a retirement party for Flight SQ22 on Saturday before the final take-off.\n\nThe festive mood was tempered by an awareness among the travellers that the lone direct jaunt between the South-east Asian city and the New York area would end with the touchdown of the exclusively business-class jet nearly 10,000 miles and 19 hours after departure.\n\nFor Michael Smith of Merion Station, Philadelphia, this excursion on SQ22 would be his first and last. Returning from a month-long recruiting assignment in Asia for the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, where he is an associate director of admissions, Mr Smith agreed to serve as The New York Times' onboard eyes and ears. His written and oral account, which included interviews with fellow fliers, provided much of the material in this article.\n\nMr Smith's travel agent, while preparing the itinerary, had urged him to book SQ22 as the closing leg. \"You are really going to enjoy this experience,\" Mr Smith was assured.\n\nIt became apparent to Mr Smith before he sank into his beige window seat, 11K, and clicked shut his belt that the agent was prophetic. There was no rush to fill overhead storage bins. Attendants addressed him by name. The air was scented. \"Hot towels, reading materials and drinks appeared almost magically,\" he said, \"all of this before we even left the gate.\"\n\nMr Smith struck up a conversation with two SQ22 veterans, John Shettle and Joanne Lau. They assured him that accumulated stress dissipates because of the plane's calming ambience and valet-like service. Mr Shettle said he never witnessed even a hint of \"air rage\" from anyone on his numerous excursions.\n\nAmenities aside, regular passengers embraced the route in either direction for delivering them as rested as one can be from spending more than three-quarters of a day in a winging capsule. (It helps that each seat converts into a close facsimile of a bed.) Alternatives require switching planes, which can tack several hours and fatigue onto the trip.\n\nWhy is such a beloved route being retired?\n\nThe airline's explanation is that it is selling its small fleet of Airbus A340-500 aircraft, which also operated between Singapore and Los Angeles until last month.\n\nAviation analysts blame economic realities. A barrel of crude oil has tripled in cost since the inaugural voyage of SQ22 in mid-2004. (For four years, patrons could choose between business and coach class, which was still upscale enough to serve buffet meals.) \"Ultralong-haul flights like this are essentially flying jet fuel tankers,\" said Robert Mann, an industry consultant based in Port Washington, New York.\n\nFilling up the tank, which has a capacity he pegged at 57,000 gallons, is expensive. A prescribed minimum must be carried in case of a delayed landing or diversion to another airport, usually because of inclement weather, Mr Mann said. Less fuel is needed for international flights that involve a stopover for refuelling or a change of planes.\n\nFor Mr Smith, bound for home after completing his mission, the flight was all about comfort and frills. From a selection of a few hundred movies, he watched 42 and Pacific Rim, along with three episodes of Bob's Burgers cartoons. One meal, served with china and silverware on a starched tablecloth, featured salmon salad, another a Singaporean chicken rice dish, both from the menu. Mr Smith wondered what would have happened had he ordered an unlisted entree, as Mr Shettle once did to satisfy a sudden craving. The sausage and pancakes soon appeared on his tray.\n\nMr Smith did test the crew with a less challenging request. They came through with cookies, brought on a plate.\n\nThe least-expected luxury was discovered in the restroom, which was stocked with fresh-cut flowers. \"I looked around for a paper towel. No paper towel,\" he said, surprised to find a supply of absorbent cloth for drying hands.\n\nSome fliers on Saturday might have used the towels to dab tears of sadness. Adding to the dread of regulars is that the best choice left, at least on Singapore Airlines, is a flight with a stop in Frankfurt that arrives at John F Kennedy International Airport. Frequent flyer Tom Ward told Mr Smith that no sane business traveller wanted anything to do with JFK, while describing Newark Liberty International as easier to navigate.\n\nMr Shettle, who has long drawn amusement from acquaintances who mistakenly assume that such an extended stretch in the air is an ordeal, told Mr Smith that he was rarely eager to leave the plane upon landing.\n\nThe farewell flight for him and others, while awash in nostalgia, ended with no fanfare. A few goodbyes were exchanged and, after 19 hours of pampering, they returned to what Mr Shettle termed the \"real world\". Just outside Gate B6 at Changi, they can turn out the lights. The party is over. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

When things get crazily stretched, there are new emerging names out there to get in.\"\n\nWhile the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is poised for its biggest annual rally in 15 years, indicators from transportation stocks to the number of companies reaching 52-week highs to the rally's breadth are at levels that signalled further gains in the past. Even price-earnings ratios, up about 20 per cent this year, remain below valuations that preceded the end to previous bull markets.\n\nToo enthusiastic\n\nSince 2009, sceptics have said equities would decline, first because the credit crisis had killed the economy, and now because investors have become too enthusiastic for their own good. BlackRock Inc's Laurence Fink and Doug Kass at Seabreeze Partners Management Inc said this month that stocks were headed for losses after an almost uninterrupted rally that lifted the S&P 500 in one of its broadest advances on record.\n\nTo James Paulsen at Wells Capital Management Inc, the prospect of a tumble remains a long shot. \"Confidence is still barely average by historic standards,\" the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells Capital, which oversees about US$340 billion, said in a phone interview.\n\n\"The market is up big because for a long time we priced the financial markets for the end of the world. And really, all that's happened so far is that we found out the world isn't going to end.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.4 per cent to 1,804.76 last week, extending the 2013 gain to 27 per cent, as the pace of hiring increased. The index surpassed 1,800 for the first time and is up 167 per cent since March 2009, as Federal Reserve chairman Ben S Bernanke held rates near zero and initiated three rounds of bond purchases to stimulate the economy. S&P 500 futures expiring next month climbed 0.3 per cent in London.\n\nRallies in shares of smaller companies, banks and transportation stocks have been bullish signs in the past. During the four biggest bull markets of the last quarter century, peaks in those categories have come before the S&P 500 reached its highest level almost 90 per cent of the time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Russell 2000 Index of companies with an average market value of less than US$1 billion reached an all-time high of 1,124.92 on Nov 22. The S&P 500 Financials Index climbed last week to the highest point since September 2008. Indexes of transportation stocks and companies whose earnings are most dependent on economic growth reached records this month. \"Railroads in particular are quite sensitive to the economy, most of the smaller-cap companies have a more domestic business, and the smaller and regional banks tend to be more focused on lending to consumers and businesses,\" John Carey, a portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management who oversees about US$200 billion, said recently.\"As they prosper, the rest of the country will prosper.\"\n\nValuations in the S&P 500 climbed 20 per cent in 2013 as more than 440 stocks in the gauge advanced. Even with the expansion, the price-earnings ratio, at about 19, remains 19 per cent below the average level at which bull markets ended since 1982, according to data compiled by S&P and Bloomberg. The index traded at more than 30 times earnings when stocks plunged in 2000 and at 21 in 1987.\n\n\"It's still a buy-on-the-dips equity market,\" Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management, said in a phone interview from Minneapolis. He helps oversee US$112 billion. \"Inflation is contained, sentiment is still generally positive, and valuation is in that fair camp.\" Netflix Inc, Best Buy Co and Micron Technology Inc led the S&P 500 in 2013, climbing more than 200 per cent since January, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They're among more than 190 companies reaching 52-week highs this year.\n\nStock gains continue for another 22 months after a peak in the number of companies setting new highs, according to the average in the last three bull markets. In the last rally, 121 stocks traded at highs on Nov 3, 2003, the most for any day during that cycle, and the index rose 48 per cent through 2007. The S&P 500 climbed 33 per cent in the 13 months after 177 companies set records in June 1997.\n\n\"Rising markets attract attention and focus,\" said Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, which oversees US$190 billion.\n\n\"People want to participate and be part of the crowd.\" Individual investors are just now coming back to the equity market, sending about US$27.1 billion to stock managers in 2013. The deposits would make this year the first since 2006 that equity funds have seen net inflows, after almost US$400 billion was withdrawn the previous four years, according to data compiled by the Washington-based Investment Companies Institute.\n\nRecord highs\n\nStocks have climbed after flows turned positive in the past, according to ICI data going back to 1984. Investors added US$6.8 billion to the funds in 1989 after taking out almost US$15 billion in 1988. The S&P 500 started its biggest bull market on record in 1990, as inflows doubled that year. Flows turned positive in 2003, when deposits totalled US$144 billion, and the S&P 500 kept climbing until October 2007.\n\n\"Retail investors are shifting into equities,\" Lawrence Creatura, a Rochester, New York-based fund manager at Federated Investors Inc, which oversees US$367 billion, said by phone. \"It certainly bolsters the chance for stocks to continue to rise. It is a source of demand for shares.\"\n\nThis year's 27 per cent advance has gone almost uninterrupted, leading Mr Fink and Mr Kass to question the sustainability of the rally. The 25 months since the S&P 500's last 10 per cent drop is the longest stretch without such a decline since 2007, according to S&P.\n\nGains have pushed the S&P 500 to a record 1,804.76 this year, more than 15 per cent above the high set in October 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That's come even as profit growth slowed this year and economists cut growth projections.\n\n\"Traders and investors, strategists and pundits are now almost historically complacent,\" Mr Kass, the founder of Palm Beach, Florida-based Seabreeze, said in a Nov 12 Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom Keene and Michael McKee. \"They're glib.\"\n\nMr Kass has grown more bearish on the S&P 500 since he said a year ago that fears were overblown and called for the S&P 500 to rise to a record. \"I have more than one foot out the door and I'm looking for short opportunities,\" he said this month.\n\nStocks may decline as much as 15 per cent because of political risks in China, Japan, France and the US, according to Mr Fink, whose New York-based BlackRock is the world's largest money manager with US$4.1 trillion in assets. Last year Fink said he would invest all of his personal wealth in equities.\n\nThe steady surge isn't reason enough to worry about a correction, according to BMO Capital Markets. There have been 17 pullbacks of at least 5 per cent since the rally started 41/2 years ago, in line with the average 15 times for bull markets since 1970, according to data compiled by BMO.\n\n\"There's clearly a lot of suspicion and doubt in this bull market, and that in and of itself gives it further fuel,\" said Rich Weiss, the Mountain View, California-based senior portfolio manager for American Century Investment who helps oversee US$130 billion, said by phone Nov 21.\n\n\"Not everybody is in. The level of exuberance can clearly grow.\" While the rally has lasted about six months longer and produced bigger gains than the average bull market since World War II, the number of stocks climbing this year is bullish. History shows that widespread stock advances one year have led to an S&P 500 rally the next. In the six times when at least 400 stocks posted increases since 1980, the index returned an average 14 per cent in the following year, according to Strategas Research Partners. All of those ensuing years were positive.\n\nAnalysts project earnings will expand 10 per cent next year and 11 per cent in 2015, doubling the 2013 growth rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. At the same time, the pace of economic expansion will increase through September 2014.\n\nMr Hodges said he sold Yelp, which is unprofitable, and Pandora, which trades at 261 times estimated earnings, after their valuations got beyond his comfort level. Since September, he's invested in Gogo, based in Itasca, Illinois, and online video advertising company Tremor Video Inc. Analysts say both will lose money next year.\n\n\"There's many segments of the market that are very undervalued and have great potential from here,\" Mr Hodges said. \"Overall, I don't see excesses.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

There's been a 55 per cent increase in the number of homes planned in the luxury market's lower end, mainly on the edges of neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Knightsbridge.\n\nSouth Asian buyers account for two-thirds of new London homes sold before completion, according to Land Securities Group, the largest UK real estate investment trust. There's a risk that those investors will grow weary of repeated sales exhibitions promoting London property, Mark Farmer, head of residential at EC Harris, said in the report.\n\n\"Pre-sales are happening in a much more crowded market and there are increasing challenges for developers and investors which are resulting from this,\" Mr Farmer said.\n\n\"We are seeing a critical juncture in the market, especially at the lower end of the prime range, where it can no longer be a given that you should spend more to make more.\"\n\nLuxury home values in central London rose 6.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, the slowest in about four years, according to London-based broker Knight Frank.\n\nDevelopers now expect to construct London homes worth more than \u00a350 billion (S$101.3 billion) over the decade, EC Harris said. Oversupply is unlikely in the luxury market because construction rarely happens if companies don't achieve their pre-sales targets. However, profit margins may be squeezed by rising building costs, the firm said.\n\nEC Harris, based in London, defines luxury homes as those that will sell for \u00a31,250 a square foot or more. That's up from \u00a31,100 last year.\n\nWealthy prospective buyers may be deterred by talk of higher taxes, Mr Farmer wrote in the report.

The planning permission for a residential SoHo unit, for instance, gives it clearance to be used as a home. A separate application has to be made for it to be used as a home-office, and several restrictions apply on the kind of business that can be conducted there.\n\nThe liberal use of the \"SoHo\" label has drawn flak, given that such units tend to be marketed at a higher price, and buyers find out - too late - that they cannot be freely used as a home and an office.\n\nDonald Han, managing director at Chesterton Singapore, said: \"A lot of people bought shoebox units on the basis of the developer describing them in their brochures as SoHo. With more shoebox units headed for completion, there could be grouses on the ground when people realise that there is no such thing as SoHo use.\"\n\nThe URA has thus issued a circular to developers and their marketing agents, urging them to make it clear to prospective buyers upfront on the approved use of the development. \"Buyers should also find out the approved use of the development before committing to a purchase,\" said a URA spokeswoman.\n\nDevelopers who choose to continue marketing their projects under the \"SoHo\" banner will have to spell out the approved use of the unit in the sale-and-purchase agreement. With residential SoHo units, they must include a clause to specify that the unit is to be used primarily as a home, but that the purchaser can, if he wishes, apply for permission to use the unit as a home-office.\n\nLee Liat Yeang, a partner at Rodyk & Davidson Real Estate Practice Group, said: \"I think URA is concerned that when developers say your unit can be converted to a home office, agents may represent that it can be any kind of office.\"\n\nTerms and conditions apply under the Home Office Scheme. One of these is that the business should not hire more than two non-resident employees. Businesses not allowed in home-offices include maid agencies, beauty or massage services, commercial schools, sales or marketing businesses, courier services or businesses which cause disruption in the neighbourhood.\n\nMr Lee said: \"Potentially, you can apply for home office use for any residential property. Of course, the nearer you are to town, the more likely it is. But with town centres now split among Woodlands, Jurong, and Paya Lebar, I won't be surprised if people buy a residential unit there and apply to convert it into a home office.\"\n\nOn the commercial front, developers and marketing agents can no longer use the term \"SoHo\" to market office developments, given that offices are not allowed for residential use.\n\nMr Lee said this appears to be a clear statement from the URA to discourage developers from using the phrase \"SoHo\" to market office developments.\n\nThe circular issued yesterday came on the back of a string of both residential and commercial developments being marketed under the SoHo banner, such as Far East Organization's residential projects The Siena and The Cape and its commercial project PS100 in Peck Seah Street. All 100 strata office units at PS100 were snapped up over its launch weekend.\n\nThat Far East features so prominently in the SoHo space is unsurprising. The group introduced the SoHo concept to Singapore, and unveiled a dedicated Far East SO/HO brand in 2011.\n\nFar East's executive director of property services, Chng Kiong Huat, said the group supports the greater clarity on the use of \"SoHo\". None of Far East's commercial developments are currently being marketed for sale under the SO/HO brand, although future residential projects that align with the specific brand attributes will continue to be marketed as such.\n\nMr Chng said: \"We have made it a point to highlight to prospective homebuyers the approved use of the relevant units under the Planning Act. Specifically, we take care to highlight to purchasers of our SO/HO properties that they will need to comply with the requisite conditions set out by the relevant authorities should they intend to use their residential unit as a home-office.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He did not elaborate on the nature of the questionable conduct and did not indicate whether the firm was under any further investigation.\n\nAnother Navy official said that Inchcape was suspended for failing to report credible evidence of significant contract overpayments, committing an offence indicating \"a lack of business integrity or honesty\" and conduct so serious that it affected the firm's ability to be a government contractor.\n\nInchcape Shipping had contracts to help arrange repairs and other services when US Navy vessels made port visits overseas. Rear Admiral Kirby said that the suspension was part of an effort by Navy secretary Ray Mabus to ensure that contractors are \"fully compliant with contracting regulations and procedures\".\n\nThe suspension came in the midst of a corruption investigation into the business practices of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia and its chief executive Leonard Glenn Francis, who was arrested in September and charged with bribing Navy officials to win business.\n\nSix Navy officers and a Navy investigator have faced action in connection with the probe, including two commanders and an investigator who were charged in the bribery conspiracy. Francis is accused of giving them luxury travel, tickets, prostitutes or cash for information helping him to secure government business.\n\nFrancis, a 49-year-old Malaysian businessman, was arrested in San Diego on Sept 16. A federal magistrate granted him US$1 million bail last week but stayed her ruling pending a review by another judge, leaving him in jail for the time being. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Foreign currency exposure is hedged, minimising currency risk.\n\nSaid Patrick Yeo, the fund's lead manager: \"Given the improving economic conditions in the US, we believe that investors are beginning to look ahead to a time when the US Federal Reserve will begin to normalise monetary policy.\"\n\nIndeed, US Treasury bonds have already started to factor in the prospect of higher interest rates, said Mr Yeo, who is also Fullerton's head of fixed income.\n\n\"Short-duration bonds are less vulnerable to rising interest rates, allowing investors to benefit from income payouts with measured risk,\" he said.\n\nThe fund invests in fixed-income securities, with average portfolio duration of up to three years and will be managed on a total return basis. It intends to distribute a quarterly dividend, income and/or capital gains permitting. On Oct 31, the fund's initial yield-to-maturity was 3.4 per cent.\n\nFullerton is targeting the fund to grow to at least US$1 billion in the medium term, given its evergreen features.\n\nIts flagship Fullerton Short Term Interest Rate Fund, which invests in short duration SGD bonds, is close to S$1.2 billion.\n\n\"The launch of this fund could not be timed better, in my view,\" said Kenneth Ho, Julius Baer managing director and Asia head of investment solutions group.\n\n\"As quantitative easing in the United States enters its final chapter amid a strengthening economy, investors should focus on short-duration instruments with credit risk.\n\n\"Higher up the issuer quality ladder, we also recommend adding short-dated investment-grade bonds to the mix. For investors seeking extra pick-up in a low-yield environment, short-dated investment-grade bonds offer attractive risk-return characteristics.\n\n\"And these issues are likely to outperform bonds from higher-quality issuers with longer duration as yields rise,\" said Mr Ho.\n\nJulius Baer is the second private bank that Fullerton has partnered to launch a new fund. The first was UBS, with whom it launched the Fullerton SGD Income Fund in January 2012.\n\nFullerton has a track record of managing short- duration fixed-income strategies. Its Fullerton Short Term Interest Rate Fund has delivered consistent top-quartile performance since inception.\n\nA unit of Temasek Holdings, Fullerton is an investment specialist, with expertise across all asset classes, including equities, fixed income, money market, currencies and alternatives. Its assets under management (AUM) total S$12 billion.\n\nPrior to its establishment in 2003, the fund management team operated as an in-house fund management division of Temasek Holdings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The traditional route was setting up a holding company in tax havens such as Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands, and listing that holding vehicle here.\n\nAn unstated hope is also that market confidence in China companies, dubbed S-chips, will improve. The reputation of S-chips has been tarnished by a spate of accounting and corporate governance scandals in the past few years.\n\n\"The regulatory processes and due diligence conducted by the relevant regulatory organisations in both countries will provide greater assurance to the marketplace,\" said SGX's deputy chief regulatory officer Richard Teng.\n\nLawrence Wong, SGX head of listings, added that he continued to see interest from Chinese companies wanting to list in Singapore.\n\nTong Dao Chi, director-general of CSRC's department of international affairs, said the regulator would work to give Chinese domestic enterprises a better understanding of listing requirements and a more efficient procedure and platform to list on SGX.\n\nUnder the framework, potential issuers will first do a pre-consultation with SGX before submitting their proposal to CSRC. Upon CSRC's acknowledgement of the receipt of relevant documents, the China companies can apply to begin the SGX review process.\n\nThen, the companies will need to get CSRC's administrative licensing approval, before SGX decides on whether to grant it eligibility to list here. CSRC's review typically includes checks on whether the company paid the necessary taxes, or own the proper legal title to land assets. SGX and CSRC generally have consistent standards for accounting and corporate governance.\n\nOut of the 140 S-chips here, only four are China-incorporated, and it has been many years since the last listing. The four are China Merchants Property Development (listed on SGX in 1995), Tiangjin Zhongxin (listed in 1997), Junma Tyre (listed in 2004) and Fujian Zhenyun (listed in 2007).\n\nThe agreement between SGX and CSRC arose out of bilateral initiatives to cooperate on financial sector development and regulation, agreed upon at last month's Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, the top bilateral body between Singapore and China.\n\nCSRC is the main regulator of China's securities industry. A year ago, it had blocked all IPOs from taking place in China due to fraud and market confidence issues. The IPO freeze resulted in a long pipeline of hundreds of companies.\n\nSome of those companies which have started on the CSRC process but are stuck waiting could now be drawn to Singapore, said Ernest Kan, chief of operations for clients and markets at Deloitte Singapore.\n\n\"The question is whether the company wants to go the extra mile and comply with international accounting standards to list here, or continue to wait,\" he said.\n\n\"Valuations in Singapore have improved in the past 12 months, and there is enough attraction to come here compared to Hong Kong.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apart from Singapore, the other non-European in the Top 10 is the United States.\n\nBruno Lanvin, Insead's executive director for global indices, said at a press conference that it's pretty obvious the rich nations have the money to produce the talent.\n\nInsead also said in a press release that the top ranked nations have many things in common, including \"a long-standing commitment to quality education (United Kingdom, Switzerland, Finland and Sweden), history of immigration (United States and Australia) and a clear strategy to grow and attract the best and the brightest (Singapore)\".\n\nThe index measures a country's competitiveness based on \"the quality of talent it can produce, attract and retain\", said the press release.\n\nCountries are ranked according to their scores in six \"pillars\" - enablers, attract, grow, retain, labour and vocational skills and global knowledge skills populated by 48 variables.\n\n\"This allows a broad combination of data measuring how a country grows, attracts and retains talent, going from government policy and quality of education to sustainability or lifestyle, for example,\" the press release said.\n\nEnablers cover the regulatory, market and business landscape. Attract refers to external and internal openness. Grow reflects formal education, lifelong learning and access to growth opportunities.\n\nRetain points to sustainability and lifestyle, while labour and vocational skills encompass employable skills and labour productivity. Global knowledge indicates higher skills and competencies and \"talent impact\".\n\nSingapore ranks very highly on enablers (3rd).\n\n\"It is one of the easiest places in the world to do business with a strong and stable political setting,\" Insead said. \"It is able to attract foreign students and is strong in higher level skills and formal education.\"\n\nBut Singapore can do better in internal openness, access to growth opportunities and employable skills where it scores relatively low. Also, while it is placed runner-up in the overall index and the sub-index for input, it's at No 6 on the output sub-index. But Mr Lanvin said that being a relatively new nation, it takes time for Singapore's input to be translated into output.\n\nFirst-placed Switzerland tops both the input and output sub-indices. It excels in almost all the variables. The country's least convincing performance is in the attract pillar.\n\nThe Global Talent Competitiveness Index is expected to be published annually, at least for the next five years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Meanwhile, the yen continued its downward slide against most major currencies yesterday in an accelerating trend which economists say will also tend to push up inflation as the cost of imported intermediate inputs leads to rises in the price of finished products.\n\nThe core-core index edged up 0.3 per cent in October while the core index (including energy prices) rose 0.9 per cent. Core prices have risen sharply but mainly because Japan is having to import more fuel in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and because the yen price of these has jumped.\n\nNeither the BOJ nor the government are ready to declare victory in the battle to turn 15 years of deflation into sustained inflation, and the BOJ is not yet within sight of its target of achieving a 2 per cent annual rise on (core) consumer prices.\n\nBut analysts are beginning to speculate that such a declaration may not be too far off.\n\n\"It may not be so long until the government declares an exit from deflation if consumer prices excluding foods and energy stay in positive territory stably,\" economist Masahiko Hashimoto at Daiwa Institute of Research in Tokyo was reported by Kyodo as saying yesterday.\n\nMinister of Economic and Fiscal Policy Akira Amari, meanwhile, said that \"as the effects of Abenomics further make progress, the move to start exiting from deflation has become clearer\".\n\nOne factor contributing to the rise in basic inflation in October was a rise in the price of household durables, where the price of intermediate inputs of parts and components from China and elsewhere is rising under the impact of a weakening yen.\n\nThe yen slid to a new six-month low of 102.52 to the US dollar in Tokyo yesterday and to 103.695 to the euro. Against the pound, it also traded lower at around 167.\n\nHousehold spending in Japan rose 0.9 per cent in October from a year earlier in inflation-adjusted terms, Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs said yesterday, despite upward trending prices.\n\nJapanese industrial output rose 0.5 per cent in October from the level in September while in November, manufacturing activity expanded at its fastest pace in more than seven years, according to government data.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The US move follows Japan Airlines Co's (JAL) decision to shift to other jets from 787s on some Asia routes.\n\nThe icing risk adds urgency for pilots to steer clear of thunderstorms already shunned because of potentially deadly lightning and turbulence. Jets flying at high altitudes through tropical zones can be at risk from powerful storms that promote the formation of performance-sapping ice, according to GE, the world's largest maker of jet engines.\n\n\"It's a relatively rare phenomenon because it requires just the right meteorological conditions,\" Hans Weber, president of San Diego-based aviation consultant Tecop International Inc, said. \"This isn't a problem that will be limited to GE engines. These crystals have been found in all engines at high altitudes near thunderstorms.\"\n\nThe twin-engine Dreamliner, the first jet made chiefly of composite materials, entered service with ANA Holdings Inc's All Nippon Airways in October 2011. Tokyo-based ANA, the biggest Dreamliner operator, uses Rolls-Royce Holdings plc engines on its planes.\n\nJAL's 787s have GEnx engines, as do the Dreamliners flown by United Continental Holdings Inc, the only US airline flying 787s.\n\nChicago-based United hasn't changed schedules or routes for its Dreamliners, said Christen David, a spokeswoman.\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc, the lone US operator of 747-8s, adjusted operations after Boeing's Nov 23 warning for GEnx-equipped jets to stay 90km from storms, said Bonnie Rodney, a spokeswoman.\n\nAny disruptions for the freighters from the Purchase, New York-based company \"will be minimal and can be managed with only minor reroutings\", she said on Monday.\n\n\"This looks a lot like a classic teething issue,\" Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Fairfax, Virginia-based consultant Teal Group, said. \"It's probably isolated to just the engine, and even then just one of the two engines available as options. It's also probably easily fixed with a software tweak, rather than any kind of hardware modification.\"\n\nGE said it's making software modifications to eliminate the ice-buildup risk and expects them to be available in the first quarter.\n\nMarc Birtel, a spokesman for Chicago-based Boeing, said the engines' design and maintenance practices, together with the new instructions, allow for the jets' \"continued safe operation\".\n\n\"The FAA has been working closely with Boeing and GE to monitor and understand these events as the companies develop a permanent solution,\" the FAA said in a statement.\n\nBoth the 787 and 747-8 have had bumpy debuts. The 747-8 was two years late in starting service in 2011, and slack demand forced Boeing to cut output.\n\nThe Dreamliner, whose 2011 entry was 31/2 years late, had been grounded for three months in January after meltdowns in the lithium-ion battery packs on two planes.\n\nThere have been six cases since April of planes with GEnx engines temporarily losing thrust in high-altitude icing conditions, Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said on Nov 23. Five were with 747-8s and one was with a 787, according to it.\n\nJAL will replace 787 Dreamliners on flights between Tokyo and Delhi with Boeing 777s until Nov 30, and will switch to 767s on its Tokyo-Singapore route, according to a Nov 23 statement. The Tokyo-based carrier will make a decision this week on flights past Dec 1, said Jian Yang, a spokesman.\n\nBoeing surpassed 1,000 orders for the Dreamliner with its haul at the Dubai Airshow this month. The company handed over 57 of the four-engine 747-8s, through the end of last month, most of which are freighters. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Indeed, Malaysian companies were the largest group of property investors in London last year, pumping RM6.34 billion (S$2.45 billion) into the sector and snapping up mainly office buildings in the British capital.\n\nThe single-largest investment there is the iconic Battersea Power Station. Last year, SP Setia, one of the largest property developers in Malaysia, beat off a clutch of international developers to win the development rights to the station, paying \u00a3400 million for the privilege.\n\nSP Setia, owned by state trust Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB), later roped in Sime Darby, also ultimately owned by PNB, and the EPF, the country's largest private pension plan, to defray the costs of the development.\n\nThe mainly Malaysian-funded syndicated loan is led by CIMB as the coordinating mandated lead arranger and book runner, but Singapore's OCBC Bank, Standard Chartered and Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank) have also been named as joint mandated arrangers.\n\nBPHC chairman Liew Kee Sin, who is also the chief executive of SP Setia, said: \"We are delighted that our bankers, who have worked with us for many years in Malaysia, have come out so strongly to support our efforts to revitalise the Battersea Power Station.\"\n\nBernama reported that he was speaking at a loan-signing ceremony witnessed by the Minister of Urban Wellbeing, Housing and Local Government Abdul Rahman Dahlan.\n\nThe financing is the largest real-estate loan extended this year and includes a five-year development facility to support Phase 1 of the development and the refurbishment of the Battersea project over the next 31/2 years.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg reported that the developer plans to sell the luxury apartments for as much as \u00a330 million each, anticipating that buyers would pay a premium to own prominent pieces of the historic building.\n\nMr Liew said in Kuala Lumpur yesterday that BPHC would start selling 250 apartments at \u00a32,500 per square foot in April. The estimated price of a penthouse in the derelict power station, to be built in the second phase of construction, is \u00a325 million to \u00a330 million, the company said.\n\n\"This is the only apartment in the UK, and perhaps Europe, that's being built on top of a power station,\" Mr Liew told reporters. \"There are people who want to own a piece of the history.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Until that inventory starts selling off, new aircraft sale will not rebound,\" Mr McGeough told Reuters in an interview.\n\nFive years on from a credit crunch that badly hurt the industry, manufacturers of small business jets are only now speaking of shoots of recovery, lagging well behind a rebound in the global equity and US housing markets.\n\nPlentiful secondhand jets are crimping demand for new light and medium-sized aircraft, in stark contrast to top-end products on display in Dubai, according to experts.\n\n\"It's a customer's market and buyers are smart,\" Marco Tulio Pellegrini, chief operating officer for business aviation at Brazilian business jet manufacturer Embraer, said. \"Many are looking at the used market for replacement, forcing manufacturers to increase discounts,\" he added.\n\nRe-manufacturing is the process of bringing end-of-life goods back to their original condition and is responsible for a growing share of the manufacturing sector.\n\nStarting out from the familiar tyre retread, the process can cover anything from refrigerators to ink cartridges, medical pumps, gearboxes, office furniture - even locomotives.\n\nAccording to a 2012 US trade report, aerospace is the largest re-manufacturing sector worth US$13 billion annually. But until now, this has mainly been confined to aircraft parts.\n\nHowever, while large business jets are benefiting from new technology, some analysts say re-manufacturing merely underscores industry woes at the lower end of the market.\n\n\"It's a sign of a stagnant market . . . (with) not a lot of technology coming in,\" said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice-president of Teal Group. \"The idea is sound in that most of the progress in business jets, especially lower end business jets, has been in propulsion and avionics.\"\n\nNextant has sold 36 of its re-manufactured business jets.

Canadian Bombardier's smallest aircraft start off at US$8.1 million and Gulfstream's at US$15.7 million.\n\nSuppliers see demand for low-cost business jets even in the oil-rich Middle East, in the wake of corporate budget cuts and the shrunken wealth of high net worth individuals. \"The light and mid-sized segment was impacted the most, while the larger cabins weathered the downturn well,\" said Scott Neal, senior vice-president of sales at Gulfstream.\n\nNine months after seeking bankruptcy court protection from high debts, the manufacturer of Nextant's revamped planes, Beechcraft Corp, emerged from Chapter 11 this year minus the \"Hawker\" name.\n\nIt stopped producing the Japanese-designed airframes being retrofitted by Nextant several years ago.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDreamweave & Other Stories\n\nMillenia Walk, #01-34\n\nTel 6333 1669\n\nOpening hours: 10:30am to 9:30pm daily\n\nCOLIN Banning says \"life is full of happy coincidences\", when describing how his store came about. His wife, Jenny Looi, first chanced upon Sika-Design's rattan and outdoor furniture at a trade fair in Europe, and was impressed by the Danish brand's design and quality.\n\n\"Jenny saw a business opportunity to bring it to Singapore, and as luck would have it, the owner of the business and his daughter, Knud and Louise Andreasen, were also at the fair,\" Mr Banning recalls. The conversation that started then led to the Andreasens coming to Singapore on their next trip to Asia, where Mr Banning met them and sealed an agreement with them to be their exclusive distributor.\n\nLast month, he opened Dreamweave & Other Stories in Millenia Walk. Apart from Sika-Design, he is also the exclusive distributor for Tine K Home, another Danish homeware brand, and Campomaggi, an Italian brand for leather bags. The store also sells a small collection of Herskind bicycles from the UK and Louise Kragh jewellery from Denmark.\n\n\"We didn't plan to specialise in Danish design,\" says Mr Banning, who used to head the finance department at food manufacturing company Mars. Ms Looi is the managing director for Villeroy & Boch Asia Pacific.\n\n\"Sika-Design was the first. Tine K Home was a clear second choice as they already had a strong collaboration with Sika-Design and their designs complement each other well,\" says Mr Banning. The couple selected the other brands based on their quality and design. \"If we feel they have the potential to delight, we bring them in.\"\n\nSika-Design is a family-run business founded by Ankjaer Andreasen in 1940 that produced wicker and straw baskets, before expanding into rattan furniture. Today, the firm is run by Ms Andreasen, the third generation owner. Sika-Design is the largest Danish rattan furniture manufacturer and has its factory in Indonesia.\n\nThe brand prides itself on its timeless designs in the form of handcrafted rockers and armchairs. Some of the pieces in its Icon collection were designed in the 1940s, but would still fit in well in a modern home today. Bestselling pieces here include the Monet chair and footstool, Monet rocker, and the Affaire semi outdoor collection. \"The Icons collection is also a hit with architects and designers,\" says Mr Banning. The Monet rocker costs $980.\n\nFor Tine K Home, its down inner cushions, which start from $20 without cushion covers, are also popular for their comfort and they retain their shape well. Founded by Tine Kjeldsen, the collection is inspired by passion for beautiful objects and different cultures. Apart from cushions, there are also lamps, glassware, silverware, ceramics and carpets, available at Dreamweave.\n\n\"While we have no direct experience in furniture retailing, we have been avid furniture customers and know the industry landscape well,\" says Mr Banning. \"We base our selections on proven bestsellers within the collections, as well on our local knowledge of consumer tastes and preferences. We learn every day what appeals most to our customers, and interestingly, the popular products in Europe are selling well in Singapore.\"\n\nThe French connection\n\nRoche Bobois\n\n354 Alexandra Road, The Alexis, #01-19/20/21\n\nTel 6734 7939\n\nOpening hours: 11am to 8pm, Mon to Thurs, and Sun; 10am to 9pm, Fri, Sat\n\nMOVE over, Ikea. When it comes to shopping for furniture, the Swedish store is not the only option on Alexandra Road. French luxury furniture brand, Roche Bobois, is also muscling in on the action with a newly opened showroom on the same stretch. The brand, started in 1960, is best known for its cutting edge designs - think dining tables with sculpted legs.\n\nThe 7,500 square foot showroom carries two collections - Les Contemporains and Nouveaux Classiques. Like their fashion counterparts, both collections have new pieces that are introduced twice a year. Les Contemporains is the contemporary collection, and Roche Bobois works with designers such as Hans Hopfer, Pierre Paulin and Ora Ito.\n\nSome of its iconic pieces include the Mah Jong sofa that was first introduced in 1971. Designed by Hans Hopfer, the sofa comes in modular pieces and can be an armchair, sofa, lounge chair or a bed, depending on how the pieces are arranged. Brand conscious homeowners can have the sofa cladded in fabric from fashion houses such as Kenzo, Missoni, Ungaro, Jean Paul Gaultier and Sonia Rykiel.\n\nAnother popular item in the Les Contemporains collection is the Moonlight coffee table, which is sculpted from a single stainless steel \"thread\". Each piece is hand crafted in Europe. On the other end of the spectrum is the Nouveaux Classiques collection, where the pieces are inspired by France's long and illustrious heritage of artisan cabinet-making and also by neo-industrial trends. Think side consoles with scallop trimmings on them, or bookshelves with gilded handles.\n\nShopping for furniture here is not as simple as merely picking a piece. The brand prides itself on being able to customise its pieces, but the headache is in deciding which of its 100 colours in fabric or leather to pick. Not only that, the cushions come in a mix of feathers and multi-density foam, so you can decide how firm or soft you want your sofas to be.\n\nWithin the Nouveaux Classiques collection, the options are just as mind-boggling. Want a piece that looks more distressed? No problem. Don't like bronze? Then how about handles in gold, brass or silver? Roche Bobois declined to reveal prices for its products, since prices vary depending on choice of materials and finishings.\n\n\"You and your friend could have bought the same sofa or cabinet, but by opting for different colours, materials and finishes, no one can tell they are both the same piece,\" says Huma Qureshi, its public relations director.\n\nApart from selling furniture and home accessories, Roche Bobois also offers complimentary interior consulting services. Customers only need to bring a floor plan of their home, through a 3D rendering software, Roche Bobois' designers can create a 3D layout and image of the space using the brand's furniture pieces.\n\n\"We know how difficult it can be to imagine how a place will look, so this service takes away the guesswork,\" says Ms Qureshi.\n\nUpdated history\n\nMoreLess\n\n302 Jalan Besar Level 1\n\nTel 6294 0042\n\nOpening hours: 11am to 8pm daily\n\nMENTION Chinese furniture and images of rosewood furniture with pearl inlays come to mind. Which is fine if you're into antiques, but younger homeowners may be less than enthused about them.\n\nEnter MoreLess, a Chinese furniture brand created by furniture designer Hou Zheng Guang in 2009. The designs are distinctively Chinese but with a touch of modernity for an updated look.\n\nUnlike traditional Chinese furniture, which is mostly made of hardwoods such as rosewood and zitan, the pieces at MoreLess are made from walnut - sourced from a renewable forest in North America - which gives the furniture a softer and more contemporary feel. Walnut was also chosen for its natural light brown patina and for its grain.\n\nHaving been in the market for less than five years, Mr Hou says that \"creation is too early for us now, our mission is extending tradition\". This explains why some pieces from the collection are inspired by traditional items.\n\nFor example, the Benchmonk shelves ($5,200), are inspired by olden day benches. The shelves are stackable, but what makes them more unusual is that each shelf has legs of different lengths. But when placed on top of each other, the separate pieces work together to form a conversation piece.\n\nAlso eye-catching is a standing mirror, where the walnut frame is shaped like a vase. The mirror lives up to its name, Ping, which is Chinese for vase. Another popular choice is the Peach Tree hanger, a coat hanger so called because of how it looks.\n\nA more unusual piece in the collection is the Buddha Palm sofa, a modular sofa that resembles an upturned hand.\n\nMoreLess prides itself on creating pieces where \"form should be accurate, function should be complete, costs should be reasonable, and quality should be fine\", says Mr Hou.\n\nApart from Singapore, there are also MoreLess stores in Shanghai and Beijing.\n\nJoanna Lim, marketing manager for Luxur Home, which brought in MoreLess to Singapore, says that \"MoreLess appeals to those who love wooden furniture and have a keen interest in Chinese history\".\n\nMoreLess prides itself on creating pieces where 'form should be accurate, function should be complete, costs should be reasonable, and quality should be fine', says Mr Hou.\n\nDistinctively Scandinavian\n\nMatzForm\n\n302 Jalan Besar Level 2\n\nTel 6294 0042\n\nOpening hours: 11am to 8pm daily\n\nWITH its clean lines, designs that are aesthetically pleasing with minimal fuss, while still fulfilling their function, Scandinavian design has always struck a chord with Singapore homeowners.\n\nThat explains the proliferation of furniture stores that fly the Nordic design flag, but it looks like there's always room for one more.\n\nMatzForm was founded by Soren Matz, who trained as a cabinet-maker in his native Denmark. He later spent 20 years in Japan refining his craft, before relocating himself and his business to Shanghai.\n\nWhile the furniture is made in Shanghai, the design is distinctively mid-century Scandinavian. MatzForm works with well-known designers such as Marc Newson and Thomas Juul-Hansen on the collection which includes chairs, dining and living room sets. These are found in the brand's Twist Collection, which is young and with a more quirky take. Take the Twist sofa, which from afar, resembles two intertwined giant worms.\n\nMatzForm also has a Classic collection for more staid tastes. They're considered classics of Scandinavian design, which MatzForm has the licence to reproduce.\n\nSome of these classics include the Fireplace chair, $3,600 by Danish couple Trove and Edvard Kindt-Larsen, as well as the Panton Relaxer One Chair, $2,350. Designed by Verner Panton in 1974, this floor rocker consists of two bent wooden runners which are connected by slats. Due to the relatively small numbers produced then, the Panton Relaxer chair has turned into a highly collectible object for vintage design aficionados and collectors.\n\nApart from the Classic and Twist collections, MatzForm's third collection is made entirely from bamboo composites, which retain the natural strength and ecological benefits of traditional bamboo. The bamboo range has dining and armchairs, study desks and stools.\n\nMatzForm works with three manufacturing partners in Shanghai. Having spent the last seven years building up a relationship with them, Mr Matz confidently says that he has been able to \"develop our suppliers' quality to match the level of Danish craftsmanship\". Should some furniture pieces require fittings or components that MatzForm cannot source from China in suitable quality, it imports them from Denmark.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But sky-high property prices in cities have driven many urban dwellers to buy such low-cost homes.\n\n\"A buying frenzy has occurred in some places amid hopes that such 'small-property-rights housing' could be legalised,\" the newspaper said.\n\nChina's home prices have continued to set new records even after a four-year long official campaign to cool the market. The government is concerned that runaway prices could foment social unrest.\n\nThe paper quoted Xu Deming, a vice-land minister, as saying that the party plenum's decision to allow some rural land to enter a unified urban-rural land market was \"on the premise of conforming to the planning and is under usage supervision\".\n\nIn China, land in urban areas is owned by the state and can be freely traded. Land in rural areas is owned by collectives - villages and townships - and contracted out to farmers.\n\nRural land can only be used for property or industrial development after being requisitioned by the state. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH a booth promoting plush furs in the foyer, and interviews with upscale designers on their exotic-skin accessories and jewel-encrusted trinkets, the idea of fashion with a conscience seemed to be the last thing on the minds of participants at the recent SEA Of Luxury Conference. But closing the three-day International New York Times conference, an annual event with its latest instalment held here, was a session on socially-responsible luxury. And Stephen Dunbar-Johnson, president, international, The New York Times Company, said: \"My pledge is to continue to make sustainability one of the core aspects of the conference.\"\n\nThe luxury industry has been gradually waking up to ethical and environmental responsibilities, even as reputation-tainting scandals of sweatshop facilities continue to make headlines and major brands are put under the spotlight for their non-existent environmental policies.\n\nIndeed, when Livia Firth, creative director of sustainability consultancy Eco Age and founder of the Green Carpet Challenge, which pairs celebs with ethical designer ensembles for the red carpet, was asked if luxury would ever be conscionable, she said: \"I truly believe so! A lesson that many fashion pioneers have taught me is that sometimes fashion industry orthodoxy should and can be turned on its head.\"\n\nThe activist and wife of actor Colin Firth was in town to talk about her involvement with Chopard's first ethical high jewellery collection, using Fairmined-certified gold and diamonds with their origins certified by the Responsible Jewellery Council, a surveillance body on responsible sourcing and supply chain due diligence. The lacework-inspired pieces were first unveiled at a film premiere during this year's Cannes Film Festival, worn by actress Marion Cotillard.\n\n\"In Cannes, the first people to purchase the collection were Korean private clients, who bought it because of the story,\" said Mrs Firth.\n\nRather than being a one-off ethical range, Chopard will eventually extend the use of Fairmined gold to 100 per cent of its merchandise, according to Maxime Labey, its international retail director. This initiative is supported by the Alliance for Responsible Mining (ARM), a group that focuses on fair trade standards for small-scale and artisanal miners. The gold used by Chopard's ethical Green Carpet Challenge pieces originates from community mines in South America, and is then refined in a foundry specialising in fair trade raw materials.\n\n\"Two years ago, Livia asked Caroline (Scheufele, co-president and artistic director of Chopard), 'where does your gold come from?' and Caroline said, 'the Swiss bank? I don't know,\" said Mr Labey, who was also present at the conference, held at Capella Singapore. \"Almost all luxury jewellery brands buy gold from banks and it comes from different sources, nobody really knows where the gold exactly originates.\"\n\nWhile Mr Labey conceded that \"right now, I don't think most of our clients care (about the ethical production of jewellery\", he added that the family-run business is passionate about the cause, and will proceed with the use of Fairmined gold despite higher production costs because Chopard \"does not have shareholders to answer to\".\n\nBesides baubles, Mrs Firth has been working alongside top fashion labels, launching a partnership with Gucci to produce the world's first luxury handbag collection made from zero-deforestation, certified Amazonian leather earlier this year.\n\n\"This was the culmination of two years' of hard work transforming Gucci's supply chain to procure sustainably produced leather from the Brazilian Amazon, which was sourced from Rainforest Certified cattle ranches,\" added Mrs Firth. \"Rare materials, such as python skin, crocodile and fur are subject to a lot of research at the moment - wild versus farmed, skinning techniques, and so on.\"\n\nIn fact, Kering, the owner of Gucci and other high fashion labels like Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta, has recently set seemingly un-glamorous yet pragmatic targets applying to raw materials sourcing; paper and packaging; water use, waste and carbon emissions; hazardous chemicals; and evaluating its key suppliers to adhere to its code of conduct.\n\n\"Even if a customer does not ask a direct question about sustainability in the shop, we can play a major role in changing attitudes by educating suppliers about the use of water, handling of waste and biodiversity,\" said Marie-Claire Daveu, chief sustainability officer and head of international institutional affairs at Kering, who was formerly a senior civil servant for France's Ministry of Ecology and Sustainable Development.\n\n\"We are not promoting sustainability just for communications with our clients but we do it to ensure that the business can be continued.\"\n\nDuring the conference, Ms Daveu also announced the group's Python Conservation Partnership, which, among other initiatives, monitors the capture of wild pythons, standards of animal welfare and captive breeding . The programme is in collaboration with non-governmental organisations, the International Trade Centre (ITC) and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN SSC Boa & Python Specialist Group), and it is hoped to \"positively impact the conservation of the two biggest python species of South-east Asia which are affected by the python skin trade - the Burmese and the Reticulated Python,\" said Tomas Waller, chair, IUCN SSC Boa & Python Specialist Group.\n\nBesides the sustainable sourcing of the precious skins, carrying that all-leather tote just became less of a guilty pleasure, as Gucci now uses an organic tanning agent such that the leather and wastewater from the tanneries are free of heavy metals, which are part of the toxic waste that affects the inhabitants of neighbouring areas.\n\nFor those hoping to shun the use of animal skin completely, there is also the leather-free products by life-long vegetarian, Stella McCartney.\n\n\"It seems to me that fashion is the last industry on the planet to address ethics,\" candidly admitted the designer, who does not use any leather or fur in her designs. \"That's something I hate about my industry. Sometimes you get the idea that all these designers are up on their high horses looking down on mere mortals, saying, 'Who cares, it's fur, it's beautiful, darling!' Those people are out of touch.\"\n\nOne of the top performing labels for the Kering group, Stella McCartney also does not carry out animal testing for products such as its fragrances, and has launched organic and eco product lines over the years.\n\n\"Anything - this subject of sustainability or any in general - is in danger of becoming a trend or a one-off,\" said the Central Saint Martins graduate in an e-mail interview, known for her ability to balance femininity and functionality in her sharply-finessed styles. \"The important thing is that everyone keeps an interest in it, and there is a vested interest because we live on this planet and we need to look after it. It's not just the fashion industry, it's every single industry.\"\n\nFor Mrs Firth, the glamour of Hollywood melded with the aspirational cachet of fashion is the perfect platform for highlighting good causes.\n\n\"When Colin received the nomination for the Golden Globes in 2009 for Tom Ford's stunning movie 'A Single Man', I suddenly found myself having to accompany him on all the biggest red carpets worldwide,\" said the Italian-born mother of two. \"This was the perfect opportunity to combine what I did as a day job with Eco Age with highlighting the issues I care about: environmental impact and social justice in the fashion industry.\"\n\nThe United Nations Leader of Change recently launched a capsule Green Carpet Challenge (GCC) collection with online retailer Net-A-Porter, featuring 10 gowns from five British designers, Erdem, Burberry, Victoria Beckham, Christopher Kane and Roland Mouret, and 20 per cent of proceeds going to the (Red) Global Fund to fight Aids and HIV in Africa.\n\n\"If I ever felt cynical, I would never do anything,\" said Mrs Firth, when quizzed about the effects of the one-off GCC designs by major brands. \"You can't underestimate the effect of planting little seeds around. Even if you work with one designer only on a one-off project, you are still introducing new fabrics, new concepts, helping them join some dots they wouldn't necessarily think about and before you know it, you have changed them for ever.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But economists believe the upward trajectory of prices will continue into 2014, as higher wages are passed on to consumers.\n\nThe bounce back in October inflation data - up from September's surprise easing to 1.6 per cent - was partly due to a pick-up in certificate of entitlement (COE) premiums, which the government expects to remain volatile in the short term as the market adjusts to the pending re-categorisation of COEs.\n\nEconomists polled by Bloomberg had been expecting a marginally higher 2.1 per cent rise in CPI in October from a year ago.\n\nIn their joint statement yesterday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said private road transport costs rose by 2.7 per cent after declining by 2 per cent in the previous month. In September, a correction in car prices occurred due to high base effects.\n\nBut beyond car prices, October's CPI increase was also a result of food inflation, which stood at 2.5 per cent last month compared to 2.4 per cent in September.\n\nWhile part of this was due to slightly steeper price increases in non-cooked food, more expensive prepared meals at restaurants and hawker centres also nudged food inflation higher.\n\nIndeed, MAS core inflation inched up to 1.8 per cent from 1.7 per cent in September, due to stronger contributions from food and oil-related items.\n\nThe MAS core inflation measure excludes private road transport costs and accommodation costs. The rise in the latter mellowed to 1.9 per cent in October from 3.9 per cent the previous month, thanks to this year's final disbursement of Service & Conservancy Charges (S&CC) rebates for HDB households.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan told BT: \"There were rebates this time which brought accommodation costs down - otherwise we would've seen a higher (inflation number). There's no rebate in November, so inflation should edge higher going forward.\"\n\nIndeed, the MAS and MTI yesterday cautioned that headline inflation could \"rise further\" in November, \"as the effect of the October S&CC rebates dissipates and COE premiums increased in October\".\n\n\"MAS core inflation is expected to be higher in November 2013, partly on account of a low base a year ago,\" they added.\n\nWhile headline inflation is projected to come in at 2.5-3 per cent in 2013 and 2-3 per cent in 2014, the government expects core inflation to rise over the next few quarters, and average 1.5-2 per cent in 2013 and 2-3 per cent in 2014.\n\nSaid ANZ economist Daniel Wilson: \"Rising restaurant prices may be an early sign that this pass-through to core (inflation) is intensifying.\"\n\nAdded Mr Tan: \"The risk of inflation pick-up rests on domestic costs such as wages and rentals. Particularly for wages, the impending increase in the qualifying salaries for employment passes (January 2014) and another round of foreign worker levy increase (July 2014) will add on to the wage-bidding war in the currently tight labour market. Labour costs of the service industry will be impacted more as they tend to have higher labour input content.\"\n\nHowever, OCBC economist Selena Ling believes that such pass-through effects \"have been less than expected\", highlighting how services inflation eased to 2.5 per cent in October from 2.7 per cent in the preceding month, led by slower increases in the costs of recreation & entertainment and holiday travel.\n\n\"The government keeps warning about core inflation going up, but actually, we haven't really seen that acceleration effect yet,\" said Ms Ling, who yesterday downgraded her full-year growth forecast of headline CPI from 2.8 per cent to 2.4 per cent.\n\n\"CPI inflation for the first 10 months of this year is averaging only 2.4 per cent, and there appears to be little reason to expect a sudden uptick in inflation, especially from the imported inflation front, for the remaining two months of the year,\" Ms Ling added.\n\nWhile Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin also thinks it likely that this year's CPI will fall below the government's projected range of 2.5-3 per cent - he forecasts inflation to average 2.3 per cent this year - he, like UOB's Mr Tan, believes the pass-through of domestic costs will become stark in 2014.\n\n\"It'll be a different story in January ... A lot of wage adjustments are lumpy, and they tend to happen at the start of the year. We'll probably get a feel of how hefty they are, I suspect, only in the January and February inflation numbers. Chinese New Year is also a popular time for price adjustments as well,\" noted Dr Chua.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/will-sti-close-2013-bang-or-whimper", "site_title": "Will STI close 2013 with a bang or a whimper?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWill STI close 2013 with a bang or a whimper?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAS 2013 winds down to a close, it's obvious that, barring a major year-end miracle, the Straits Times Index (STI) - which rose 19.7 per cent in 2012 - is set to turn in a poor showing this year. It started 2013 at 3,167 and closed at 3,172 last Friday: a measly gain of just 5 points in almost 11 months.\n\nTwelve months ago, there was a sense that the worst was over for the global economy, that the money printing by the US was working and turning its economy around, and that China would continue to grow strongly while avoiding a hard landing.\n\nSo it was that the investment community was generally bullish for the year that lay ahead; one local house, for example, said it was not unreasonable to expect the STI to gain 24 per cent.\n\nNo criticism is due here, though, for those who missed the mark - very few experts could have foreseen the significant role that the fear of quantitative easing (QE) tapering by the US Federal Reserve would play in rocking emerging markets. Nor would it have been possible to predict the various problems investors had to deal with, such as the difficult Italian elections in February, sequestration, and the US government's shutdown last month.\n\nHowever, it is interesting to see that despite the natural tendency of brokers and banks to try as far as possible to paint an optimistic picture for their clients (after all, pessimism doesn't really sell), there were a few who went against the grain and issued sobering assessments a year ago of what investors could expect.\n\nIn other words, while some were wildly off the mark, there were those who got it almost spot-on correct.\n\nPerhaps the most accurate prediction was made by Nomura Equity Research. It said in its Dec 3, 2012 Singapore Equity Strategy report titled \"Restructuring clouds outlook\" that, at best, the market would produce only a single-digit return for 2013, \"with the possibility of a negative return if the economy turns out worse than expected\".\n\nNomura went on to say the year was likely to see \"lacklustre\" trading, and that it was bearish on property developers and neutral on banks.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if the STI (which, as noted earlier, is only 5 points to the good for the year) does indeed slip into the red in the next five weeks.\n\nThen we have DBS Vickers, which in a Jan 4, 2013 report titled \"Global over local\" said Singapore would underperform the region. \"The Singapore economy will continue to face a slow-growth high-inflation environment in 2013 due to the sluggish global economic outlook and domestic restructuring from efforts to tighten foreign labour policies,\" said DBSV.\n\nIt said the STI's downside was limited to 3,050, while upside was capped at 3,260. Last Friday, the index's 2013 low and high were 3,004 and 3,454 respectively. So DBSV's estimate of the low was almost on the dot, while its projected high turned out to be a bit too conservative.\n\nIn the meantime, OSK DMG said in a January report that \"investors concerned with global macro-economic developments are unlikely to invest aggressively in equity markets\". It forecast a year-end STI of 3,251, based on a sum-of-the-parts analysis - only 79 points away from last Friday's close. There's still time yet for this prediction to be proven correct.\n\nAnother broker deserving mention is CIMB. It downgraded Singapore from \"overweight\" to \"neutral\" a year ago, saying that 2012's outperformance, lack of earnings growth and restructuring-induced cost pressures would act as headwinds.\n\nCIMB said the eurozone would not break up despite the fears which abounded at the time. It also predicted that the US would overcome the \"fiscal cliff\" fears hampering markets at the start of the year.\n\n\"Ahead, investors could price out doomsday scenarios and stretch for growth,\" said CIMB. \"Singapore could lag as it is not associated with growth.\" Blunt, but honest.\n\nLast but not least, Morgan Stanley in its Nov 26, 2012 Asean Equity Strategy report said although it expected Asean to deliver an average return of 9.9 per cent for 2013, Singapore was its least preferred market, with a projected return of just 2.8 per cent.\n\n\"In our view, Singapore has the poorest earnings visibility . . . although it has the least policy and political volatility, its high external trade and capital linkages make the macro environment quite vulnerable to global growth,\" it said.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see if these houses can maintain the same predictive accuracy for 2014 - a year in which Fed tapering is expected to kick in. Or could the others redeem themselves? Stay tuned as we check back in a year's time.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But this is no longer just about picking out unexplored sectors to zero in on and make winners of, as they once did with electronics, petrochemicals or biomedicals.\n\nRather, the next big things now are the ligaments connecting these industries: potentially disruptive technologies such as 3D printing, digital advancements, consumer analytics, supplier networks, and access to the growth market of Asean.\n\n\"What Singapore has done to date is to build up very strong industry verticals,\" says Yeoh Keat Chuan, managing director of the Economic Development Board (EDB). \"Competitive, they stand very well on their own. What we started doing about a year ago is, we started to look at the connections between the verticals and ask 'Can we strengthen that?' And as a result, 'Can we build clusters of clusters?'\n\n\"I think moving forward, you will see a mix of approaches and outcomes,\" he said in an interview with BT.\n\nSo EDB, the government's lead agency for planning and executing Singapore's economic strategies, will continue to explore new industry clusters, or \"verticals' in EDB parlance. But only those adjacent to the city-state's existing strengths will be developed further.\n\nMr Yeoh said: \"We moved into biologics. Why? Because we had strengths in pharmaceuticals. It was something of a leap. Companies said making large molecules is quite different from small molecules. But we sent Singaporeans abroad to be trained and they came back and built it up.\"\n\nThere are now eight biologics facilities here - $2.4 billion worth of investment that has generated 1,700 jobs so far.\n\nSimilarly, the satellite industry, \"the new kid on the block\" for which $90 million has been set aside, has been identified as an emerging area of growth because the skills needed are closely related to those deployed in Singapore's electronics, aerospace and precision engineering sectors.\n\nCritical to Singapore's future economy, however, are the \"horizontal\" planks which cut across multiple sectors. Hence this is where the bulk of the $500 million set aside for \"the future of manufacturing\" earlier this year in Budget 2013 will be put to work.\n\nOne type of connecting tissue all sectors would gain from is a strong regional supplier base and network. Some $250 million of the $500 million earmarked will go to supplier development to ensure local suppliers meet the highest manufacturing quality standards and to building a regional network.\n\n\"This time around, we looked beyond Singapore's borders and boundaries. We're a small island; it doesn't really make sense for us to do everything here. We have to work closely with our neighbours to see how we can form a much more complementary ecosystem,\" Mr Yeoh said.\n\nOther \"horizontals\" include advanced manufacturing technologies that may disrupt production cycles: 3D printing or additive manufacturing, robots, Asian consumer insights, and big data.\n\nData analytics is one \"horizontal\" that extends beyond manufacturing to established services sectors here: security, healthcare, urban solutions, retail, finance, and supply chain management.\n\n\"We felt that the positioning for Singapore was to be a global hub for applied analytics enabled by data. Again, not the basic science, but the applied analytics: how to predict for supply chain management what you will need, or when engines must be sent for servicing,\" Mr Yeoh said.\n\nEarlier this year, Lenovo launched its global analytics hub in Singapore, adding to an analytics-based supply chain centre IBM launched last year, and Deloitte's data analytics think tank set up in 2011.\n\nThe government has said it hopes to train 2,500 data analytics professionals over the next five years, but feedback from companies already suggests this may not be enough, the EDB MD said. Prioritising the \"horizontals\" alongside \"verticals\" is no sudden shift in gears, said Mr Yeoh, who rose through EDB's ranks to become its MD last July.\n\nAfter all, it has been more than four years since the lead agency for planning and executing Singapore's economic strategies first articulated its \"host-to- home\" strategy - one which \"is gaining a lot of traction\", Mr Yeoh said. It is perhaps EDB's broadest \"horizontal\" stroke, to get global and Asian businesses to view Singapore not just as a kindly host, but a home to plunge their roots deep into, with regional headquarters, innovation and talent.\n\nHe cites examples of companies that seem to agree with EDB's pitch. Unilever's chief operating officer, GlaxosmithKline's officer in charge of all markets outside of the United States and Halliburton's intelligent completion tools business chief - they all sit in Singapore now. Applied Materials has its most advanced vacuum chambers manufactured out of Singapore, while Unilever, Sony and Samsung have also set up corporate universities or global training facilities here.\n\nYet, successive rounds of policy changes to slow the growth of foreign manpower over the last four years have led foreign business chambers and companies alike to voice discomfort at the reduced ease of hiring even skilled talent.\n\n\"Talent is always a critical success factor. The question for us is how do we work with our universities to ensure that they are providing the right training to meet our industry's needs,\" said Mr Yeoh.\n\nIn his view, preparing people for new jobs is also about capturing imagination and sparking a sense of excitement in Singapore's youth over future job possibilities. That too, is part of EDB's role, he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We respect JAL's decision to suspend some 787 service on specific routes,\" a Boeing spokesman said.\n\nThe move followed six incidents from April to November involving five 747-8s and one 787 when aircraft powered by GE's GEnx engines suffered temporary loss of thrust while flying at high altitude.\n\nThe problem was caused by a build-up of ice crystals, initially just behind the front fan, which ran through the engine, said a GE spokesman, adding that all of the aircraft landed at their planned destinations safely.\n\nBoeing on Friday issued a notice prohibiting the affected aircraft from flying at high attitude within 50 nautical miles of thunderstorms that may contain ice crystals.\n\nJAL said on Saturday it would replace Dreamliners on its Tokyo-Delhi and Tokyo-Singapore flights with other types of aircraft while also dropping a plan to use 787s for its Tokyo-Sydney route from December.\n\nJAL will continue to fly 787s for other international routes, which are unlikely to be affected by cumulonimbus cloud for the time being, a company spokesman said.\n\n\"The aviation industry is experiencing a growing number of ice-crystal icing encounters in recent years as the population of large commercial airliners has grown, particularly in tropical regions of the world,\" the GE spokesman said.\n\nGE and Boeing are working on software modifications to the engine control system, which they will hope will eliminate the problems, he added.\n\nThe 787 can be powered by either GEnx engines or rival Trent 1000 engines made by Rolls-Royce plc, while the 747-8 is powered exclusively by the GE engine model. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It is fully leased to Optus Administration - a unit of SingTel Optus, the second largest telecommunications company in Australia - for a weighted average lease term of 8.6 years with fixed annual escalation of 3 per cent.\n\nSpeaking to BT, CEO Nicholas McGrath said that what attracted them to the property was the credit worthiness of the tenant and the trust's strategy shift in wanting to move more into business parks.\n\nAt the same time, the weaker Australian dollar and interest rates \"at historic lows\" also drew it to the market, where the network and real estate expertise of its two Australian sponsors, AIMS Financial Group and AMP Capital, gave it a competitive advantage.\n\nPost-acquisition, its Australian assets would make up 18 per cent of its portfolio, while its \"business park/hi-tech space\" slice of the pie would also grow from 16 per cent to 30 per cent.\n\n\"We want our exposure to be predominantly in warehouse and logistics as well as business parks,\" Mr McGrath said.\n\n\"We look at the Singapore government's policy and see that lower-value uses of land such as manufacturing are moving offshore, while land use for warehousing and logistics to serve ports and airports, hi-tech light industries and knowledge-based business parks such as JTC's one-north are growing. It makes sense for us to ensure that our investment strategy aligns with the government's strategy,\" he said.\n\nOn a pro forma basis, this acquisition is likely to boost the trust's distribution per unit and distribution yield by 5.7 per cent and 5.6 per cent respectively, while net property income yield will increase to 6.6 per cent from 6.3 per cent, he added.\n\nCBRE had last month valued the property at A$377 million in the open market. The value of a 49 per cent stake would therefore work out to A$184.7 million - on par with the trust's purchase price.\n\nAIMS AMP will fund the acquisition by drawing down on its new five-year Aussie dollar term loan facility, which provides a substantial natural currency hedge, as well as its existing dual currency SGD/AUD revolving credit facility.\n\nMr McGrath added that the trust has been using interest rate swaps to fix its interest rate exposure for the next three years, as well as \"favourable interest rates\" to enter into funding arrangements with banks to push up debt maturities.\n\nAll these, ahead of the imminent tapering of the Fed's bond buying programme, which is likely to \"reduce easy money sloshing around in the market, normalise rates in Europe and the US, and affect interest rate sensitive vehicles like Reits\", he said.\n\nThe acquisition is subject to unitholders' and Australian regulatory approval. The trust closed 2.5 cents lower at $1.50 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

As it fell to a six-month low of 101.94 to the dollar yesterday, the Nikkei 225 stock average market hit a six-month high of 15,942.60.\n\nThe weakening yen is good for Japan's exports although Mr Sasaki pointed to changing corporate structures in Japan, whereby more goods are manufactured overseas than in the past. Also, rising import costs could limit the benefits of currency deprecation.\n\nSpeaking at the Paris Europlace International Forum in Tokyo, Mr Kuroda acknowledged that the BOJ's inflation target is \"very ambitious\" but said that other leading central banks have set similar inflation targets and that the BOJ had been among the last to do so.\n\nIt is proving difficult to reverse the deflationary psychology brought about by 15 years of falling prices in Japan but deflation expectations are finally ending and core consumer prices are turning upwards, he pointed out.\n\n\"There is a long way to go but we have already achieved a positive inflation rate,\" he said. The BOJ promised in April to double Japan's monetary base within two years and also to double the central banks' holdings of Japanese government bonds within a similar time frame.\n\nMitsuhiro Furusawa, Vice-Finance Minister for International Affairs, also claimed at the forum that deflation is coming to and end and Japan's economy is expanding as a result of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies.\n\n\"Real GDP (gross domestic product) is growing, deflation is coming to an end, business confidence is improving and corporate profits are picking up,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Boeing received over a US$100 billion in orders at the recent Dubai air show - it is in large part the engine makers who are driving the mega sales, say experts.\n\nThey may not be as well-known as Boeing or Airbus, but the major engine manufacturers - US companies General Electric and Pratt and Whitney, Britain's Rolls-Royce and France's Safran - account for major part of the aviation market.\n\nEngines account for about a quarter of the total cost of an aircraft, according to Richard Aboulafia at the aerospace and defence consultancy Teal Group.\n\nThe numbers are not insignificant - GE took in US$26 billion orders in one day at Dubai.\n\nBut engines have also been a major source of innovation - it is the gains in fuel economy that are boosting orders of new aircraft by airlines.\n\nWhile carriers need to add aircraft to meet air traffic growth, which is doubling every 15 years, sustained high oil prices have pushed airlines to seek competitive advantage by acquiring new-generation models that promise savings on fuel.\n\nAt Dubai, Boeing's new long-haul 777X struck a record product launch for a commercial airliner by value, with a debut of US$95 billion in orders.\n\nBoeing says the new version of its biggest commercial success will burn 20 per cent less fuel while carrying more passengers.\n\nLike the 787 Dreamliner, some of the gains in efficiency will be from using lightweight composite materials, but mostly they will come from the engines.\n\n\"When a manufacturer announces a new aircraft model, the engine makers draw upon the technologies it feels are ready to propose a motor that offer a performance gain of 10 to 20 per cent\" from existing models, said Marc Ventre, Safran's deputy chief executive for operations.\n\n\"For engine makers it's an ongoing process, because if you don't have new technologies ready, you can't offer a new engine,\" he added.\n\nMr Ventre said it can take 20 to 25 years to develop a new motor.\n\n\"The jet engine development programme typically takes longer than an aircraft development programme,\" said Rick Kennedy, spokesman for GE Aviation, whose GE9X motors will power the twin-engined, twin-aisle 777X, which is to enter service around 2020.\n\n\"Now, there are clear examples where jet engines drive aircraft designs,\" he added.\n\nHe pointed to the 1980s, when the reliability of the new motors pushed the International Civil Aviation Organisation to allow aircraft with two engines to make transoceanic trips.\n\n\"So jet engine technologies drove the move toward larger twin-engine aircraft, such as the 777, 787, and A350 aircraft,\" said Mr Kennedy.\n\nMr Ventre said engine manufacturers conduct their own studies of the aviation market to be able to help anticipate what aircraft makers will want.\n\nSometimes, they get an engine design ready before aircraft makers are ready.\n\n\"In the case of the Leap, it is clearly the engine which precedes the plane,\" Mr Ventre said of the motor which Safran is manufacturing with GE Aviation in a joint venture.\n\n\"When in 2008 we announced at the Farnborough air show that we were capable of offering a new engine with new technologies that would reduce fuel use by 15-16 per cent, none of the aircraft manufactures was launching a new plane,\" said Mr Ventre.\n\nBut the next year China's Comac announced it would use the Leap for its entry into mid-size single-aisle segment, the C919.\n\nAirbus followed in 2010 with the announcement of the new version of its medium-haul workhorse, the A320neo - the moniker stands for new engine option.\n\nThe builder offers airlines the option of the Leap or Prat and Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine which will be ready in 2015, with the Leap due for delivery the following year.\n\nBoeing followed suit some six months later, announcing in 2011 it would update the 737 into the 737MAX, whose main change is the adoption of the Leap. -

But revenue-hungry governments are looking to impose tougher rules on so-called transfer pricing that could make it harder for firms to trade goods, services or assets between their Singapore and overseas entities. As a result, accountants warn that the city-state will need to review the level of transparency in its tax incentive schemes and get stronger justifications from companies on their transfer pricing arrangements to fend off challenges from other jurisdictions.\n\n\"Singapore's challenge is to ensure that it stands ready to adequately address any kind of unilateral tax action taken by other countries,\" said Abhijit Ghosh, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Singapore. \"In this brave new world of fiscal competition for the tax dollar, dispute resolution will be on the increase and Singapore will need to focus more resources on enforcing and defending its principles of value creation in international forums.\"\n\nThe city-state's government says it is against artificially contrived arrangements constructed \"solely for the purpose of flouting or exploiting loopholes in tax rules\", according to a spokeswoman from the Ministry of Finance. However, Singapore is also arguing that it should not be singled out because it has low tax rates. \"We must guard against new forms of protectionism masquerading as tax harmonisation,\" the spokeswoman said. \"We should avoid converging on high taxes globally as this would only hurt growth and jobs.\"\n\nCompanies justify booking significant amounts of revenue and profits in Singapore by the fact that they often run key business functions such as finance and operations, hold intellectual property rights there or base regional executives in the city. Apple says its Singapore base includes finance, operations, online sales and customer support functions.\n\nKey driver\n\nSingapore lures international companies with its reliable legal system, skilled, English-speaking workforce and high living standards. However, its low tax rates and generous tax incentive programmes are one of the biggest draws and have been a key driver behind the economic success story of the island.\n\nThe Group of 20 (G-20) big developed and emerging economies has backed a draft OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) plan that would give tax authorities greater rights to \"re-characterise\" transactions and ignore inter-company contracts if they believe they are aimed at channelling profits into low-tax countries.\n\nAlthough its size pales as a consumer market in comparison with the likes of India or Australia, Apple's Singapore-booked revenues for the year to September last year exceeded the US$10.7 billion of net sales it recorded in the rest of Asia-Pacific, excluding Greater China and Japan.\n\nIt recorded a post-tax profit on its continuing operations of US$186 million that year, with an effective tax rate of 6 per cent, according to company filings lodged with Singapore accounting authorities.\n\nApple's Singapore operations featured in a US Senate report detailing how US companies structured their operations to book the majority of their non-US profits in low-tax jurisdictions. The report, published in May, described the circuitous legal trip taken by a batch of Apple products made in China and destined for Asian markets.\n\nThe \"title\", or legal ownership, of the shipment is bought first by a unit in Ireland called Apple Sales International, before being sold on to Apple South Asia Pte Ltd in Singapore.\n\nThe Singapore unit, which is owned by another Irish entity - Apple Operations International - then sells the products to other Apple subsidiaries in Asia, third-party resellers or Internet customers. The gadgets may never even touch Singapore shores, according to the Senate report. Another Senate report in 2012 said Microsoft Corp had shifted some of its intellectual property to a Singapore subsidiary, as well as entities in Puerto Rico and Ireland, to take advantage of lower tax rates.\n\nMicrosoft Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd owns a Bermuda company called Microsoft Asia Island Limited (Mail), an entity that has no employees but shares 10 per cent of the software giant's research and development activities, according to the report.\n\nMail holds the right to sell Microsoft products in Asia, and then licenses those rights to another Singapore entity, Microsoft Operations Ltd (MOPL), which then sells Microsoft products across Asia. In 2012, MOPL earned around US$6.3 billion according to company accounts filed in Singapore, posted a profit from its continuing operations of US$368.7 million and paid an effective tax rate of 12 per cent.\n\nSignificant presence\n\nSuch legal arrangements are part of the focus of the G-20 and OECD projects to ensure that companies do not book profits in low-tax jurisdictions when most of the activity that generated those earnings went on elsewhere.\n\nApple said in a statement to Reuters that it has had a significant presence in Singapore since 1989 and employs more than 2,000 people. \"In every country where we do business we pay all the taxes we owe and uphold the highest ethical standards,\" it said.\n\nMicrosoft declined to comment on its tax arrangements. The company opened its first Singapore office in 1990 and bases its regional headquarters, its Singapore sales and marketing operations and its Asia-Pacific operations centre here. It employs around 1,500 full-time and contract employees.\n\nSingapore is not a member of the OECD, a 34-nation association of mostly rich countries, but has said it will support the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Report the OECD published in July this year. Singapore's headline corporate tax rate is 17 per cent - low, but not remarkably so, by international standards. Many MNCs moving to the city-state will pay a lower rate, however, as they are able to take advantage of tax incentives offered in return for undertakings such as providing jobs and capital investment.\n\n\"Tax incentives are given only if substantive economic activities are conducted in Singapore and the incentive recipient can add value considerably to our economy, such as bringing in new capabilities into Singapore or creating good jobs for Singaporeans,\" the Finance Ministry spokeswoman said.\n\nIncentives have been especially targeted at companies in industries Singapore has wanted to become a \"hub\" for - from shipping and commodity trading to funds management and biotechnology. In 2001, it also toughened further its strict banking secrecy rules, which helped boost the growth of its wealth management industry.\n\nBut as Western economies started pushing back against rich people hiding money offshore after the 2008 financial crisis, the city-state was quick to start signing exchange of information agreements with other governments including Japan, Australia and Britain, eager to protect its reputation as a clean financial centre.\n\nNow, as the net starts to fall on aggressive corporate tax avoidance, Singapore is under pressure to move swiftly again. \"We never thought exchange of information would come here, but it did,\" said a former official from Singapore's tax authority, who declined to be named due to the sensitive nature of the matter. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}
{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/saving-earth-degradable-shopping-bags", "site_title": "Saving the earth with degradable shopping bags", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSaving the earth with degradable shopping bags\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Nov 25, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] In just two years, Indonesian social entrepreneur Sugianto Tandio became the largest maker of degradable plastic bags using proprietary technology he developed, supplying to major retailers including Carrefour and Giant hypermart in his native country, as well as Mall of America, one of the largest shopping malls in the United States.\n\nMr Tandio, president director of Indonesian plastic bag producer PT Tirta Marta, has now set his sights on Singapore, besides other places, and recently began supplying degradable bags to a handful of retailers including Bata, CK Tang, Raoul, Eu Yan Sang and Royal Sporting House.\n\nEcoplas bags (made of cassava) and Oxium bags (which include a natural additive to plastic resin that quickens the degrading process) are his brainchild. Mr Tandio, whose family business has been in plastics manufacturing since 1971, began in 2000 to steer his company towards developing sustainable packaging technology to replace traditional plastics in an effort to help mitigate the environmental problem.\n\nParlaying his work experience as an engineer with 3M, he spent 10 years of research and development and millions of dollars creating cost-competitive biodegradable alternatives in the hope of reducing the carbon footprint of plastic.\n\nTraditional plastic typically takes between 500 and 1,000 years to degrade. But Ecoplas bags, which have a biodegradable polymer made from tapioca, if buried among active microbes or insects, can decompose in 10 weeks, while the Oxium bag can be broken down through oxidation (exposure to oxygen and heat) in two years. Both technologies are patent-pending.\n\n\"We've found a way to make Oxium price-neutral to conventional plastics, so the Indonesian market took off almost immediately. Oxium is priced to be only 2-5 per cent more expensive than traditional plastic,\" he said.\n\nThe company currently sells around 500 tonnes of Ecoplas and 3,000 tonnes of Oxium plastic bags a month. Mr Tandio is applying the proprietary technology he developed to products with household applications such as cutlery, garbage bags, styrofoam packaging and reusable totes.\n\n\"We are supplying about 90 per cent of the local plastic shopping bag market for major retailers in Indonesia. The demand for Oxium is so high that Tirta Marta has licensed the technology to 20 plastic bag manufacturers in Indonesia. It's a question of repeating our success in Indonesia in other countries. Our first two years were focused on building the Indonesia and US market. Only in the past year, we started marketing our technology to China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines.\"\n\nApart from the price- competitive factor, also driving the switch to degradable plastic bags in Indonesia was an agreement signed in February 2010 between the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) and the Jakarta city administration to encourage retailers to phase out regular plastic bags from next year, and instead offer non-plastic bags or degradable bags.\n\nPresently, Singapore does not have similar legislation, Singapore Environment Council (SEC) executive director Jose Raymond said, citing several reasons why the use of biodegradable bags is not more widespread here.\n\nAccording to the SEC, bags made entirely of bio-based polymers might have a lower environmental impact than the oxo-degradable alternative, but the lack of such options here to date make these an unlikely solution to the problem of plastic bag wastage for now.\n\nIn 2011 alone, consumers in Singapore used about 3 billion plastic bags.\n\n\"The usage of plastic bags in Singapore is a multi-faceted issue for which there is no simple solution. Economic considerations have to be balanced with environmental and commercial and even personal interests,\" Mr Raymond said.\n\nConsumer complacency that a degradable bag would disintegrate even if disposed might lead to higher rates of littering.\n\nOxo-degradable bags are also not designed for material recycling. A typical plastic recycling process involves reheating, during which biodegradable bags will decompose and make further processing impossible. Furthermore, the mixing of biodegradable bags in the feedstock of recycling will damage the quality of recycled products, the SEC said.\n\nOn the flip side, oxo-degradable bags require 10 per cent less raw materials to produce compared with their counterparts, and studies have also shown that the incineration of polyethylene plastic bags generates about double the amount of greenhouse gases compared to that of bio-bags, the SEC said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It has matched its economic interdependence with political integration,\" Mr Barroso exclaimed. \"Our growth model, based on international reforms and openness to external activities, is more sustainable than it was before.\"\n\nHe added that \"growth is on the rise and expected to gradually regain traction, up to 1.4 per cent in 2014\".\n\nDespite the economic uncertainty clouding the future prospects of certain countries on the fringe, the EU retains the status as the world's largest importer of both manufactured goods and services, the world's largest investor of foreign direct investment (FDI), as well as the destination of the world's largest flow of FDI.\n\nBoth the EU and China stopped short of calling the planned treaty a free trade agreement (FTA), but an EU-China trade deal is aimed at achieving much the same thing: to \"protect bilateral investment\" and \"ease market access\". They have set a goal to boost bilateral trade to as much as US$1 trillion by 2020 - almost double the US$580 billion in 2012.\n\nChina is the latest Asian country to negotiate an FTA with the EU, part of what Mr Barroso described as \"a very ambitious trade agenda for the region\".\n\nThe EU recently concluded its trade talks with Singapore and South Korea, and is in talks with Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam,and India. Negotiations with Japan kicked off early in the year.\n\nEarly this month, it began a second round of negotiations with the United States to create the world's biggest free trade deal. By now, the EU has engaged almost all the major global markets for a bilateral trade deal. These trade deals are likely to extend its lead in export competitiveness.\n\nBoth the EU and China have much to gain from having a comprehensive trade deal. China hopes to lower many of the trade barriers Chinese companies have encountered in investing in individual EU countries, and to speed up its exports to these markets.\n\nPresident Xi, quoted by state news agency Xinhua, said he hoped the European side could create a sound environment for Chinese enterprises to conduct economic and trade cooperation in Europe, and to boost cooperation in urbanisation, science, aeronautics and astronautics, and green economy.\n\nFor the EU, the immediate reward could be a slew of lower tariffs for many of its top export items, from automobiles and cosmetics, to luxury watches and wine.\n\nThibault Pontallier, Asia representative for French wine maker Chateau Margaux, says the Chinese tariff for wine stands at 48 per cent, and he is worried about China carrying out its threat (made in the summer) to punish European wine exports in retaliation for the EU's penalty on China's state subsidies to its solar panel exporters. The EU is also taking China to task for alleged dumping by Chinese manufacturers of steel fastenings.\n\n\"We don't know what's going to happen,\" Mr Pontallier says. \"For Europe, and for each country in the EU, each is weaker by itself. We are more important when we work together. It's better (for us) to go through the EU.\"\n\nChina levies high tariffs on all sorts of luxury products, on top of a domestic consumption tax, according to Fung Business Intelligence Centre. The top tariff levels could hit 150 per cent for cosmetics; 130 per cent for jewellery and precious stones; 100 per cent for luxury watches; and as high as 270 per cent for certain car models, the centre estimated. A Burberry cashmere scarf is 40 per cent more expensive in China than in Hong Kong, for instance, and a Cartier tank watch costs 36 per cent more.\n\nBilateral trade between the EU and China reached 434 billion euros in 2012. But China's exports to the EU, at 289.7 billion euros, was about twice as much as its imports from the EU, at 143.9 billion euros.\n\nPart of Europe's exports to China was done via Hong Kong, where Chinese tourists splurge during their shopping outings in the city. Europe made a trade surplus of 23 billion euros from bilateral trade of 44 billion euros with Hong Kong.\n\nThe warm relationship in trade, with the EU having been China's largest trade partners for nine consecutive years, has not been matched by foreign direct investment, however. European investments in China account for a mere 2 per cent of its overall FDI flows, whereas China's FDI to the EU was just one per cent of the EU's total inflows.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/getting-know-tech-stocks", "site_title": "Getting to know tech stocks", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGetting to know tech stocks\n\nOver 100 firms on the SGX get revenue from technology, almost half of them from hardware production and services, writes GEOFF HOWIE\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSTEP onto a train in Singapore these days and count the number of people looking at devices in their hands or attached to a set of earphones. Perhaps it is easier to count those who aren't doing so.\n\nWhen we think of technology, our first thoughts usually centre on consumer products and applications. By definition, technology is the art of combining science and existing equipment to solve problems or make things more efficient. While consumer gadgets hog the limelight, large corporations and government agencies in Singapore spend billions each year ensuring they have the most up-to-date technology to optimise their operations.\n\nIn economics, there is an intimate relationship between technological advancements and an increase in production. Singapore's own history of rapid economic development owes much to the good use of technological innovation across a wide range of sectors, such as telecommunications, transport, engineering and financial services. Technological innovation and its successful implementation are also what help companies listed on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to maintain their competitive edge.\n\nHowever, while technology plays a crucial role in the operations of SGX-listed blue-chip companies such as SingTel and Singapore Airlines, there is generally less recognition for stocks that make money from developing technology. Perhaps the best-known company is ST Engineering, which is a constituent of the benchmark Straits Times Index. Although it is considered an industrial stock by the Industrial Classification Benchmark, it derived more than a fifth of its revenue from technology, according to its FY2012 annual report.\n\nThere are more than 100 companies listed on SGX that generate revenue from technology, almost half of them from hardware production and services. Technology stocks can generally be divided into five revenue-generation categories: design manufacturing and distribution, hardware, semiconductors, software and technology services.\n\nHardware\n\nHardware refers to the devices and machinery that perform tasks for us. More specifically, hardware refers to computer equipment, such as monitors and processing units, peripherals, printing and imaging machines, consumer electronics, electronic components, mobile phones, digital storage devices and other bits of machinery.\n\nIn recent decades, much of the world's hardware has been built in Asia, particularly in low-cost China. Singapore also has large production and design facilities operated by some of the world's largest technology companies.\n\nThere are 17 SGX-listed counters that derive all of their revenues from hardware operations. Price performances year-to-date range from a 50 per cent decline for Plastoform Holdings to a 221.4 per cent gain for Amplefield. On average, these stocks have gained 17.7 per cent in price for the year-to-date period.\n\nTPV Technology, the largest hardware company on SGX by market capitalisation, listed in 1999 and provides display products, such as personal computer monitors and liquid-crystal display television. Its share price has declined 12.7 per cent since the end of 2012.\n\nThe second largest hardware company is Elec & Eltek, which listed on SGX in 1994 and on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in 2011. Its principal activities involve the manufacture and distribution of high-density circuit boards. Its share price has declined 4.5 per cent so far this year.\n\nSoftware\n\nFor hardware to function, it needs a set of instructions. Software is the digital information package that provides these instructions. Most of the time, it includes a user interface of some kind that enables humans to interact with the piece of hardware.\n\nSoftware has many industrial and consumer-related applications. In Singapore, eight companies reported more than 50 per cent of their latest revenues from software-related operations. Price performances for software companies so far this year ranged from Silverlake Axis' 73 per cent gain to Xyec Holdings' 45.8 per cent decline. Software stocks on average have declined 1.1 per cent for the year-to-date period.\n\nIn addition to being the best-performing software company on SGX, Silverlake Axis also happens to be the largest, with a market capitalisation of $2 billion. It makes up 84 per cent of the aggregate market capitalisation of the software companies mentioned above, and 48 per cent of the weight of the 25 SGX-listed companies in both the hardware and software businesses. The company provides software services for financial institutions in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nDMX Technologies Group is a Hong Kong-based digital media company and the second-largest SGX-listed software company, with a market capitalisation of $238 million. Its stock price has declined 6.8 per cent so far this year.\n\nSemiconductors\n\nJust as software provides instructions for hardware, semiconductors relay the instructions to hardware's key components through their circuitry.\n\nSemiconductors are the bits that make our devices more intelligent and functional. They are essential components in most electronic devices. The production of semiconductors demands large investment in high-precision and research-intensive facilities, and makes up an important part of the Asian economies of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan.\n\nDemand for semiconductors has often been used as a \"canary-in-the-coalmine\" gauge of the health of the global economy.\n\nSGX lists 10 active companies that derive 100 per cent of their revenue from semiconductor operations. So far this year, price performances have ranged from a decline of 29.4 per cent for ADV Systems to a gain of 41 per cent for UMS Holdings. Stocks on average have risen 3.5 per cent.\n\nSTATS ChipPAC listed in 2000 and is the largest SGX-listed semiconductor company. With a market capitalisation of $672 million, it takes up 59 per cent of the combined market capitalisation of the 10 semiconductor companies. Its share price has declined 8.8 per cent so far this year.\n\nUMS Holdings, the second-largest semiconductor company and best performer on the list, was listed in 2003 and is an industrial machinery company involved in manufacturing high-precision front-end semiconductor components.\n\nTechnology services\n\nWhile the three segments mentioned so far focus on the development and function of the technological product, technology services refer to the commercial application of these products across industries.\n\nAt its core, the technology services segment is about the fast transmission of information across operations to improve commercial efficiency. This is particularly important in the financial services sector where market prices and the flows of funds and money need to be reflected in companies' real-time data feeds.\n\nThere are 11 SGX counters from the technology services sector. Five of these derive all their revenue by providing technology services, while the rest get the majority of their revenue from such services.\n\nPrice performances of the 11 counters vary from a 72.5 per cent gain for Azeus Systems to a 50 per cent price decline for Declout so far this year. The average year-to-date price gain is 12.2 per cent.\n\nThe biggest SGX-listed technology services provider by market capitalisation is CSE Global, which derived its entire FY2012 revenue from providing systems integration solutions and computer network systems to clients globally. The company's share price has gained 27.6 per cent this year.\n\nNera Telecommunications is the second-largest technology services company and sells, installs and maintains IT networks, which account for 61 per cent of its total revenues in FY2012. The group also sells, distributes and services satellite communication and transmission network products and undertakes contract manufacturing for various industries. Nera shares have gained 42 per cent thus far this year.\n\nTechnology design, manufacturing and distribution\n\nMany hands make light work and it takes many more hands just to make a mobile phone do what it's supposed to do.\n\nTechnology design, manufacturing and distribution companies are predominantly focused on the many inputs that go into the production and delivery of technology goods and services.\n\nThe revenue streams associated with the design, manufacturing and distribution segment span a variety of technology products and services, such as electrical, communication products, industrial machinery, factory equipment, semiconductors and integrated chips.\n\nWhat sets these companies apart from design, manufacturing and distribution companies in other sectors is the high investment in the precision required to ensure that technology products are functional.\n\nSGX lists 12 companies that derive some or all of their revenue from design, manufacturing and distribution-related operations. More than half of these companies are from the electronic and electrical equipment sector, while the rest are from the industrial engineering, general industrials and technology hardware and equipment sectors.\n\nThe year-to-date price performances of these 12 companies range from a 6.3 per cent decline for Venture Corporation to a 55.6 per cent gain for New Wave Holdings. The counters have averaged a 25.6 per cent gain so far this year.\n\nVenture Corporation is the largest SGX-listed technology design, manufacture and distribution stock. With a market capitalisation of $2.1 billion as at Nov 20, the company contributed 73 per cent to the combined market capitalisation of the group of companies. Venture Corporation is a provider of technology services, products and solutions with capabilities ranging from design and development to product and process engineering. It derived 96.2 per cent of its revenue from design, manufacturing and distribution operations.\n\nTai Sin Electric is the second largest stock in this cluster with a market capitalisation of $145 million. The company manufactures and markets electrical cables and wires for both the private and public sectors. The company is also involved in the production of lamps. According to its FY2013 annual report, its design, manufacturing and distribution product segment contributed 38.2 per cent to its revenue. The stock price has gained 34.7 per cent so far this year.\n\nMore information on the companies in the technology sector can be found in the Market Updates section of SGX My Gateway at\n\nwww.sgx.com/mygateway\n\n.\n\nThe writer is SGX's market strategist\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, such industries must be high-value ones as the additive manufacturing process remains quite slow.\n\nTwo industries fit this bill well and are strong clusters in Singapore: aerospace and medical devices.\n\nMr Yeoh explains, \"It is not just that the aerospace companies are here, they have been here for a while. But, we now have an increasing number of them doing manufacturing, doing development work.\"\n\nPart of Rolls-Royce's $700 million campus at Seletar for instance, is an advanced technology centre conducting manufacturing technology research. Pratt & Whitney also said earlier this year that it would bring production of its advanced Geared Turbo Fan into Singapore.\n\n\"So if you extrapolate, then you think, likely, hopefully, we will see some interest in this space,\" Mr Yeoh says.\n\nAlso exciting is the prospect that companies in other industries may want to be near to and learn from industries at the forefront of 3D printing applications.\n\n\"If we link them up, I think there is tremendous value. Some of them will show the way, and others will maybe be later adopters,\" he adds.\n\nJust last Friday, the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) announced a new programme to develop additive manufacturing technologies for the aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, marine and precision engineering sectors. The $15 million 3D printing technologies fund will be split among six projects undertaken by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech).\n\nIn fact, over the past few months, there has been a buzz surrounding investments in 3D printing research.\n\nIn August, NTU and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) set up a joint lab for 3D printing research. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also spoke during the National Day Rally about 3D printing of bone tissue scaffolds developed by A*Star, which have been commercialised for use by dentists by home-grown firm Bio-Scaffold International.\n\nAnd NTU announced in September that it would build a $30 million additive manufacturing centre, funded by EDB.\n\nA*Star said that the global additive manufacturing market could grow to an estimated US$10.8 billion by 2021, close to five times the US$2.2 billion in 2012, led by automotive, medical and aerospace applications.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What would be the key message of the celebrations?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nRay Ferguson\n\nCEO\n\nStandard Chartered Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE'S big 50 celebrations would be a fitting time to look back at the business policies and initiatives that have contributed to the growth of the Republic's highly developed economy today. CEOs and senior leaders of organisations that have been deeply rooted here for more than 50 years would make interesting interview subjects. They will be able to share unique experiences and observations over the years and pay tribute to the people and actions that have contributed to the nation's success. It would also be a good opportunity to showcase the organisations and companies that have played a part in the development of our business sector.\n\nArvind Agarwalla\n\nCEO\n\nFACT Software International Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE'S journey from 1965 has been remarkable. While we have built our nation on strong foundations, we have also reached out to the world.\n\nI have a simple, yet very powerful, idea. I urge our government to gift a small flag of Singapore to every Singaporean by the year-end. Easily foldable, the flag can be carried by Singaporeans on our travels, and we can post photos on the 50th birthday website, displaying our red flag proudly.\n\nThis initiative would engage every citizen in the celebrations and create a buzz like no other. It would achieve a very important goal of involving every citizen in this historic event.\n\nJohn Koh\n\nManaging Director\n\nWMRC Private Ltd\n\nI WOULD think that besides the usual party and fireworks associated with the celebration, it is good to look back and reflect on how we, as a nation, have progressed over the past 50 years. A story can be crafted to highlight the key milestones achieved since we became an independent nation. More importantly, we need to look forward to the next 50 years. How will the Singapore Dream evolve as we pace ourselves for a centennial celebration? What can Singaporeans look forward to as we strive in nation building? What plans do we have in place to make Singapore an even better and more exciting place to live and do business in? All these and more should be addressed as we move closer to Singapore's birthday in 2015.\n\nDileep Nair\n\nAmbassador\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nTHERE should be an island-wide tableau depicting the values that have brought us to where we are today - trust, discipline, courage, industry and inclusiveness. And then the vision of where we are heading to. The key message should be keeping faith with these core values and having an unwavering eye on the future - which is ours to make.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and CEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nTHE focus of the golden jubilee celebrations should be on the people who played a part in Singapore's success, be it big or small. There is no better way to celebrate than to take a trip down memory lane and recount the highs and lows of Singapore's history.\n\nABN AMRO is proud to be a part of the Singapore heritage, with our first branch opening in 1858, making us the oldest bank in Singapore. The impressive story of Singapore's financial and banking sector deserves to be told, including the role of local and foreign banks in shaping the landscape and making a difference in the lives of customers and employees.\n\nAmong the things we can do to commemorate this occasion should include giving back to the Singapore community - the very people who have supported our business and without whom we will not be where we are today.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nSINGAPORE'S diverse people and the strong economic stability it is reputed for is a call for celebration. The key message can be on the colourful cultures and the various contributions the people have brought forth. The country has transformed from a developing nation to first-world in a few decades and not without reason. The jubilee is about celebrating the successes, strength and determination of a nation that has gained worldwide recognition ranging from social economic success to political stability.\n\nBoon Yoon Chiang\n\nChairman\n\nJardine Matheson (Singapore)\n\nHALF a century is relatively short in the history of a nation. As a small city state, Singapore is remarkable in having achieved so much in such a short time - from third to first world in 50 years.\n\nThis was largely due to a dedicated, determined and effective political leadership, which is forward-looking and enlightened, being able to work closely and harmoniously with Singaporeans of different racial origins towardsa common vision.\n\nWith globalisation and rapid technological advances, there will, no doubt, be fresh challenges ahead but also new and interesting opportunities. So long as our leaders are committed and prepared to take a long term view and are able to motivate the people to work together for a fair and inclusive society and make Singapore useful to the world without having to compromise our basic values and principles, the future will certainly remain bright.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group Pte Ltd\n\nTHE Golden Jubilee is a great opportunity for Singapore to continue its nation-building exercise and create a fresh sense of identity and pride for Singaporeans. It would be a reflection of how far Singapore has come in diverse areas such as population mix, standard of education, growth and enhancement of infrastructure, national identity etc. I suggest the following:\n\nBring back the Swing Singapore party. Singapore is a fun place to live and work in. We need our version of mardi gras. This should be the party of the year and Singapore Tourism Board should plan to milk it for what it is worth.\n\nHave a \"Speak Singlish Day\". Singlish is possibly one of the strongest and most enduring Singaporean traits. The power of Singlish as a unique national identity cannot be belittled. Besides, it gives our government a chance to drop its straitlaced persona for a day.\n\nDo a campaign with mature Singaporeans who can relate the changes they have seen and experienced over the past 50 years. Nothing beats watching real accounts of life in Singapore through the eyes of Singaporeans to create the nostalgic feel to help bond the nation.\n\nLim Tit Meng\n\nChief Executive\n\nScience Centre Singapore\n\nTHE innovative use of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is the critical success factor that has enabled our survival and transformation from an island with limited natural resources into a first world city-in-a-garden. Without STEM we would not have NeWater or our reclaimed land. We would not be able to maintain and expand our world famous Changi Airport - neither would we be able to establish ourselves as the financial hub in Asia. As we mark our golden jubilee, we should celebrate our achievements in STEM by showcasing the top 50 innovations coming out from Singapore, so as to inspire and nurture more talents in STEM to bring Singapore to the next level of excellence. The Singapore Science Festival in 2015 can be a very suitable platform to highlight how Singapore can remain competitive only with STEM being core in our innovation and knowledge-based economy.\n\nGerald Foo\n\nPresident\n\nWalton International Group (S) Pte Ltd\n\nHOW about a short guide of 50 terms and acronyms that were created and used in the nation's policy-making process, explaining how they propelled the country to grow into a first world nation? It can also include government institutions that played a significant role, such as the CPF or the HDB.\n\nFor example \"tax free holiday\" was introduced as an incentive for companies to set up operations here during the Jurong industrialisation phase. Then, to curb our car population and congestion, we had COE and OMV. To encourage Singaporeans to have more babies, we had SDU, among other measures.\n\nBecause the guide tracks the development of Singapore, it can be used to educate future generations and foreigners on how this tiny city state, against all odds, grappled with the challenges in the past 50 years and got to where it is today.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nAS we celebrate Singapore's 50th year of independence in 2015, it would be timely for us to reflect on not just how far we have arrived economically but also on how we have progressed socially and culturally. It presents a great opportunity for us to recognise the people and the organisations in Singapore who have contributed significantly to Singapore's development in different areas like public service, business, sports, the arts, culture, etc. We should also celebrate people who have made sacrifices or have risen to challenges in key crisis situations such as the Sars outbreak.\n\nLooking forward, I think it is crucial that we define what is success for Singapore in the next 50 years, not just based on economic indicators but on how we develop holistically as a nation. There needs to be an inclusive approach where every stakeholder's opinion matters.\n\nTan Tiong Cheng\n\nChairman\n\nKnight Frank\n\nTHE golden jubilee in 2015 will mark a significant milestone for Singapore. Having emerged from many trials in the early years of independence to reaching First World status within 50 years, we must always remember, with gratitude, how we have overcome all odds to reach where we are today. The future will be challenging, yet we can thrive as a nation if our citizens stay united and determined to build Singapore together. The spirit of \"Unity, Courage, Commitment and Compassion\" should be celebrated and magnified in various activities during the golden jubilee year, to remind us of our core values that bind us as a cohesive nation to forge ahead without fear.\n\nThe year 2015, too, is also a particularly significant milestone and memorable year for all at Knight Frank Singapore as it is our 75th anniversary.\n\nPhillip Overmyer\n\nChief Executive\n\nSingapore International Chamber of Commerce\n\nFROM the beginning of Singapore's independence, the nation has been blessed with not only hardworking Singaporeans but also foreigners who have played various interesting roles in its development. Particularly prominent are talented foreigners who have transferred significant product knowledge, technologies and business knowhow to spur Singapore's economic growth and, along the way, lift Singaporeans' capabilities. SICC would like to suggest that as part of the golden jubilee celebrations, the country brings a few good old comrades back from around the world to let them relish the grace and wonders of Singapore today, as each in his or her own way remembers Singapore's unique history that they have helped to create many years ago. Also worth celebrating will be our national business champions that have successfully left global footprints through determination and sheer hard work. Asia Pacific Breweries, Banyan Tree, Capitaland, Charles & Keith, Keppel Corp, PSA Corporation, SIA and many more local companies have made Singapore proud overseas. The message to inspire Singaporeans will be that, just as the Singapore economy and its homegrown players can punch above their weight, so can each and every Singaporean who dares to dream big and who is willing to persevere. Regardless of their career aspirations to become an outstanding entrepreneur or a first-rate worker, Singaporeans should believe they have what it takes to succeed and, along the way, strive to open new chapters in Singapore's history that will be well remembered in future years.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nFIRST, we should all take a moment to reflect on and appreciate what our country has achieved over the past 50 years - there could have been many different outcomes and, so, our achievements given our limited resources and diverse culture is all that more remarkable. It is also a time to recognise the collective contribution of the people of Singapore - citizens from all walks of life who have in their own ways contributed to this remarkable 50 years of nation building. Likewise for the business, social and community sectors and, of course, our leaders over the years. As we adopt an inclusive approach in these celebrations, we need to also appreciate the challenges that we will face in the next 50 years as we invite all citizens to paint a new narrative and a vision of what we want to create for Singapore for our next generations.\n\nTony Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nAedas Singapore\n\nTHE golden jubilee is a significant milestone for Singapore as a city state that has transformed dramatically into a first world nation since independence. With the emergence of world class architecture in recent years, 2015 will be a good opportunity to share Singapore's story of nation-building with the display of the eclectic mix of heritage and modern day architectural designs - a proud reflection of Singapore's success against a cultural kaleidoscope backdrop.\n\nWhilst we celebrate what we have achieved and work towards becoming the city-to-be for the future, the celebrations can look towards the next 50-year milestone in an ever-changing built environment. Aedas would be privileged to be a part of it.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nTHERE should be a meaningful celebration that reflects how far Singapore has come. Having the celebration at the new sports hub would be suitable in view of the new and improved facilities. This venue will be a clear demonstration of how Singapore has progressed from a humble island state to a confident cosmopolitan nation. Perhaps the government may also wish to consider a longer celebration by declaring an additional day of public holiday (the National Day will fall on a Sunday in 2015). There can then be more fringe activities to excite the people (and boost retail sales). Let us show our confidence; let the whole nation really partake in the festivities on this joyous occasion.\n\nZaheer K Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQi Group of Companies\n\nCOUNTRY celebrations and festivities range from music, parades and fireworks to commemoration of the restoration of \"dignity\". Marking Singapore's golden jubilee of independence is momentous. I hope we have all of these interspersed with one key message: sustaining our invaluable cultural diversity and unity. The integration of different races, languages and religions has permeated the very core of our society. Coupled with our work ethic and \"never-die spirit\", it has resulted in our spectacular successes in the global economic arena and other aspects of society. More than pomp and splendour is our need for a strong message on our core values, while being inclusive of the less fortunate. Only then will we live true to our pledge of one united people achieving progress for our nation.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE is still a very young nation - yet we boast a rich cultural history. The golden jubilee celebrations should thus focus on Singapore's history and culture, and how far we have come in the past 50 years. It would be wonderful to have a series of grassroots and nationwide celebrations leading up to our grandest National Day Parade ever. Besides the razzle and dazzle, I would like to see something meaningful done for society. For a start, we could bring back some of the previous civic programmes we used to have, such as the national courtesy campaign. Additionally, the relevant ministries could perhaps work together to kickstart a pilot programme to have every school working with social welfare organisations in a concerted manner. For example, our youth can befriend the elderly either in old folks homes or those living alone. Hopefully, this can evolve into a long-term initiative that continues beyond the golden jubilee year. I believe that this can help to instil the right values in our young - the future leaders of this nation - as we strive to cultivate a more gracious society for all.\n\nShawn Balakrishnan\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nThe Hoffman Agency Singapore\n\nIN Singapore's upcoming golden jubilee, we should celebrate our achievements over the past 50 years by showcasing to the world - the People, Education and Infrastructure that make up the building blocks of our blooming country. With so much to rejoice about, the golden jubilee should be marked by a whole year of celebration and activities that will capture memories of the vast changes and developments in our culture and cityscape over the course of our short but rich history. Most importantly, these activities will remind us of what makes us uniquely Singaporean and how we can continue to make Singapore a country we are all proud to call home.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nHAVING come a long way since its independence in 1965, human capital was and still is the backbone of Singapore's success. Through the years, we have come to appreciate and celebrate our multi-faceted society and the vibrant and diverse cultures that form our rich social fabric. One possible theme for Singapore's 50th anniversary is therefore the \"Celebration of Diversity\".\n\nThe composition of Singapore's workforce is becoming increasingly diverse because of the changing needs of the economy and businesses. In order for Singapore to remain competitive in this challenging business environment, we must embrace and celebrate diversity in all its aspects: racial and cultural diversity, diversity in gender, thought, background and opinions, to continue to create opportunities for all.\n\nAs Singapore strives towards becoming the region's leading global accountancy hub by 2020, I urge fellow Singaporeans to continue to celebrate diversity and embrace change for the continued success of the Republic.\n\nTerry Smagh\n\nVice-President\n\nQlikView South East North Asia (SENA)\n\nAS a country and an economy, Singapore has gone through many challenges. The early years of independence coupled with the outbreak of Sars in 2003, along with the Asian financial crisis in 2008/2009 have all proved that this brave nation and its people have and will always remain resilient in the face of adversity. With the golden jubilee only two years away, the key message of the celebrations should be about the importance of always looking at ways to improve as an individual and how we can contribute back to society to make sure our sons and daughters will live as comfortably in the future as we did.\n\nAnother key message is the importance of team spirit. As the country charts its course to maintain growth and progress, its citizens' contributions and unity will continue to be the core pillars of a successful and fruitful future. As the saying goes, you are only as good as your team. Here's to another successful 50 years ahead.\n\nJ David Crammond\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nWHEN Singapore celebrates its golden jubilee in 2015, I feel that its citizens must come together to forge a new and meaningful vision that rallies the nation to strive for many more golden years.\n\nI first came to Singapore 10 years ago as the CEO of a company and, since then, I have become an entrepreneur and started Maachu, a Singapore technology firm, to match the skills sets and experience of applicants to specified jobs. I hope Maachu can play a contributory role to facilitate the growth of talent in the next phase of nation building.\n\nSingapore's foundation of success was laid by the pioneering immigrants who strove to establish themselves. Next came the visionary politicians and the enterprising businessmen and women who made Singapore a first world country. Today, we need more nimble and talented entrepreneurs to perpetuate this journey of growth and excellence.\n\nTan Hak Leh\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAIA Singapore\n\nSINGAPORE'S golden jubilee should be a celebration of the strength of the family unit, which is the building block of our society. As we continue to create a cohesive community, let us also reflect on how families can be further empowered to live fuller lives together. Two important aspects are to bolster their resilience through sound financial planning and by encouraging families to adopt a healthier lifestyle. AIA Singapore believes in the combined efforts of the public and private sector, together with the individual, to ensure Singaporeans are adequately insured and stay healthy. As we work together to achieve this, AIA Singapore will continue to serve the nation's protection needs and invest in Singapore's health through initiatives such as AIA Vitality, so that families can lead happier, healthier lives together.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nA UNIFYING theme such as \"Our people first - always\" will not only address the concerns of Singaporeans today but reassure them that their livelihood and wellbeing will always be taken care of in the future. It is an important statement for the government to make, going into the golden jubilee. Singaporeans today are concerned about losing jobs to foreigners, the high costs of living, healthcare, transportation, homes - not to mention the overcrowded MRT, long wait for public housing, etc. The 50th anniversary is a great opportunity, following the national conversation, for the government to reassure Singaporeans and make an unequivocal and strong commitment to look after Singaporeans, and to ensure that everyone has a fair share of the economic growth and prosperity. An \"Our people first - always\" theme will take the celebrations to a new high. It will be remembered not just for the celebrations of the country's many accomplishments but also for the emotionally appealing new compact between the government and citizenry. Although the future may seem more uncertain for Singaporeans, there should be no doubt that there is much to look forward to and, therefore, cause for celebration and jubilation.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman\n\nHTwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nFORMING an S50 Committee to plan the country's 50 years of independence is a right move to ensure wide participation from all segments of the nation and getting ideas from all walks of life. The celebrations should include documentation of our experiences as a young nation in our journey through these 50 years.\n\nA commemorative book reflecting our journey through these years would serve as a good reference of our history, especially for our younger generation to appreciate the contributions of our pioneering leaders. Recognising people, both local and foreign, who have contributed to our growth is important. Possibly a special S50 Golden Jubilee Fund should be set up for deserving pioneering generation Singaporeans who may now need help in their golden years.\n\nIn my view, the key message should be that we should always be integrated as a nation, be team players, and that everyone has a part to contribute, regardless of where they stand in society.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\njobsDB Singapore and Malaysia\n\nSINGAPORE has come a long way from its humble beginnings to the truly global city it is today. Riding through times of economic crisis and financial difficulty, Singapore has always been resilient, striving to excel and achieve its true potential as a nation. jobsDB is similarly all about providing the best job opportunities for Singaporeans to explore their true potential in their careers. As Singapore turns 50, I believe the key message should focus on learning from the nation's past 50 years, to ensure the country continues to prosper for the next 50 years and beyond. May its spirit of exploring opportunities and achieving excellence continue to bring the Singapore nation to greater heights.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nSINGAPORE is an accidental nation. For the country to survive miraculously the trials and challenges to reach 50 years is a great feat, and for it to become a First World developed nation in the same time is a greater feat. This would not have come to pass if not for the great determination, grit and convictions of our first-generation leaders.The 50th jubilee celebration must not miss out on marking the life of every pioneering Singapore leader. The public should nominate a list of 50 leaders, each to be featured in a good writeup. Singaporeans should know their leaders' journeys and be inspired by their dedication to our nation. The arts and culture that form the tapestry of our diversity must also be highlighted and celebrated. Our artists can be spurred to put up their creative works for all to see and to support. These can be small public projects or large commissioned works of art - sculptures, murals or statues - that can serve as a reminder of our past and of the present to celebrate our limitless hopes and collective hearts.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nTHE golden jubilee is a great opportunity to share Singapore's remarkable achievements and to set a new vision for the future. Our highly skilled workforce has been integral to our nation's success and transformation into a global metropolis. Singapore is now home to many top talents and we should mark the golden jubilee by celebrating our people. We should showcase top talents in different industries and also demonstrate how these industries have evolved. An example is in the engineering and technical sector, which has been a cornerstone of Singapore's economic growth. We remain dedicated in developing the engineering and technical talent pool in Singapore for the oil and gas, power and energy and engineering services industries which require specialist knowledge and niche skill sets.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In the early 1800s, it was a thriving port of call while Hong Kong was just a fishing village. Today, as Singapore is bracing for a silver tsunami, one has already hit Zhoushan's shores; its population has been declining for 11 years. It is the only city with a long-term negative population growth outlook in Zhejiang province, according to a China Daily report. Last year, one in five in the city of one million was aged 60 and above, and this will rise to two in five by 2030. By contrast, one in five in Singapore's population will be aged 65 and older by 2030.\n\nOther than increasing pension and healthcare costs, the most serious consequence of an ageing population is the shortage of workers to support the elderly. Last week, Zhoushan jumped to implement China's new reforms on the one-child policy announced after its Third Plenum meeting of top officials. A document on the Zhoushan government website released last Thursday said eligible couples in which either spouse is an only child, and who already have one child in the family, can now apply to have a second child. Observers have long pushed for China to reform its one-child policy, implemented in the late 1970s. To be fair, the policy has been relaxed over the years. Since the late 1980s, rural couples were allowed to have a second child if the first-born was a girl. The latest reforms amount to further gradual easing. Analysts have suggested that the change will lead to several million more newborns a year. But while significant, the relaxation of the rules does not go far enough. China should abolish its one-child policy. Even as it does so, a population explosion is unlikely to occur; today's China is very different from that of the 1970s.\n\nSingapore's experience is a case in point. In the 1970s, Singapore implemented a birth control policy encouraging citizens to \"stop at two\". The government reversed the policy in 1987, but fertility rates continued to plummet as Singapore joined the ranks of the world's urbanised, developed nations. As Singaporeans grew richer, they married later, and had fewer children. Women became financially independent and no longer saw raising a family as their only role in life.

So as long as the central bank keeps its benchmark rate close to zero, the rise in mortgage rates and Treasury rates should be gradual and easy for the economy to digest.\n\nThe holiday-shopping season starts earlier every year, and stores such as Best Buy are now launching their annual holiday sales on the morning of Thanksgiving itself, this Thursday. In effect, the sales have already started at Wal-Mart Stores, Best Buy and other outlets which are matching offers that customers find advertised on rivals' websites.\n\nInitial indications of consumer response to the sales this week will give investors a preview of crucial fourth-quarter earnings prospects for publicly traded stores. Wal-Mart, the world's largest store chain by sales, warned that it anticipates the toughest holiday season since 2009 as a price war looms.\n\nEconomists at brokerage Wells Fargo predicted a \"modest 3.7 per cent\" increase in holiday sales from 2012. That's a lesser rate of growth than a year earlier. An October National Retail Federation (NRF) survey of shoppers forecast a 2 per cent decrease in per-person spending over the season.\n\n\"Americans are questioning the stability of our economy, our government and their own finances,\" said NRF president and CEO Matthew Shay.\n\nThe same survey found that the average person would do nearly half their shopping online this year. That suggests that Amazon.com will enjoy the festivities, even if operators of malls do not.\n\nSeveral companies have timed the launch of new gadgets with the holiday season. Sony's new PlayStation will vie with Microsoft's new Xbox for the attention of gamers.\n\nAny signs that holiday sales growth is more than modest could spark a strong finish for the 2013 stockmarket rally - which has brought the Standard & Poor's 500 to the brink of its highest-returning year since 1997.\n\nSmall-cap indexes such as the Russell 2000 and tech-heavy indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 have had even stronger returns, reflecting a new appetite for fast-growing, risky companies.\n\nSome of the fastest growing and riskiest companies, including video-streaming service Netflix and electric-car maker Tesla, suffered a precipitous decline early last week and have not recouped all their losses.\n\nAnalysts had warned that these stocks could not sustain their monumental gains forever. Some even suggest that these stocks reveal the bubble characteristics of the broad market.\n\nValuation metrics like price-to-earnings ratios do not bear out this fear, however. Even though charts of the broad Standard & Poor's 500 in the last three years closely resemble those of the 1920s and 1990s, in the steep run-up to major crashes, the valuations of most stocks this time are more in line with historical averages than during the dotcom boom.\n\n\"It's really an unwarranted concern out there,\" said Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital. \"Currently, the higher beta (or more volatile) stocks are going through a little bit of a reset phase. In any healthy bull market you get these types of selloffs, which, I think, help keep the euphoria of optimism at bay.\"\n\nMr Marshall said bear markets - such as the dotcom crash and the 2008 financial crisis - typically strike when everyone is fully invested in the stock market.\n\nEven after a rush into stocks this year, many Americans are still shying away from stocks in their retirement savings. According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans owning stocks was near an all-time low as recently as May.\n\n\"Bull markets don't end with everyone sitting on piles of cash,\" Mr Marshall said.\n\nStill, even the bulls concede that the economy and corporate earnings now have high expectations to live up to. While stocks are likely to continue their run into January as workers partake in the annual reallocation of in their pension funds, most believe the rally will need some more corroboration to keep going for the rest of next year.\n\n\"Additional and sustained gains would require an acceleration of earnings growth to catch up with valuations, which, even in the bullish case, would require more time,\" said Lorenzo Di Mattia, manager of hedge fund Sibilla Global Fund, in a note to clients. \"The stars are aligned well, with the economy showing a moderate pick-up and the Fed offering accommodation, which should continue given the nomination of Yellen. At some point though, things will be as good as they get.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It then dipped in the next two recessionary years to below US$6.4 billion. Then there was a spike in 2010 when exports surged to US$9.5 billion - an increase of more than US$3.0 billion in just a year.\n\nEven accounting for the setbacks in 2008 and 2009, the pace of US private services exports to Singapore has quickened after the Great Recession. It picked up by US$1.0 billion in 2011 when exports hit US$10.51 billion. And last year, the export of US private services to Singapore rose even higher by US$1.75 billion to US$12.25 billion.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2012, shipments of US private services to Singapore soared more than 90 per cent. There was no similar post-recession spurt in the export of Singapore services to the US - largely travel and related business and freight and port services - to the US. The increase was a more moderate 40 per cent.\n\nBut over a longer period, Singapore is making better progress than the US in the balance of trade in private services. From 2002 to 2012, the export of Singapore services to the US jumped 149 per cent to US$4.9 billion while US exports to Singapore rose 123 per cent. The result is that the US's trade surplus in services with Singapore narrowed from 2.8 to 2.5 times.\n\nThis could change if US firms persist in their post-recession aggressiveness. The renewed US push overseas is worldwide but most evident in high-growth Asian markets. While the export of US services increased 28 per cent in 2009-12 overall, it rose 41 per cent in the region.\n\nWithin Asia, the US appears to be most aggressive in Singapore where the shipment of US services has surged 91.2 per cent since 2009. This is followed by China (89.2 per cent), Taiwan (77 per cent), South Korea (41.6 per cent) and Australia (41.5 per cent).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Iceland has vast amounts of spring water naturally filtered by mountains and lava terrain for hundreds of years that otherwise goes to waste, he said.\n\nAqua Omnis's plan offers an alternative to costly water desalination and recycling as supplies are reduced by climate change and rising demand from the agricultural, and oil and gas industries. By 2030 almost half the earth's population may face water scarcity, according to the UN.\n\n\"We have an abundance of high-quality spring water underneath our surface which we are offering to the world,\" Mr Gudnason said recently in London at the IEA & Marketforce conference. \"It flows from Iceland into the ocean, quenching no one's thirst.\"\n\nIt will cost US$300 million to start the initial project including a minimum of seven ships, fuel and mooring equipment, the company said. Conditional funding agreements are in place from investors including parties in Gulf nations, Mr Gudnason said. The company plans to start commercial operations within three years, he said.\n\nAqua Omnis will transport water from springs using second-hand vessels from the oil industry. Some tankers will be able to carry 500,000 tonnes. It can also move the water in \"flexitanks\" made of the same material as plastic bottles that can be transported in trucks or smaller ships.\n\nIt plans to use ultra large crude carriers, some of which may have been deleted from the official register though not yet scrapped, and then refurbished, Mr Gudnason said.\n\n\"They can be as good as new or even better as new vessels would need to be overhauled anyway to carry water,\" he said. \"Whether we use exactly 500,000 dwt (deadweight tonnage) vessel or 441,500 dwt or a portfolio of different sizes of vessels is not really the main issue to us,\" he said.\n\nIn England, Aqua Omnis could sell the water for about US$2 per tonne, according to Mr Gudnason. Thames Water Utilities charges US$2.05 a cubic metre, where one cubic metre is 1 tonne, for household water supplies.\n\nThe water flowing from the aquifers to the Atlantic through streams under land Aqua Omnis owns in Olfus in south-western Iceland is drinkable, a quality \"unheard of\" outside the country, he said. The tankers will moor just off shore and deliver water directly to distributors without requiring treatment, he said.\n\nBallast water that can sometimes contain invasive species isn't an issue because the water collected from Iceland is uncontaminated after being filtered for years underground, he said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Iceland has planned to share its resources. A plan for an undersea power cable to connect the British grid to Iceland, which has abundant geothermal and hydropower, is attracting investor interest, Charles Hendry, a former UK energy minister, said this month. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

His American opponent, the young upstart Brandon Rios, is an underdog who knows he is on the brink of superstardom should he upset the odds and defeat Pacquiao.\n\nIn all, 15,000 people will pack the Cotai Arena at the Venetian Macau integrated resort - the flagship property of Las Vegas Sands' operations in China - to watch the biggest boxing event ever held in Asia.\n\nIt all spells big bucks for Edward Tracy, the president and chief executive of Sands China, who is already planning to bring in more high-level boxing matches to Macau next year to feed the growing demand for this sport.\n\n\"(Sunday) is going to be very successful for us. We're very happy with the ticket sales and the pay-per-view numbers so far,\" he told BT Weekend in an exclusive interview yesterday.\n\nThat this event would be broadcast to a Saturday night prime time audience in the United States due to the time difference, as well as to millions more around the world, will help change the perception that Macau is purely a destination for gambling.\n\n\"I think people are going to view Macau differently, and that's part of the government's strategy here,\" said Mr Tracy.\n\nAs far as Sands China is concerned, he sees boxing and other non-gaming activities as part of the company's overall development strategy to attract a much broader range of customers, especially the rising middle class from the mainland.\n\n\"(We want) to have such a diverse offering that people think about us in a very different way, that there is so much to do here and that's why they want to come to Macau, and not because we happen to have baccarat tables,\" he said.\n\nThe world of boxing is not alien to Mr Tracy, who has been involved in the sport for close to 30 years to date.\n\nAs the former CEO of the Trump Organization, he was responsible for putting together some of the most memorable fights in history in the 1980s and 1990s, including the historic clash between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I did a lot of those with (professional boxing promotion company Top Rank CEO) Bob Arum. This 'Clash in Cotai' is kind of a page out of our playbook from those days, but with a modern and Asian twist to it,\" said Mr Tracy.\n\nBy Asian, he means giving Chinese boxing fans the chance to see their heroes in action tomorrow as well, chief of whom is two-time Olympic gold medal winner Zou Shiming.\n\nThe 32-year-old - one of the most recognisable athletes in China today - made his professional debut in April this year at the Venetian Macau and returned to the same venue for another event three months later. He won both fights, sending the largely Chinese crowd into raptures.\n\nMr Tracy believes having such a boxer will be key to unlocking the gold mine that is the 1.3 billion population in China.\n\n\"The demand for these kinds of boxing events in China is pretty spectacular. It's something that's very new to China, having seen other sports like basketball, golf and tennis. Boxing is something new to the marketplace, and there seems to be really high demand for more of it.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bankers at CIMB only recently celebrated its first anniversary Down Under, with red and white cupcakes - the colours of the bank's corporate logo.\n\nKeen to depend less on its home market, Malaysia's No 2 bank by assets agreed in 2012 to buy parts of Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc's (RBS) Asian business, including most of its Australian unit.\n\nSo far, there has been no buyer's remorse.\n\nCIMB was the sole underwriter and bookrunner for a stake sale earlier this month worth A$503 million (S$575.2 million) in the world's No 4 iron ore miner, Australia's Fortescue Metals Group Ltd.\n\nThe Warrnambool mandate had also thrust CIMB into the thick of what is now a A$505 million takeover battle. Key to that role was CIMB's ability to retain a core group of experienced investment bankers who had worked closely together under the RBS banner.\n\n\"The RBS franchise they purchased had been a longstanding part of the local scene, and had strong existing relationships,\" said Lachlan Colquhoun, head of markets analysis at research and advisory firm East & Partners.\n\n\"The transition team at CIMB would appear to have done well in preserving some of the relationships... while beginning to establish their very own franchise, which also has its own point of difference - the link to Asia which none of the other competing investment banks really have to the same extent.\"\n\nWarrnambool already had a close relationship with RBS before CIMB took over the business, said Oscar Ludwigson, who was a senior RBS banker in Australia before becoming CIMB's head of investment banking in the country.\n\n\"We haven't got paid every year... but that's not the point. The point is that they are a client of ours and we have stayed close to them,\" Mr Ludwigson said.\n\nWarrnambool wasn't immediately available to comment on why they had appointed CIMB to advise them on the deal.\n\nCIMB faces serious competition in the Australian investment banking market, with RBS historically not a significant player.\n\nThe corporate advisory realm in Australia is currently dominated by Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Macquarie Group Ltd and UBS AG. Together, the banks command 65.3 per cent of the market, with UBS taking the lion's share at 22.4 per cent, according to East & Partners.\n\nRBS's banking status in Australia and elsewhere was also weakened by the misfortunes of its UK headquarters, bailed out in a taxpayer rescue amid the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\"CIMB didn't really take over a strong business, it was already badly weakened after several years of lack of love,\" a banker said, requesting not to be named talking about a competitor.\n\nNor has the CIMB team been helped by the bank's brand, which lacks the recognition that some of its competitors enjoy in Australian boardrooms.\n\nNow, as dairy rivals slug it out to buy Warrnambool, CIMB and its legacy RBS bankers are up against some of Australia's established investment banking names.\n\nAmong them is the chief executive of Lazard Australia, John Wylie, who is leading Murray Goulburn Co-operative Ltd's charge in the takeover battle. Mr Wylie is a well-known investment banking figure, who in a sports-mad nation also chairs the government's Australian Sports Commission.\n\nAlso in the mix are Rabobank and Rothschild, advising Canada's Saputo Inc, while Kidder Williams Ltd is advising Bega Cheese Ltd.\n\nIn Australia, CIMB has extended its capabilities and added new people including Aaron Lamshed, who has been helping to drive its equity capital markets business.\n\nMr Ludwigson said Mr Lamshed was integral in the Fortescue deal - a block of shares that a person familiar with the sale said was sold by Canada's Teck Resources Ltd.\n\nThat deal helped CIMB rank second in Australian equity capital markets this quarter, giving the bank a market share in the segment of 13.6 per cent for the period, according to Thomson Reuters data.\n\nCIMB may get a US$4.7 million payday for its role in the Warrnambool deal, according to an estimate from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting Co.

Chipmaker Intel intends to play a significant role in these developments.\n\nPrakash Mallya, country manger for sales and marketing at Intel Singapore and Malaysia, revealed during a recent press briefing that the continuous \"revolution\" in computing means it is no longer feasible for many data-centre operations to remain manual.\n\nHe noted that in terms of provisioning servers, storage and networking to support business applications, these processes are not automated. The time taken to get these online in order to run an application is also too long, and this would impact the business's nimbleness and ability to respond to market trends.\n\nTherefore, he believes SDDCs are the way to go to power forward-looking enterprises. Intel's vision for this is to make it possible for the applications to \"talk\" directly to the infrastructure layer so that quick deployment and optimisation are achieved. This means developing \"software hooks\" or APIs (application programming interfaces) and introducing these to enterprises, he elaborated.\n\nThis doesn't mean the United States-based chipmaker will now become a software house and develop operating systems to manage data centres better. Rather, it is intent on building up the overall technical expertise within the IT industry and accompanying ecosystem to achieve the software-driven data centre ideal, Mr Mallya explained.\n\nThe company has set up a test-bed site in the US to develop products and services related to driving the SDDC adoption, he added. This is in addition to its core business of constantly improving the raw horse power of its processors to support the running of next-generation data centres and applications, he noted.\n\nOne example of how Intel is contributing to the ecosystem is in Big Data analytics. The executive said while more organisations within Asia are moving beyond the interest stage and committing to proof-of-concepts, the resources needed to run Big Data analytics in real time and \"full steam\" is just too costly.\n\nThis is why it came up with its distribution of Apache Hadoop, which is a tool that helps to collate and mine big datasets for insights. Not only did Intel optimise the software to work with its Xeon processors and technologies such as Hive and HBase, it also included security and manageability functions to what is essentially an open source tool in Hadoop, the executive said.\n\n\"Intel is trying to drive down cost (of doing Big Data) through Apache Hadoop,\" Mr Mallya reiterated.\n\nBesides innovating on the technology, Intel is also building up the ecosystem, he noted. For instance, it is one of the key partners - together with Dell and Revolution Analytics - for Malaysia Big Data player Pulse. It is an early-stage start-up aimed at offering analytics-as-a-service for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), he said.\n\nIn an August press release, Pulse said the four companies are working together to offer Big Data analytics infrastructure, solutions, training and proof-of-concept for innovative projects for businesses and government organisations in the region.\n\nThe Intel executive attributed the rise of social media for the increasing need for Big Data analytics capabilities across all businesses, not just enterprises. \"The advent of social media and the propensity to use (these services), especially among the younger generation, has changed traditional business intelligence to Big Data analytics,\" he said.\n\nIt is in understanding how consumers in this demographic, who have the spending power and desire to spend, that companies will be able to better monetise their Big Data initiatives. Intel understands this, and wants to help companies move towards this outcome, the executive added.\n\nHe qualified his observations by saying that there will not be \"droves\" of companies adopting Big Data in the coming year. In fact, within Asia-Pacific, there will only be pockets of interest deploying proof-of-concepts. That said, he is confident that more will jump aboard once the early adopters illustrate successful deployments and business benefits in time.\n\nIntel's moves are in line with market growth projections. According to research firm IDC, the global big data and services market is expected to hit US$23.8 billion by 2016. It is also projecting spending on Big Data in the Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan, region to reach US$603 million this year - which is an increase of 42.6 per cent over 2012.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Chat software makers call them \"stickers\", and companies think they're the main key to making money today.\n\nVoice app Viber is the latest to jump on the apps bandwagon. It was first launched in end-2010 and is one of the oldest players in the market of chat apps, standing out from the rest of the herd because it's the only one which started as a voice app.\n\nThe Cyprus-based company is positioned as a Skype competitor, and still bills itself as a \"free calling\" app. But it has started to tag on the \"free messaging\" line as well.\n\nWith the stickers and the focus on text-chatting, Viber is starting to compete more closely with the likes of US-based WhatsApp, Korean app KakaoTalk, WeChat from China and Japan's Line.\n\nThese are native text chatting apps and don't have phone-calling functions.\n\nViber's CEO and founder, Talmon Marco, told BizIT that the company is expecting a high percentage of its 200 million users to download the new, free stickers. Last week, it released a float of 300 free stickers, expecting to hit the thousand-mark with paid packages eventually. \"Many of these were designed for users in Asia,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the company is confident that users will be keen to download and pay for these stickers. It's pricing each pack of stickers at US$1.99.\n\nThe stickers won't be Viber's only source of revenue, however. Mr Marco revealed that his company has a plan for various revenue streams - and this is the first, although he couldn't elaborate on future plans.\n\nOne source of revenues might be telco deals. Viber in September signed up with Indonesian operator Axis to offer unlimited use of Viber for a flat fee from users.\n\nThese deals are attractive to telcos because of the added revenue package they can sell downstream, as well as getting more users hooked on data usage - potentially signing up for more premium monthly accounts down the line.\n\nThe sticker tactic isn't just a pure revenue play; each app maker has said that stickers are a way to elevate the chat experience above mere text, in the hopes of attracting users with unique stickers.\n\nSocial network Path has said that stickers are \"pieces of art . . . They are expressive and fun, and they communicate what words can't.\"\n\nFacebook, which currently offers free stickers, said: \"Stickers are different from emoticons. They're detailed illustrations of characters with personality. Sending stickers is a way to share how you're feeling with your friends.\"\n\nViber's 200 million users deem it to be among the more popular apps in the market. WhatsApp is still the undisputed leader, with 350 million monthly active users in October - that is, users who have logged in at least once a month to the app.\n\nWeChat, which is produced by Chinese company Tencent, has about 195 million active users per month, across a base of 300 million registered users.\n\nMarket leader Whats- App is perhaps the only chat app that hasn't jumped into the sticker market yet.\n\nThe company is valued at between US$2 billion and US$4 billion with an enormous user base. Its last round of funding was US$8 million back in 2011. Rumours have surfaced of a potential IPO for the company down the line.\n\nCurrently, Viber has 50 employees and development centres in Belarus and in Israel.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But while their western counterparts are doing it, the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) Council says that Asian companies are not keeping up with the move.\n\nThe council, which has more than 7,000 members worldwide, is a network of senior corporate marketing leaders and brand decision-makers across a wide range of global industries.\n\nIn an Adobe-sponsored survey of 276 senior marketers in the Asia-Pacific region, the marketing trade association found that Asian companies struggle with limited budgets and are lacking in the skills needed to initiate full digital campaigns.\n\nThese campaigns include analytics and reporting metrics that track and indicate how well marketers' efforts are doing.\n\nThe survey report concludes: \"In more mature markets, digital is more than just display, mobile or social advertising. It is advancing to a data-driven, targeted and connected experience with customers at the centre. These countries see higher levels of senior management support that are enabling more tools and technologies to be deployed and leveraged.\"\n\nHisamichi Kinomoto, Adobe's vice-president of marketing, Japan and Asia-Pacific, said that Singapore, Australia and India are leading users of analytics in the region. Across the Asia-Pacific, 80 per cent of companies said that they were measuring and testing their digital campaigns, with 28 per cent of Indian marketers saying they were able to do this well.\n\nAround 21 per cent of Australian and Singaporean companies said the same, but in contrast, Hong Kong, China and Korea only returned a 9 per cent, 7 per cent and 3 per cent positive response, respectively.\n\nThe CMO Council findings correlate with this. It shows that 67 per cent of Australian firms, 65 per cent of Singaporean firms and 60 per cent of Indian firms had the support of senior management when it came to implementing digital technologies.\n\nIn China, Hong Kong and Korea, these numbers were 27 per cent, 44 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.\n\n\"Businesses in Singapore, Australia and India are gaining confidence, taking a more aggressive approach to investment, enjoying higher levels of executive support, measuring more complex and sophisticated metrics and building more dynamic business cases for return on marketing investment. In other countries, however, marketers continue to struggle with low budgets and haphazard agency support, and they are working hard to measure the right elements to convince senior management that their business case for greater investment is water-tight,\" said Mr Kinomoto.\n\nBy 2015, digital advertising will take up 36 per cent of the total marketing budget in the US, while in Asia, that proportion will be at 29.4 per cent.\n\nThis trend runs contrary to the growth of the online audience in Asia, especially those with mobile devices.\n\nAccording to ComScore, 41 per cent of the world's Internet population now resides in Asia. And 78 per cent of the region's online audience is under the age of 45.\n\nOn the mobile front, 40 per cent of smartphone users and 35 per cent of tablet users globally will come from Asia.\n\nTo compare Asia with the more established Western markets, reports also point to more than half of the world's mobile phones being in Asia today. This is more than 10 times the number of phones in North America.\n\nIn Singapore, social media is a particularly favoured channel. Social media was the top priority for 78 per cent of marketers this year, up from 68 per cent in a similar survey done last year.\n\nDavid Scribner, head of Virgin Mobile in Australia, said that the telco has a large data warehouse that collects information from customers, and it has built social media into its SAP backend system. He said the company tends to use social media first for its campaigns, before bringing in traditional media afterwards to support it.\n\nWang Li-Na, head of consumer marketing for StarHub in Singapore, said she is focused on making her team lead their campaigns digitally, rather than have digital distribution seen as another channel within a larger media plan.\n\n\"The challenge has been to get our backend processes and IT systems up to speed to support our digital initiatives,\" she added.\n\nThe CMO Council said that overall, Asia still lags behind North America in its digital marketing performance and readiness but the gap is closing fast. Marketers keenly understand that there is no time to allow this evolution to happen slowly, it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

CASUAL,\" says the receptionist, eyeing my dining companion's business shirt and suede loafers with some disdain as she mouths into a walkie-talkie, well within earshot. \"We have an $80 minimum spend per person for dinner,\" she adds as she hands you an elevator pass for the 57th floor.\n\nWell, well. What a long way the Ku De Ta brand has come since its founding in 2000 as a casual beach bar on Bali's Seminyak strip, where one could just wash up from a dip in the sea to drink in the sunset on a sandy daybed.\n\nRun by a separate management team who also runs the brand's month-old Bangkok offshoot, Ku De Ta Singapore is like a trendier, haughtier grown-up sister ready to shrug off her humble beginnings. And though it's been four years since her much-feted debut atop the Marina Bay Sands, she's working harder than before to fashion herself as a trendy, modern Asian affair comparable to the likes of Nobu and Hakkasan.\n\nIn its latest coup, the restaurant has roped in a brand new executive chef - the UK-trained Frenchman and four-year alumnus of the Nobu group, Frederic Faucheux - to further vamp up its Pan-Asian cuisine.\n\nRather than overhaul the menu, Faucheux is taking it slow, penning in new creations among existing dishes on the menu, which waiters only help to identify upon request.\n\nWe kick off with chopped yellowfin tuna tartare ($28) served with yuzu soy garlic dressing on a nest of thin udon. Against expectations, it is the simple udon that is the dish's selling point. Cooked to textbook perfect bounce, the noodles get a refreshing brightness from the citrus dressing. The fish, unfortunately, lacked both seasoning and general flavour.\n\nA single yamamomo, or Japanese bayberry - sweet yet simultaneously acidic - appears on the side as a palate cleanser and as a nod to mentor Nobu Matsuhisa's signature practice in his restaurants.\n\nThe yutaka roll ($34) is a complex combination of foie gras, salmon skin, cucumber and lightly torched scallops that pushes the Asian fusion envelope slightly too far. Though the crackle of the salmon skin is a delight, the buttery soft pate of foie gras and the subtle sweetness of the scallops are lost in the too strongly vinegared sushi rice. Even for those bent on indulgence, there can be too much of a good thing.\n\nSimilarly, a lighter hand would benefit the lobster claw tempura ($32), which is coated in a batter more fluffy than wispy that obscures the claw's flakey, milky sweetness.\n\nMuch more deserving of praise are plates that don't try to straddle the East-West divide as obviously, such as the Australian lamb rack ($38) glazed with walnut jus and grilled to a sunset-pink medium doneness; as well as the decidedly Asian halibut ($32), steamed till fork-tender and flakey, complemented by healthy diced pickled carrots, konbu and steamed bak choy.\n\nDesserts sound great on paper, but are hit-and-miss on the plate. Intercontinental marital bliss is portrayed in the garam masala and chocolate ($18) comprising a dense, aromatic chocolate brownie lifted by a berry sorbet, contrasting with a white chocolate panna cotta. But there are awkward arrangements too, like the tear-inducing wasabi ice-cream ($18) with crunchy cubes of fresh pear and chocolate mousse.\n\nThe restaurant also does tasting menus for $158++ per person for parties of two or more, and lunch has a more corporate feel compared to dinner, when the restaurant's balcony doors are thrown open to the breezy outdoors, and a live DJ spins upbeat lounge music.\n\nLooking out towards the clear skies rather than downwards on Singapore's cityscape, one can easily be transported back to the laid-back beaches of Bali.

Thailand and Vietnam also show potential, she said.\n\nConsumer preferences are developing in the same pattern as in other emerging luxury markets, Ms D'Arpizio said. While Chinese consumers are becoming more sophisticated and turning away from conspicuous logos in favour of unusual design and craftsmanship, Southeast Asian shoppers still \"seek out more visible, recognisable luxury\", she said.\n\nThe ubiquity of smartphones, however, means there are new opportunities as well as obstacles for luxury companies as they woo consumers in South-east Asia and beyond.\n\nAccording to Bain's research, online transactions now account for 5 per cent of all luxury sales around the world, and mobile is driving a third of that traffic. While mobile-driven sales are still a very small part of the total global luxury market, retailers recognise that they are growing and are updating Internet strategies.\n\n\"Most advertisers started their digital journey with desktop digital devices and traditional websites,\" said Ravi Thakran, group president of LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton for South Asia, South-east Asia and the Middle East. \"Mobile is definitely a key tool in South-east Asia markets. All of us have started to increase our pace in developing mobile sites or relevant apps to reach our consumers.\"\n\nLast year, Kering, formerly called PPR, whose brand portfolio includes Gucci, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, began to see mobile marketing as a necessity instead of a \"nice to have\" addition to traditional Internet marketing, said Federico Barbieri, the company's senior vice-president of e-marketing.\n\nKering introduced sites optimised for users with smartphones and tablets. It also created new analytics dashboards, so each of its more than 20 brands could track online traffic by the type of device.\n\nThe data will help brands build websites and apps that are easy to browse on different models of smartphones and tablets, Mr Barbieri said.\n\nHe noted that the challenges facing Kering's mobile developers included integrating high-quality product images that wouldn't slow navigation or download speeds.\n\n\"The website architecture, navigation and functionality must be designed with a totally different approach,\" Mr Barbieri explained. \"It's easier to adapt a mobile site to desktop than vice versa, for instance, even if I believe that going forward we will need a tailor-made approach by device.\"\n\nMr Thakran says LVMH has used online videos optimised for mobile viewing in its Asian advertising campaigns. And the company's beauty brands, which include Sephora, BeneFit and Make Up For Ever, also have sponsored weather and photo-sharing apps.\n\nLuxury brand executives say that, along with tailoring online marketing campaigns to smartphones and tablets, they need to learn how to use the mobile devices to improve service and to form connections with individual consumers that are personalised but don't feel intrusive.\n\nFor FJ Benjamin, a Singapore-based company that manages the retail operations of several luxury brands in South-east Asia, including C\u00e9line and the watch company Girard-Perregaux, tablets already have become valuable in-store marketing tools. Sales associates use them to visit brand websites and online catalogues, as well as keep track of individual shoppers' favourite styles or products.\n\n\"It's a simple, elegant way of getting brand information into the customers' hands at the time the customer is deciding on his or her purchase,\" said Ben Benjamin, general manager of FJ Benjamin's luxury division. \"It's also a great way to link the product to the global fashion market.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Based on a sale consideration of about 2.294 trillion rupiah (about $249 million), this translates into net proceeds of about $237 million. The divestment will see Keppel Land realise a net gain of about $149 million.\n\nThe buyer, PT Modernland Realty Tbk, previously held a 49 per cent effective stake in both PT Mitra Sindo Sukses and PT Mitra Sindo Makmur, which own Jakarta Garden City, an integrated township. Keppel Land held the majority 51 per cent stake.\n\nKeppel Land said that its divestment will allow the company to redeploy capital to new residential and commercial projects in Indonesia, with a focus on Jakarta.\n\nThe Indonesian economy is expected to remain positive in the long term, underpinned by sound fundamentals that will continue to drive demand for quality homes and investment-grade offices, especially in Jakarta, it added.\n\nUnder the current masterplan, Jakarta Garden City will be developed in phases and will comprise about 4,000 landed homes and townhouses when fully developed.\n\nAs at end-October, 83 per cent of the 1,486 launched homes and shophouses have been sold under Phases 1 and 2. To date, over 1,100 units have been completed, with facilities such as a clubhouse, school, wet market and shopping arcade, as well as direct access to the toll road, Jakarta Outer Ring Road.\n\nApart from Jakarta Garden City, Keppel Land is currently developing Tower 2 of International Financial Centre Jakarta, which is located on a prime site along Jalan Jendral Sudirman in the city's Central Business District.\n\nWork on the 48-storey Grade A office Tower 2, located just beside the fully-leased Tower 1 and near the upcoming Setiabudi MRT station, is progressing well, with piling works completed. When completed in the second half of 2015, Tower 2 will offer about 50,000 square metres of net leasable area.\n\nKeppel Land's stock ended trading down three cents, at $3.57.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Avaya is a global provider of enterprise communications systems, software and services.\n\nAccording to the survey, many customers use different channels as they are not getting their query resolved adequately through the first channel they use. On average, it takes a customer just under four interactions with an organisation to resolve a query.\n\nWhile phone and in-person conversations remained the most common method of communication, 2013 saw a rise in the use of social media, particularly in South-east Asia.\n\nIn Singapore, almost a third of the respondents used Facebook to contact organisations for information.\n\nNearly nine out of 10 customers who have used social media in the past three months for a service query had already tried to use another channel to resolve the query. With social media, many expect to be able to get a faster response, more positive response or make sure their query is actually addressed.\n\nIn Singapore, the hospitality and tourism industry led in the adoption of social media channels, followed by retail and wholesale, and healthcare, government and education sectors in the third place. The finance, banking and insurance sector, although the slowest in adopting social media platforms, led in the use of mobile applications.\n\nApart from social media and mobile applications, another emerging channel for providing customer service across various industries is video chats.\n\nThe survey revealed that 15 per cent of respondents in the Asia-Pacific region has used this function when contacting organisations.\n\nFor those who have used video chats, 85 per cent said they were \"happy\" to \"extremely happy\" with the service interaction. The highest video usage was seen in the retail and wholesale sector.\n\nIn Singapore, consumers used video chat mainly to update their customer details, make complaints and purchase a product or service. According to the survey, the adoption of video chats is expected to grow in the region by 14 per cent.\n\n\"The importance of multi-channel communication continues to grow, and video is starting to represent an opportunity for customer service differentiation. While monitoring conversations and engaging customers via social media channels has also become increasingly important, companies need to ensure they have the right analytics and tracking tool in place to ensure they can decipher the chatter that matters,\" said Tan Meng Teck, APAC customer experience management leader, Avaya.\n\nMore consumers are also looking to resolve queries themselves, with web self-service expected to register the highest growth in usage (at 41 per cent) in the region in 2014. This will put greater pressure on supporting technology such as knowledge management and customer relationship management (CRM) tools.\n\nInstead of following what the competition is doing, Mr Tan stressed the need for organisations to listen to their customers as they look to expand the variety of channels to offer to customers. He noted that there were many cases where organisations had rushed to launch a mobile application or social media channel but had not achieved the benefits they were expecting due to poor execution.\n\nAs customers bounce around different channels, they have also come to expect a seamless and integrated experience regardless of the channel they use. For example, they expect not to have to repeat their query, account identification and information each time, and for the organisation to combine the information from the different interactions.\n\nCustomer service remains a key influencer of brand loyalty, with 83 per cent indicating they would avoid buying from a company, and more importantly, actively advise friends and family to do the same if they experienced bad customer service. The majority of consumers in the region (or 70 per cent) will spend at least 10 per cent more money with a company that consistently provides excellent customer service.\n\nIn Singapore, 65 per cent of respondents feel that interacting with customer service centres is always problematic, while less than half agreed that the service received from customer service centres has improved over the last 12 months.\n\nOverall, Singapore consumers registered the highest satisfaction with the overall interaction process provided by the hospitality, tourism and entertainment industry and the least satisfaction with that provided by telecommunications service, media and utility companies.\n\nIn terms of response times, 43 per cent of local consumers indicated they would be impressed with an organisation if they received a reply to their email in under five hours.\n\nExpectations for web chat response times are much higher, with 45 per cent of respondents expecting a response to their web chat within one minute.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The figures were not far off from the previous week's 34 trades worth $6.4 million. Buyers outnumbered sellers with 15 companies that recorded 24 purchases worth $5.4 million, versus five firms with six disposals worth $4.4 million. The number of companies and value on the buying side were up from the previous week's 11 firms and $5.2 million. The number of purchases, however, was down from the previous week's 29 acquisitions. On the negative side, the number of companies and trades were consistent with the previous week's three firms and five disposals. The sell value was sharply up from the previous week's sales worth $1.2 million.\n\nBuyback activity among listed firms rose with seven companies posting 27 repurchases worth $4.7 million. The number of trades and value were up from the previous week's 20 transactions worth $2.8 million, pushing the buyback totals this month to nine companies, 53 trades and $7.7 million. The repurchases so far this month are far below the averages for November of 2007- 2012 of 26 firms, 182 trades and $68 million. If the slow buyback pace continues, the repurchases this month will amount to a paltry 70 transactions worth $10.2 million.\n\nThe bulk of the significant insider trades last week were acquisitions, most of which were made following the announcement of earnings results.\n\nLey Choon Group Holdings\n\nExecutive chairman and CEO Toh Choo Huat picked up where he left off in one-stop underground utilities infrastructure services provider Ley Choon Group Holdings in May with 80,000 shares purchased on Nov 21 at 18.6 cents each, increasing his deemed holdings to 309.476 million shares or 52.24 per cent of the issued capital.

It redefines the concept of the dated department store. By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT'S been a tale of modern-day consumerism, a historical shopping haven aimed at filling the emotional and sartorial void of any cash-wielding shopaholic. But in recent years, just like the sepia-toned images of its grand abode in Raffles Place in the 1960s, the romance of local department store giant Robinsons seemed to have faded.\n\nDespite facelifts over the years (a $7 million makeover of its outlet at The Centrepoint in 2005; the opening of an upscale outpost at Marina Bay Sands in 2011 which closed in May), the shopping institution was nevertheless better known for marked-down pillows and figure-forgiving clothing that mum and gran would gravitate towards.\n\nWith shoppers milling to on-trend fashion chains, luxury boutiques and online sales sites, one would have thought that the decline of the department store was inevitable. But the retailer's new $40 million flagship, located where The Heeren Shops used to reside, is poised to breathe glamour into the department store concept. Sure, its line-up of 380 new brands, including hyped labels such as The Kooples and Elevenparis, as well as designer names such as Manolo Blahnik and Roland Mouret, may pique the purse strings of those in the know.\n\nBut the truly inspired features of the 186,000 sq ft store lies in its exercises in sheer indulgence that one would never have associated with a mass-market store. Imagine a sprawling personal shopping gallery with changing rooms, espresso machines and even an in-house hair and beauty salon; a section dedicated to furs; a vintage department with Birkins and Chanel classic flap bags nestled in a glass cabinet; and a champagne bar featuring a glass table supported by oversized fluted stemware.\n\n\"It's a revolution for Robinsons, that's for sure, but 'revolutionary' is a big word to describe Robinsons Orchard as a retailer,\" says managing director of Robinsons, Franz Kraatz, when asked how the new Orchard store is set to change the retail scene.\n\nMore evolution than revolution\n\n\"We would say that we are more into an 'evolution' than 'revolution' because we are still keeping the brands that our loyal customers love but on top of that, we are bringing in new brands that they don't know about and that we've patiently tried to find throughout the world.\"\n\nMr Kraatz, who is of French-German descent, spent seven years at luxe Hong Kong department store Lane Crawford as senior vice-president of sales and operations for seven years, before joining Robinsons. And his eye for sophisticated visual merchandising has perhaps influenced the sleek and intuitive store design, spearheaded by home-grown interior design firm Designphase DBA.\n\n\"We felt that we have tried to make it as open a space, as friendly and accessible as possible,\" explains Mr Kraatz. \"Accessibility, openness, the sense of discovery and arrival were all very important to us.\n\nWe also want to provide convenience for shoppers based on the idea of putting several brands in one category together, for example the shirt bar, where shoppers are able to see right away and decide - if they want a blue shirt, they can choose between two or three brands and zoom onto it easily rather than have to go brand by brand at different sections of the store.\"\n\nAnd amid the store's clean lines and abundance of natural light are showcases that border on the theatrical. Think shavers, pots of potions and other grooming apparatuses laid out on a bar-top like artefacts on a museum's plinth in the men's beauty section; perfume bottles encased within bell jars; and a mannequin languorously sprawled along a counter behind the cashier.\n\nAll the better to highlight the glorious merchandise located on the store's six floors, painstakingly sourced from all corners of the globe.\n\n\"It took a bit of convincing to brand principals to be part of the new Robinsons Orchard and get them to visualise our new store concept,\" admits Isabelle Tan, merchandising manager for the ladies' shoes, bags and accessories department who acquired labels such as French footwear brand Walter Steiger and Italian luxury bag label Elena Ghisellini.\n\n\"However, this challenge pushed us even harder to seek out new brands in Asia and even in countries such as Brazil, where we found the brand, Schutz.\" But would this sudden influx of indie labels or designer marques intimidate the average Robinsons shopper, seeking old-school business loafers or classic twin sets?\n\n\"I don't think it is too difficult to educate consumers on the new brands as Singapore has the highest proportion of smartphone users - everybody Googles and checks their phones for brands and information,\" says Mr Kraatz, who hopes to target a younger generation of well-travelled shoppers as well as tourists with the new labels.\n\n\"And we will naturally try as much as we can to get the brands' awareness out in the market, such as through extensive training on the brand for retail staff so that they can impart the brand information, history and ethos to shoppers.\"\n\nIt certainly seems that Robinsons may be Singapore's answer to London fashion and lifestyle emporium Selfridges or Parisian multi-label store Colette, especially with a stable of brands ranging from haute to hip, like Elizabeth and James by celebutantes Mary-Kate and Elizabeth Olsen, outre shoe company L'F Unisex and vintage Christian Lacroix accessories.\n\n\"Before the launch of Robinsons Orchard, Singapore did not have these brands to cater to customers who are well-versed with bridge fashion labels,\" says Doris Loh, womenswear merchandising manager. \"We have too many high-street fashion brands, which in my opinion, is a phase that will not last very long in Singapore's retail market.\" While it remains to be seen if shoppers are truly ready for this modern-day cathedral to material pleasures, one thing's for sure, Robinsons Orchard is going to shake things up in the department store sector.\n\n\"We have been to big department stores in cities from London to Hong Kong, and most of these big stores have revamped their store concepts,\" adds Ms Tan. \"We often hear Singaporeans commenting that shopping in Singapore is very boring, referring to department stores having the same brands. So now they have Robinsons Orchard as the destination to visit for trendy wares.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/attacks-websites-wake-call-singapore-mcafee", "site_title": "Attacks on websites a wake-up call for Singapore: McAfee", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAttacks on websites a wake-up call for Singapore: McAfee\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 24, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE recent spate of attacks on websites in Singapore may have organisations looking harder at their cyber defences but Michael Sentonas, McAfee's vice-president and chief technology officer for Asia Pacific, says there is no need to make a beeline for next-generation security products.\n\n\"This is a good wake-up call. The threat is very real and is something that organisations need to take very seriously. Many of the techniques that have been used to penetrate networks are not new. The average attacker does not have to do anything new,\" he said, pointing to techniques such as cross-site scripting and SQL injection that were used in some of the attacks.\n\nA basic example of cross-site scripting is when an attacker injects a script in a legitimate site URL which then redirects a user to a fake but identical page. The attacker can then hijack the user's session. In SQL injection, code is injected into a data-driven web server that allows the attacker to gain access to the contents of a database.\n\nAdded Mr Sentonas: \"Many organisations are not aware of where the weaknesses lies or that their websites are not 100 per cent secure or kept up-to-date. We shouldn't be panicking to look for and buy next-generation security products. They may or may not be needed. The very first thing that I would do is have a look at what is working inside my organisation today, what needs to be updated and what needs to be better secured. Maybe I have technologies that do a great job but are not used correctly.\"\n\nIn addition to conducting regular vulnerability assessments and patches, he also stressed on the need for continuous education of employees so that they do not fall prey to phishing attacks that may compromise an organisation's security.\n\nIn fact, before firms start to think about technology, they should establish what information is critical to them. \"If someone accessed that information, what would happen to your business? Do you know where that information is? If you can't work out the answers to those questions, you won't know what to secure. You won't know how much you should be spending on security,\" said Mr Sentonas.\n\nHe added that many small businesses typically do not see the need to secure their data as they do not think they would be targeted by cyber criminals. However, they may be holding customer or employee information that is of interest to a hacker.\n\nMobile threats are another rising concern for organisations, particularly with the rise of BYOD (bring your own device) in the workplace. According to the McAfee Labs Threats Report: Third Quarter 2013, more than 680,000 new Android malware samples were found in that quarter, as attacks on the mobile operating system increased by more than 30 per cent.\n\nOne new mobile malware that was identified is the Exploit/MasterKey.A, which allows an attacker to bypass the digital signature validation of applications on Android devices. While Google has produced a patch and provided it to manufacturers of Android devices, Mr Sentonas cautions those who acquire applications from third-party stores or websites to ensure they install mobile security software.\n\nMcAfee Labs researchers also found two-part malware, consisting of a Trojan application that downloads a second-stage malware to a device. An example is the Android/Repane family which consists of a downloader, Android/Repane Dropper.A, and a malicious portion that sends user information to the attacker. The dropper pretends to be an application that lets users x-ray things with their Android devices but this application does not work as neither phone nor tablet cameras emit x-rays. Once users download the malware, the dropper will get them to install it in order to continue scanning.\n\nUsers also need to beware of the banking Trojan Android/Hesperbot, which pretends to be an application that produces authentication codes for online banking, but instead steals the victim's login information. It deletes its icon so that it will not be noticed. Though visible in the process list, it goes by the misleading name \"Certificate\".\n\nMr Sentonas stressed that every organisation should be using a mobile device management solution to secure the device. As for protecting data in the device, he pointed to the availability of \"container\" technology that allows e-mail to be opened in an encrypted container, and the use of a mobile virtual desktop, so users can connect back to the office without keeping any data in the phone.\n\nThe McAfee report also found that AutoRun malware, which often hides on USB drives and can allow an attacker to take control of a system, doubled at the start of the year and remained in the third quarter. At the same time, traditional malware signed with digital signatures grew by 50 per cent to more than 1.5 million samples, calling into question the validity of digital certificates as a trust mechanism. Global spam volume increased 125 per cent in the third quarter of 2013; however, McAfee Labs researchers believe much of this spike was driven by legitimate \"affiliate\" marketing firms purchasing and using mailing lists sourced from less than reputable sources.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ngiam was promised a 3 per cent commission for the work. Thereafter, he received large sums of monies totalling $1,249,829.23 from various remitters in the US, Canada and Cook Islands. Despite his suspicions, Ngiam subsequently withdrew and passed monies totalling $850,000 to Chua in person on six occasions.\n\nNgiam received a total sum of $10,451.94 for his work. The banks of the various overseas remitters were deceived into remitting money from the remitters' accounts into Ngiam's accounts after receiving fraudulent e-mail instructions.\n\nAs a result, Ngiam was sentenced on Oct 15, 2012, to a total of 54 months' imprisonment for dishonestly receiving stolen property and transferring the benefits of criminal conduct, under Section 411(1) of the Penal Code and Section 47(1)(b) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (CDSA).\n\nChua has also been charged for dishonestly receiving stolen property and transferring benefits of criminal conduct, under Section 411(1) of the Penal Code and Section 47(1)(b) of the CDSA.

For that matter, many other telephone numbers. All they need to do when they want to make a call is to key in the company's name on their mobile phone and they will be connected.\n\nThanks to an app called CallmyName, dialling numbers will be a thing of the past. Handphone users only need to key in names to call a company or an individual.\n\nLaunched two weeks ago by Global Yellow Pages, the app is not only a convenience for consumers, it also reinforces brand recall for businesses. Said Global Yellow Pages' CEO Stanley Tan: \"It is often easier to remember names as opposed to remembering phone numbers because names are intuitive.\"\n\nDeveloped in 2008 by CallmyName, an Israeli company, the app was launched three years later and is now available in UK, Russia and Germany. The company chose Singapore to be its launch pad in Asia because of its IT-savvy population and affluence and sought out Global Yellow Pages for its established commercial relevance.\n\nAlthough a boon to businesses, the app is equally friendly for social use. In Europe, many social users take on a monicker for ease of recall or to project a persona. Likewise, commercial users whose product names differ from their registered company's name can choose to use the product name as the effective contact. What this means is that anyone who keys in the product name on his or her handphone can reach the company instantaneously.\n\nIt costs $500 to register such a name - which is the same amount as what SingTel charges for a golden number. All 120,000 business names published in the current Yellow Pages are already in the CallmyName system by default.\n\nBusinesses can go to the CallmyName.sg website to find out more. The public can download the app for immediate use via itunes app store or google play store free of charge.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, older data centres sited in Singapore are siphoning too much energy and are becoming a drag on the government's smart city ambitions, a senior executive at Schneider Electric has cautioned.\n\nBenedict Soh, Schneider Electric Singapore's vice-president for IT business, told BizIT that establishing a smart city requires a seamless integration of technology across six areas: water, mobility and transportation, public services, energy, buildings, and infrastructure.\n\nData centres are key to ensuring each of these functions properly and can be seamlessly integrated - which is why they are critical to the successful development of smart cities, he noted.\n\n\"However, despite the symbiotic relationship between the two, data centres seem to be a counterpoint to Singapore's journey to becoming a smart, energy- efficient city,\" Mr Soh said.\n\nElaborating, he pointed out that Singapore's farsightedness in announcing its 10-year Infocomm Technology (ICT) blueprint in 2005 - also known as iN2015 Masterplan - meant that many major players had already been lured to set up their data centres here as early as almost a decade ago.\n\nThese legacy data centres are now one of the main challenges for the local industry in terms of improving energy efficiency, though, Mr Soh said. \"This is because older data centres consume more power as they need to keep up with growing data demands and new technologies, such as virtualisation, which pushes power usage effectiveness (PUE) figures higher.\"\n\nAdditionally, energy usage is not a typical design criterion for data centres or effectively managed as an expense, particularly for older data centres. This is in spite of how electrical power costs over the lifespan of a data centre may exceed the cost of the power system installed, or the IT equipment housed in the facility, the executive said.\n\nAccording to the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), there are currently more than 50 data centres in Singapore, of which 20 are large data centres. A typical large facility is estimated to consume the energy equivalent of 10,000 households.\n\nMr Soh said another contributor to energy inefficiency in data centres is oversizing - of power and cooling equipment, in particular. This happens when the design value of these systems exceeds the total IT load, he explained.\n\n\"While it is clear that installing too much power and cooling equipment is wasteful from an investment standpoint, it is not so obvious such oversizing can dramatically decrease the electrical efficiency of the overall system and cause excessive ongoing electrical consumption,\" Mr Soh said.\n\nThere are fixed losses in the power and cooling systems that are present, regardless of the IT load, and represent a \"dominant\" percentage of data centre physical infrastructure (DCPI) electrical consumption in a typical installation. In data centres with light IT loads, the fixed losses become a larger percentage of the total electrical bill, he explained.\n\nThis is why the assessment and planning stages of any data centre implementation play a critical role in reducing power wastage and, in doing so, cutting costs for the company, he said.\n\nSome of the questions decision makers have to ask themselves include whether they know the life cycle and productivity of existing data centre infrastructure, its current PUE, how to better optimise its availability and performance as well as reduce operating costs and manage capital expenditure, the executive pointed out.\n\nThis is why Mr Soh lauded Singapore's introduction of the BCA-IDA Green Mark for Existing and New Data Centres, as it would greatly improve energy efficiency and make its data centre sector's development more sustainable.\n\n\"(The certification) gives businesses a framework for their data centres to establish systems and processes that can improve energy efficiency as well as recommend metrics and best practices that they can follow. This allows IT managers to understand how they can elevate data centre energy efficiency during the design, planning and operating stages,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It later ventured into rubber and general trading. In the 1980s, the company became Mulpha (Singapore), before being acquired by Mr Masagung's family in 1988.\n\nIn 2007, Mr Masagung, Mr Salim and other investors initiated an offer - first offering 39.5 cents a share before raising their bid to 43.5 cents - for Guthrie, eventually garnering a stake of over 50 per cent.\n\nIn Singapore, Guthrie partly owns Jurong Point Shopping Centre and manages nex mall in Serangoon.

But he didn't think companies would \"dump the data centre altogether\".\n\nHis company AWS started in March 2006 with its S3 product, providing cloud storage. Today, it runs nine large cloud data centres globally: four in the US, and one each in Europe, Sydney, Tokyo, Sao Paolo and Singapore.\n\nAWS' head start, combined with aggressive investments in more data centres, has given it a formidable lead in the cloud game. According to Gartner research, AWS is the undisputed leader in the public cloud market, with five times more business than 14 of its closest competitors combined.\n\nOther tech vendors like VMware and HP have often taken up the hybrid stick to beat AWS down. The common argument they raise is that companies don't want to entirely abandon their in-house data centres, because of security and compliance concerns. Many in the public sector and financial services industry, in particular, are required to keep confidential data within the physical confines of their walls.\n\nMr Vogels acknowledged that as much as the company would like clients to jump on the cloud bandwagon completely, it is aware of the demand for hybrid setups and has been working on more ways for systems outside AWS to connect and play well with the AWS cloud.\n\nLast year, AWS and infrastructure provider Eucalyptus Systems teamed up to allow the two to bridge AWS's cloud with third-party clouds such as those privately owned by enterprises. This marked another step AWS took towards opening up and embracing third parties. Some of its technologies like Simple Workflow Service help make third-party applications run nicely on both internal and public clouds. Storage Gateway and Direct Connect help to get data off private data centres and into AWS more smoothly.\n\nAWS has continued to step up the pace of its product rollout, as noted recently by AWS senior vice-president Andy Jassy. \"The pace of innovation is accelerating at AWS,\" he said. AWS released 61 services in 2010, 82 in 2011, 159 in 2012, and 235 so far in 2013.\n\nThanks to its efforts, AWS can now namedrop peers like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Citrix and Red Hat, all of whom have products that interface with AWS's cloud services, Mr Jassy said.\n\nThough customers still want to combine both, Mr Vogels has continued to advise them to tap the public cloud over an internal system: \"On- premise private clouds give you none of (the public cloud's) benefits; you still have to buy and own the hardware. Maybe you can improve agility a little, but you're still constrained - you're still trying to make security work. And you definitely can't go global in minutes.\"\n\nHe observes that customers in Asia seem to be quicker to get on the cloud - and they are more likely to be keen on the public cloud.\n\nThe lack of legacy infrastructure to maintain helps, and a lot of the earlier reservations about clouds being unreliable and not secure have largely been lifted, thanks to big names like Shell and Unilever on public clouds, Mr Vogels said.\n\nHe noted that Asia's connectivity continues to improve quickly, which again lowers the barrier to cloud adoption.\n\n\"Last-mile connectivity is still an issue in Asia's emerging markets,\" Mr Vogels said. (Last-mile connectivity is the ability to get to rural and far-flung places that may not be close to wired stations.)\n\nBut Asia's emerging markets are leapfrogging cellular legacy standards like 2G and 3G, which established markets need to maintain - and are able to go straight to 4G connectivity, which is about 10 times faster than 3G and more stable.\n\nThese trends are helping Asian small and medium-sized businesses to go to the cloud, because more stable connectivity means firms can tap clouds over the Web more reliably.\n\nIt's no coincidence that good connectivity in Asian markets like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan are reasons that they have been able to adopt the cloud earlier than neighbours in emerging markets elsewhere. This year, the Asia Cloud Computing Association (ACCA) ranks them as the most ready for cloud adoption.\n\nIn contrast, while China boasts many cloud-ready factors such as a tech-savvy workforce and the building up of good hardware infrastructure, its poor connectivity proved to be a huge hindrance. China ranks only 10th in the ACCA's Cloud Readiness Index of countries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Net proceeds would be used as working capital and to develop its three core business units: medical consumables, blood purification and orthopaedic products.\n\n\"We are positive on Shandong Weigao on this development because sale proceeds will strengthen its balance and working capital. And it is exiting a challenging business,\" said Alfie Yeo, an analyst at DBS Vickers Securities.\n\nEarlier this month, Biosensors posted a 60 per cent decline in net profit to US$11.3 million for its second quarter ended Sept 30, from US$28.2 million a year ago. This was mainly a result of lower selling prices of its products and increased expenditure.\n\nSaid Mr Yeo: \"Shandong Weigao is in a net cash position and no urgent need of money. We therefore believe this signifies Shandong Weigao's loss of confidence in (Biosensors') stent business.\"\n\nThe sale is expected to be completed on Dec 20 this year and no later than Feb 28 next year, Shandong Weigao said. Zhang Huawei and Phyllis Chan Yuk Ying, directors of Biosensors nominated by Wellford, will resign from their positions with effect from the completion date.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, Biosensors shares closed four cents higher at $0.98.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Does it really mean that you have high blood pressure (hypertension)? A 76-page document forms the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH/ESC) 2013 guidelines for hypertension - a telling sign that not all the experts can agree on many of the issues pertaining to hypertension.\n\nWhile the latest guidelines state that \"it is recommended that the diagnosis of hypertension be based on at least two blood pressure measurements per visit on at least two occasions\", it recognises the limitations of basing the diagnosis of hypertension on the current definition and supports the use of home blood pressure monitoring in hypertension management.\n\nIn the latest guidelines, the criterion for the diagnosis of hypertension based on a blood pressure reading of 140/90mm Hg or more has remained largely unchanged.\n\nWhite-coat phenomenon\n\nDiagnosing a person as having hypertension is not as simple as it seems. For a long time, physicians have noticed that there are patients who have a higher blood pressure reading whenever they visit a doctor but the blood pressure reading is lower outside the clinic or hospital environment. This observed blood pressure pattern is termed the \"white-coat phenomenon\" in reference to the white coats commonly worn by doctors. Elevation of the blood pressure without reaching hypertension thresholds is described as the white-coat effect and is present in almost everyone who visits a clinic.\n\nThis is thought to be due to the activation of the nervous system by the brain. However, through multiple visits, the blood pressure can gradually decrease as a result of the person being conditioned to the environment.\n\nThe presence of the white-coat effect can also occur in those with proven hypertension and may create a false impression that the patient's hypertension is resistant to medication; this may result in excessive medication being dispensed and the patient complaining of dizzy spells at home.\n\nWhite-coat hypertension\n\nThe latest European guidelines define white-coat hypertension as clinic systolic (upper reading) and diastolic (lower reading) blood pressure readings of 140/90mm Hg and a 24-hour blood pressure of less than 130/80mm Hg; the US guidelines define white-coat hypertension as a clinic blood pressure of 140/90mm Hg and an average daytime ambulatory blood pressure reading of less than 135/85mm Hg.\n\nThe 24-hour blood pressure reading is obtained by putting the patient on an ambulatory blood pressure monitor, usually on the arm, and recording blood pressure readings at regular intervals over a 24-hour period.\n\nPatients who are considered to have white-coat hypertension do not have evidence of damage of blood pressure on the body's organs and do not require medication.\n\nData from papers published by the European Society of Hypertension in the Journal of Hypertension in 2013 and British Hypertension Society in British Medical Journal in 2000 shows that about 15 per cent to 30 per cent of patients who have elevated clinic blood pressure readings have white-coat hypertension and this is more frequently present in women than men.\n\nDistinguishing white-coat hypertension from real hypertension is important as it avoids unnecessary medication, unnecessary costs and unnecessary premium payments for insurance.\n\nIn the elderly, the administration of medication to those with white-coat hypertension can have the unintended effects of dizzy spells and falls with serious consequences. In those with white-coat hypertension, it has been noted that the clinic blood pressure can decrease by up to 15 mm Hg for the systolic blood pressure in subsequent clinic visits and probably represents conditioning of the patient to the clinic environment.\n\nIn some patients, it may require up to six clinic visits for the blood pressure to become stable.\n\nIs white-coat hypertension of any consequence?\n\nThere is evidence that patients with white-coat hypertension are more likely to develop long-term sustained high blood pressure. In one study, slightly more than one-third of patients with white-coat hypertension progressed to sustained high blood pressure over a mean period of 2-1/2 years and this progression was associated with evidence of thickening of the heart muscle resulting from high blood pressure.\n\nThose who are more likely to continue having sustained high blood pressure are those who are older with blood pressure near hypertensive limits, and those with underlying medical conditions that predispose them to high blood pressure (such as sleep-related breathing problems, diabetes and impaired kidney function).\n\nShould white-coat hypertension be treated?\n\nThe question of whether patients with white-coat hypertension should be treated remains very controversial primarily because there is data from the 2012 International Database on Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Relation to Cardiovascular Outcomes (IDACO) study to show that in men and in patients with diabetes mellitus, the presence of white-coat hypertension is associated with increased risk of heart disease.\n\nWhile there is no consensus as to when patients with white-coat hypertension should be treated, generally, those with high-risk factors for heart disease and those with evidence of damage to the body from the effects of elevated high blood pressure should be considered for treatment.\n\nEvidence of damage to the body can be detected by using ultrasound to measure the degree of narrowing of the neck (carotid artery), thickening of heart muscle (due to strain on the heart), detection of albumin in the urine (due to kidney damage) and increased stiffness of the arteries.\n\nA simple indicator of significant stiffness of the arterial system is that the difference between the systolic and the diastolic blood pressure readings (pulse pressure) is more than 60mm Hg. In most healthy people, the pulse pressure is usually not more than 40mm Hg.\n\nSome advice\n\nIf you have an elevated blood pressure reading (more than 140/90mm Hg) at your doctor's clinic, you should consider repeated measurements both at home and at your doctor's clinic before starting on medication.\n\nIf however you already show evidence of organ damage from sustained high blood pressure, you should commence medication. If you have persistent white-coat hypertension, you should consider lifestyle changes such as salt reduction and stress reduction as there is evidence that it can potentially be detrimental.\n\nIf there is considerable variability of your blood pressure and/or presence of a pulse pressure of more than 60mm Hg, you should discuss treatment with your physician as there is data to show that blood pressure variability and severe arterial stiffness are associated with adverse consequences.\n\nIf you are on medication for hypertension and you get frequent dizzy spells, especially when you get up from a lying or sitting position, it may be possible that you may have white-coat hypertension. The most important point to remember is this: ensure you do not have white-coat hypertension before you commence any treatment for elevated blood pressure.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

Debbie Yong checks in\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nREMEMBER the last time you were in Bangkok? When you got all dressed up for a long, enjoyable evening of dinner and drinks in various nightspots, got into the car, and then headed straight into a buzz-killing hour of stand-still traffic?\n\nSuch travel woes will soon be a tale for the history books with the opening of the new Ku De Ta Bangkok. The curtains to the highly anticipated nightspot were lifted earlier this month, revealing a sprawling, 10-in-one entertainment complex within.\n\nBesides three restaurants spanning three concepts - modern Asian fine dining, Signature; casual Japanese robatayaki joint, Izakaya; and progressive Western steakhouse, Grill - the 30,000 sq ft complex further encompasses seven bars and a spacious dance floor with 10m tall ceilings to cater to Bangkok's heady swirl of pleasure-seekers.\n\n\"You can start with a drink here then head elsewhere, or stay on and have dinner at one of our restaurants before crossing over to the club or to another one of our bars if you prefer a quieter drink,\" explains managing director of Ku De Ta Bangkok Spencer Roberts - all far from the tooting horns of the infamous Bangkok jams.\n\nThough Bangkok welcomes over 22 million visitors annually, the city is still better known for its budget-friendly travel options, observes Mr Roberts, a 20-year resident of the city. This means local Thai elites, expatriates and the global jetset tend to pad around a small circuit of stiff high-end bars and fine-dining restaurants, mostly set within hotels. He elaborates: \"Even if you really like one restaurant, there is only so many times you can return to it. But with the different sections at Ku De Ta, you could come here seven days a week and have seven completely different experiences - all with stunning views mirroring what we have in Singapore.\"\n\nSimilar to its Singapore sister outlet atop the Marina Bay Sands, Ku De Ta Bangkok is perched on the 39th and 40th floors of the Sathorn Square Building in Bangkok. Glass windows all around let in 360-degree vistas of the glittering Asian metropolis by night - though far outshone, on the complex's opening evening, by the jewellery-studded arms of its high society patronage.\n\nBesides Ku De Ta, the Sathorn Square complex by Thai property developers, Golden Land, also holds a residential tower and the W Hotel Bangkok. Though no one would quite call Sathorn the throbbing heart of Bangkok's nightlife yet, the neighbourhood is gearing up for a string of high-profile openings. Ashley Sutton-designed burlesque bar Maggie Choo's opened a few streets away earlier this year, while Thailand's tallest skyscraper, the MahaNakhon, will house Dean and Deluca's Bangkok flagship, as well as the city's first Vogue Club and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon when it opens next door in 2015. There are rumblings that recently shuttered Bed Supperclub is looking to open in the area, too.\n\n\"We don't see them as competition. The new openings will create a new lifestyle buzz in what was traditionally a financial district,\" says Michael Farquhar, corporate director of food and beverage at the Ku De Ta group.\n\n\"Singapore was our first step, and Bangkok is an indication of the future,\" he adds, of the two levels designed by New York-headquartered designers, AvroKO. A balance of shiny counter tops, dark lounge chairs and wood and stone accents keep things chic, yet comfortable. Leafy water fountains, carved stone statues and decorative 200-year-old pots crafted and shipped in straight from Bali keep the connection to the brand's initial outlet, first started on Seminyak beach in 2000.\n\nKu De Ta Singapore, too, will get a facelift next year. The restaurant will have a brand new sushi counter and new furniture, while the nightclub will be completely reconfigured and accented with more Balinese touches.\n\nThough Ku De Ta's Singapore and Bangkok outlets are owned by a separate team from Ku De Ta in Bali, \"I still call the original founders of Ku De Ta Bali every two months to ask for styling ideas,\" says Mr Farquhar. A trademark infringement suit between both parties was resolved earlier this week.\n\nWhile the menu at Ku De Ta Bali's main restaurant runs the global gamut, the food at Ku De Ta Bangkok's three restaurants bear distinct Asian leanings, thanks to an operations team combed from various modern Asian dining stalwarts. Club director Justin Dunne previously managed Bangkok's Bed SupperClub, F&B director Peter Lamb has worked at Yauatcha, Hakkasan and Zuma in London and Bangkok, while Le Bernardin-trained head chef Jonathan Maza has helped to open Nobu restaurants worldwide.\n\nFlagship 120-seater restaurant Signature serves up seamless marriages of East and West such as a Japanese sea bream with miso chowder or local tiger prawns paired with an American-leaning shiitake corn succotash, while 100-seat Izakaya's affordably priced grilled seafood and meats will complement its \"relaxed, and slightly noisy, train-station vibe\", says Mr Farquhar. Cocktails muddle Asian herbs with exotic flavours such as Danish licorice, and when ready next year, 40-seat Grill will dole out premium steaks that can be served pre-sliced to facilitate Asian-style communal dining.\n\nA 15,000 sq ft Hong Kong outpost will open across the top three floors of the California Tower in Lan Kwai Fong in mid-2014 and three to five more outlets in cities in Europe, the United States and the Middle East are currently being considered, including beach destinations, reveals Mr Farquhar.\n\nWhether you're looking over a city in its latest \"trophy building\" or taking in the sunset by the sea, picture postcard-worthy views will be the running thread at Ku De Ta. Adds Mr Roberts: \"Wherever we open, we want you to look out the window and go, 'Wow!' \"\n\nAmbitious, you remark. \"Nothing wrong with a little bit of ambition,\" he retorts. \"We're here to be a game changer.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, the situation is reversing again.\n\nA weakening yen will help Mr Abe secure the economic growth needed to maintain his popularity at a time when other government policies, such as promoting Japan's entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, nuclear power policy and a controversial new official secrets Act, threaten to undermine voter support, analysts say.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

To fulfil the vision of a walkable district, Parliament Lane and the small road at Empress Place (between ACM and Victoria Theatre) will be pedestrianised permanently. This will integrate the two spaces, creating a seamless park-like setting.\n\nPart of Fullerton Road - in front of Victoria Theatre and, incidentally, part of the Formula 1 track - will also be realigned, allowing for a larger and more elegant lawn space in front of Victoria Theatre/Concert Hall and ACM.\n\nIn addition, Connaught Drive will be narrowed to one lane and limited to destination-bound traffic. Tourist coaches which currently park along Connaught Drive will be redirected to a new coach park at Marina Centre near the Marina Centre bus terminal. A new dedicated drop-off and pick-up point is planned.\n\nOther landscaping efforts, such as the planting of more trees to provide shade, better way-finding signs and upgrading of street furniture are also planned at Empress Place and Esplanade Park.\n\nIn addition, the waterfront promenade along Esplanade Park will be opened up with stepped plazas and an urban beach, allowing people to get closer to the water.\n\nVarious spaces, including Raffles Landing, will soon be equipped to host outdoor events. To facilitate this, in-built infrastructure is planned, which will allow for easier setting-up of events, pop-up structures and mobile kiosks. Night lighting will also be provided to support night activities.\n\nThese plans are part of the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) PubliCity initiative, which aims to engage the community in celebrating good public spaces and to enliven public spaces through good design and programmes.\n\nIn the longer term, URA is studying the possibility of closing Anderson Bridge, Fullerton Road, St Andrew's Road and Parliament Place to through traffic, leaving it open to destination-bound traffic, public buses and pedestrians only.\n\nOther developments being studied include the temporary closure of Anderson Bridge, Fullerton Road, St Andrew's Road, and Parliament Place to traffic during weekends or evenings for events.\n\nElsewhere on the island, other upcoming enhancement projects include an environment improvement project at Bras Basah and Bugis, which will see the carriageways on a stretch along Queen Street narrowed and the sidewalks widened. More street furniture and trees are also planned, with works expected to be completed by mid-2014.\n\nPunggol Town Square and Bedok Town Centre will introduce new public spaces in Punggol and Bedok, respectively.\n\nIn addition to creating new public spaces and rejuvenating existing ones, PubliCity wants to encourage ownership of these spaces. To this end, the public is being invited to re-imagine four public spaces.\n\nSpecifically, ideas are being sought to enliven the open space beside Gedung Kuning in Kampong Glam, which measures about 1,200 square metres (sq m), and The Lawn @ Marina Bay, which measures about 13,000 sq m, as gathering spaces for the community.\n\nThe third space comprises two plots along the Singapore River Promenade - a 2,600 sq m site beside High Street Centre and a 1,000 sq m site at Clarke Quay/River Valley Road on which part of G-Max and GX-5 are currently situated. It is intended for the latter site to be transformed into an attractive entry point to Clarke Quay.\n\nThe 2,000 sq m Woodlands Civic Plaza, which is bounded by Causeway Point, Woodlands Civic Centre and two future developments, rounds up the list. The vision for the existing plaza space is a vibrant key node. Proposals should give ideas on how it can become a better public space for a diverse range of users who use the plaza for rest and respite and as a meeting place.\n\nThe submission period is from Nov 22 to Feb 14. Up to 10 winners will each win $1,000 in cash.\n\nSeparately, URA intends to launch the Pick a Bench, Pick a Place project in February next year. The public will be invited to vote for their favourite bench designs and where they would like to see the benches installed.\n\nThe benches, which are made using seating planks from the former National Stadium, are the product of a design competition held in September last year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE norm is to blindly buy a skincare product on the strength of its advertising or word-of-mouth recommendation, going by faith and trial-and-error. But now, one new skincare brand from Paris will eliminate that uncertainty, promising to give women and men scientific diagnoses as the basis for its recommended products. \"Ioma isn't just an ingredient story,\" summarises Jean Michel Karam, the founder and chief executive officer of the brand which touts itself as offering \"smart\" skincare.\n\n\"It's completely different from what you see on the field today, and it is revolutionising how skincare is being delivered,\" he adds. Paris-based Ioma plans to expand in Asia from Singapore.\n\nThe brand is built on its diagnostic devices, based on microelectromechanical systems (Mems). Mems are complex electronic components that can detect physical phenomena such as pressure, acceleration and speed in a particular environment. How is Mems going to revolutionise the beauty industry?\n\nFirstly by imaging and probing below the skin's surface, automatically characterising the skin and recommending personalised treatment. Based on the diagnostics, a beauty regimen is recommended. The ingredients as well as the combination of products can be customised so that the customer gets bespoke skincare. There's a focus on hydration and regeneration, and the whole idea is that not one good ingredient is good for everything, but the optimised combination of ingredients, especially when they come with the highest concentration of active ingredients. \"We have close to 10,000 different combinations based on skin needs. In Ioma, our efficacy is personalisation and that's a major trend today, as you can see in luxury and medicine,\" says Mr Karam, a scientist, inventor of more than 50 high technology patents and a serial entrepreneur. He is also the founder and CEO of MEMSCAP, a public-listed company on the NYSE Euronext stock market that ranks among the top 100 driving engines of French technology.\n\nThe Ioma Sphere device measures all the parameters of the skin and characterises it into seven major imperfections - UV damage, fine lines, firmness and wrinkles, redness, sebum, oily skin, spots and pigmentation. It then gives a score from 1 to 15 (from \"perfect\" to \"caution\") and assigns a skincode. \"A newborn's skincode is theoretically 1 but with time, our skin code gets close to 15,\" he explains. \"What you'll also see is that your skin is also different on the left and right sides of your face, because it's affected by which side gets more sun as you drive, or which side you sleep on and so on. The devices also keep track of the history of the skin.\"\n\n\"What we give to the people is the ability to understand skin better. Understanding the skin is essential, and you will understand better how to deal with it. That's why we made the commitment not to launch any point-of-sale without the devices,\" he says.\n\nDiagnosis is done at no cost to the customer, and he recommends taking the diagnosis every two to three months, because our skin changes and needs new formulas. Skin regenerates every four to six weeks, depending on genes. \"So I recommend taking a diagnosis after a month of using your first Ioma product,\" he says.\n\nIoma, launched in 2010, is a game-changer in skincare, thinks Mr Karam, and seems to be recognised as such by Unilever which has taken a share in it.\n\n\"So we now have the muscle to go into Asia in a big way.\" Besides women, the male market is an important one for Ioma, especially in Asia where men take care of their skin more than other countries. Ioma's male customers in the US comprise about 30 per cent of its clients.\n\nIoma opened at Robinson's and will next open at the end of November at Isetan Jurong East, before its third location at Isetan Scotts in January. Ioma is already distributed in over 500 points of sale in France, at Saks Fifth Avenue in the United States, and at Harrods in the UK, besides hundreds of retail points across Europe. Singapore will be the brand's first foray into Asia, and from here it will expand into at least 10 other Asian countries.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 22, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY WiFi connectivity on a travel coach may not sound like a big deal, but it can make the difference between hashtagging a picture as an #instagram versus a #latergram.\n\nAnd for those who cannot relax while on holiday, they can now send emails instead of only being able to do so when they check in to the hotel.\n\nSince Nov 1, luxury land tour operator Insight Vacations has been offering free WiFi connectivity on their coaches travelling through more than 25 European countries. The service will be extended to its North American coaches from Jan 1.\n\n\"Wifi availability is a necessity for the majority of the travellers because they want to be constantly connected,\" says Sheryl Lim, Insight Vacations regional director for Asia.\n\nWiFi connectivity on the go is just one of the many ways that travel companies are tapping technology to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nPrime Touch and Feel, the online arm of Prime Travel & Tour recently launched two new online services that aim to make travelling abroad much easier.\n\nThe first is the Prime Smart Voyager, a mobile app that functions as a virtual tour guide. Maps, points of interest in a city and the travel itinerary are downloaded onto the app before leaving Singapore. The content is only made available to clients who have booked a tour with the agency, and it will only last the duration of the trip.\n\nAt the destination, a click on the agenda buttons shows the day's list of things to do, with tips on useful local phrases and suggestions on what foods to try.\n\nUsing the app's offline maps, visitors can tour the city on their own, and at each point of interest, a video will pop up explaining more about the spot. With the app, travellers no longer have to lug a physical guide book around.\n\n\"A city may have over 200 points of interest, so the visitor can pick which ones they want to visit,\" says Buck Low, chief executive of Prime Touch and Feel.\n\nThe app also comes with a \"Take Me Back\" function which allows the user to return to a pre-determined location, with directions provided.\n\nThe company introduced its Prime Dream Holiday Builder, where users can create their own holidays with a few mouse clicks. Templates to different destinations have been created, but users can tag on additional nights at a certain location if they wish, or change accommodation accordingly. The site uses real-time pricing, so users instantly know how much they will be paying.\n\n\"It can be a time-consuming process if you book a holiday in 10 different cities. So we have made it easier with this customised tour planning and booking engine,\" says Mr Low.\n\nSince their launch in August, Mr Low says about 80 people have used the Smart Voyager and about 150 people have \"fiddled\" with the Dream Holiday Builder.\n\nHe notes that there has been an increase in the number of people who book their holidays online, compared to going to a travel agent, and that number will rise. \"We want to have a head start by offering these two services,\" he says.\n\nAlso jumping on the technology bandwagon is Singapore Attractions Express (SAEx) which launched its Virtual Tour Guide System (VTGS) earlier this week. SAEx is the largest network of express bus services that connects major attractions in Singapore.\n\nThe VTGS can be found on the company's buses, and uses GPS to trigger pre-recorded videos at certain locations. For example, when it passes by Chinatown, a short video clip of the area will be played. Bus Hub managing director V Anilan says the system works as a tour guide's assistant. \"It does not replace the tour guide,\" he adds. Bus Hub operates SAEx.\n\nMr Anilan adds VTGS works well for tourists on unguided bus tours, and can be implemented in rental cars as well.\n\nOnline travel agency Zuji which has been operating since 2002, recently relaunched its website, but the changes are more than just about aesthetics. New features on the site include a live chat function where users can easily talk to the customer service officers. Chua Hui Wan, Zuji Singapore's CEO says that these features are important to have as online travel agencies often lack the \"people factor that traditional travel agents offer\". Traffic to the website peaks at night, so instead of having customer support service from the previous 8am to 8pm duration, Zuji will now offer 24/7 support.\n\nTravel partners who have already been offering services online are not resting on their laurels.\n\nAndreas Behrens, TripAdvisor's director of mobile partnerships APAC says that more than one-third of traffic to the site comes from a tablet or smartphone device. \"Travel is an inherently on-the-go experience, and we want people to get the most out of our resources on any device, anywhere. Over 69 million people have installed our various apps, and we see that travellers are using them not only for planning but during their trips.\" Some of the features in its newly designed tablet app include the ability to see everything surrounding a specific point of interest and new city pages to explore all the best things to do.\n\nDesign Hotels is also relaunching a new look for its website. Instead of merely listing hotels and booking options, the new site will include \"not to miss\" events in destinations, insider information from hoteliers and local heroes, and an easier booking process.\n\nTechnology may be changing the way people travel, but travel agents have ways to keep up with the competition.\n\nThe majority of people who go to travel agents are still looking for package tours. Jane Chang, Chan Brothers Travel's marketing communications manager says, \"package tours will never be the sunset industry\".\n\nShe adds that travel agencies are better connected, possess a wealth of knowledge that customers might attain only a fraction of, even if they spend weeks combing and researching the Internet, offer time-tested itineraries and provide 24-hour overseas emergency assistance.\"\n\n\"We keep packages interesting so that people will be drawn to them and always bring new experiences to customers,\" she says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the week, the index lost 29 points or 0.9 per cent.\n\nDearth of liquidity has been a major problem for several weeks now and yesterday was no exception with a feeble 1.2 billion units worth $772 million being traded. Excluding warrants, there were 185 rises versus 188 falls.\n\nRetail brokers reported little or no interest from their clients, in blue chips or penny stocks. \"It's deathly quiet in our dealing room,\" said one trading representative. \"This is the worst the market's been in many years.\"\n\nStill, there were a few bright spots. Keppel Corp, for example, has been strong lately and gained 5 cents at $11.16 yesterday with 3.5 million traded.\n\nKeppel is JP Morgan's (JPM's) best \"overweight\" pick for 2014 because of strong order momentum, better margins and orders from its new Mexico yard.\n\n\"Our Dec 2014 target of $13.30 is based on a sum-of-the-parts, which uses discounted cash flow to value the rig-building business, 12x earnings for ship repair, property at nett asset value, Keppel Land at our price target and infrastructure at 1.5x book,\" said JPM.\n\nCIMB set an identical price target and recommended clients buy ahead of Keppel's gathering order momentum.\n\n\"The stock could potentially trade up to +1 standard deviation above its 5-year mean of 18x P/E (price/earnings) or 3.3x P/BV (price/book value) if its order momentum reverts to its 2005-07 levels of $7 billion per annum in our view,\" said CIMB.\n\nElsewhere, Golden Agri Resources (GAR) yesterday added half a cent at 58.5 cents with 24.7 million traded. OCBC Investment Research, however, yesterday noted GAR's disappointing results but conceded that as the market appears to be taking on a more \"risk on\" approach, a higher valuation is perhaps justified. Even so, this only results in GAR's fair value rising from 46.5 cents to 50 cents, which means the broker is maintaining its \"sell\" rating.\n\nOne main reason for the market's current paralysis is an outflow of liquidity due to worries over when the US Federal Reserve will start tapering its US$85 billion per month asset purchases. Most observers expect this to start in March next year.\n\nOn Thursday, the president of the Richmond Fed, Jeffrey Lacker, said it would be appropriate for the Fed to start scaling back its asset purchases between December and March.\n\nIn response, Rabobank said that while Mr Lacker is known as a hawk and is currently a non-voting member of the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), his statement adds to the theme of Wednesday's FOMC minutes that while the timing of tapering remains uncertain, it is certainly on its way.\n\nDBS Group Research, however, is sceptical of the benefits of QE, stating in its Wednesday Daily Breakfast Spread that QE hasn't been very \"explosive\" to begin with.\n\n\"It hasn't kicked up demand growth and, therefore, it hasn't kicked up inflation,\" said DBS. \"Consumption growth has been falling for three years and is now at a 3.5 year low. Business investment growth has averaged 0.6 per cent ... over the past three quarters - practically zero ... One can only conclude that QE hasn't done much good, nor much harm. It hasn't done much of anything.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They will add 26 new gates and expand cargo storage at the airport.\n\nCCR and partners Flughafen Zuerich AG and Flughafen Munchen will add a new terminal and landing strip at Confins airport on the outskirts of Belo Horizonte - Brazil's third-biggest metropolitan area, with over five million residents.\n\nAirports have been the most appealing part of President Dilma Rousseff's plan to privatise some 200 billion reais of infrastructure projects, breathing new life into Brazil's clogged roads and ports.\n\nThe latest concessions follow a hotly contested auction in February 2012 that awarded rights to major airports in Sao Paulo and Brasilia for 24.5 billion reais.

This, especially when today's advantaged feedstock, like shale, becomes commonplace or more costly in future.\n\nWith the feedstock landscape always shifting - due to trends and innovations not just in petrochemicals, but in the upstream and refining sectors - chemical companies like ExxonMobil will require sustained innovation in feedstock, manufacturing processes and products if they want to build competitive advantage, he stressed.\n\nCiting an example, he said ExxonMobil's Rotterdam aromatics plant has been designed to get feedstock from nine of its refineries and chemical plants, with the pooling of feedstock supply and advanced technology enabling the facility to become the largest and most profitable there.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You have the money, you buy the real estate, you Reit it, you exit,\" she said in a recent interview. \"We have not seen this done in Asia before. There's a market for it.\"\n\nPlans for the funds come as cross-border property transactions in the Asia-Pacific region climbed 5.5 per cent in the third quarter to US$5.2 billion, according to CBRE Research.\n\nCommercial real estate transactions in the region rose 11 per cent to US$21.6 billion from the June quarter, the property brokerage said.\n\nReits have raised US$2.7 billion through initial public offerings in Singapore, about a third of all Reit IPOs in the Asia-Pacific this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMapletree Greater China Commercial Trust, which raised US$1.4 billion in its February IPO, was the second-biggest fundraiser in the Asia-Pacific this year after the Nomura Reit in Japan.\n\nMeanwhile, Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman is stepping up real estate investment in Asia, tapping the market for US$4 billion for Blackstone's maiden property fund focused on the region. Blackstone, which has been among the biggest buyers of property in Australia and India, is seeking more investment in China as rising income and urbanisation drive demand.\n\nUnder the agreement with ARA, Singapore-based Straits Trading will buy a 20.1 per cent stake in the trust manager for $294.4 million in cash and shares from Mr Li's Cheung Kong Investment Co and Mr Lim. The transaction will make Straits Trading the biggest shareholder of ARA.\n\nThe Blackstone-style funds will be created through the new company formed with Mr Lim, and the venture will have capital commitment of as much as $950 million, according to the announcement last month.\n\nStraits Trading, a landlord in Singapore's financial district, has real estate assets worth $830 million, Ms Chew said.\n\n\"The key will be on execution,\" Terence Khi at UOB Kay Hian Pte said. \"ARA's focus is shifting away from launching new Reits towards private funds due to the impact of tapering and increased competition.\"\n\nThe creation of new Reits comes as the number of retirees increases in the region, boosting demand for investments that offer a stable dividend.\n\nThe number of people who will exceed 60 years old will reach 463.1 million by 2017, up from 391.3 million last year, according to data compiled by Ageing Asia Pte.\n\n\"Logically, there should be a demand for Reits in Asia,\" Ms Chew said. \"We have an ageing population and Reits are a very steady form of income.\"\n\nThe joint venture is still deciding on where the new properties will be located. Other than Singapore, the funds may seek investments in properties in Europe, Malaysia and Australia, Ms Chew said.\n\nUnder the agreement with ARA, Straits Trading's investment property portfolio will be managed as a separate account, according to the statement.\n\nStraits Trading shares have fallen 2.7 per cent this year, compared with the 8 per cent slump in the measure tracking property stocks in Singapore.\n\nThe company had cash proceeds of $508.8 million after accepting United Engineers Ltd's higher offer for its 44.58 per cent stake in WBL Corp, giving Straits Trading more access to capital for its property funds.\n\n\"What we're trying to do is create a whole ecosystem and a platform for monetizing real estate,\" Ms Chew said. \"The environment is in our favour.\" Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price in debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nJane Street deposits US$567 million so it can resume India trading\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:48 PM\n\nBank of Japan is said likely to consider raising inflation forecast\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM", "images": []}

She will step down at year-end, but filling her shoes is such a gargantuan task that two people will take over her portfolio.\n\nMs Yeo, 64, will retire when the new year arrives, but will retain a role as special adviser to SGX. Replacing her as chief regulatory officer will be current deputy chief regulatory officer Richard Teng. The chief risk officer hat will be donned by Agnes Koh, who is currently head of clearing risk. Like Ms Yeo, Mr Teng and Ms Koh held positions at the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) before joining SGX.\n\n\"Lian Sim has built SGX's risk management and regulatory function into a well-respected, professional organisation with a worldwide reputation for expertise and execution,\" SGX chief executive Magnus Bocker said in a statement yesterday.\n\n\"She has been tireless in her pursuit of regulating a fair, orderly and transparent marketplace. We thank her for her invaluable contribution and send with her our very best wishes for a long and happy retirement.\"\n\nMs Yeo joined the exchange in July 2004 after an illustrious career at MAS and Temasek Holdings. She replaced Alan Shaw, who was one of the architects behind SGX's migration towards a disclosure-based regime.\n\nMs Yeo's legacy includes the creation of the sponsor-supervised regime for the Catalist board, as well as leading SGX to become one of the first exchanges in the world to meet post-global financial crisis international standards on clearing and risk management for exchanges.\n\nNotably, she helped to steer the exchange through the global financial crisis. SGX's ability to quickly resolve and clear the debris from MF Global's 2011 collapse has drawn praise.\n\nSome of her views have evolved over time. For the first several years of her time at SGX, she had resisted calls for circuit breakers in the market, arguing that the existing mechanisms were enough.\n\nBut as markets have become more complex, and with the possibility of high-frequency trading on the horizon, SGX is now laying some of the final pieces for a circuit-breaker system.\n\nOn her watch, SGX has also had to grapple with a number of corporate governance lapses among China-based companies that have tested the limits of the exchange's powers.\n\nMs Yeo sought to find a delicate balance as a regulator, saying in 2007 that \"intervention with a heavy hand does not add to effective regulation\".\n\nBut she has also been acutely aware of the importance of enforcement, through which regulators try to translate their ideals into reality.\n\n\"This is where regulators come in, to put flesh on the bones,\" she had said in 2007.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The first is the Prime Smart Voyager, an app that allows clients who have booked tours with them to download maps and points of interest for their destinations. This eliminates the need to lug around guide books. The second offering is the Dream Holiday Builder, which allows users to customise their holidays.\n\nThe site caters to those who don't want to join a package tour, but takes the hassle out of booking free and easy tours which can be a time-consuming task. Templates are created, and users can adjust the number of nights in each city and the type of accommodation.\n\nSingapore Attractions Express\n\nThe largest network of express bus services connecting major attractions in Singapore launched its Virtual Tour Guide system earlier this week. The system is installed in its buses, and uses GPS technology. Upon reaching specific locations, a video will play, providing visitors with information on the location.\n\nInsight Vacations\n\nThe luxury land tour operator is believed to be the only travel company that offers free WiFi connectivity on its buses. The service was started this month for its European tours, and will be extended to its North American coaches from next year\n\nW Hotels\n\nThe chain of hotels not only pride themselves on cool design but hip music choices too. The W app not only allows users to book W Hotels worldwide, but also features an integrated music platform with exclusive content, a first for the hotel industry.\n\nW's Global Music Director, Michaelangelo L'Acqua, acts as the brand's ambassador for what is new and next in music, by curating music for the app.\n\nDynasty Travel\n\niDynasty, a comprehensive mobile travel booking application, the first to be launched by a local travel agency. The app contains travel deals so users can book holidays from their mobile phones. They can also redeem travel rewards such as dining vouchers through the app. The app also provides information such as emergency numbers and visa requirements for different destinations.\n\nZuji\n\nA revamped website, which now includes 24/7 customer support service, and a live chat function that will be introduced in the next few weeks. The online travel agent also has a Zuji ArrivalGuides app, which users can download information from, for over 420 cities. Zuji hopes that with the app, people will be enticed to visit countries they were not considering before. A button also links the app to the site for bookings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/more-buyers-more-galleries", "site_title": "More buyers, more galleries", "publish_date": null, "content": "More buyers, more galleries\n\nWith local art lovers snapping up pieces in greater numbers, even high-end dealers are jumping onboard AAF. HELMI YUSOF reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 21, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF AFFORDABLE Art Fair statistics are right, Singaporeans are the hungriest art buyers in the world - at least for lower- end art.\n\nThe fair, which takes place in 15 cities, found that 1 out of 2.5 visitors to the Singapore fair buys a piece of art. That ratio is the highest in the world - the second highest being its London fair figure, where 1 out of 4 visitors buys an artwork.\n\nAAF Singapore, which sells art priced from $100 to $10,000, has grown substantially since its humble beginnings in 2010. Then, there were 50 galleries; this year, there are 95. The fair also expects to hit $4.5 million in sales this year - up from 2010's $1.75 million, 2011's $3 million and 2012's $4 million.\n\nAAF director of development and global partnerships Paul Matthews says: \"In some countries, the concept of the Affordable Art Fair had been a little slow to take off. In Singapore, it took off almost instantly. People here just got it, and wanted to buy art.\"\n\nNext year, AAF Singapore is expanding to hold two fairs - one in May and the other in November. According to fair director Camilla Hewitson, AAF has compared its data across the board, taking into account local differentiators, and found the expansion viable.\n\nIndeed, there are only two other cities where Affordable Art Fairs holds two fairs annually at the same venue: London and New York, the art epicentres of the world.\n\nAnd though most art observers would agree that Singapore's art scene cannot compare with that of London or New York, its low-end art consumption certainly rivals theirs.\n\n\"There's definitely a great hunger for art here, and people do have some money,\" says Mr Matthews. \"But the other thing to note is that Singapore is tremendously multicultural; our gallerists are constantly telling us how they've sold works by the same artist to buyers as diverse as French, Malaysian, South American and, of course, Singaporean. It's very heterogeneous - unlike in some places.\"\n\nTypical of AAF Singapore, though, most of the artworks tend to be brightly coloured and decorative - perhaps even more so in this year's edition than the last. One has to walk through a lot of pleasant-looking figurative works before finding the strong statement pieces that challenge perspectives. Bold, conceptual works and good abstract pieces are rare.\n\nMs Hewitson says: \"We do advise our gallerists on what might work better in this market. Paintings and photography do well here. Large-scale works that measure, say, 2m by 2m are not likely to be bought because of the apartment sizes here. There's not a lot of sculptures - but there are some galleries bringing that in this year to test the market. And there are very few conceptual works.\"\n\nForging new relationships\n\nTwo surprising additions to this year's gallery list are Mizuma Gallery and Space Cottonseed - two galleries from the high-end gallery cluster Gillman Barracks. Opened last September, Gillman Barracks has unfortunately seen low footfall and weak sales, prompting the two galleries to participate in AAF Singapore.\n\nSpace Cottonseed owner Janice Kim says: \"I came here because I want to meet more art buyers and forge new relationships... I was here last year, and the place was very much active and alive, compared to Gillman Barracks which is sort of quiet. . . . Of course, I had to select artworks that are priced below the $10,000 cap, so I've included some of my good artists, but choosing their works that are lower- priced.\"\n\nMr Matthews says there were initially eight galleries from Gillman Barracks that wanted to take part in AAF. But at the last minute, six got \"cold feet\" - presumably because they brand themselves higher on the art- buying spectrum than AAF.\n\n\"Still, we're proud we have another part of the market we haven't had at the fair before,\" says Mr Matthews. This year, the fair expects to attract 17,000 visitors - up from last year's 16,000.\n\nOther galleries making their debut this year include London-based Manifold Editions and online store Eyestorm. They sell limited-edition prints by top and emerging artists respectively.\n\nManifold Editions has brought prints by art giants like Marc Quinn, Chris Ofili, Damien Hirst and Anish Kapoor, all under $10,000. Among the good buys may be its Quinn prints of his sculpture of Kate Moss in a yoga pose, retailing at $2,750, as well as Hirst's dot paintings going for $4,200 to $9,500. Meanwhile, Eyestorm has brought works by its bestselling emerging artists, including Jacky Tsai, Noma Barr and Lucie Bennett.\n\nInvesting in the future\n\nAAF's sterling numbers have not just attracted the higher-end galleries. DBS Bank, which brands itself as \"the people's bank\", has also jumped onboard to be the lead sponsor of the event for the first time.\n\nKoh Kar Siong, regional head of DBS Treasures and Treasures Private Client, says: \"In recent years, we have seen an increasing interest in the arts and culture among our clients. As part of DBS's commitment to be a leading wealth manager in Asia, we are always looking for unique sponsorship platforms that aim to engage, enrich and educate.\"\n\nAnd while, arguably, very little art found in AAF would count as \"investment art\" (that is, art that is likely to appreciate in value), AAF has been generous in investing in its collectors and the future stars of art. It continues to feature various talks on collecting, as well as a booth for the Young Talent Programmes, featuring promising young Singaporean artists including Hilmi Johandi and Lennard Ong.\n\nSays Mr Matthews: \"Some 30 per cent of the buyers at all our fairs are first-time buyers - in that they've never bought a single art piece in their lives. We're not competing with the higher-end Art Stage; we just want to create a friendly environment where people don't feel intimidated by art.\"\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nThe Affordable Art Fair is now on till Sunday, at the F1 Pit Building.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And was it to a parent, a partner, or perhaps a pet?\n\nBecause there are so many different types of love, with very different ways to express each of them, SingTheatre plans to delve into the theme of love, and its multiple layers with its latest production.\n\nThe show is titled A French Kiss in Singapore, and it is a musical revue that includes dance, music and sketches, all revolving around the music of four of the biggest names in French music - Charles Aznavour, Serge Gainsbourg, Jacques Brel and Charles Trenet. It will run from next week till Dec 7 at the drama theatre of the School of the Arts.\n\n\"When these French writers write songs, every song tells a story. And they write it from observing daily life. So if they write about love, it's not just about romantic love. It could be love between a son and his dying mother, it could be love of a soldier thinking about home,\" explains director and choreographer George Chan, who is one of the four actors in the all-male cast.\n\nAdds his co-star, local theatre veteran Hossan Leong: \"Also, I think we're realising while singing and rehearsing these songs, that it's not your Lady Gaga style of repeat, repeat. Oh my goodness, every verse is different, every refrain has a different lyric. So there's no repeat, no going back to chorus.\"\n\nTaking the stage also in this production are acclaimed local actor Robin Goh, and Australian actor Linden Furnell, who earlier this year starred in Pangdemonium's hit musical Next To Normal. Between them, they will be singing 23 songs, but only two and a half (the cast declined to reveal the \"half\" song; preferring to keep it a surprise for the audience) will be in French.\n\nAnd though the names of these French singers may sound foreign at first, the English titles of their songs will probably ring a few bells. For example, Trenet's song La Mer (The Sea) is actually the Bobby Darin classic Beyond The Sea.\n\nAlso, in 1961, Belgian singer-songwriter Brel wrote Le Moribond (The Dying Man), which was later translated and became an English pop hit Seasons in the Sun. It was first made famous by Canadian singer Terry Jacks in the seventies before Irish boyband Westlife remade it over two decades later.\n\n\"A lot of these songs, when we sing them, they are in English; so we are all singing them without realising they were originally written in French ... We want to reach out to the Singaporean community especially to those who don't speak French, and tell them, 'hey, French culture is not just about baguettes, berets and red wine, there's a lot more than that,\" Leong chuckles.\n\nA French Kiss in Singapore runs from Nov 27 to Dec 7, at the Sota Drama Theatre at 8pm from Tues to Sun, with an additional 4pm matinee on weekends.

Such workers enjoyed an average wage increase of 3.1 per cent in the year they were trained, reinforcing the belief that training enhances low-wage workers' productivity levels, which in turn results in higher pay.\n\nIn its study of 6,000 Singaporean low-wage workers tracked over three years from 2007 to 2009, MTI found that this \"positive causal return\" to training occurred on top of year-to-year increments that other workers who did not participate in training experienced.\n\n\"As such, the results provide evidence of positive returns to training, and re-affirm the importance of skills upgrading for low-wage workers,\" said MTI economist Lee Zen Wea, who authored the study.\n\nEven after restricting the sample to workers with no formal education, the returns to training still remained positive and statistically significant - albeit lower at 2.4 per cent - indicating that less-educated workers stand to benefit from structured training as well.\n\nThe study showed that workers with little or no formal education and those in less-skilled occupations - such as cleaners and labourers - were less likely to participate in training.\n\n\"(The results) suggest that among low-wage workers, access to training opportunities can vary . . . Policymakers may thus wish to focus their attention on these groups of low-wage workers,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nThe study also found that workers with union memberships were 12 per cent more likely to attend training than their non-unionised peers. This could be because unionised industries are likely to have roles that are more structured, and therefore have specific training courses catered to them.\n\nUnions may also increase the bargaining power of low-wage workers, institutionalise training plans for them and raise the awareness of training opportunities among its members. \"As such, more efforts to reach out to non-unionised low-wage workers to encourage them to participate in training can also be explored,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nHe believes that there is scope for more research to assess the types of training that would benefit low-wage workers the most, and studies that examine such workers' post-training wage profile over a longer time period.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A clutch are also spinning off fast-food concepts to reach out to a wider audience.\n\nAshikin Raja of Frootkeyk, a baking collective that churns out healthy cakes using organic ingredients such as raw food, rice milk and superfoods like chia seeds and spirulina, has noticed a significant turn in their 11 months of operations.\n\n\"More parents are asking to customise their children's birthday cakes to include healthier or organic food, and we get requests for gluten-free bakes from people who don't suffer from coeliac disease,\" she adds.\n\nInstead of riding on the current food fad, young entrepreneurs Agnetta Lew, 23, and fiance Gabriel Lee, 24, decided to eschew opening yet another cupcake shop for a more challenging alternative: in July, they opened Singapore's first entirely gluten-free bakery, Jonathan's, to cater to what they feel is a gap in the market.\n\nMs Lew, whose younger brother Jonathan has Down's Syndrome and is on a gluten-free diet, says she started the cafe to offer special needs children and those with severe allergies a place where \"like other kids, they too can order anything and everything on the menu\".\n\nUnless personally afflicted with a food allergy, says Ms Lew, most chefs don't realise the severity of such health conditions, and the need to strictly control cross-contamination, says Ms Lew, hence her decision to go fully gluten-free, despite the very niche target market. \"The upside of having a customer base with specific needs also means that you tend to get more loyal customers, and better word-of-mouth marketing within that community,\" adds her business partner, Mr Lee.\n\nSimilarly, consultant chef Tim Ross-Watson, who is gluten-intolerant, worked in a 55 per cent gluten-free menu at Gusto when the Italian restaurant at Ion Orchard approached him to reboot their menu. His business partner, Audrey Yeong, who runs food consultancy, Apple Order, and is on a voluntary Paleo diet - an eating regime that eliminates all processed forms of sugar on certain days of the week - attributes the growing demand for allergen-free dining to the proliferation of fitness and fad diets.\n\nAllergy sufferers, for instance, may not realise they have existing allergies until they go on a fitness regime that requires the elimination of specific food groups, and then notice a significant improvement in their health. They may then decide to get tested, and identify pre-existing allergies. \"And when they start to see results through eating better, they won't want to go back to their regular eating habits,\" she says.\n\n\"People are awakening to the fact that pharmaceutical drugs are just suppressing the symptoms rather than treating the problem - and they usually come with side effects,\" observes Ashley Heather of the Living Cafe and Deli in Bukit Timah. Rather than try to suppress the growing appetite for fast food given in an increasingly time-starved society, businesses such as his have decided to adjust their concepts to keep up with the shift towards convenience food.\n\nLast month, the cafe rebranded itself as the Living Cafe and Deli to better spotlight its retail section and expanded menu of grab-and-go items such as healthy sandwiches, salads, wraps and dehydrated crackers. \"It used to be a given that fast food was unhealthy, processed food, but these days, people want fast food that is also healthy. We are evolving with the dynamic,\" Mr Heather adds, citing the global boom in raw food express outlets.\n\nVegan burger joint, Greenzilla, likewise, expanded from a stall in a Jurong East coffeeshop to a four-seat, largely takeaway kiosk in The Star Vista mall in September, while SuperNature recently relocated from its Park House to a more visible space in Forum the Shopping Mall to boost its walk-in traffic. It set aside a prominent corner in the store for a new takeaway concept, the SuperNature To-Go Cafe.\n\nThe ready meals help to dispel the common perception among sceptics that healthier food is less tasty and offers poorer value for money, according to its spokesman. \"Ready-made food allows customers to taste the organic produce available in our store, and we believe that tasting is believing. When customers sample our food, they can truly taste the freshness and difference that organic produce offers.\" If the takeaway counter is well-received, the corner may eventually be expanded into a full-fledged, sit-down cafe.\n\nTo keep prices down, the store's buyers also source free-range and natural products from countries around the region such as Taiwan and Thailand, rather than limit themselves to products from Europe and the United States, which tend to have higher import costs.\n\nBut business owners such as Frootkeyk's Ms Raja also believe critical change comes about not just from boosting the number of speciality health food restaurants in Singapore, but in getting more regular food outlets to offer healthier alternatives too.\n\n\"As it is, we see bubble tea shops allowing for sugar level choice and hawker stalls promoting healthier options,\" she adds.\n\nStill, there's a stickier challenge that plagues not just health food eateries, but every F&B business in Singapore: the issue of simply surviving in an increasingly competitive environment. According to the latest statistics, a total of 537 restaurants closed in Singapore last year.\n\nCiting high rents and tightened foreign labour laws, Living Cafe and Deli's Mr Heather rules out further expansion in Singapore, citing instead opportunities in neighbouring cities such as Jakarta, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur instead.\n\n\"Running an F&B outlet in Singapore is just too hard,\" he says.\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And the designers behind both companies had travelled to Paris, part of a nine-brand contingent, thanks to the taxpayers of Singapore.\n\nFor the last three years, the Textile & Fashion Federation (Singapore), a non-profit trade body, has been aggressively promoting fashion and design in the city-state by sending designers and their wares to industry trade shows and organising special promotional events of their own.\n\n\"If it were not for Singapore, I would not be here,\" said Georgine Ratelband, 24, whose Georgine label is incorporated in Singapore but who maintains a design studio in New York.\n\nThe contingent included jewellery designers showing at the Premi\u00e8re Classe tent in the Jardin des Tuileries. Jeweller Yuki Mitsuyasu, who trained at Central Saint Martins and is from Singapore, showed a visitor a necklace that flowed through her fingers like a stream, which she said was her inspiration for the piece. And bold, Jackson Pollock-inspired rings were displayed by Carolyn Kan, winner of the 2010 Elle jewellery designer of the year award in Singapore.\n\nThe federation underwrites designers' travel expenses and show fees with a grant from a programme operated by International Enterprise Singapore, a governmental agency promoting overseas business.\n\nCallia Chua, the federation's group director, said the first group was sent to a Paris event in 2010 and, since then, others have attended trade shows such as the Expo Riva Schuh, a footwear show at Lake Garda in Italy.\n\nFrank Bober, founder and chief executive of the online trend forecaster Stylesight, says such international exposure is a good idea. \"There is not much awareness of Singapore designers on the world stage, but everyone has to start somewhere,\" he said. \"It's nice to hear that there is support for the Singapore industry.\"\n\nA key port in centuries past, and particularly favoured by ships that could not travel between India and China without a stop, Singapore today is the second-largest hub for textile and apparel business and sourcing in the Asia-Pacific region, following Hong Kong, Ms Chua said. The total apparel trade is valued at S$4.4 billion, or US$3.5 billion, a year.\n\nFashion is a relatively recent addition.\n\n\"The fashion industry has evolved from a manufacturing-based industry sometime in the 1980s, and continues to be an integral part of our economic landscape,\" Ms Chua said.\n\nGovernmental support for fashion expansion is not unique to Singapore.\n\nFor example, the Korea Fashion Association, an organisation introduced by the South Korean government in 1985 to promote fashion, has organised a variety of international showcases, and has been credited with introducing labels such as Ugiz and Culture Call.\n\nSome industry specialists say such programmes are good but could be better focused on the designers rather than the country or government.\n\n\"Financial support from governments to show collections overseas always benefits designers,\" said Fern Mallis, an industry consultant and the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. \"But when a group of designers are promoted under a banner like 'Singapore Designer', no designer name recognition is registered. It would be better if these government initiatives promoted the designer with a small credit.\n\n\"For example: 'With support from the Singapore Fashion Federation'. Then the fashion industry would be responding to a specific designer and not a group show.\"\n\nOne of the recent Singapore-organised trips was to South Korea, where the designers participated in a group show during Seoul Fashion Week and stocked a pop-up store at the Galleria department store in the capital.\n\n\"Koreans are now hungry for something fresh,\" said Ms Kan, who also went on this trip. \"It was a success in terms of sales and awareness, with local TV and international magazines.\"\n\nShe said her company, Carrie K, received orders from Cara & Co, a concept store in Sydney, as well as interest from buyers from South Korea, Europe and the Middle East.\n\nShe also was surprised by Instagram fans. \"They found out that I was here.\"\n\nAnother beneficiary was Rayson Tan, the designer behind the lifestyle and fashion brand L'ile Aux Ashby. \"I made new contacts, took orders and got good international awareness,\" said Mr Tan, whose clients include Taiwan pop star Jolin Tsai.\n\nMs Kan said the Singapore federation helped find people in Seoul to produce the runway show, including getting sponsorships for the hair and makeup services; initiated and managed the pop-up store at the Galleria; and set up a private showroom and marketing for the designers.\n\nDesigners who want to qualify for funding must be incorporated or registered and based in Singapore, Ms Chua said. In addition, their businesses must complete three of six operations in the city-state, including such categories as market development and planning; manufacturing and other activities; logistics and shipping management.\n\nThe programmes, which have included 36 designers or brands in five shows this year, are growing in popularity.\n\n\"Last year, there was a lot more interest,\" Doreen Tan, the federation's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. \"Designers realised that they get both publicity and confirmed orders.\"\n\nBuyers also have kind words for such programmes.\n\n\"Our main goal is to search for new talent,\" said Averyl Oates, fashion director for the department stores division of the Groupe Galeries Lafayette, in Paris. \"This is not easy when buyers do not travel as much due to travel and budget constraints.\n\n\"Supporting and investing in Singaporean or any foreign designer is beneficial for all parties, both to help emerging and young designers establish themselves in a very competitive environment, as well as in creating and incubating global talent, across luxury and couture, with well-known designers such as Andrew Gn to more mass market contemporary names, such as All Dressed Up,\" Ms Oates said, referring to two Singapore labels.\n\n\"Most young designers do not have the funds, distribution support, or know-how to establish themselves abroad, which Singapore could help with if they took a stand at foreign trade shows.\"\n\nThe next fashion mission is planned for February, when designers will travel to the women's ready-to-wear trade show Coterie, in New York.\n\nHeliopolis, an accessories business founded in Singapore in 1990, plans to introduce its Sunset Glam collection at the event.

These were lowered to 0-1 per cent and 2-3 per cent respectively in August.\n\nSticking to the 0-1 per cent growth forecast will mean an average growth rate of 33.5 to 40 per cent in the final two months of the year, UOB Bank economist Francis Tan estimated, which is highly unlikely.\n\nUOB reckoned that NODX was more likely to slip 3 per cent this year, which Mr Tan felt was still on the optimistic side because it suggested an average 14 per cent year-on-year rise in November-December.\n\nDespite the downward adjustments in the full-year trade numbers, the government trade promotion agency said yesterday that it expected both NODX and total trade to grow 1-3 per cent next year, in line with stronger global economic growth.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the global economy will grow 3.6 per cent next year, up from 2.9 per cent in 2013.\n\nIE Singapore is mindful that uncertainties remain in 2014. It pointed out that the eurozone recovery is likely to be weak while US economic growth will be moderate.\n\nMost Asian economies are projected to grow slightly faster, but China looks like it will grow slower than in 2013.\n\nThe latest revised forecasts came after NODX and total trade fell 7.1 and 1.8 per cent respectively in the first nine months of the year. But the year-on-year contraction in total trade in Q2 - it fell 2 per cent - has swung to 6 per cent growth in Q3.\n\n\"The level of total trade reached $254 billion in Q3, higher than the previous quarter's $246 billion,\" IE Singapore said.\n\nNODX's on-year quarterly decline has also started to ease, pointing to a pick-up in the last quarter of this year.\n\nNODX fell 3.3 per cent year-on-year in Q3, after tumbling 5.2 per cent in Q2 - as a result of lower shipments in both electronic and non-electronic NODX.\n\nShipments to all of Singapore's major markets fell in Q3, except China, the United States, Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nThe biggest contributors to NODX's decline in Q3 were the European Union (-29.1 per cent), South Korea (-33.4 per cent) and Taiwan (-13.3 per cent), said IE Singapore.\n\nElectronic NODX fell 8.7 per cent in Q3, a smaller fall than the 11.5 per cent decline in Q2. Domestic shipments of integrated circuits, parts of PCs and disk media products continued to drop.\n\nLed by lower domestic exports of pharmaceuticals, specialised machinery and aromatic chemicals, non-electronic NODX dipped 0.6 per cent. It fell by a larger 1.9 per cent in Q2.\n\nLooking at October's NODX, which posted year-on-year growth of 2.8 per cent, the first positive reading since January, Barclay's Joey Chew concluded: \"It (NODX) has emerged from a long slumber.\"\n\nBut CIMB's Song Seng Wun felt that it was too early to say that a decisive turnaround had taken place.\n\nStill, most private sector economists have become more upbeat, predicting that full-year economic growth would exceed 3.5 per cent.\n\nNon-oil re-exports (NORX), the only bright spot among the gloomy trade numbers so far, jumped 7.6 per cent in the January-September period.\n\nThanks to the rise in both electronic and non-electronic re-exports, NORX jumped 11.7 per cent in Q3, after a 12.2 per cent increase in Q2.\n\nApart from Indonesia, NORX to the rest of the major markets rose in Q3. The three biggest contributors to the increase were China (31.5 per cent), South Korea (53.9 per cent) and the US (30.3 per cent).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So you still need to top up at night by buying from the grid at full rate. But current regulations make that a very difficult proposition.\"\n\nThe Energy Market Authority (EMA) has announced various measures to promote the use of intermittent energy sources, such as nearly doubling the cap for power generation from such sources to 600 MW from 350 MW. Last month, S Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, launched a consultation paper on proposed changes to rules governing such sources.\n\nThese and other measures are expected to help enable renewable energy sources (without the aid of government subsidies) meet 8 per cent of Singapore's electricity needs by 2025, up from less than one per cent now. This, in turn, will support its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to between 7 and 11 per cent below business as usual (BAU) levels by 2020.\n\n\"The SEAS White Paper is based in part on discussions with EMA,\" said Mr Inglin. \"Until recently, most renewable energy is not commercially viable without subsidies. So government said we will testbed you. Now the key message is you don't need the subsidy because you can compete with conventional electricity (sources). All we need now is a level playing field and fair access to the grid.\"\n\nDispelling perceptions that renewable energy is expensive, SEAS chairman Edwin Khew noted that solar prices have \"gone below grid parity\" in the past two years due to raw material cost reductions. The levelised cost of energy (or the cost per unit of electricity) for solar photovoltaics (PV) electricity is about 15 cents per kilowatt hour, and that of biomass is 19 cents per kilowatt hour, while current retail electricity tariffs are about 26 cents per kilowatt hour.\n\nThe ability to unlock up to $4 billion worth of potential investment from the private sector will depend on the removal of regulatory, commercial and technical barriers to adoption of such sources, Mr Inglin said.\n\nWhile there are restrictions on feeding renewable energy directly into the grid, EMA is looking at simplifying grid connections for small (1-10 MW) renewable energy plants, and allowing large commercial customers to sell excess green energy to the grid, he said.\n\nSingapore is behind the curve in terms of dealing with its waste, said Stephen Peters, director of environmental consultancy Stratcon Singapore. \"Incineration was great 30 years ago, but we've moved on a bit in terms of technology. You can make biogas from putrescible waste such as food waste, biomass energy from garden clippings and horticultural waste timber, and generate electricity from combustible waste like textiles and plastics.\"\n\nOne of the problems is that waste in Singapore is not segregated, he said. \"Hawker centres have the capacity to use trolleys to sort organic materials from plastics. But very few people do it, because once they do that, how do they sell it? The plastics waste will be bought, but no one buys the food waste, because the infrastructure hasn't been set up for it yet.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Central banks have also been stocking up on their physical gold reserves.\n\nCommentators have noted an increasing gap between the declining price of gold in the paper market and the rising demand in the physical gold market, fuelled by Asian countries like China and India.\n\nThey worry that the paper gold market will collapse amid a supply crunch, with unpredictable consequences for prices.\n\nMr Sinclair said that he wants to be involved in the birth of the physical gold market, which he said could take off within a year.\n\nHe wants to be able to provide a platform for a transparent valuation of gold.\n\n\"I firmly believe that if you will build it, they will come,\" he said, adding that what is unique about Singapore is that it has laws, effective regulation, technical experience and a welcoming attitude.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Moreover, we are also guaranteed a certain minimum grade in the agreement,\" said the spokesman.\n\nLionGold would utilise its existing processing plant, which has an annual processing capacity of 320,000 tonnes of ore, for the production.\n\nIt said that income from gold produced under this project is expected to sustain its exploration activities at the Konongo Gold Project, SML's flagship asset in Ghana.\n\nLionGold's shares closed 0.5 per cent down at $0.177 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And it is a matter of urgency for these overseas banks, because most of these funds are moved out of Singapore on the same day.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, 133 cases involving $15.5 million were investigated - 43 per cent higher than the 93 cases that cropped up in the whole of last year, when $24.6 million was involved.\n\nWith these monies zipping electronically out of Singapore, the rate of recovery has not been sparkling: 20 per cent for the first nine months of this year. Last year's recovery rate was more dismal - 11 per cent.\n\nIan Wong, deputy director of the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police Force, said that the customers of the overseas banks claimed that their e-mail accounts had been compromised by fraudsters who used them to send instructions to the victims' banks to transfer funds to bank accounts here.\n\nUpon realising that their money had been fraudulently moved, the victims then instruct their banks to recall the remittances.\n\nThe accounts into which these funds land and are transferred out of soon after belong to individuals, who, sometimes enticed by the commissions to be earned, are commonly recruited through social networking websites to become mules; sometimes, they are duped into becoming mules.\n\nThe fraudsters are known to be creative in roping in their accomplices. Some would claim to be recruiting \"Singapore agents\" for a foreign company - agents whose job is to open personal bank accounts to receive funds - usually from online scams.\n\nThe fraudsters are also known to use real-estate agents to launder their ill-gotten gains. Posing as potential clients responding to online property ads, they would obtain a property agent's bank account number to transfer one month's rent, but \"mistakenly\" transfer a much larger sum, after which the fraudsters would ask the agent to transfer the excess to another mule.\n\nLaw firms are also a target. Fraudsters, posing as potential clients, would engage a law firm to settle a civil dispute, say, one to recover a certain sum of money from an individual. The law firm would then receive funds in its account, purportedly transferred by the individual, though the firm may not even have contacted this individual. The fraudsters then move in and instruct the firm to keep a portion of the money as legal fees and to move the rest to a mule.\n\nThe Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), the police here and the National Crime Prevention Council warned yesterday that individuals who allow their accounts to receive stolen funds could be fined up to $500,000 and/or be jailed up to seven years upon conviction for money laundering; if corporate accounts are used for money laundering, the fine is stiffer - up to $1 million.\n\nThe CAD's Mr Wong said the police take a serious view of the activities of money mules because their actions facilitate crime and enable the wrong-doers to evade detection.\n\n\"The illicit funds money mules help to transfer may also be used by fraudsters to finance and perpetuate their criminal activities.\"\n\nOf the 32 money mules charged since last year, 17 have been convicted, he said, the heaviest sentence so far being a 41/2-year jail term for a mule who received $1.25 million from remitters in the US, Canada and Cooks Islands.\n\nMr Wong ventured that Singaporeans are targeted because the fraudsters communicate with them easily in English, and because of the relative ease with which bank accounts can be opened in this financial hub.\n\nThere are fewer than a handful cases of the reverse scenario - that of Singaporeans getting their funds stolen and transferred out.\n\nRichard Moore, who is with the ABS anti-fraud task force, said Singapore is not immune to such attempts, but \"Singapore banks are not losing money because of robust controls here. While there have been attempts at this type of activity, loss has not been incurred.\"\n\nABS director Ong-Ang Ai Boon said banks here are on high alert, and will file suspicious transaction reports (STRs) with the police whenever there is unusual movement of funds into customers' accounts. Last year, 17,000 STRs were filed; 15,000 have so far been filed this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In view of the SGX-ST's rejection of the company's application, the company will be delisted.\"\n\nUnder listing requirements Rule 1314, an issuer on the watch-list may apply to SGX for its removal from the watch-list if it satisfies any one of the following requirements: the issuer records consolidated pre-tax profit for the most recently completed financial year; and has an average daily market capitalisation of $40 million or more over the last 120 market days on which trading was not suspended or halted.\n\nSGX also informed Aussino in its letter that \"the company or its controlling shareholder(s) must comply with Listing Rule 1309, which requires the company or its controlling shareholder(s) to provide a reasonable exit offer to shareholders. The SGX-ST will grant the company an extension of time for the company or its controlling shareholder(s) to make an exit offer.

It was required to meet the requirements of Rule 1314 within 24 months from Sept 6, 2011, failing which SGX would either delist the company or suspend trading of the company's shares.\n\nThe company made a net loss of $8 million in FY2013, with total current liabilities exceeding total assets by $153,162.\n\nTraders noted that the stock had more than halved in April this year, when SGX had rejected the company's application for a $70 million reverse takeover (RTO) deal with Max Strategic Investments, which SGX had said was linked to a Myanmar tycoon on the US sanctions list.\n\nAussino shares had run up sharply previously, after it said last year that it would issue new shares to buy the energy business of Max Myanmar Group headed by Myanmar tycoon U Zaw Zaw.\n\nOn Nov 6, the group said it planned to issue US$30 million in convertible senior notes to an investor, Crede CG III, Ltd, an institutional investor based in the United States.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It can operate in water depths of 400 feet and drill to depths of 40,000 feet.\n\n\"Customer acceptance of the Ensco 120 series design has been remarkably strong because the rig has proprietary, patented technology that significantly increases the operational efficiencies in harsh environments,\" said Ensco's chairman and chief executive officer Dan Rabun.\n\n\"This is certainly a positive for the company, on the back of its recent five-rig order from Transocean,\" said Clement Chen, equity research analyst at Barclays Capital. \"It highlights the strength of the jack-up markets globally but also the importance of owning a well-accepted proprietary design that serves as a natural barrier to entry to other players trying to compete in the space.\"\n\nTo date, Keppel O&M has delivered 17 newbuild rigs to Ensco, with four on order including this latest contract.\n\nIn November, it secured a US$1.1 billion order from US-based Transocean to build five jack-up rigs with options for five more.\n\nIn October, it secured jack-up rig orders from Mexico's Perforadora Central and Clearwater Capital Partners of the US worth around US$240 million and US$440 million respectively.\n\nThis latest Ensco deal lifts Keppel O&M's 2013 year-to-date orders to $6.7 billion.

The airport saw 6.9 per cent more passengers year-on-year in September and passenger movement growth of 9.4 per cent in August. Meanwhile, aircraft landings and takeoffs rose 6.7 per cent to 29,500 in October.\n\nDuring the month, Changi Airport handled 157,400 tonnes of cargo, up 1.8 per cent from a year ago. Cargo volumes contracted 2.5 per cent year-on-year in September and were down 0.5 per cent in August.\n\n\"Passenger traffic to North-east Asia, South-east Asia and the Middle East grew in the 10 months ended October,\" said CAG. \"Among Changi Airport's top 10 country markets, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia registered double-digit traffic growth for the month.\"\n\nFor the 10-month period, total passenger movements worked out to 44.14 million, up 5.4 per cent, while cargo volumes edged up 0.8 per cent to 1.53 million tonnes.\n\nNew services being launched at Changi include Scoot's five times weekly flight to Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Tigerair is launching three new services to Chiang Mai and Langkawi, both operating four times weekly, as well as a thrice-weekly service to Lombok.\n\nBudget carrier Thai AirAsia is starting a daily service to Krabi while SilkAir is adding a thrice-weekly service to Yogyakarta.\n\nThis year, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects global passenger growth to hit 5 per cent, while cargo growth is expected to come in at 0.9 per cent.\n\nAsia-Pacific carriers are likely to clock 6.6 per cent in passenger traffic growth, which will help contribute to a bottom line of US$3.1 billion for the region. However, this too has been downgraded by US$1.5 billion because of slower growth in key emerging economies and a lacklustre performance in the cargo market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With this sale, the company's stake in Australand will go from 59.1 per cent down to 39.1 per cent, though Australand remains its single largest investment outside Singapore and China.\n\nThe proceeds will be used to invest in opportunities in its core markets in Singapore and China, as well as for general working capital purposes, the company said yesterday.\n\nCapitaLand president and chief executive Lim Ming Yan said in a statement that the partial sale \"will improve Australand's liquidity and attract more institutional investors\". \"We are comfortable with our remaining interest in Australand and it will remain a key investment for us.\"\n\nAnalysts remained positive on CapitaLand, with four maintaining their \"buy\" calls yesterday.\n\nNomura analyst Sai Min Chow said CapitaLand had \"locked in some gains at a good price\", and cited the management as having said that it was still possible for some proceeds to be paid to shareholders.\n\nAustraland had attracted suitors even before CapitaLand said at the beginning of the year that it could be up for sale. CapitaLand, which said it wanted to streamline its operations and focus on its core markets, concluded in July that Australand remained a key investment.\n\nFor the partial sale on Wednesday, CapitaLand appointed Citi the sole bookrunner and underwriter. Eventually, the price of A$3.685 was arrived at for the sale of 115.66 million Australand stapled securities after an overnight accelerated book build. The Business Times understands that the securities were placed out to institutional investors from Australia and abroad, including the US.\n\nThe price was at the low end of the range of transaction terms of A$3.685 to A$3.75 reported by news wires. Nevertheless, it was at a mere 1.7 per cent discount to the A$3.75 per stapled security at which Australand last traded. CapitaLand said it would continue to benefit from the strong recurring income in Australand's commercial and industrial portfolio, as well as the improvement in the Australian residential market.\n\nAustraland's free float after the transaction increased by half, and this significantly improves its ranking in the ASX 200 and ASX 200 A-Reit indices, CapitaLand said.\n\nThe sale is expected to be completed on Nov 26. CapitaLand will record a loss of about S$127.5 million. This is due to the recognition of S$162.9 million of foreign currency translation reserve and interest rate hedging reserve losses, partially offset by a divestment gain of S$8.8 million and a fair-value gain of S$26.6 million on the remeasurement of CapitaLand's remaining stake.\n\nThe accounting changes were caused by the deconsolidation process. With CapitaLand's stake in Australand having dropped below 50 per cent, the Australian developer is no longer a subsidiary. There is no expected impact on CapitaLand's net tangible asset value, which came to S$3.63 a share as at end-September.\n\nAssuming the placement was done at the beginning of the year, CapitaLand's earnings per share for the first three quarters of the year would decrease from 16.6 cents to 13 cents.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, CapitaLand closed down a cent at S$3.05, while Australand was down 15 Australian cents, or 4 per cent, at A$3.60.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Who are the real bad guys? Well, it depends on which side of the fence you sit on as fingers are pointed anonymously online.\n\nEnglish screenwriter Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things, Eastern Promises, and just earlier this year Redemption, which starred actor hero Jason Statham in a slightly serious dramatic role) looks at both sides of the coin when a bomb goes off in London's Borough market in his latest thriller Closed Circuit.\n\nSlickly directed by John Crowley (Boy A, Is Anybody There?), the film also doubles as a tense legal drama with two lawyers who used to be lovers, Martin Rose (Eric Bana) and Claudia Simmons-Howe (Rebecca Hall), being assigned to defend the bombing's primary suspect Farroukh Erdogan (Denis Moschitto).\n\nThe high-profile case is set to be the trial of the century with it being argued in both open court and behind closed doors because of the sensitive nature of some of the evidence. As one is handling the open court proceedings and the other, the closed-door, they are barred from communicating with each other. And they think it's in their best interest to keep their past out of the public eye anyway.\n\nBut as Rose digs deeper into the case, some dangerous truths and a conspiracy theory starts to emerge. Fearing for his ex-lover's safety and determined to expose the real baddies behind the bombing, he tries to reach Simmons-Howe and becomes engaged in a cat-and-mouse game that threatens to once again put national security at risk.\n\nWithout giving too much away, Knight fills the plot with plenty of cloak-and-dagger stuff and Crowley compacts it all into a tight 90-minute package.\n\nThe edge-of-the-seat action plays out with the intensity of a time bomb as one dirty secret after another is exposed. Some of it might not be totally logical but both Crowley and Knight give the audience little time to question things because of Closed Circuit's brisk pacing.\n\nBana and Hall are well-cast in their roles - the Australian actor makes an art out of being high-strung yet looks every bit like the screen hunk he is with his flashy suit and carefully sculpted coiffure.\n\nBritish actress Hall plays her character with vulnerability but is never weak or resigned to meekness.\n\nClosed Circuit is a smart and dark thinking man's thriller that questions the price of national security and if any organisation has the right to do whatever it feels like so the citizens of a country can sleep peacefully at night.\n\nThe premise might not be the most original with many other films and even television series nowadays using a terrorist attack to launch a plot.\n\nBut it's cleverly written, well-crafted and has more than enough moments leading up to the finale when justice is served. And that more than justifies the price of a ticket.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

HSBC/Markit's flash PMI eased to 50.4, from last month's 50.9. The result was also well below the government's version of the PMI, which hit 51.4 last month.\n\nAmong the sub-indexes, new export orders fell under the 50 mark, pointing to a fragile global recovery, while employment also decreased. Overall new orders rose but at a slower rate than last month, suggesting that internal demand was still not strong enough to support growth. A reading above 50 indicates expansion while anything below signals contraction.\n\nMarkets responded negatively to the data with shares falling in Hong Kong and Shanghai.\n\n\"China's growth momentum softened a little in November,\" Qu Hongbin, HSBC chief economist for China, said in a statement accompanying the data. \"That said, this is still the second-highest PMI reading in seven months.\"\n\nGDP grew 7.8 per cent in Q3, recovering from two quarters of slowing growth after the government implemented, over the summer, a \"mini stimulus\" via investments in the housing and transport sectors. Despite a rebound in most sectors of the economy in the past months, economists had expected the recovery to soften near the end of this year, as the new government seeks to move to a more sustainable consumption-led growth model.\n\nChina also has to deal with an over-leveraged economy, over-capacity and unproductive state-owned companies. The central bank has recently sent rates soaring after reining in credit, another sign that the leaders are determined to depart from previous growth patterns.\n\n\"The downbeat flash PMI adds to the evidence that the recent economic rebound is fading. The efforts of policymakers to slow credit growth are set to further weigh on growth in the months ahead,\" said Qinwei Wang, an economist with Capital Economics.\n\nThe Communist Party published a blueprint last week highlighting key reforms, with a strong focus on rebalancing and restructuring the economy over the next decade.\n\n\"Mostly because of the magnitude of the debt problem, the path will inevitably be bumpy,\" wrote Societe-Generale China economist Yao Wei in a report.\n\n\"We think that the policy trajectory going forward will consist of many repetitions of this year's pattern: policymakers force deleveraging and quicken reform; as a result, growth decelerates and financial risk rises; when the situation becomes too precarious, they pause deleveraging and stabilise the economy (with some investment); then as soon as the economy steadies, they go again,\" she added.\n\nThe official growth target for this year has been set at 7.5 per cent, a figure that most economists think China will outperform. The final reading of the HSBC PMI will be released on Dec 2, a day after the official one published by the statistics bureau.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Unfortunately, after the unveiling of the statue in May 2011, it seems that the honour of this commission was elbowed out of the spotlight by a flood of negative criticism about his work.\n\nAccording to art critics and public opinion, Rainaldi's statue, Conversazioni, was said to bear little resemblance to the late Pope John Paul II, who died in 2005.\n\nEven Rainaldi himself was unhappy with the way that the statue turned out, and says that something intangible had gone missing when the foundry workers were putting together the 40 pieces that made up his five tonne statue.\n\n\"The idea was the same, but (my initial model) was more fluid. During the execution of the first statue, something was lost in the fluidity,\" says the 56-year-old, whose works are part of a small exhibition currently on display at the Partners & Mucciaccia Gallery at the Gillman Barracks till mid-February.\n\nA plaster model, some bronze sculptures and a few other conceptual sketches of Conversazioni are featured and is part of the 49-piece larger exhibition titled Works 2003-2013. The art pieces are for sale, priced from 8,000 euros (S$13,450) to 130,000 euros.\n\n\"An artist works with millimetres. The difference between one artist's work and another is in the millimetres, not metres. If you're wrong by just three millimetres, it can look like it's big or fat,\" explains Rainaldi fervently. In the end, he says that it was his personal dissatisfaction with the first statue that drove him to redesign it over a period of nine months, and not the criticisms that he received.\n\nThe second unveiling took place in September last year, and the statue currently stands in front of Rome's Termini train station.\n\nIn hindsight, the \"constructive evolution\" turned out to have been \"necessary\", says the artist in halting English. \"It's hard to explain, but you know it's like when you make something and it doesn't turn out the way you want. But even bad things happen for a good reason,\" he says.\n\nThis controversial piece of work aside, the rest of Rainaldi's work on display all have a spiritual sense to them, which comes from his own religious beliefs as well as his background of studying theology.\n\nFor example, one of his series of works is titled Caduti (Fallen). It represents how Mankind has sinned as portrayed in the Bible, so every piece in the series has its head hung to face the ground in shame.\n\nThe artist later reveals that at one point in his life, he actually considered becoming a priest. But he ended up taking what he jokingly calls a \"big detour\" when he met the woman who would later become his wife and go on to have three children with him.\n\nWhen asked what he wants people to take away from his exhibition, Rainaldi says that his biggest target is for his work to raise questions about anything at all - be it his art, religion, or life in general.\n\n\"The best things about any artwork is that they talk to you. They need to communicate, so it's best if everyone not just look at it, but listen to it too. Because if you see something that is flat, and doesn't speak to you, then it's not good because there isn't any emotion. But the questions only come once it speaks to you,\" he says.\n\nOliviero Rainaldi's works will be on display at the Partners & Mucciaccia Gallery at Block 6 Lock Road, #02-10 Gillman Barracks, till Feb 16. Opening hours are from noon to 7pm from Tues to Fri, 11am to 7pm on Sat and noon to 6pm on Sun.

However, staff in sales and marketing pose a much higher risk for frauds, such as falsifying revenue and dishonest expense claims.\"\n\nThe study found that the most prevalent type of fraud is the misappropriation of assets (56 per cent) - of which embezzlement made up 40 per cent and procurement fraud 27 per cent.\n\nMost fraudulent acts were carried out over one to five years, with 93 per cent being committed in multiple transactions.\n\nWhen fraudsters acted alone, 9 per cent of the frauds incurred a total cost exceeding US$5 million. When they acted in collaboration with others, 16 per cent had a total value of greater than US$5 million.\n\nIn Singapore, about 70 per cent of the fraudsters analysed were employed by the victim company and they tended to be opportunists. KPMG also found that many companies here have fewer fraud deterrence measures in place and are especially vulnerable to procurement fraud. A tendency to focus almost exclusively on price, over other factors such as track record and the results of vendor due diligence, can leave companies vulnerable.\n\n\"Simply picking the lowest bid leaves a company exposed not only to problems such as underperformance but also frauds such as bid-rigging and kickbacks provided to their staff for inside information,\" Mr Hawkes said.\n\nKPMG believes that understanding the characteristics of a typical fraudster - and also the fact that these are subject to change with time - will enable organisations to better protect themselves against being defrauded.\n\nAn important change or development in recent years is the growing use of technology by fraudsters, and not just in the technologically advanced countries. About 46 per cent of all fraudsters were computer-literate.\n\nIn Singapore, the recent cyberattacks on government websites show how cyberattacks and high-tech fraud are becoming increasingly common.\n\n\"Some companies in Singapore have not significantly updated their defences in some time. What worked a few years ago will no longer be enough to keep company assets and data safe,\" said Mr Hawkes.\n\nTechnology enables not only the fraudster, but also the organisation to defend itself. Companies will have to think harder about whether old fraud prevention technologies still apply.\n\nNewer approaches such as data analytics and data mining give the company a much better chance of catching the fraudster, KPMG said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

HELMI YUSOF reports\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 21, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTWO years ago, when art lover Serenella Ciclitira was in Indonesia, she asked a group of Indonesian artists: \"Do you have a museum of modern art that I could visit?\"\n\nThey replied: \"Yes, we do. It's in Singapore; it's called the Singapore Art Museum.\"\n\nTo her, their dry reply underlines the inadequate art infrastructure that hinders the development of many Asian art scenes, particularly in parts of South-east Asia and Central Asia. With a weak gallery system and few or no museums to showcase their country's art, many good Asian artists are not getting the recognition that they deserve.\n\nThat is why she and her husband David helped found the Prudential Eye Awards through their not-for-profit organisation Parallel Contemporary Art and the famous Saatchi Gallery. Title-sponsored by life insurer Prudential, the award aims to recognise emerging Asian talent in five categories - photography, painting, sculpture, installation and digital video.\n\nTo be launched next January, the award will cover artists in over 30 countries in what Ms Ciclitira calls the \"greater Asian region\" - from Kazakhstan to China to Indonesia to Australia. The overall winner not only gets a total of US$50,000 in prize money, he will also see his works on display in the influential Saatchi Gallery in London.\n\nSaatchi's involvement\n\nThe Saatchi Gallery is owned by the controversial advertising giant and art collector Charles Saatchi, who has often riled the art world for what some describe as a large and undue influence on the art market.\n\nBut as far as Ms Ciclitira is concerned, Mr Saatchi is a force of good because of his ostensibly magnanimous support of the arts.\n\nShe says: \"His gallery is incredibly popular with art lovers to visit - even children visit it - which goes to show that Saatchi Gallery is curating art that captures the imagination of the new generation of art lovers. You can't say that about all galleries.\"\n\nSaatchi aside, Ms Ciclitira herself has exerted some influence on the art market. Since 2008, she has been curating country-specific exhibitions in South Korea, Hong Kong and Indonesia under Global Eye programme.\n\nThese exhibitions - titled Korean Eye, Hong Kong Eye and Indonesian Eye respectively - comes with a comprehensive catalogue that showcases 75 talented artists from the countries. These catalogues have become authoritative insider guides to the art scenes of these countries, used by collectors, curators and gallerists.\n\n\"In Korea, when I curated the exhibition and book Korean Eye in 2008, there were very few available books on Korean art in English then. Since then, I would go to an art fair and I'd see gallerists using the book to show to collectors and say: 'Look, my artist has appeared in the Korean Eye - that's how good he is.'\"\n\nNow, the Global Eye Programme is set to do the same for the Malaysian market. Next April, it will be launching the Malaysian Eye exhibition and book featuring the best in contemporary Malaysian art.\n\nMs Ciclitira is also setting her sights on curating a Singapore Eye by 2015 though plans are not firmed up yet. For now, though, Prudential is also sponsoring the Prudential Singapore Young Artist Award in partnership with Lasalle College of the Arts for art students, with a prize of US$10,000.\n\nThough some may demur the involvement of the Saatchi Gallery because of its controversial owner, Ms Ciclitira is clear on one thing.\n\nShe's never sold her art\n\nOver the years, she and her husband have amassed an enviable collection of 350 artworks, some by award-winning artists. But, unlike Mr Saatchi, who has had a hand in both raising and lowering the prices of the artists whom he collects, the Ciclitiras have never sold a single one of their artworks.\n\nShe insists: \"We collect art only because we love it. We do it for pleasure, not for investment. We sometimes see the crazy prices that some artworks have gotten at auctions. But we are certain we want to keep this art for our own enjoyment.\"\n\nBesides her, the judges of the award are Nigel Hurst, CEO, Saatchi Gallery; Tsong-Zung Chang, co-founder, Asia Art Archive; Sir David Green, former director-general, British Council; Nick Mitzevich, director, Art Gallery of Southern Australia; Lee Young Hye, creative director, Gwangju Design Biennale; Andre Erofeev, independent curator and critic; and Tan Boon Hui, group director, Programmes Group, National Heritage Board of Singapore.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We have since resolved the issue and bookings in the pending queue are currently being processed and cleared.\"\n\nCustomers also experienced some difficulties with the website on Wednesday due to a separate issue with the booking system, which has also been rectified, the company said.\n\nHowever, judging from some of the comments on the airline's Facebook page, complaints about the inability to book flights on the website started as far back as Monday.\n\nOne irate customer went on to buy a ticket with another airline after receiving an error message from the Tigerair website while trying to pay for her flight. However, she found herself double booked when she received a confirmation from Tigerair some 13-14 hours after her botched booking attempt.\n\nWhile it isn't clear yet how much the website glitches could have cost the airline in lost revenue, the online portal is an important channel for the budget carrier as it likely contributes to the bulk of ticket sales.\n\nAccording to UOB-Kay Hian analyst K Ajith, the website alone could account for some 80 per cent of the budget carrier's bookings.\n\nTigerair, which has apologised for the inconvenience caused, said customers should call its customer care hotline if they do not receive an emailed confirmation of their booking within 24 hours.\n\nTiger Airways, which reported its second quarter results last month, swung into the black with a net profit of $23.8 million, boosted by gains from the sale of a 60 per cent stake in Tigerair Australia to Virgin Australia.\n\nRevenue fell nearly 17 per cent to $163.8 million, due to lower yields as well as from the partial disposal of its operations Down Under.\n\nShares in Tigerair closed unchanged at 50.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The youth, glamour, hope and power that Kennedy represented were all extinguished over the space of a few horrifying seconds that even now - thanks in part to a home movie of the actual murder - remain painfully embedded in the national psyche.\n\nParkland is a docudrama that recreates in authentic detail the moments leading up to the death of the president and the hours and days that followed, when a wave of shock, grief and guilt swept through Dallas, the scene of the crime. Written and directed by Peter Landesman in a journalistic, matter-of-fact manner, the movie focuses on a few key people and places that were instrumental to the proceedings.\n\nAided by some archival footage and the weight of history, Landesman makes no effort to embellish the facts. Viewers are given a ringside seat to perhaps the most heavily scrutinised and debated event in American political history. The filmmakers don't do much by way of making judgments or presenting conspiracy theories - that well-trodden path is best left to the likes of Oliver Stone.\n\nInstead, what we're left with are individuals - among them the ones tasked with protecting the president and when they failed, others who desperately tried to save him from dying. Parkland, which is based on a book (Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F Kennedy) by Vincent Bugliosi and refers to the hospital where Kennedy was taken after the shooting, does a decent (if a little stodgy) by-the-book interpretation of the effect that the killing had on everyone - from the First Lady, the FBI and Secret Service agents to the doctors and nurses at Parkland and Abraham Zapruder, the man who unwittingly (and famously) recorded the killing on his 8mm movie camera.\n\nInterestingly, one of the primary characters in Parkland is Robert Oswald (James Badge Dale), the brother of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald (Jeremy Strong) and a man who unwittingly finds himself at the centre of the storm. Their mother Marguerite (Jacki Weaver) is portrayed as a deluded oddball who tries to force her way in from the fringes of history.\n\nThe movie's ensemble cast - including Paul Giamatti as Zapruder, Zac Efron as doctor James Carrico, Marcia Gay Harden as head nurse Doris Nelson, Ron Livingston as FBI agent James Hosty and Billy Bob Thornton as Secret Service agent Forrest Sorrels - all perform with admirable restraint for the greater good.\n\n\"Just the facts, ma'am,\" a line attributed to detective Joe Friday in the television series Dragnet, comes to mind here, because Landesman seems to have taken it to heart.\n\nThe tragic events of 50 years ago - and the chaos and recriminations that followed - shattered much more than just one man's life. It's a chapter that could perhaps have been avoided - despite its strict adhesion to the facts, Parkland does allow itself to pose a \"what if\" question or two. The scars from that day are still present in one form or another. \"I will never be ordinary again,\" declares Marguerite Oswald. Neither would anyone else.\n\nRating:\n\nC+\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Both themes feature prominently in his first full-length production for THE Dance Company, premiering soon at Contact 2013 dance festival.\n\n\"The piece seeks to question audiences on whether communication is important to humans,\" explains Kim, who's the resident choreographer of the company.\n\nDrawing from his experience in Singapore, Kim adds that he found an Asian identity that inspired him for the piece, entitled Mr Sign, which revolves around emotional satisfaction in relationships and easing troubled minds in society.\n\nIn the piece, he will have dancers seeking release from social convention by sprouting gibberish and performing a kind of text-based dance, even if the text is not a comprehensible language.\n\nLeaning towards dance theatre, Kim also is known for engineering and composing his own music for his choreography.\n\nFor Mr Sign, he is utilising the score from Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. \"The first part depicts a person that cannot express himself, and thus uses a section in the music in a bid for others to understand him. The desire that this person has is similar to the portion from Swan Lake that portrays a passionate image; hence I used it as the title song,\" he explains.\n\nFor the second part, entitled Public Sphere, another Swan Lake segment is used to portray idealistic conversations for fair communication. \"I felt that the dance of the Four Swans could ideally express this conversation better than any other; therefore I used Part One of the Four Swans music to make the message easily comprehensible for the audience.\"\n\nBut Kim has also mixed his musical influences, by utilising the traditional genre of \"trot music\" from Korea combined with the traditional gamelan music of Indonesia.\n\nLast year, Kim's piece for Contact was a relentlessly energetic work, and this year's promises the same high-powered output.\n\nMr Sign will open the dance festival which features 16 international and regional artists from nine countries.\n\nThe festival also includes an acclaimed solo work by Danish artist Kitt Johnson, and a duet by Compania Nacional de Danza principal dancer Tamako Akiyama and her husband Dimo Kirilov.\n\nThrough the AFX - Asian Festivals Exchange - Contact forges connections and exchanges within Singapore and the region. AFX will present two collaborative works - one between Singapore artist Liz Fong and Yuriko Suzuki of the Yokohama Dance Collection, and the other between Seoul Dance Collection's award-winning Korean choreographer Choi Myung Hyun and Malaysia's Damansara Performing Arts Centre Dance Company's artistic director Wong Jyh Shyong.\n\nIn Accents of South-east Asia, the festival will feature emerging choreographers such as Singapore's Goh Shou-Yi, Malaysia's James Kan and Vietnam's Ngo Thanh Phuong.\n\nContact 2013 will be held from Nov 29 to Dec 8.

OCBC - which has long been a supporter of local sports - now owns the exclusive naming rights to a multi-purpose indoor arena, an aquatic centre, two club lounges in the National Stadium as well as the VIP lounge in the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nAs widely expected, the 55,000-seater National Stadium - the crown jewel of the Sports Hub - was not included as part of the naming rights package. This was in line with the desire to preserve the historic venue - home to so many major events over the decades including famous football victories and the annual National Day Parade - as a Singapore icon.\n\nIn a surprise move, however, the authorities also deemed that the Singapore Indoor Stadium would not be named after a commercial entity for the same reasons. The government later said that one or both stadiums could possibly be named after a personality some time down the road in order to commemorate or remember him or her.\n\nWhile few will argue that it is the right move to keep the National Stadium off limits to commercial branding, there is perhaps a missed opportunity when it comes to getting the most out of the Singapore Indoor Stadium.\n\nApart from the National Stadium, the 12,000-capacity Indoor Stadium (which opened in the late 1980s) is the next most recognisable facility within the entire Sports Hub. One could certainly surmise that the entire naming rights package could well have been worth much more had the Indoor Stadium been made part of the deal as well. The extra money - quite possibly in the tens of millions of dollars - could have been spent on many more meaningful community or sporting initiatives in and around the Sports Hub.\n\nAs Acting Culture, Community and Youth Minister Lawrence Wong put it, it is important to get the right balance in preserving the public character of the Sports Hub project, while attracting corporate sponsorship for venues that will help activate and catalyse the sports industry in Singapore.\n\nThe door should not be closed entirely on the Indoor Stadium, given that such naming rights contracts last only for a specific period. After all, if there is a major brand out there that is more than willing to pump in good money that will boost Singapore's sports scene, then it would be wise to at least consider the pros and cons.\n\nAll things considered, should the authorities change their minds one day in the future and decide to put the naming rights to the Indoor Stadium up for sale, there will likely be no shortage of corporates ready to snap up that offer in a heartbeat.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The regulator also gave SingTel until April 2018 - an extension from the April 2014 deadline - to sell down its stake in the trust.\n\nIDA's approval, which comes with several conditions, follows the vehement opposition to the sale by six Internet service providers (ISPs) in September. These ISPs compete in the same fibre broadband space as SingTel and had objected to the prospect of SingTel wholly owning the only nationwide fibre provider in Singapore.\n\nYesterday, M1, one of the service providers, said: \"We are still evaluating the details of IDA's decision. OpenNet's less-than-satisfactory performance to date has adversely impacted the Next Generation Nationwide Broadband Network (NGNBN) customer experience, and we hope this new arrangement will result in tangible improvements that benefit consumers.\"\n\nNetLink Trust owns the ducts and manholes through which the network's optical fibre cables pass. It is 100 per cent owned by SingTel but the majority of the board of its trustee-manager, CityNet, is independent.\n\nPost-buyout, CityNet will take over OpenNet's role of rolling out the nationwide fibre broadband network and providing the services that the latter is currently offering.\n\nThis will happen in two phases. After the buyout, the first phase will see OpenNet's business and assets transferred to NetLink Trust. SingTel will give up its role as key subcontractor to OpenNet and transfer employees, skills and expertise to the trust.\n\nIn the second phase, CityNet will assume the OpenNet role. By April 2018, SingTel is to have pared down its stake in NetLink Trust to below 25 per cent. The original deadline was April 2014, but SingTel had requested an extension until 2018.\n\nYesterday, IDA said that this extension was \"not unreasonable\" given the scope of the undertaking. Other industry players had previously expressed their \"grave concerns\" about the requested deadline extension, saying that for as long as SingTel continued to hold significant ownership of NetLink Trust, \"CityNet will always be under an obligation to put SingTel's interests ahead of any other party\".\n\nTo address this concern, one of IDA's conditions for the sale is the establishment of a monitoring board to keep CityNet and SingTel in check until the latter reduces its stake to below 25 per cent. This monitoring board will be staffed by government representatives and not industry ones.\n\nAnother one of IDA's conditions obliges SingTel to act \"reasonably and in utmost good faith\" as a CityNet unitholder. CityNet will not be allowed to take into account unitholders' interests which have no relation to their investment in the trust. No more than 25 per cent of CityNet's directors can be appointed by SingTel.\n\nThese conditions were a reaction to fears by other industry players that the Business Trust Act would oblige CityNet to put SingTel's interest ahead of its own.\n\nPost-buyout, CityNet should have \"full independence\" in making decisions for the prices and terms of its service offerings, IDA said.\n\nNow, the parties mooting the sale have up to 14 days to accept the terms. CityNet said it would \"examine the additional conditions . . . and will revert within 14 days\".\n\n\"The purchase of OpenNet is about streamlining processes in the industry and ensuring greater accountability with a single point of contact for fibre, ducts and manhole operations,\" said its chairman, Yap Chee Keong.\n\n\"We want to reiterate CityNet's commitment to ensuring equal and open access to the NGNBN fibre network.\"\n\nWhen the proposal was mooted in August, it was roundly shouted down by rival telcos StarHub and M1 as well by as smaller ISPs. They argued that this deal would not address existing delays in connecting users to the network and would \"further entrench SingTel's dominance\".\n\nA StarHub spokeswoman said: \"We support any move to improve OpenNet's quality of service and speed of provisioning. We look forward to working with IDA and the industry to ensure that OpenNet provides quality services, in a timely manner, on an open-access and non-discriminatory basis.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They plan to drastically reduce the number of their foreign employees during the next three years from the current 74 per cent to just 35 per cent.\n\nEven in the last one year, SMEs have significantly rebalanced the proportion of local and foreign employees on their payroll. The number of SMEs with 10 per cent or fewer foreign workers has increased by almost threefold - from 12 per cent in 2012 to 33 per cent this year.\n\nHowever, this reduction in foreign employees has led to increased manpower costs due to the higher costs of hiring local staff. As many as 85 per cent of SMEs in the survey listed this as a cost that they are most affected by.\n\nNinety-five per cent of construction companies and 90 per cent of manufacturing firms indicated manpower costs as their topmost concern.\n\nConsequently, more SMEs indicated cost reduction on staff expenditure as their priority over expanding their existing range of products and services.\n\nThis preoccupation with cost issues has hurt SMEs' growth and turnover. Only 44 per cent of SMEs recorded a turnover of over $10 million for the 2012-2013 financial year, compared to 55 per cent the year before. The lower turnover was attributed to slower market growth and rising costs.\n\nSimilarly, there was a 3 per cent drop in SMEs generating a net profit of more than $500,000 for the financial year.\n\nManaging costs was critical for SMEs to make profits, and smaller companies (with a turnover of up to $5 million) accounted for as much as 78 per cent of the loss-making SMEs.\n\nOnly 7 per cent of the SMEs expect to achieve double-digit growth going forward, marking it as the lowest level in the survey's 11-year history. Up to 44 per cent expect stagnant growth.\n\nThe lack of appetite for growth (and focus on survival) is also resulting in fewer SMEs doing business overseas: 46 per cent this year compared to 54 per cent in 2012. The lack of drive also sees fewer SMEs having a business strategy: 75 per cent this year, down from 85 per cent in 2012 - with one in four SMEs having no strategy at all.\n\n\"SMEs have had to focus on cost-cutting and productivity in order to stay competitive. As a result, fewer SMEs are pursuing expansion and pushing for growth,\" said Chen Yew Nah, managing director of DP Information Group (DP Info), which conducts the annual survey.\n\nSMEs are also losing out on debt and equity financing from institutions as they are unable to highlight new business opportunities to attract funding.\n\nFinancial institutions, however, warned that this lack of ambition could be costly, and urged SMEs to step up their game plan. \"With the challenging global economic environment, it is natural that SMEs may be apprehensive about their growth plans. However, SMEs can take this opportunity to raise their game and get ready for growth,\" said Kavita Bedi, regional head of SME banking, Singapore and South-east Asia, at Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nThe survey also found that more SMEs here have a higher credit risk rating, with 43 per cent of them now falling into DP Info's \"DP7-8 High Risk\" companies - up from 25 per cent five years ago.\n\n\"SMEs need to understand that the riskiest thing to do is to stand still. After a period of stagnant growth, the balance sheets of SMEs have weakened and more SMEs are now considered to be high credit risks,\" cautioned DP Info's Ms Chen.\n\nThe survey was conducted among 10,000 SMEs, with at least 30 per cent local ownership and with not more than $100 million in annual turnover.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But since it also falls under musical theatre giant Andrew Lloyd Webber's brand name, comparisons are inevitable.\n\nAs an Andrew Lloyd Webber production, it felt like the runt of the litter that's trying too hard, while as a musical in general, it lacked heart more severely than the Tin Man thought he did in The Wizard of Oz.\n\nStarlight Express is about a child who dreams about his toy train set coming to life. Actors act as locomotives, zipping across the stage on rollerskates in breathtaking synchrony while dressed in a variety of dazzling costumes. They are the ones that the underdog steam engine Rusty intends to challenge in a race to be named the \"fastest engine in the world\".\n\nBut he must first find a race partner to qualify. So he approaches his love interest - Pearl, the observation car - who initially agrees to race with him.\n\nHowever, she quickly abandons him for the promise of a faster partner in electrical train Electra, and after one race changes her mind and hops over to pair up with reigning champion Greaseball, the diesel train.\n\nOf course, Rusty eventually overcomes all the obstacles hurled his way, and gains the blessing of Starlight Express (an omniscient presence whose title is left up to audience interpretation). By a stroke of sheer luck, he finally emerges as default champion and is deemed worthy in Pearl's eyes, so she conveniently realises she is in love with him.\n\nUsually, the recipe of the underdog story is quite a foolproof one, where hard work and a persevering spirit will eventually win the day (and audiences over).\n\nBut Starlight Express's underdog probably had too much working against him. The sincerity and earnestness of the protagonist Rusty, along with his heartfelt rendition of Starlight Express at the end of Act 1, was hopelessly lost against a backdrop of harsh flashing lights and deafening sound effects.\n\nBut the icing on top of the train wreck (pun intended) came just as the races were about to begin, and audiences were visibly gearing up for a little excitement. Alas, what they got instead was the demanding voiceover of the child, Control, telling everyone to put on their \"safety goggles\" (actually cardboard 3D glasses) so they can watch the race take place in all its glory on a 3D screen.\n\nFor diehard musical fans who have forked out up to $160 for a Category A ticket (and even more for a VIP ticket to watch \"live\" theatre), that borders on insulting.\n\nBut perhaps that's just what happens to a travelling show. After all, not every stage can be as impressive as the original one at the Apollo Victoria Theatre in West End, where characters raced live around the audience.\n\nOr perhaps this is just a classic case of a production that tried a little too hard and, along the way, went a little too far off track.\n\nStarlight Express runs till this Sunday at Marina Bay Sands' MasterCard Theatres. Tickets from $65 are available at Sistic outlets, online, and at the venue box office.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For its 75th anniversary celebration next week, the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (Nafa) has invited him and two well-known local choreographers to work with the students for its triple bill, Still Waters Run Deep.\n\nThe local choreographers are Jeffrey Tan, the former resident choreographer of Singapore Dance Theatre (STD), and Osman Abdul Hamid, artistic director of Era Dance Theatre.\n\nCousins won Matthew Bourne's inaugural New Adventures Choreographer Award in 2011, and has since been commissioned by the Scottish Ballet and National Ballet of Chile.\n\nFor Singapore, he will be presenting an excerpt of his signature piece Everything and Nothing, which he describes \"as a high energy work for 10 dancers, inspired by our perception of 'nothingness'\".\n\nHe explains: \"We often think of 'everything' and 'nothing' as being opposites. However, taking ideas from quantum physics, everything is actually a development of, a magnification of, and the result of nothingness. What we perceive as 'nothing' is actually alive. Without this 'nothing', we couldn't have everything.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Tan - who recently joined THE Dance Company as an associate artist - will be presenting Swirling, a new work commissioned by the arts academy.\n\nTan describes the work, set to the Tirol Concerto from Philip Glass' The Passage, as a contemporary ballet number that \"focuses on the fluidity of movements . . . to convey swirling and ripple effects of water\". He prefers to \"let the movements do the talking\".\n\nComing from a predominantly ballet background as the former principal dancer and resident choreographers of SDT, he felt that some of the classical roles he took on were limiting.\n\n\"I'm more attracted to the possibility of movement . . . treating the body as a kind of live sculpture which can be shaped and moulded in many different ways,\" he says.\n\nFinally, there is Osman's work, a contemporary Malay dance number titled Currents Of Time that conveys the struggle to retain one's traditions and identity amid rapid social change. Blending traditional Malay moves such as joget, zapin inang, dana and silat, the dance will be accompanied by traditional live music composed by Osman.\n\nHe says: \"I've not only shared with the students the different Malay dance genres, but also the gestures we use in our daily life and the values imparted through these gestures.\"\n\nThe three diverse works - from contemporary dance to contemporary ballet to contemporary Malay dance - will stretch the skills of Nafa's 37 student dancers and five alumni dancers.\n\nSays Caren Carino, head of the Department of Dance at Nafa: \"We want to convey our East-West contemporary profile and debunk the general perception that Nafa's dance programme is 'traditional' and 'Asian' or primarily Chinese.\"\n\n'Still Waters Run Deep' will be staged at the Esplanade Theatre non Nov 29 at 8pm.

The share of owners with at least 20 per cent equity climbed to 60.8 per cent from 58.1 per cent, making it easier for them to list properties and buy a new place.\n\n\"Home sales will pick up very nicely when people gain the equity they need to sell their house and have a downpayment for the next one,\" said Neal Soss, chief economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. \"There's a magnifying effect on sales - people are able to list their home and sell it, and odds are they're going to go on and buy another one.\"\n\nA shortage of inventory has forced homebuyers to compete, driving up prices and leaving some shoppers out of the market, said Thomas Lawler, a former Fannie Mae economist who now is a housing consultant. The number of homes for sale reached a low of 1.8 million in early 2013, the fewest in more than a decade, according to data from the US National Association of Realtors.\n\n\"The pent-up demand from people who now have enough equity to sell their homes will help next year,\" said Mr Lawler, president of Lawler Economic & Housing Consulting LLC in Leesburg, Virginia. \"We'll see the effect during the spring selling season. Not a lot of people put their homes on the market during the holidays.\"\n\nWhile the supply of homes limited sales, it boosted price growth, said Michelle Meyer, a senior US economist at Bank of America Corp in New York. Shortages have caused buyers to compete for properties by raising the price they offer, she said.\n\nThe median price of an existing home rose 12.8 per cent last month, the Realtors' group reported. In August, it jumped 13.4 per cent, the fastest rate since the height of the US real estate boom in 2005.\n\n\"We'll see the pace of price growth moderate next year,\" said Ms Meyer. She estimates prices will gain 8 per cent in 2014, compared with 10 per cent in 2013.\n\nThe real estate recovery has supported economic growth for almost two years as buyers make ancillary purchases such as home decor and appliances, Ms Meyer said. Consumer spending accounts for about 70 per cent of the US economy. Gross domestic product grew at a 2.8 per cent pace in the third quarter, up from 2.5 per cent in the prior period. \"Whenever we see a house turn over, we see furniture sales and renovations that add to consumer spending,\" she said. \"With the real estate market recovering, people are feeling more confident about their situation, which makes them more willing to spend.\"\n\nAbout 10.8 million homeowners were underwater on their mortgages in the third quarter, down from 12.2 million in the second quarter, Zillow said. About 20 million people had negative equity or less than 20 per cent equity, down from 21.5 million in the prior three months. Las Vegas, Atlanta and Orlando, Florida, led major metropolitan areas with the highest rates of borrowers with less than 20 per cent equity. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This beat the expectations of market economists, who thought the flash estimate of 5.1 per cent growth would be raised to a median forecast of 5.3 per cent.\n\nIn sequential terms too, the GDP surprised the market with an annualised 1.3 per cent jump after seasonal adjustments, contrary to the advance estimate of a one per cent quarter-on-quarter contraction. Economists were expecting a better showing, but the median of 15 forecasts submitted to Bloomberg still pointed to a 0.3 per cent drop.\n\nAfter MTI released the figures yesterday, at least four banks hiked their 2013 growth forecasts; two raised their estimates to 4 per cent, the top end of the new official estimate. This, despite the very different story unveiled yesterday on the trade front by International Enterprise Singapore. The government now expects non-oil domestic exports (NODX) to contract more sharply by 4 to 5 per cent this year than the earlier projection of a zero to one per cent fall.\n\nBut economists pointed to the October trade figures, which came out earlier this week, showing the first month of NODX growth since January and early signs of recovery.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan said: \"Recent high-frequency data shows an improvement in the factory output of Singapore's key exporting countries, and the expected recovery in the advanced economies over the next few quarters will likely lift demand for our exports.\"\n\nThis gives him and other analysts reason to believe that the recovery in exports may soon catch up with that in industrial output.\n\nMany economists noted that Q3's strong showing went beyond the industrial sector. Not only did manufacturing growth accelerate to 5.5 per cent from a flash estimate of 4.5 per cent - thanks to a surge in electronics and rig-building activity - the services sector too, grew 6.3 per cent, beating a flash estimate of 5.7 per cent growth. In particular, segments facing the global economy, such as wholesale and retail trade and transportation and storage, expanded strongly, to offset quarter-on-quarter declines in sentiment-sensitive sectors such as finance and insurance.\n\nOther lagging sectors were the tourism-related sectors. Accommodation and food services grew a relatively weaker 3 per cent year on year, falling 1.1 per cent in sequential terms. Barclays economist Joey Chew said that these likely suffered from the depreciation in Asean currencies and weaker sentiment in the region. Comparing the first three quarters of 2013 with that of 2012, the economy expanded 3.5 per cent. MTI expects this pace of growth to carry into the final quarter.\n\nMTI's permanent secretary, Ow Foong Pheng, said: \"For the rest of the year, we expect externally oriented sectors like manufacturing, wholesale trade and transportation and storage to support growth, in line with the slight pickup in the global economy.\"\n\nConstruction, which grew 5.3 per cent in Q3, and business services, which grew 3.9 per cent, are also expected to stay resilient in this current quarter. However, it is possible that the pace of growth may moderate next year, if it falls in the lower end of the government's forecast range of 2 to 4 per cent growth for 2014.\n\nWith a slow recovery in the US and eurozone on the cards and Asia's growth likely to be mild, given structural reforms in China and fiscal consolidation in some Asean economies, MTI characterised Singapore's 2014 growth outlook as \"modest\". There are risks to this global backdrop, including uncertainties over how markets might react to the Federal Reserve's move to taper quantitative easing, or whether the US debt ceiling is raised in a timely manner. MTI sees the eurozone as still \"susceptible to a flare-up of the sovereign debt crisis\"; the risks from China are those of a sharper-than-expected slowdown as its government restructures the economy.\n\nMTI also noted that tightness in the labour market - due in part to foreign manpower curbs - will persist and could drag down growth of domestic sectors that are labour-intensive.\n\nAlthough stronger output pointed to labour productivity being favourable this time round, Mrs Ow said that the impact of policies to shift the economy towards \"productivity-led\" growth should be assessed only over the longer term.\n\nBut the take-up of grants and incentives to boost productivity has been \"encouraging\", she said, adding that as at September, the government had committed to disburse $330 million in such incentives to more than 15,000 companies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He is currently hot on Burgundy and had heard of this wine. He certainly was aiming high - you do not get much higher unless you ask for a Montrachet by Domaine Romanee-Conti.\n\nMusigny Blanc is the name of the white chardonnay produced on Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue's Grand Cru vineyard, Musigny, in Chambolle-Musigny. Its last vintage was 1993; since then, the wine has been sold as Bourgogne Blanc because the current vines are not old enough to permit the wine to be called Musigny Blanc Grand Cru. Bourgogne Blanc it may be called today but it certainly is not priced as a Bourgogne Blanc, rather more like a Premier Cru white burgundy from the Cote de Beaune, eg Puligny-Montrachet Premier Cru Clavoillon. The wait is in sight though because the current vines were planted between 1986 and 1997, so it should not take much longer before Musigny Blanc reappears.\n\nAt its height, the production of Musigny Blanc was around 100 cases, which makes it as \"rare as the proverbial hen's teeth\". I was fortunate enough to have tasted Musigny Blanc once, during the early days of wine collecting. Sadly, I did not fully understand my good fortune at the time. What about Bourgogne Blanc itself? It is still just occasionally possible to acquire a bottle or two of this.\n\nBourgogne Blanc 2002, Domaine Comte Georges de Vogue\n\nAugust 2011 in a very crowded Chinese seafood restaurant in Port Klang. We brought the bottle.\n\nVery light yellow with tint of green; light bouquet lemony, very delicate. Very complex flavours - pears, pineapple, pomelo, almonds. Very long and very delicate taste of good ripe fruit. A hauntingly long finish. Exquisite. The wine was then nine years old. It is now two years older. Perhaps time to look at it again?\n\nThis Musigny Blanc/Bourgogne Blanc, Domaine Comte de Vogue is a classic example of the frustration one has to live with when studying Burgundy. There are wines that are impossible to acquire, whatever you are prepared to pay for it. You can buy a Romanee-Conti, or even a Henri Jayer Cros Parantoux today - all you need is a deep purse. But not a Musigny Blanc - not yet anyway. Perhaps in five years' time when the vines are old enough to meet DOC's requirements for Grand Cru.\n\nHarlan Estate, Oakville, Napa Valley\n\nIt has been quite some time since we have seen any wine producer from Napa Valley, a matter of great regret. Gone are the days when Robert Mondavi would come on his periodic visits, and then there were also the occasional visits by the people from Cakebread Cellars, Far Niente, and Opus One. So, it was a most pleasant surprise when I found myself sitting down to a rare dinner treat. The guest of honour was Don Weaver of Harlan Estate. Don had kindly brought along with him a magnum of one of Harlan Estate's early successes and which had been highly praised worldwide - RP 100 - the Harlan Estate 1994 which proved to be the star of the evening.\n\nHarlan Estate is generally regarded as one of California's \"cult wines\", in company with Screaming Eagle, Colgin Estate and others. Bill Harlan who founded this eponymous Estate in 1984 had an overriding ambition, to produce California's first First Growth. The first commercial vintage was 1990, released in 1996. The estate is planted with Cabernet Sauvignon 70 per cent, Merlot 20 per cent, and Cabernet Franc 8 per cent and Petit Verdot 2 per cent a very Bordeaux-like mix!\n\nHarlan Estate 1994 in magnum\n\nA very dark red with brownish tints, a still youthful and very fragrant, very cabernet aroma, lots of cedar wood and cassis, very seductive. Very, very impressive on the palate, a big dense concentrated wine, packed with ripe blackberry fruit, very tasty because it was so ripe and sweet. Still amazingly youthful at nearly 20 years old, partly the effects of being in magnum format. A very rich wine, very Cabernet-dominated, a hot-climate style as evidenced by the great ripeness of the fruit. Well balanced because rich as it was, it remained fresh, very seductive, and yet not cloying. The richness produced by the Napa Valley climate was well offset by its freshness. You could go on drinking this wine, every swallow being followed by an instinctive reaching out for the glass again. It would be interesting to see this wine in 10 years' time.\n\nThe evening had begun with a Chablis 2005, Domaine William Fevre, which I was delighted to see. Chablis is all too little seen on the table today, an omission greatly to be regretted. All too often, the dinner wine list begins with a Puligny or a Meursault. Domaine William Fevre, one of the most esteemed names in Chablis, and one of my favourite Chablis producers, was sold to Bouchrd Pere et Fils in 1998 following the retirement of William Fevre himself. Fortunately the wine-making style had not changed as I was very pleased to note, when in the autumn of 2000, as a member of the Grand Jury, I attended an extensive tasting of the new vintage in the Domaine's cellars in Chablis. It was very impressive.\n\nChablis Grand Cru Les Clos 2005, Domaine William Fevre.\n\nPale yellow, with that slightly flinty lightly lemony aroma of Chablis wines. Very youthful. This was reflected also on the palate which showed good density and concentration, very good freshness and ripeness. The wine tasted of a mixture of citrusy tropical fruit, with a flavour which always reminds me of what hay would taste like (!), but is actually more due to the mixed nuts. Very, very youthful, needs a lot more time. This wine will age beautifully, give it another 10 years!\n\nThis brings me back to one of my favourite hobby-horses - patience and long ageing of wines. Patience has its rewards!\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last year's edition of the Singapore Airshow snagged more than US$30 billion in orders for commercial and military aircraft, the bulk of which came from Indonesia's Lion Air.\n\nStill, the demand for space at the fourth edition of the biennial Singapore Airshow from Feb 11 to 16 has been strong; 95 per cent of the exhibition space at the Changi Exhibition Centre has already been leased.\n\nThe venue offers 40,000 sq m of indoor space and 100,000 sq m outdoors for displaying aircraft.\n\nNew exhibitors at the show include Canada-based Vector Aerospace, Japan logistics services provider Nippon Express, the Singapore Flying College and Switzerland's ExecuJet Aviation Group.\n\nMore than seven in 10 show participants who have booked space are returning exhibitors such as established players Airbus, Boeing, ST Engineering and French aerospace group Thales.\n\nMr Lau said bookings came in faster for next year's show than for the previous one. Experia Events started accepting bookings in July 2012, at the Farnborough Airshow.\n\nThe 2012 Singapore Airshow attracted 900 companies from 50 countries. The trade delegates from 134 countries and regions numbered about 44,800, and visitors, more than 90,000 over the two days the show was open to the public.\n\nMr Lau said that although next year's show will have about the same number of exhibiting companies as 2012, the number of trade delegates will go up 10 to 15 per cent.\n\nNext year's show will introduce a \"feature country\" - the United States, an active participant at every Singapore Airshow, will be represented by more than 150 companies. This \"feature country\" series is aimed at bolstering bilateral trade between Singapore and other nations.\n\nThe upcoming airshow will also incorporate an aviation training zone for companies to showcase their products and services for pilot training, an increasingly important area as air travel continues to grow.\n\nStatic displays at the show will include Boeing's Dreamliner, military and commercial helicopters and a range of business jets from planemakers such as Cessna, Gulfstream, Embraer and Bombardier.\n\nThe event organiser is hoping to get Airbus to display its upcoming A350 wide-body plane, which will be operated by carriers such as Singapore Airlines.\n\nIn addition, the show will coincide with a series of high-level conferences catering to the global aviation industry, such as the Singapore Airshow Aviation Leadership Summit (SAALS), the Asia-Pacific Security Conference and the A*Star Aerospace Technology Leadership Forum.\n\nMinister for Transport Lui Tuck Yew will attend the SAALS, at which International Air Transport Association director-general Tony Tyler will deliver a speech.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They have grown so comfortable with each other that they practically finish each other's sentences during an interview with BT earlier this week.\n\nFerrari says that she has become fast friends with Laurent and that the chemistry they have developed is crucial to the acting. \"If you pretend, it won't work; we trust each other a lot,\" says the 23-year-old, who has previously worked on the French and Italian versions of the musical over the last four years.\n\nThe Italian actress has spent two of those starring opposite Laurent, who has also made a name for himself on the show and is a Notre Dame de Paris veteran, having been in it for the last 15 years. \"Initially, I thought I was only going to do 30 shows but I've done about 700 now,\" laughs the Canadian native, 46.\n\nThe pair are in Singapore for a promotional tour of the musical based on Victor Hugo's 1831 novel of the same name. The gothic rock opera will open here next month and is the brainchild of award-winning lyricist and composer Luc Plamondon and Richard Cocciante respectively.\n\nThe English lyrics were penned by Will Jennings, who was behind the Celine Dion hit, My Heart Will Go On. The pop diva can also be heard performing the song Live For The One I Love on the Notre Dame de Paris soundtrack album.\n\nThe musical premiered in Paris in 1998 and has enjoyed sell-out tours in France, Canada, England, Switzerland, Russia, Spain, America, Italy, Monaco and South Korea. Over 4,000 performances have been staged before 10 million people in more than 20 countries and it still holds the record for the show with the most successful first year of any musical ever produced in the Guinness Book of Records.\n\nProducer Nicolas Talar attributes the success of Notre Dame de Paris to the timeless story. Citing the song Cast Away which depicts the plight of illegal immigrants who had no human rights in 15th century France, as an example, he says that the problem is something that is still very true to this day.\n\nFerrari says that playing Esmeralda has brought out the passionate and emotional side of her in real life that she never knew she had. Laurent, on the other hand, claims he channels his inner Quasimodo by relating to all the heartbreaks he's had to suffer in life.\n\nLaurent is a well-known recording artiste back home and often wins over the crowd with his spontaneity and rock-star charisma. While on tour in Korea, he entertained the audience with his K-pop impression and it went down so well he was asked to repeat it while in China. There, he had to memorise the lyrics of Teresa Teng's The Moon Represents My Heart just moments before he performed it.\n\nNot to be outdone, the pint-sized Ferrari leaves a lasting impression with her big voice - something she attributes to singing along to AC/DC and Guns N' Roses rock anthems since she was 15.

The film is notably well cast, with dynamic, appealing leads that are comfortably committed to their roles and top-notch veterans in secondary parts.\n\nHeading the list is Jennifer Lawrence as the memorably-named Katniss, whose prowess with a bow and arrow is matched only by her ability to annoy the cruelly totalitarian leader of the fictional country where the games take place. Lawrence, fresh from her Oscar-winning performance in Silver Linings Playbook, picks up where she left off in the first film. She's required to show more vulnerability this time around - haunted by the bad memories from her first Games - but she's equally convincing in action-heroine mode.\n\nKatniss and fellow tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are forced by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to continue with their fake romance, devised in the first film as a subversive act that would ensure their survival as joint winners of the games. Under normal circumstances, representatives from each district would have to fight to the death until a single victor emerges from the carnage. They embark on a state-sponsored victor's tour around the impoverished districts, where they notice the growing anti-government discord that has been fuelled in large part by Katniss' open defiance of the regime. She becomes a symbol of hope for the rebellion.\n\nMeanwhile, a peeved President Snow orders his storm-troopers to crack down on dissenters, and new head gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) proposes a diabolical wrinkle to this year's games: contestants will be selected from the pool of previous winners, meaning Katniss has to do battle once again.\n\nKatniss is plagued by nightmares and is troubled by having to leave her real boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) back in the district to fend for himself. To prepare for the games, she and Peeta are mentored once more by Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), a perpetual drunk who is their district's only other past winner. His advice to Katniss: \"Stay alive.\"\n\nA substantial chunk of the movie is over by the time the games even get underway. Then it's Lost meets Survivor in a giant domed tropical arena as Katniss, Peeta and their fellow contestants contend with a number of hazards while trying to stay alive - including lightning strikes, torrential blood, a deadly fog bank and, for a bit of variety, a hostile baboon troop.\n\nIt's hard to keep a good girl warrior down, though. The final book will be presented in two parts and Games devotees will have to wait another year for the penultimate film to be released. Until then, the odds - and the box-office gods - will forever be in Katniss' favour.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it is probably time to be realistic and realise that this isn't a sure path for owners to enjoy windfalls through en-bloc sales,\" said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research.\n\nGiven that the government has successfully unlocked land from other sources, there was no need to increase plot ratios, said Alan Cheong, Savills Singapore's head of research and consultancy.\n\n\"We still have pockets of infield sites in the heartland. Why would we want to increase plot ratio in established areas and soak up demand which is going to the new regions that the government is planning?\" he asked.\n\nThe key is to expand more land and provide more communal spaces, said Donald Han, managing director of Chesterton Singapore. \"Currently, 5.3 million people live in approximately 71,400 hectare (ha), or 74 persons per ha. By 2030, another 76,000 ha will be made available for an increased population of up to 1.9 million. This reflects a lower density ratio of about 49 persons per ha,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, more focus should be given to the manufacturing sector to ensure that the real estate hardware continues to cater to the fast-changing nature of the sector, said Ms Chia.\n\nHaving shown a willingness to modify existing real estate templates to update the housing environment for the current needs of the population, such as through the introduction of public housing flats for singles and multi-generation housing units, the government needs to adopt a similar strategy to ensure that manufacturing-related companies still have a place in Singapore's factories, and are not disqualified as commercial entities in the economy, she said.\n\n\"If the government wishes to promote all spheres of business with an entrepreneurial spirit, there should also be affordable 'no-frills' commercial premises made available for businesses, including small-and-medium enterprises,\" she added.\n\nThat said, there has been a real effort to rejuvenate all the old and existing industrial spaces which have been key drivers for Singapore from the 1970s, said Desmond Sim, associate director at CBRE Research. \"(As) we are going through economic restructuring, it looks like the industrial zoning will be zoned by clusters. So if a food manufacturer is in Defu and Defu is going to (focus on) light industrial, they will encourage the food manufacturer to move to a food belt like Bedok . . . This more concerted effort to cluster complementary industries together allows for economies of scale.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He promised on Saturday to \"pull out all stops to deepen financial sector reforms\".\n\nDariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, said Mr Zhou's comments could mean that the People's Bank of China (PBOC) will widen the trading band of the yuan in the near term. \"That probably means there is more upside for the renminbi,\" he said.\n\nThe yuan, also known as the renminbi, has risen this year to 6.09 per US dollar from 6.23 at the end of 2012 and hit a record high of close to 6.08 in October.\n\nHowever, there was little evidence of any new- found freedom for the yuan in trading yesterday. On the one hand, the central bank set its daily fixing for the starting point of yuan trade at a record high, but dealers said open market gains were checked by state-run banks selling the currency, probably on behalf of the central bank.\n\nIn addition, the daily fixing has been consistently weaker than the spot market, indicating that the central bank is trying to rein in the currency's strength.\n\n\"The PBOC is still intervening heavily to prevent the CNY (yuan) from appreciating more,\" said RBS economists Louis Kuijs and Tiffany Qiu in a client note, referring to dollar trade inflows and speculation that are putting the yuan under pressure to rise. \"Freeing up the currency would imply a very large appreciation versus the US dollar, something for which we believe there would not be appetite right now.\"\n\nMr Zhou's latest comments were released as part of a public guide book to the Communist Party's reforms.\n\nIn the guide book, Mr Zhou says the central bank will gradually expand the yuan's trading band to help make the currency more flexible and market-driven - comments that repeat a long-standing central bank position.\n\n\"We will widen the floating range of the yuan exchange rate in an orderly manner and increase the two-way flexibility of the currency,\" Mr Zhou was quoted as saying.\n\nTo that end, the PBOC will \"basically\" exit from regular intervention on the currency market, he said, going slightly further than in previous comments when he had said it would reduce intervention.\n\nFor years, the central bank has bought up foreign exchange, mostly US dollars, to curb strength in the yuan fuelled by the country's export engine, building the world's biggest currency stockpile of US$3.66 trillion.\n\nSuch currency intervention has been a key driver of money and credit expansion, fanning inflationary risks and housing bubbles.\n\nThe yuan's trading band was last widened in April 2012 to allow the exchange rate to rise or fall 1 per cent either side of the midpoint fixing announced daily by the central bank. \"We must seize the favourable time window to quicken the pace of realising yuan convertibility in capital account,\" Mr Zhou said.\n\nFull convertibility would allow the free movement of capital across China's borders, a demand of many of China's trading partners.\n\nThe central bank has pledged to make the yuan \"basically convertible\" by 2015, but it has not made clear what that means.\n\nSome analysts caution against high expectations for the speed of financial reform, noting that some policymakers fear that allowing the currency to move freely too quickly could expose the economy to volatile capital flows, such as the ones blamed on the US Federal Reserve's economic stimulus programme.\n\nAnalysts expect the central bank to unveil a long-awaited deposit insurance system by the end of this year or early in 2014 to pave the way for freeing up bank deposit rates, which are now subject to administrative caps.\n\nSuch a scheme would protect depositors as Beijing is concerned that some smaller lenders could go under as banks compete for deposits in a more open regime.\n\nEarlier this year, the central bank removed controls on lending rates.\n\n\"We will choose a time when conditions are ripe to lift controls on deposit rates, which we think is the final step of liberalising interest rates,\" PBOC vice-governor Hu Xiaolian told a forum in Beijing yesterday.\n\nThe reforms are aimed at helping Beijing engineer a shift in the giant economy away from investment- and exports-led growth to activity fuelled more by consumption and services. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

OpenNet also began to offer installation capacity on Saturdays. However, it takes time for OpenNet's contractor to increase installation capacity as they will need to hire and train new teams to ensure that the additional installation capacity is met.\"\n\nOpenNet has until the year-end to clean up its act in terms of QOS standards for its residential end-user connection services. IDA will once again size up OpenNet's performance in Q1 next year.\n\nAsked whether the deadline was feasible yesterday, OpenNet said that \"additional initiatives have been proposed to IDA and (are) currently under discussion\". \"Together with the quarterly adjustment to the installation capacity, we expect the QOS performance for residential connections to improve with these initiatives.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/latest-news-bloomberg-about-big-changes", "site_title": "The latest news from Bloomberg is about big changes", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nThe latest news from Bloomberg is about big changes\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nMONDAY was a big day for layoffs over at Bloomberg, and Kara Bloomgarden-Smoke has the official memo from editor-in-chief Matt Winkler. In typical Bloomberg style, the defenestrations seem to be taking place in much the same way as they would on Wall Street, with reporters being escorted from the building, never to return. (Bloomberg has a formal policy that once you've left, even if your departure was not of your own choosing, you can't come back.)\n\nI received a phone call from one Bloomberg employee of very long standing who used terms like \"Lord of the Flies\" and \"culture of fear\"; he said that he had never seen anything like this during his long career at the company. Employees were even reportedly flocking to the local Starbucks to view the latest NMA video about Bloomberg News on their phones, because they didn't dare watch it on their work computers.\n\nIf you take a step back from the chaos, however, it's possible to see the beginnings of a deep change in how the Bloomberg newsroom is run. The message I'm getting from the layoffs is that Bloomberg is finally growing out of Winkler's insecurities, and is beginning to shape the newsroom into more of a means to an end, and less of an end in itself.\n\nTo understand what's going on, it's important to have a vague feel for where the power really lies within Bloomberg LP. Winkler is undoubtedly a powerful man - he oversaw the rise and rise of Bloomberg News, and he is a close confidante of Michael Bloomberg, co-writing his autobiography along the way. But while Winkler is powerful, he's no Tom Secunda.\n\nSecunda, a co-founder of the company, is the other Bloomberg billionaire, the man in charge of basically everything which makes money at Bloomberg. And Secunda is the opposite of a romantic press baron: all he's interested in is profitability.\n\nWinkler's enormous achievement, of building one of the world's foremost news organisations from scratch, required an aggressive, underdog spirit. Bloomberg News is a highly competitive organisation, and Winkler wanted to beat everybody, on everything, all the time. His goal for Bloomberg News was always that it be faster, broader, deeper, more accurate, more trustworthy - on every story, compared to every competitor.\n\nThat goal put Winkler at odds, to some degree, with Secunda, whose only priority is client service, and giving Bloomberg subscribers whatever they want. And it turns out that Bloomberg subscribers, although they definitely want market-moving news ahead of anybody else, are much less fussed about the broad mass of news stories which don't move markets.\n\nSo while Winkler was building up a substantial investigative journalism group, or creating the Bloomberg Muse franchise to cover the arts, Secunda was grumbling, asking why Bloomberg News needed to provide any of that kind of stuff. Couldn't Bloomberg subscribers find just as good content in such areas from the New York Times wire, if they needed it?\n\nThe answer, of course, was yes, but that was not an answer that Winkler ever wanted to hear: his competitive drive didn't end at actionable news. He wanted to win everything, all the way down to sporting results and book reviews.\n\nIn recent years, Winkler has been losing a bit of his former power. New areas of editorial - most obviously Bloomberg View and Bloomberg Businessweek - have been set up largely outside his purview: while he's nominally in charge of both, he has little actual control of either - as some of Businessweek's most notorious covers will attest. And then, this summer, the Atlantic's Justin Smith was hired to the newly-created job of Bloomberg Media CEO.\n\nSmith's main qualification for the job was that he took a company which was bleeding millions and turned it into a profitable, digitally-savvy news organisation. And while Bloomberg News doesn't have a profit mandate - its main job is to provide news to terminal clients, not to be profitable in its own right - it was clear that Smith was being charged with making the organisation rather less wasteful, and with ensuring that if Bloomberg was doing something, it was doing it for a good reason.\n\nThus was created a procedure which had never happened at Bloomberg News before. \"We evaluated everything we're doing,\" said Winkler, in his memo, \"to determine what's working and what isn't, with the single aim to ensure all we do has maximum impact\".\n\nNo more would Bloomberg News try to beat everyone on everything: from here on in, it would concentrate only on those areas where it could really move the needle.\n\nPut like that, it was pretty clear where layoffs would be coming. Bloomberg TV is watched by, to a first approximation, nobody - and loses more than US$100 million a year. Bloomberg Muse created some wonderful content, but, again, almost nobody read it - and it was hard to make a case that it was producing extraordinary material that no one else could equal.\n\nAs for the investigative unit - well, investigations are part and parcel of any serious news organisation, and Bloomberg News is nothing if not a serious news organisation. But again, the unit was looking bloated, it wasn't reaching a wide readership, and the terminal clients didn't much care about what it produced. If they weren't interested, then at the very least the investigations should have some kind of popular impact, and help to bolster the reputation of Bloomberg News within the global elite.\n\nThus did Smith give Josh Tyrangiel, the editor of Bloomberg Businessweek and one of the very few people inside Bloomberg News to have proven himself largely independent of Winkler, a broader remit, including pretty much all the problem areas: investigations, Bloomberg Muse, and - at least temporarily - Bloomberg TV.\n\nThe pruning was severe, just as it was when Tyrangiel took over Businessweek. But Winkler is clear that even after these cuts, Bloomberg News is going to have a greater headcount next year than it did before this week's firings. It's still growing: it just no longer feels the need to try to beat every other media organisation on things as peripheral to its terminal business as arts coverage and match reports.\n\nAll of this should make Secunda happy - while at the same time emphasising the fact that Smith and Tyrangiel now have a significant degree of control over a newsroom which used to belong solely and unambiguously to Winkler. And while the Winkler regime had its idiosyncrasies, it didn't pull its punches.\n\nNow, however, Bloomberg News is increasingly a direct threat to the success of Bloomberg LP, in a world where China represents the company's biggest growth opportunity and just one of the two things that Mike Bloomberg has declared to be in his \"long-range plans\" after his successor's inauguration as New York City mayor.\n\nThis is the downside of having Bloomberg News act as some kind of service provider to the terminal sales business: the terminal sales business clearly wants to minimise the impact of any critical news articles about China.\n\nAs Edward Wong of The New York Times reports: \"Editors at Bloomberg have long been aware of the need to tread carefully in China. A system has been in place that allows editors to add an internal pre-publication code to some articles to ensure that they do not appear on terminals in China, two employees said. This has been used regularly with articles on Chinese politics.\"\n\nThis is a textbook example of pulling punches: refusing to publish stories in exactly the country where they would serve the greatest purpose. I can't imagine that Winkler would have initiated such a protocol: it serves no journalistic function. But it's clear - for good and for ill - that Winkler no longer has the absolute control over Bloomberg News that he used to have. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

In last month's budget, Prime Minister Najib Razak doubled the minimum amount foreigners must spend on property and raised the capital gains tax to 30 per cent on homes they sell within five years.\n\nThe local governments of Johor state, where Iskandar is based, and Penang to the north, are considering additional tariffs on overseas buyers.\n\nWhile Horizon Hills surrounds a golf course and is luxurious by Malaysian standards, homes cost far less than in Singapore. Four-bedroom houses in the 487 hectare development, popular with expatriates, are advertised online at US$270 per square foot, compared with the US$503 per square foot asked for a four-bedroom public housing flat in Bishan.\n\nThe average price of a new 1,000-square-foot condominium in Singapore is between US$800,000 and US$960,000, according to London-based broker Savills.\n\nA similar-sized place in Kuala Lumpur costs about US$374,000, according to CBRE Group's Malaysian unit.\n\nSingapore has ramped up efforts to bring down housing costs with measures such as linking borrowers' maximum debt levels to their incomes, higher stamp duties and capital gains taxes. Home prices have still jumped 40 per cent to a record since the island-state started introducing curbs four years ago.\n\nThe gains led to Singapore being ranked the most-expensive city to buy a luxury home in Asia after Hong Kong by Knight Frank in a wealth report in March.\n\nThe difficulties of purchasing in Singapore have prompted potential buyers to explore Malaysia.\n\n\"Malaysia has certainly been the recipient of a lot of Singaporean money since the tighter cooling measures here,\" said Nicholas Holt, Knight Frank's Asia-Pacific research director. \"Singaporeans probably top the list in terms of overseas buyers in Malaysia, most notably in Iskandar, but also in Kuala Lumpur and Penang.\"\n\nThat's prompting Malaysia to act, joining Hong Kong and mainland China, in seeking to cool surging housing markets to help combat concerns over affordability and prevent a housing debacle from emerging in the financial system.\n\nMalaysia's central bank shortened the maximum length on mortgages in July, saying household indebtedness had risen by an average 12 per cent per annum in the past five years.\n\nLast month, the government barred developers from helping home buyers by absorbing some interest payments on loans.\n\nMalaysians have accumulated South-east Asia's highest level of household borrowings at 80.5 per cent of gross domestic product, according to Bank of America Corp's Merrill Lynch unit.\n\nB Shashikumar, a 32-year-old Malaysian bank manager, wants to buy a home before he gets married.\n\n\"Even with my RM5,000 (S$1,956) monthly salary, I can't buy a house in Kuala Lumpur or Selangor below RM300,000,\" said Mr Shashikumar, who typically spends three hours each day commuting to and from work in Malaysia's capital from Shah Alam, a city where he lives with his parents. \"I'll have to find one in another state. It's difficult to get high loans for a house in the city.\"\n\nAverage Malaysian home values rose 43 per cent to a record in the four-and-a-half-years to June, according to government data.\n\nPrices in Kuala Lumpur climbed 62 per cent to RM605,711 between the start of 2009 and the end of the second quarter this year, said CBRE, citing government data. They rose 49 per cent to RM298,697 in Penang and 37 per cent to RM187,644 in Johor during the same period, the data showed.\n\nCooling measures may slow home sales, according to consultants including CBRE and Knight Frank. \"The market is expected to self-correct in the next six to 12 months,\" said Judy Ong Mei-Chen, a Kuala Lumpur-based executive director at Knight Frank.\n\nIskandar, a development zone spanning 2,217 square kilometres, three times the size of Singapore, was started in 2006 to compete for manufacturing and logistics business with its neighbour in the south. It's aimed at piggy-backing on Singapore's economic rise, just as Guangdong gained from Hong Kong, by offering lower-cost alternatives to manufacturers, food processors and energy companies.\n\nResidential neighbourhoods featuring large homes, gardens and swimming pools, are being built.\n\nSpin-offs of foreign schools and universities are also opening, offering cheaper international-standard education than Singapore, including Britain's Marlborough College, where Mr Metcalf now sends his kids.\n\nSome high-profile projects, including the Legoland Malaysia amusement park and Pinewood Iskandar Malaysia Studios - a franchise of the UK-based company where James Bond films were made - are done or nearing completion in a flagship development zone called Nusajaya.\n\nWealthier foreigners are encouraged to settle in the country under the government's Malaysia My Second Home Programme, which provides them with renewable 10-year multiple-entry social visit passes.\n\nAbout 77 per cent of the 22,709 people who have applied are from Asia, with the largest number of recent arrivals coming from China, government data showed.\n\nSingaporeans account for 70 per cent of overseas buyers in Malaysia, making them the largest group of foreign purchasers, Wan Abdullah Wan Ibrahim, chief executive officer of UEM Sunrise Bhd, told reporters on Nov 13.\n\nUEM, which is co-developing Horizon Hills with Gamuda Bhd, is the biggest landowner in Iskandar.\n\n\"The impact of the budget measures will be temporary,\" Mr Wan Abdullah said. \"Developers are very creative. We will find other means of attracting buyers.\"\n\nUEM, UOA Development and Mah Sing Group may post slower sales growth due to the cooling measures, K&N Kenanga Holdings said in a research note dated Oct 28, predicting a knee-jerk reaction to foreigners' appetite in the next few months.\n\nUEM shares have fallen 12 per cent since Mr Najib announced property cooling measures on Oct 25. UOA dropped 12 per cent and Mah Sing is down 9 per cent in the same period, underperforming a 0.5 decline in the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index.\n\n\"Currently, Malaysia has a rather low number of foreign purchasers despite having one of the most accommodative environments for property investment in the region,\" Leong Hoy Kum, Mah Sing's group managing director, said in an e-mailed response. \"This means that should sales be slower, it may not have a very strong impact on the market in terms of pricing and sales volume.\"\n\nJohor is planning to impose an additional 2 per cent tariff on buyers from overseas across all segments of the property market from May, The Business Times of Malaysia reported, citing Koh Moo Hing, chairman of the Johor branch of the Real Estate and Housing Developers' Association.\n\nPenang is seeking public feedback on proposals to introduce a 3 per cent levy on foreigners purchasing homes next year, Lim Guan Eng, the state's chief minister, said last month.\n\n\"If I buy a property, I'm not going to buy it to speculate,\" Mr Metcalf said. \"I want to buy a house that I can live in and the kids can grow up in and that we can call home.

This is even though Marina South will be the last of the three areas to see work start.\n\nDevelopment is slated after 2017/2018, while Kampong Bugis may launch after 2016 and Holland Village by 2015.\n\n\"Marina South will be well received by investors ... as it will be near to CBD,\" said Ong Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research. \"Tenants, especially expatriates, need this convenience.\"\n\nThe 21.5 hectares of developable land at Marina South, part of the future Greater Southern Waterfront, will be a mixed-use residential district with the likes of 9,000 private homes and an underground mall.\n\nAlice Tan, head of research at Knight Frank Singapore, called the plans for Marina South, just off Gardens by the Bay, a \"well thought-through strategy\" by planners to construct high-quality recreational spaces first, similar to what was done in Punggol. This allows the initial investment into recreational facilities to enhance land value in the future.\n\nChia Siew Chuin, director of research and advisory at Colliers International, believes there will be an \"overall metamorphosis of an area currently devoid of vibrancy\" when work there is completed.\n\nKeppel Land's president (Singapore), Tan Swee Yiow, said Marina South \"will be the centrepiece of Singapore's urban transformation and add vibrancy to Singapore's New Downtown\".\n\nHe also sees the Greater Southern Waterfront as complementing efforts to transform Keppel Bay. Keppel Land is behind several projects in the broader area, including Marina Bay Financial Centre and Reflections at Keppel Bay.\n\nConsultants expect Kampong Bugis, near Kallang Riverside, to benefit from the upcoming completion of the Sports Hub next year, which will draw human traffic. The 18 ha of land to be developed at Kampong Bugis will result in about 4,000 private homes.\n\nThis should allow it to take off where Kallang Riverside, which had been a growth area identified in the previous Master Plan, could not.\n\nAs for Holland Village, analysts see interest from owner-occupiers attracted to the lifestyle area, expatriates on lower benefits, as well as from workers from the nearby one-north.\n\n\"It is a popular locale among the local and expatriate population and (is in) a prime location,\" said Lee Lay Keng, head of Singapore research at DTZ.\n\nThe six-hectare extension of Holland Village will feature a mixed-use development with an underground parking station and two residential sites. In all, about 1,500 new homes will be available.\n\nThe prevalence of mixed-use projects was a notable feature in the Draft Master Plan, a fact welcomed by CapitaLand, which has said its new focus will be on such developments.\n\n\"We will study the details and identify areas where we can leverage our multi-sectoral capabilities to add value to the locations earmarked for development,\" a spokesman for CapitaLand said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The acquisition is expected to be completed by Q4 2014.\n\nThe latest valuation of the property as at Nov 19, 2013, commissioned by CMA and conducted by CBRE Limited, is 2.2 billion yuan.\n\nTaking into account this valuation, the purchase consideration payable to Greenland Real Estate for the acquisition is 2.19 billion yuan.\n\nThe shopping mall is located at Baiyun Greenland Centre, an integrated development at the junction of Yuncheng West Road and Qixin Road within the core commercial centre of Baiyun New Town in Baiyun District.\n\nBaiyun District is the most populous district in Guangzhou with a population of more than 2.2 million. A number of companies are headquartered in Baiyun District, and Baiyun New Town is positioned as the new regional centre of northern Guangzhou.\n\nThe eight-storey shopping mall will have a total gross floor area, excluding car park, of about 86,000 square metres. It will be positioned as a shopping destination with a lifestyle supermarket, Cineplex, international and local fashion brands, as well as a wide range of food and beverage outlets.\n\nThe mall will also be connected to the Baiyun Park subway station on Line 2, making it the only shopping mall in Baiyun New Town that is directly connected to a subway station.\n\nIt is targeted to open in phases from 2014.\n\nLim Beng Chee, CMA's CEO, said he is confident about growth prospects of the retail sector. \"This new mall in Guangzhou will mark our strategic entry into a first-tier city in South China. We will leverage on our established team in South China, which has been in Guangdong Province since 2005, to manage the new mall.\"\n\nHe said the acquisition was part of CMA's strategy to selectively expand its footprint in China, while strengthening its presence in the cities and regions it is already in.\n\nIncluding this development, CMA now has 62 shopping malls in 37 cities in China, of which 51 are operational while the other 11 are under development.\n\nThe counter closed three cents lower at $2.01 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/hedge-accounting-sees-substantial-overhaul", "site_title": "Hedge accounting sees substantial overhaul", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nHedge accounting sees substantial overhaul\n\nNew model enables firms to better reflect risk-management activities: IASB chief\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] The much-awaited new hedge-accounting model, released by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in the UK on Tuesday, represents a substantial overhaul of hedge accounting - arguably the most complex accounting standard out there.\n\nIASB chairman Hans Hoogervorst said: \"This is a significant change in accounting that enables companies to better reflect their risk-management activities (and) has received strong support from corporates around the world.\"\n\nThe new model was drawn up in response to concerns raised by preparers of financial statements about the difficulty of understanding and applying hedge-accounting rules.\n\nMr Hoogervorst said: \"It makes it easier for (entities) to really show their activities to minimise their economic risk. It takes out the mathematical bright lines in current hedge accounting and retraces them with more qualitative criteria. It's more principle-based and will therefore be easier to retain hedge accounting.\"\n\nChen Voon Hoe, Singapore Accounting Advisory leader at PwC Singapore, said he believes the IASB has tried very hard to address the issues surrounding hedge accounting: \"To me, the most notable achievement is that this new hedging standard actually simplifies the accounting for hedging transactions. Most of the proposed new standards or amendments tend to introduce greater complexity to accounting.\"\n\nHedge accounting is a method of accounting in which entries for the ownership of a security and the opposing hedge are treated as one with the aim of reducing the volatility created by the repeated adjustment of a financial instrument's value.\n\nThe new model for doing this is part of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which will replace IAS 39. The IASB was pushed to review IAS 39 in the wake of the global financial crisis, after policymakers criticised fair-value accounting for amplifying the credit crunch.\n\nIts chapter on hedge accounting aligns the accounting more closely with risk management, and improves the related disclosures. It also makes improvements to the reporting of changes in the fair value of an entity's own debt contained in IFRS 9 more readily available.\n\nWard Coombs, assurance partner in Financial Services at EY, said: \"The new model is significantly different in the approach taken and in the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Under the new standard, entities that did not apply hedge accounting in the past due to the administration burden now have a way to proceed in applying hedge accounting.\"\n\nThe most significant improvements apply to those that hedge non-financial risk. Previously, hedge accounting could not be applied to components of non-financial items and groups of items, so businesses could not show in their financial statements the fact that they were entering into derivatives for hedge-accounting purposes.\n\nOng Pang Thye, who heads Audit at KPMG in Singapore, pointed out: \"Airlines, shipping and other industries that have to manage significant commodity price exposures will have the most to gain from the new ability to apply hedge accounting for risk components of non-financial items.\n\n\"A company will be able to reflect in its financial statements an outcome that is more consistent with how management assesses and mitigates risks for key inputs into its core business.\"\n\nMr Chen said: \"The new standard removes the rigid 80 per cent to 125 per cent effectiveness testing requirements, allowing a greater flexibility to designate a component of non-financial instruments, deferring time value and forward points of options and forwards.\n\n\"This translates to a broad-based improvement for a wide range of companies for those with simple foreign-exchange forwards to those with more complex commodity hedges. This will result in wider adoption of hedge accounting and reduced volatility.\"\n\nStill, there will be challenges. Mr Ong said: \"More may have to be done to guide organisations in implementing this new standard. Significant effort may be needed to analyse the requirements of this new standard and determine how best to apply them to a company's particular circumstances.\"\n\nThe Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) said the new standard will require more disclosures because it is more principles-based than the standard it replaces.\n\nNigel Sleigh-Johnson, head of ICAEW's Financial Reporting Faculty, said: \"More judgment means an increased need for disclosures. That may be a challenge for some. What is critical is that the longer disclosures don't result in key information becoming obscured.\"\n\nAs for how and when this will affect Singapore, experts say the Accounting Standards Council (ASC), which sets standards here, is likely to wait for the IASB's completion of the entire IFRS 9 project before adopting the standard here.\n\nThe IASB is continuing to consider limited amendments to the classification and measurement requirements already included in IFRS 9 and is working on finalising the new expected credit loss impairment model. It has therefore removed the Jan 1, 2015, mandatory effective date for the standard.\n\nMr Coombs said: \"It may be difficult for the ASC to consider adoption without first understanding the final impairment guidelines that will be released in future. There may be some companies in Singapore which would like to adopt the version as released on Tuesday night so as to implement hedge accounting, and the ASC will likely survey to see if there is such interest in early adoption.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The safety offered is enough of a draw that the companies are tackling cultural differences and unfamiliar approval processes, and at times accepting lower returns.\n\nIn the United States, the six biggest metropolitan areas have attracted US$2.88 billion in commercial real estate investment by Chinese companies this year, up from US$321 million in all of 2012, according to New York-based research firm Real Capital Analytics Inc. The data include both completed and pending transactions. Manhattan and other New York City boroughs were the two biggest areas for deals, with Los Angeles third.\n\nThe Chinese are adding to a wave of investment in top markets by buyers including sovereign wealth funds, real estate investment trusts and private equity firms. In the six major US metro areas, commercial property prices reached a five-year high in August, the latest month for which figures are available, and are up 6.2 per cent this year, according to Moody's Investors Service and Real Capital Analytics.\n\nIn exchange for relative safety, Shanghai-based Chiway Holding Group Co is prepared to settle for an internal rate of return of about 15 per cent on US projects, less than the 30 per cent to 50 per cent more common in China, chairman Jianrong Qian said in Los Angeles, the first stop on a tour organised by the China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"These types of returns are going to end in China too,\" said Mr Qian, whose company has built about 12 million square metres of mostly residential buildings in eastern Chinese cities including Shanghai. \"They will have to level out at some point. But it's hard to predict, and it makes business-planning for the future difficult in China.\"\n\nGreenland Holding Group Co, the Shanghai-based builder of one of China's tallest towers, has emerged as one of the largest Chinese investors in the US. In October, the company signed a memorandum of understanding to buy a 70 per cent share of Brooklyn's US$5 billion Atlantic Yards project. Greenland's investment in the nine-hectare development, which was approved in 2006 and has been delayed in part by the recession, involves 14 apartment buildings and one office property.\n\n\"The trend for Chinese companies going abroad has just started,\" Greenland chairman Zhang Yuliang said in Shanghai. The company's projects include four of the world's 10 tallest buildings, and it has developments in more than 80 Chinese cities.\n\nGreenland is providing funding for the Atlantic Yards project while Forest City Ratner Cos, the site's original developer, will manage the day-to-day tasks. Such an arrangement is common for Chinese developers seeking US partners to navigate the local building processes and cultural differences.\n\nThe Chinese \"realise it's more efficient to have a local partner\", Mr Gaw said. \"The ones who try to do it on their own will have the hardest time. It's not financial but a cultural problem.\"\n\nIn San Francisco, China Vanke Co, the nation's biggest publicly traded developer, has teamed with New York-based Tishman Speyer Properties LP to develop the 655-unit Lumina high-rise towers in the South of Market area. Vanke, based in Shenzhen, has the majority equity position in the US$620 million complex, while Tishman is the developer and project manager.\n\nThe companies have discussed possible sites for a second high-rise housing project in the city, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Tishman is trying to assemble parking lots into a large parcel for the construction site, and is negotiating with San Francisco officials because some of the lots are owned by the city, said one of the people.\n\nIn Los Angeles, developer Joseph Moinian is selling a 1.8 ha site designated for a retail, hotel and residential complex with a potential value of US$900 million. The land sits near the Staples Center, the downtown arena where the Lakers basketball team plays, and is a few blocks south of a site where Greenland agreed to buy a US$1 billion stake in a 2.4 ha apartment, hotel and office development.\n\nMr Moinian said he's received five \"serious\" bids, more than one of which was from Chinese investors. \"Investors see the potential of a development site such as ours,\" said Mr Moinian, chief executive officer of New York-based Moinian Group. \"Chinese tend to have a longer investment horizon, so this is very attractive to them.\"\n\nOffshore investments by Chinese developers are being fuelled in part by the government's tacit endorsement through a \"hands off\" approach, Mr Gaw said. \"The fact that the government hasn't stepped in and stopped any of these deals is also a message\" that Chinese companies can continue building internationally, he said.\n\nIn 2009, China loosened rules governing local companies' direct investments overseas, broadening the types of funding allowed and scrapping other rules to help them seize opportunities with lower investment costs, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. \"The government hasn't gone as far as actually giving incentives to developers like us for investing abroad, but they have relaxed the restrictions and made it easier,\" Mr Qian said.\n\nWhile limitations on developments abroad have loosened, curbs at home have been helping drive Chinese developers to seek opportunities in places such as the US.\n\nChina's government has instated limits on homebuying as a way of cooling the booming market. In September, new-home prices in the country's four biggest cities jumped the most since January 2011, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Oct 22.\n\nIn an attempt to slow the increases, China's government is limiting members of one family to owning no more than two homes in major cities such as Beijing, restricting mortgage lending and enforcing 20 per cent capital gains rules on some sales, according to Omer Ozden, managing partner of the private equity unit of Beijing Capital, whose investments include real estate overseas. The rules have prompted some people to get divorced or enter \"fake\" marriages to circumvent the limits, he said.\n\nEven stricter rules are expected at the end of the year, including guidance from the government on how high builders may price residential units, Mr Ozden said. Developers and investors are responding to the restrictions by seeking deals elsewhere.\n\n\"It is cooling demand and limiting the pace of growth for Chinese real estate developers,\" Mr Ozden said. \"Even though the demand is still there, even though people still want to buy, the government is imposing restrictions to slow things down.\"\n\nLast year, in a separate advisory role, Mr Ozden represented Beijing-based residential developer Xinyuan Real Estate Co in its acquisition of waterfront land in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighbourhood for the construction of 216 condominiums.\n\nIn cities such as New York, Chinese developers are betting on rising demand from the increasing number of wealthy Chinese seeking property outside their own country, including homes for children studying abroad, according to Mr Ozden and Mr Qian. Xinyuan's project, called the Oosten - the Dutch word for east - is scheduled to begin construction by the end of the year, and is expected to have a \"significant\" number of pre-sales to buyers who live in China once marketing begins, Mr Ozden said.\n\nIt isn't as common for US developers to invest in real estate in China, said Gregory Karns, a Los Angeles-based lawyer at Cox, Castle & Nicholson LLP, who has been advising Chinese companies for more than two decades.\n\nPrologis Inc, the world's biggest owner of industrial real estate, on Nov 11 said it would form a venture to build and buy properties in the country. The venture, the San Francisco-based company's second in China, has an investment capacity of more than US$1 billion, including US$588 million of committed equity.\n\n\"There are certainly US firms investing in Chinese real estate, but it's less so than the Chinese investing here,\" Mr Karns said. \"For one, it's easier to invest in US property than in China. Essentially, all you need is money. But there is also a higher level of certainty in the US.\"\n\nThe surge in Chinese real estate development overseas is reminiscent of the Japanese wave of property investments in the US and other countries in the 1980s, which included purchases of New York's Rockefeller Center and California's Pebble Beach golf course. While the push for globalisation and diversification by investors is similar, the timing is quite different, according to Mr Karns.\n\n\"The Japanese set the top of the market and kept pushing it higher and higher,\" he said. \"Just like with the Chinese today, there was this push to internationalise investments. But what's working in the Chinese favour is that the US is coming out of a real estate recession, so prices are better.\"\n\nJapan's relatively small population and declining economy at the time of its US real estate expansion ultimately undermined the overseas investments - untrue of China and its investors, said Mr Zhang.\n\nForeign expansion by Chinese builders shows no signs of cooling. Vanke plans to increase its overseas investments to 20 per cent of development spending from 5 per cent today, with a focus on cities that have been attractive to Chinese for decades, such as San Francisco, New York and Boston, according to chairman Wang Shi.\n\nOutside the US, the UK and Australia's largest cities also are attracting Chinese developers, according to Meisheng Nie, founder of the China Real Estate Chamber of Commerce, a 5,000-\n\nmember organisation focused on growth in the property sector. Greenland Holding is seeking projects in Australia and hopes to invest more than A$1 billion (S$1.7 billion) in the country, mostly in Sydney and Melbourne, in the next two years, Mr Zhang said.\n\nThe company plans to construct 1,000 apartments on a Melbourne site and expects to open a five-star, 180-room hotel in Sydney by 2015, Sherwood Luo, managing director of Greenland Australia, said last week.\n\nIn Europe, investments have totalled US$3.82 billion this year, more than triple the amount spent in all of 2012, with London and Brussels topping the list of targeted cities, according to Real Capital Analytics.\n\nBeijing Construction Engineering Group Co last month said it formed a venture with Manchester Airports Group and other partners to build an international business district in the second-biggest UK city.

It really is stock picking, and we would expect that to continue next year.\"\n\nSome broad themes are gaining close to consensus status as 2014 approaches: The US and Japanese economies are picking up steam, but recoveries in those markets are still fragile. Europe is also getting glimpses of life, though deflation continues to threaten some of the peripheral economies.\n\n\"The eurozone overall continues to struggle,\" Schroders economist Azad Zangana said recently at the firm's international media conference in London.\n\nIn Asia, concerns about a China slowdown are balanced by confidence in restructuring efforts and by the fact that even a slower China is still growing at a robust clip.\n\nSouth-east Asia, however, is facing a threat of capital outflows as developed markets improve, while the overperformance from previous years dulls the region's attractiveness on a relative basis.\n\nThose broad themes form starting points, but asset managers stressed that the outlook remains highly sensitive to a large number of factors - when US tapering occurs, for example, and at what pace is anyone's guess - and there will be winners and losers. Figuring out how to tell them apart is therefore the challenge for next year.\n\nOne popular filter at the moment is income, with fund managers expressing a preference for dividend-paying stocks.\n\nBut the income play is shifting from traditional yield instruments, such as bonds and real estate investment trusts (Reits), towards more growth, such as dividend-paying cyclical equities.\n\n\"In a rising interest rate environment, we still recommend income products to our clients, but we are changing the complexion of the underlying investments,\" Mr Pulling said. \"We can find stocks in sectors that have high yields, but also have better growth prospects. So maybe the yield is not as secure as the yield in, say, a Reit, but the growth of the dividend might be stronger.\"\n\nMr Pulling said that stocks in cyclicals, financials and materials, in particular, are where value can still be found. And he prefers North Asia to South-east Asia, partly because valuations in Singapore and its neighbouring countries remain elevated compared to markets such as China and Korea.\n\nIn the United States, Schroders portfolio manager of US large-cap equities, Joanna Shatney, said that healthcare and industrials looked interesting because of valuations, demographics and expectations of increased capital expenditures.\n\nMs Shatney believed that the year-long US equity rally still had legs. Slow economic growth should keep the Federal Reserve dovish for longer, while margin multipliers could amplify US corporate earnings improvements.\n\n\"I'm not a believer that margins have peaked . . . There are still, if you look by sector, opportunities for margins to go up, and to be honest I don't have an official margin forecast for next year, but we think that 4 per cent topline growth can be leveraged into 200 to 300 basis points for operating income growth,\" Ms Shatney said.\n\nThe stock-picking strategy also applies to Europe, where Schroders European equities fund manager Martin Skanberg is taking a bottoms-up approach.\n\nAn accommodative central bank and drastically improved availability of credit are all supportive of economic growth, and many eurozone countries have become more competitive in the wake of the region's financial crisis, Mr Skanberg said.\n\nValuations are also extremely cheap, with price-earnings multiples far below historical averages.\n\n\"This has been historically the best predictive tool towards future returns and it looks mildly supportive for next year,\" Mr Skanberg said.\n\nBusinesses leveraged to the domestic economy of Europe, such as telecommunications, offer some of the best value at the moment, and non-periphery banks have become investible as well.\n\nThe challenge in bargain hunting is avoiding value traps, where cheap multiples accurately reflect a business' limitations rather than over-pessimism.\n\nAn investment assessment must therefore combine valuation with a view on whether there is a catalyst that will unlock the mispriced value.\n\n\"Why do we need to own this stock now? What is the inflection point?\" Mr Skanberg said.\n\n\"Because the risk is that you find all these cheap stocks, and they're value traps, or they're like the telco sector that's been underperforming for six years. You need to ask yourself why now . . . We're looking for a new management team, we're looking for a cost restructuring programme, we're looking for an acquisition, we're looking for a disposal. Changing dividend policies, or evidence that the underlying economy and their products are improving.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is assuming that OUE Bayfront is sold for the minimum price, OUE said in a circular to shareholders yesterday.\n\nOUE Bayfront is one of two assets that will form the initial portfolio of OUE C-Reit. OUE had previously also said that it will inject the 50-year leasehold Lippo Plaza, which is located in Shanghai, into the Reit.\n\nOUE's tenure for the 36-storey office and retail Lippo Plaza started in 1994. The building has a net lettable area (NLA) of 422,290 sq ft.\n\nIn its circular, OUE said that the Reit will also have first right of refusal to acquire three of OUE's commercial properties. These include the US Bank Tower in downtown Los Angeles which OUE snapped up earlier this year for US$367.5 million. Known as the tallest building in California, the US Bank Tower has a NLA of 1.4 million sq ft.\n\nThe other two properties are OUE's 40.8 per cent interest in office and retail development, One Raffles Place, which has an NLA of 862,001 sq ft, and OUE Downtown 2 and Downtown Gallery - which has an NLA of 603,016 sq ft.\n\nOUE said that it expects to hold 40 per cent of units in OUE C-Reit. \"Depending on the final offering structure, the group may hold up to 50 per cent of the units,\" it added.\n\nMedia reports quoting sources had said previously that OUE C-Reit could raise up to $700 million through its initial public offering in the first quarter of next year.\n\nOUE will be holding an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on Dec 4, 2013, for shareholders to vote on the sale of OUE Bayfront to OUE C-Reit.\n\nThe development has an overall NLA of 402,374 sq ft, with three components: the 99-year leasehold OUE Bayfront, which is an 18-storey premium office building with rooftop restaurant premises, and ancillary properties, 99-year leasehold OUE Tower - a conserved building currently occupied by a fine dining restaurant - OUE Link, a link bridge with retail units which has a 15-year leasehold title that started in 2010.\n\nIn FY2012, the property delivered net property income of $35.4 million.\n\nBased on the valuation of OUE Bayfront by Cushman & Wakefield VHS as at Sept 30, 2013, the property is valued at $1.01 billion on an \"as-is\" basis and at $1.04 billion after taking into account income support.\n\nThe EGM will also see OUE put to vote a proposal to distribute to its shareholders one stapled trust it currently holds in its hospitality Reit, OUE H-Trust, for every six OUE shares held on the books closure date.\n\nThis will be done in proportion to stakeholders' shareholdings in OUE.\n\nThe distribution will hinge on whether shareholders pass the resolution to sell OUE Bayfront, it said.\n\n\"In the event that shareholders do not approve Resolution 1 (the sale of OUE Bayfront), the company will not proceed with Resolution 2 (the distribution of OUE H-Trust stapled securities).\n\n\"Should the shareholders not vote in favour of the proposed disposal, the company will not be able to avail itself of the cash proceeds, and may have to find other means of raising the same funds, including selling the company-held OUE H-Trust stapled securities instead of distributing them to shareholders.\"\n\nPart of the proceeds raised from the OUE Bayfront sale will go towards paying down debt of US$376.6 million.\n\nIf both resolutions pass, OUE's proposed distribution of OUE H-Trust stapled securities will amount to about $133.5 million, based on 151.7 million company-held OUE H-Trust stapled securities valued at 88 cents each.\n\nThis translates into a dividend of about 15 cents per share - based on the total number of issued shares in OUE, said the group.\n\nThe distribution represents about 25.6 per cent of the stapled securities OUE holds in its hospitality Reit, OUE H-Trust. This is about 11.6 per cent of the total number of stapled securities in OUE H-Trust.\n\nOUE \"intends to retain approximately 33 to 35 per cent of the total number of OUE H-Trust stapled securities in issue\" after the distribution, it added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The two-year two billion yuan (S$408 million) bonds priced at 3.2 per cent on Tuesday night received orders hitting 5.2 billion yuan.\n\nThe issue by ICBC Singapore branch, wholly owned by ICBC, China's largest bank, scored several firsts. It is the first Chinese entity to issue a yuan bond cleared in Singapore.\n\nAt two billion yuan, it is also the biggest deal. So far, yuan bond issuances by DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank and HSBC were for 500 million yuan each while Standard Chartered's was one billion yuan.\n\nSingapore investors took up 55 per cent, Hong Kong investors, 43 per cent, and those from other markets, 2 per cent. By industry, banks and corporates were allocated 25 per cent each, while fund managers got 35 per cent and private banks, 15 per cent.\n\n\"Future bond sales will depend on business growth,\" said Zhang Weiwu, ICBC Singapore branch general manager, yesterday.\n\nICBC Singapore began yuan clearing operations at the end of May. It is also celebrating its 20th anniversary here, along with the official opening of a private banking hub and upgraded full-banking service branches. It has three outlets in Singapore.\n\nThe bank's business has grown rapidly, and it plans to open more branches in Singapore next year, said Mr Zhang.\n\nSixty-six local and foreign banks have opened yuan clearing accounts with the branch, contributing a clearing volume as much as 1.7 trillion yuan. Its first month of clearing was 60 billion yuan which has risen to around 500 billion yuan per month, he said.\n\nThe bank also launched a wide range of yuan products covering retail banking, funds settlement, trade finance, global cash management and capital market.\n\nIn the first 10 months of this year, it recorded over 120 billion yuan of cross-border settlement volume, over 26 billion yuan in assets and over 11 billion yuan in deposits.\n\n\"Our three-year strategy is leveraging on our RMB strength to become the RMB preferred bank,\" said Mr Zhang.\n\nNext year, the target is to increase RMB assets to 60 per cent of total assets from 45 per cent today, and to 70 per cent after three years, he said.\n\nAs for cross-border settlement volume, he expects that it will hit 140 billion yuan by year-end and over 200 billion yuan next year.\n\nOn yuan-bond sales by corporates in Singapore, Mr Zhang said that with the pace of yuan internationalisation picking up, more companies will have yuan funding needs.\n\nThe bank is targeting to handle bond sales by Singapore corporates as well as multinationals that have treasury headquarters here, he said.\n\nAs the yuan continues to strengthen, and given China's economic clout as the world's second-largest economy, more and more corporates are settling in the Chinese currency.\n\nInvestors, too, are piling in on yuan products, betting on its strong fundamentals.\n\nDBS said that it has grown yuan corporate loans by over 140 per cent to 46 billion yuan as at Sept 30, 2013. DBS's yuan deposits rose by 8 per cent to 38 billion yuan as at Sept 30, 2013.\n\nThis year, the yuan has been the best-performing Asian currency, up over 2 per cent against the US dollar and 4 per cent against the Singapore dollar.\n\nThe yuan is expected to appreciate further next year, up 3.4 per cent by the third quarter, according to Derek Halpenny, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ European head of global markets research.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

COE bids for certain categories, including Cat A, are valid for six months.\n\nFrom February, the COE system will be recategorised to include an additional criterion relating to engine power.\n\nWhile the Land Transport Authority (LTA) will keep the existing engine-capacity criterion for Cat A (1,600cc and under), it will limit engine power to 130 brake horsepower (bhp). This means certain makes of cars now in Cat A will be pushed into Cat B from February.\n\nDemand for Cat B COEs has continued to slip, with buyers hesitant to make their move, given that the overall economy and stock market performance has been less than rosy, Mr Lim said.\n\nHe added that the new financing restrictions will also be a dampener, as a bigger capital outlay is needed when buying a car.\n\nEarlier this year, stricter car-financing measures and a tiered car-tax structure were introduced, with the aim of discouraging over-leveraging and cooling the demand for vehicles. For instance, loan quantums for cars with an Open Market Value (OMV) of above $20,000 have been capped at 50 per cent.\n\nMeanwhile, the COE for commercial vehicles and buses is thought to have bottomed out at the $55,000 mark.\n\nPremiums for the category have corrected after rising in recent months amid the rush to register Euro 4 diesel vehicles before the tougher Euro 5 emission standards kick in come January.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rest of the space will be leased out later.\n\nThe new showroom more than doubles Hafary's existing showroom space, to about 30,000 square feet.\n\nIt is targeted at retail customers, who account for about 60 to 70 per cent of the company's business, Mr Low said.\n\n\"We feel that it's time to put up something really good, to provide this level of service to them,\" he said. \"If you look around other showrooms in Singapore, you cannot find anything comparative.\"\n\nBut Hafary could be putting more resources into a challenged market.\n\nCIMB property analyst Donald Chua said private residential property volumes have fallen significantly from a year ago. Although Build-To-Order public flats could provide some support over the next few years, \"incrementally we're seeing more and more of this demand getting soaked up already\" as well.\n\nMr Low acknowledged that the housing market is facing some headwinds, but felt that public housing supply in the next few years should provide some resilience.\n\n\"If you look at the direction of the HDB in the next five years . . . we will see the business supply,\" Mr Low said.\n\nHafary is also not restricting itself to Singapore. The company has operations in China, where the company will be doing some trading. It also has a business venture in Vietnam, where the weak economy has actually made it easier for a newcomer to gain a foothold, Mr Low said.\n\n\"In the next one to two years we should see the Vietnam side picking up,\" he said. \"When times are not so good, it's easier to penetrate the market; when times are good nobody, wants to partner you. . . We went in with a long-term view.\"\n\nMr Low said Hafary's multi-pronged strategy within the same industry should put the company on solid ground. \"We are actually growing all sections,\" he said.\n\nHafary shares closed at 23 cents, up by half a cent or 2.2 per cent, yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And we don't like anyone talking about it not being around,\" Emirates airline president Tim Clark told Reuters an interview. \"I want to make this absolutely clear, to Airbus and the EADS board, that we are here for the long term. We will take more if we can, we have demonstrated that.\"\n\nEmirates already dominated the A380 backlog with a total of 90 ordered out of 259 since it was launched in 2000. After the new deal it has 140, or almost half the planes on order.\n\nYet some other airlines have cancelled or deferred as they worry whether they can fill the giant jet in tough economic times. Industry analysts say doubts have grown over whether as many as 30 further aircraft will be delivered as planned.\n\n\"I've been very vocal with the Airbus management, saying don't bottle out of this . . . it's a really good aircraft,\" Mr Clark said.\n\nSunday's deal galvanised an already dramatic start to the Dubai Airshow, coming on top of US$100 billion in orders for a new Boeing jet including 150 for Emirates.\n\nIt also ended a dearth of orders for Europe's iconic double-decker jet. The apparent shortage of demand had fuelled internal discussion over whether to cut production and review A380 strategy, as Reuters reported last month.\n\n\"We were aware of it. But that was not the reason why we did this deal,\" Mr Clark added. \"We wouldn't place orders of this size if we were concerned about it.\"\n\nThe new agreement was sealed in less than a week. \"They (Airbus) knew nothing about it until Monday last week. We gave them a call and said we want these airplanes and this is how we want to do it,\" Mr Clark said. \"At the time, they were having issues with regard to what to actually do, slow production rate maybe.\"\n\nMr Clark said he had always considered Emirates would need at least another 25 or 30 A380s for its fleet. \"So what we then did was to re-examine the real estate at the Dubai International Airport and see how we could use every trick in the book\" to fit in more planes.\n\n\"When we did that study, the magic number came up. So we said, let's have them in,\" he said, adding, \"we could have done another 10 if we found another bit of space somewhere in the field\".\n\nAirbus officials said there had been preparatory talks for a few months, but confirmed that last week had seen a step-up in the pace of negotiations. Industry sources said the carrier had at first looked at something closer to 20-25 jets.\n\nThe sale does not immediately resolve a problem of what to do with an estimated five A380 aircraft remaining to be sold in 2015, for which the first parts must soon be ordered.\n\nThe unallocated planes are worth some US$2 billion at current list prices, most of which is usually paid on delivery.\n\nEmirates is unlikely to take delivery of those planes since they do not fit its schedule for introducing a complex new in-flight entertainment system, which must be planned well ahead.\n\nAirbus has said it needs to deliver 30 aircraft in 2015 to meet its target of breaking even on the jet that year, but that any shortfall would not have a significant impact on profits. However, it could have a stronger impact on EADS' cashflow.\n\nEmirates and Airbus both expect traffic to grow fast enough in coming years to prove the A380's worth, but increasingly share an interest in ensuring the project succeeds.\n\nBoeing says airlines prefer twin-engined planes like its new type of 777.\n\n\"We believe business will come,\" Mr Clark said, adding Emirates was already detecting signs of recovery in Europe.\n\n\"You have to fill it. Time will demonstrate that you can fill the 500-seater. I can name 10 airlines today that I'm convinced can fill the airplanes, who are not operators of the 380.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The company, which helped Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co build factories in Thailand, plans to spend about 40 billion baht over five years to boost its property, utilities and power businesses.\n\n\"They can receive a substantial amount of funds at one time from the sale of assets into the funds, allowing them to avoid increasing leverage from bank loans,\" Korawut Leenabanchong, chief investment officer at UOB Asset Management, which oversees about US$6 billion of assets, said.\n\nMr Charoen, Thailand's richest person, plans to raise about 32 billion baht from a fund backed by revenue from 12 Thai hotels, Somchai Boonnamsiri, chief executive officer of Krung Thai Asset Management Co, the fund's manager, said on Nov 15. Mr Dhanin's CP Land Co plans to raise about 10 billion baht with a fund backed by 30-year rental rights of three office buildings, said Mr Somchai, who will also manage that fund.\n\n\"A property fund would give us a new financing source,\" Mr Nardone said, adding that MFC Asset Management Pcl will oversee the fund. \"The offering should have no problem as investors are very interested.\"\n\nThe sales may test investor appetite for Thai assets after a resurgence of political unrest in the country. Overseas investors have pulled a net US$4.1 billion out of Thai equities so far this year, the most among South-east Asian markets, and the benchmark SET Index has retreated 4.5 per cent in the past month, making it Asia's worst performer, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"Property funds give investors a way to diversify away from risky equity investments,\" UOB Asset's Mr Korawut said, declining to say whether he would invest in Hemaraj's fund. \"Still, investors will be more cautious and selective with more property funds expected to come to the market.\"\n\nThai real estate funds have provided an annual yield of about 7 per cent, according to Krung Thai Asset's Mr Somchai. The country's five largest banks offer an average annual interest rate of 1.63 per cent on three-month fixed deposits, according to central bank data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe country's 44 property funds have a combined market value of 243.7 billion baht, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Thailand Property Fund Index has fallen 6.8 per cent this year after gaining 32 per cent in 2012. The SET Index has risen 1.9 per cent this year, and rallied 36 per cent in 2012.\n\nHemaraj's profit may increase at least 10 per cent next year on rising demand for industrial land and higher earnings from its power units, Mr Nardone said. Net income doubled to 826.8 million baht in the first nine months of 2013, from 408 million baht in the same period a year earlier.\n\nHemaraj operates six industrial estates on Thailand's east coast in Rayong, 146 km south east of Bangkok, and one in Saraburi province, covering a total land area of 6,313 ha, according to its website.\n\nThai property funds mobilise capital by issuing unit trusts and then investing the fund in real estate, according to the Stock Exchange of Thailand's website.

Of this, two-fifths are earmarked for wastewater and sludge treatment facilities.\n\nPrivate companies, both domestic and foreign, have been welcomed to participate. This was a significant shift from a time when the water industry was run by Chinese state-owned enterprises. Severe fresh water shortage and growing pollution due to rapid urbanisation proved too much for them to handle.\n\nSo, what was once a hot industry is now hurting some players. Competition has led to lower utilisation of constructed treatment plants, translating into lower revenue and earnings for many companies there.\n\nThe Singapore firms with footprints in China also face another kind of competition at home, where newcomers are starting to enter the water treatment arena with maiden water deals.\n\nThis year has seen engineering cum real estate group Tee International agreeing to evaluate a possible acquisition of a wastewater treatment plant in Huzhou, China. The company has also formed a consortium which won a contract to manage the water level at the Makkasan Water Catchment area in Thailand.\n\nSystems integrator CNA Group also signed a concession deal with the Dongying Economic and Technological Development Zone of Dongying City in Shandong province, China, in the industrial wastewater treatment sector.\n\nLast year, specialist relocater Chasen Holdings signed a deal for a transfer-operate-transfer project involving a purified water treatment plant and a wastewater treatment plant in Jilin, China. Engineering firm Tritech Group also clinched a deal to provide a system to monitor the pollution levels along India's River Ganges.\n\nNRA Capital analyst Jacky Lee explains it as \"a diversification into a new non-core segment for some recurring income, so that the numbers from their construction works and turnkey projects alone don't look so volatile\".\n\n\"The water treatment business for companies big and small now is still profitable, though not very. The return of investment for wastewater management is very low because of the competition, but it's stable income and low-risk business for the company.\"\n\nLatest company earnings further confirm the dimming outlook in the sector.\n\nFor the period ended Sept 30, 2013, Sembcorp Industries' net profit from its water product segment fell 23 per cent to $16.5 million from a year ago, even as turnover climbed 7 per cent to $124.2 million. Overall, the conglomerate still scored stellar profits thanks to huge gains from the initial public offering of its Salalah company in Oman.\n\nSound Global's net profit also fell 24 per cent to 115.4 million yuan, hit by higher finance costs, while revenue dipped slightly to 766.9 million yuan.\n\nThe Chinese wastewater treatment firm, also listed in Hong Kong, is looking to delist, reportedly to consolidate all its shares onto one platform in the hope that the increased liquidity will allow its shares to rerate. Its counter has been trading at a 50-per-cent discount to peers' valuation in Hong Kong, said JPMorgan.\n\nMost of the higher finance costs reported by companies were due to new bonds and notes issuances, interest payouts on earlier issued bonds, as well as overall higher borrowings to finance their investment in water assets, which can be hefty. Meanwhile, lending rates in China have also risen from a year ago: the Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor) averaged 3.2564 per cent in the third quarter this year, compared to 2.7903 per cent in the previous year.\n\nAt the same time, intense competition has also led to some consolidation. Membrane supplier Memstar in July agreed to have its business and assets fully acquired by water treatment firm United EnviroTech for $293.4 million, in order to transform into a vertically integrated water solutions provider.\n\nExplaining the move, Memstar said it was \"necessary for an independent membrane provider to offer a complete one-stop water solution to its customers in order to remain competitive\".\n\nBoth companies reported lower or flat-at-best top and bottom lines in their latest quarter.\n\nTo be sure, it wasn't a complete massacre across all water stocks in Q3. Hyflux, for instance, scored a 74 per cent jump in net income to $25.3 million on the back of a 26 per cent rise in revenue to $187.7 million, although DBS analyst Tan Ai Teng notes that Hyflux has not been getting a lot of new contracts, and this is reflected in its share price which has fallen 9.8 per cent year-to-date to $1.19 yesterday.\n\nHanKore Environment Tech and SIIC Environment also boasted better earnings, thanks to newly acquired plants that expanded their capacities, says Ms Tan. This then fed into higher revenue and consequently, higher recurring income stream - likely to continue until they hit full utilisation.\n\nAlthough competition is stiff, it is not a case of not enough slices of pie to go around. Opportunities to pick up contracts are ample, and business demand is still robust in China, says Ms Tan.\n\n\"The issue is that everyone wants good projects, but not all projects give similar returns, depending on location, quality, size, as well as who the offtakers and payers are.\"\n\nThere are some who see the water sector as a proxy to China's urbanisation; as long as it is driving up consumption, water companies will keep seeing the money.\n\nBut there are others who warn that these companies' dependence on water infrastructure spending makes them vulnerable to industry cycles and economic downturns.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released its latest report on the global economic outlook. Going by its estimates, if China's annual economic growth accelerates to 8.2 per cent in 2014 from an expected 7.7 per cent this year, then perhaps those who belong to the latter train of thought would have less to be anxious about.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Together, the plots are expected to yield about 1,500 units.\n\nOf the three development plots, the mixed-use one, to include private housing, will likely be the first to be rolled out; development is likely to begin by 2015.\n\nThe developer who wins the tender for this site will be required to build a basement carpark big enough to serve Holland Village. The number of lots required is still being worked out.\n\nThe extension, which abuts the existing Holland Village, encompasses the six HDB housing blocks vacated under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme in 2011, their adjacent land parcels (including the to-be-closed Buona Vista Swimming Complex) and the carpark now serving Holland Village.\n\nAn access road will be built adjacent to the Holland Village extension area, to channel traffic away from the centre of Holland Village to the car park.\n\nMeanwhile, the HDB will design and develop a new community park. This will be complemented by pedestrian-oriented streets and new public spaces including urban plazas.\n\nA network of pedestrian walkways will be built so that the surrounding public housing developments will continue to enjoy easy access to Holland Village and the Circle Line MRT station.\n\nHolland Village is one of three Singapore neighbourhoods identified as places of character and charm, the atmosphere of which is to be retained. (Serangoon Garden and Jalan Kayu are the other two.)\n\nIn the case of Holland Village, the intimate streetscapes, urban village vibe, and eclectic mix of retail shops and services will be preserved.\n\nThe new buildings to come up in the area will be scaled sensitively to sit with the rest of Holland Village. New buildings will therefore go from low-rise to medium-rise the further they are from the existing Holland Village; the residential towers to be developed on the residential plots will be set back so as not to overwhelm the human scale of the area.\n\nThe extended Holland Village will be bounded by Holland Drive, Holland Road, and Holland Avenue.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The rental value is determined by existing tenancies of similar properties within the same location, SY said, with the valuer usually determining the hypothetical rental on about 70-80 per cent of actual rental values, primarily to avoid excessive objection hearings.\n\nAsked for his view, CH Williams Talhar & Wong managing director Foo Gee Jen concurred. \"He (SY) is right. Annual value in layman's term is the equivalent of annual rental.\"\n\nIn most situations, values and rentals go in tandem, Mr Foo said, but stressed it was not the case at present. Property prices may have doubled or trebled, but rental yields have shrunk.\n\nHe pointed out that a decade ago a property might have yielded 8-10 per cent based on its value, but today is likely to give only 2-3 per cent.\n\nIndeed, in Malaysia's bigger cities, home prices - especially for landed homes - have run so far ahead of yields that buyers mainly purchase for capital appreciation, to hedge against inflation or because they fear that in future houses will be priced even further out of their range.\n\nThanks also to swirling liquidity, low interest rates, easy financing and the free rein of market forces, thousands of housing units have been built in the past six to seven years outpacing rental demand.\n\nBe it in the residential or commercial segment, \"For Sale/Rent\" signs are aplenty in many areas of Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMr Foo said DBKL has the right to review assessments but not the rate, which is 6 per cent for residential properties and double the amount for commercial. He said a lower rate of 2-3 per cent applies for specific areas including Malays reserve land such as Kampung Baru and new settlements and that the Local Government Act allows a maximum rate of 35 per cent on the annual value to be charged as assessment.\n\nAlthough assessments have not been reviewed for 21 years, it has not been for want of trying, according to Kuala Lumpur Mayor Ahmad Phesal Talib.\n\nThe Star reported him as saying that DBKL had tried to do so several times in the past, but had been prevented from doing so.\n\nWhether it was because of economic conditions or politicians feared being unpopular, DBKL appears now prepared to incur the wrath of city folk.\n\nOpposition lawmakers from Pakatan Rakyat (PR) contend that the increases are a \"punishment\" being meted out to Kuala Lumpur residents for voting in PR candidates in the May general election, where the coalition won nine out of 11 parliamentary seats under the Federal Territory. Despite losing the overall popular vote, the Barisan Nasional coalition won more federal seats, giving it control of the Federal Territory (and Kuala Lumpur).\n\nBut the 13th general election was bruising, especially in hot seats such as Lembah Pantai (in the Federal Territory ), ultimately retained by Nurul Izzah Anwar, daughter of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.\n\nCynics say the proposed huge assessment jumps are to boost DBKL's \"now-running low\" coffers.\n\nHaving released the \"test balloons\", they expect the council to settle on lesser increases to make the assessment revisions more palatable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With an above-average number of residential and non-residential projects slated for the years ahead, coupled with the government's commitment to doubling Singapore's rail network by 2030, BRC Asia believes the robust local demand for reinforcing steel will continue.\n\nHowever, the group reckoned that \"it should be but a matter of time before the demand and supply situation reverses\", given the aggressive expansion of major players and new entrants to the local reinforcing steel industry in recent years.\n\nBRC Asia said its joint venture in China made a loss in 2013, due to provisions for doubtful debts of about $1.4 million. It expects the operating environment there to \"continue to be challenging in the coming year\".\n\nBRC Asia has proposed a final dividend of 1.2 cents per share, making it a total of 1.7 cents per share for the whole year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He added that the earlier situation, in which emerging economies boosted the global economy, has reversed and that they are now exerting an overall drag.\n\nLong-standing risks such as fragilities in the euro-area banking sector and the Japanese fiscal situation have been augmented by new concerns, notably the possibility of \"significant financial instability\" in emerging economies, especially during the exit from unconventional monetary policies in the US, the OECD said.\n\nGrowth in the 35 \"advanced\" members of the Paris-based body is projected to slow this year to 1.3 per cent from 1.6 per cent last year; in the six non-OECD economies covered by Global Economic Outlook (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa), growth is set to drop from 5.1 per cent to to 4.8 per cent.\n\nChina is an exception. Its growth this year is forecast to stay at last year's level of 7.7 per cent and to accelerate to 8.2 per cent next year. US growth will drop sharply from last year's 2.8 per cent to 1.7 per cent this year, while growth in Japan will slow slightly to 1.8 per cent this year. The euro area will remain in recession until next year.\n\nMr Padoan recently listed three events that have unsettled confidence and market stability. Apart from concerns about developments in some emerging economies, he cited the threat of US monetary tapering and its impact on capital flows, plus the fact that the US came close to a \"potentially catastrophic\" crisis over its government debt ceiling.\n\nThe OECD warned in its report: \"These episodes could easily be replayed - quite possibly in a more virulent form - in the period ahead.\"\n\nThe report noted that global recovery remains modest and uneven, with continued divergence in activity developments between and within advanced and emerging economies.\n\nIt said: \"Almost all of this reflects a further growth slowdown in large emerging market economies, which is tempering the pace of the recovery in the OECD economies.\n\n\"Global activity and trade are projected to strengthen gradually in 2014 and 2015, but the recovery is likely to remain modest.\n\n\"Growth in the large emerging market economies is expected to remain subdued by past standards, held back by supply-side constraints, recent policy actions and the recent tightening of financial conditions triggered by expectations about US monetary policy.\"\n\nThe slowdown in emerging economies is likely to exert some modest drag on activity in advanced economies, although the United States will be \"relatively sheltered from such feedback\", said Global Economic Outlook.\n\nThe OECD emphasised that monetary policy \"needs to remain very accommodative, especially in the euro area, where deflation risks have risen and Japan, where asset purchases should be continued as planned\".\n\nIn the United States, should unemployment continue to fall and inflation strengthen as projected, asset purchases should be wound down in 2014 and policy interest rates start to be raised in 2015.\n\nTurmoil following the tapering discussions by the Federal Reserve in mid-year \"has revealed how sensitive some emerging market economies are to US monetary policy\", the OECD said. It warned that this may involve turbulence when actual tapering takes place as needed, with negative feedback effects on advanced economies.\n\nThe planned slowing in the pace of fiscal consolidation in the United States and the euro area \"is appropriate, given the state of public finances and the economic outlook (while) strong fiscal tightening in Japan is necessary to slow public debt accumulation and eventually reduce debt\".\n\nThe OECD added that structural reforms are critical for exiting the crisis, notably in Japan, the euro area and many emerging market economies to strengthen growth prospects, debt dynamics and facilitate global and euro area rebalancing.\n\nSpeaking to journalists in Tokyo via a video conference from Paris, OECD principal economist for Japan Randall Jones said that while the OECD had been impressed by initial monetary and fiscal stimulus actions taken by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration, bolder structural reforms are needed in Japan to support lasting economic recovery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The company that ran the ship was not prosecuted.\n\nWhen it broke in two, the Prestige spilled 63,000 tonnes of fuel oil into the sea, coating 2,980 kilometres of shoreline in Spain, France and Portugal with black gunk.\n\nThe president of the Galicia region, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, explained separately on Monday that the central government's appeal aimed \"to recover the money invested by Spain\" in cleaning up the spill.\n\nThe court ruling put the cost of the disaster at more than 368 million euros (S$617 million) to the Spanish state, 145 million euros to the Spanish region of Galicia and 68 million euros to neighbouring France. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Adjusted for inflation, the market remains below the peak it reached earlier in the decade. And by the end of the day, the market averages had retreated somewhat, with the Dow closing up slightly and the S&P reversing course and ending down.\n\nBut those easily remembered strings of zeros represented new benchmarks for a stock market that has already soared more than 160 per cent since it hit bottom in March 2009. And they might entice investors who have been late to the party to enter it now, even if prices are no longer as cheap as they were a few years ago.\n\n\"A number like Dow 16,000 doesn't mean anything in isolation,\" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial in Boston. \"But it helps to create a behavioural bias that gets more individual investors to come back into the market. It's kind of a flag, telling people, 'Don't miss this', and more people who have been sitting on the sidelines will be likely to buy stocks.\"\n\nAs people open their 401(k) and mutual fund statements these days, the numbers have generally been looking much better. That's not just because recent returns have been strong, but also because with the passage of time, the horrendous declines of early 2008 have dropped out of the calculations of five-year stock returns. Perhaps partly because of this, there is some evidence of a modest surge into stock mutual funds recently.\n\nWhile individual investors have often been skittish about the stock market, a consensus of professional strategists became convinced months ago that compared with bonds, stocks were a good bet. That view is still widely held, with some caveats.\n\n\"'Don't fight the Fed' is one of the oldest adages on Wall Street,\" noted David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist of Gluskin Sheff in Toronto. He says that the swelling Federal Reserve balance sheet and the return of the stock market are highly correlated, with Fed officials deliberately pushing investors into buying stocks.\n\nMr Rosenberg, often thought of as a \"permabear\" because of his long-term gloomy outlook, is now cautiously bullish on many stocks and negative about the prospects for the bond market. \"The long rally in bonds is over,\" he said in a recent commentary.\n\nOn Monday, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 2.67 per cent from 2.7 per cent late Friday, while its price increased 11/32, to 100 24/32.\n\nOne problem, however, is that a range of valuation models show that stocks are relatively attractive - with \"relative\" being the key word - as long as interest rates remain very low. Corporate profits are rising, but not rapidly enough on their own to justify big increases in stock prices.\n\nThe direction of the bond market is therefore critically important to stock investors, who were reassured by testimony last week from Janet Yellen, suggesting that if she is confirmed as the next Fed chairwoman, the central bank will continue to be accommodative as long as the economy remains weak.\n\nA sharp strengthening of the economy, and a tapering of the Fed's US$85 billion in monthly bond purchases - a policy known as quantitative easing - does not seem likely in the next few months, many strategists said.\n\nBut some analysts are bullish without deep conviction. Matt Paschke, for example, co-manages both bullish and bearish portfolios for Leuthold Weeden Capital Management in Minneapolis, including the Grizzly Short fund and the Leuthold Core fund.\n\nOverall, he said, despite stretched valuations in the stock market his firm remains \"cautiously bullish\", largely because the fixed-income market looks so unattractive.\n\n\"There are two schools of thought on stock valuation,\" he said.\n\n\"One says you should only buy stocks when they're cheap. The other says I need to put my money somewhere, so where should I put it? If you look at it that way, stocks are the only game in town, and that thought will probably make us and some other market participants stick around a little longer than we might like because there's nowhere else to go.\"\n\nOn a valuation basis, he said, the stock market isn't particularly appealing. While it's not in extreme bubble territory, he said, the S&P 500 is fairly richly priced right now.\n\nGoing back to 1940, he said, industrial stocks in the index are trading 11.8 times price to cash flow, which puts them in the 83rd percentile, on a historical basis.\n\n\"You'd like to see them in the middle third or lower, but they're in the top third, as far as valuation goes.\"\n\nThey are also very expensive - well into the 90th percentile on a historic basis - according to several other metrics, including price-to-sales and price-to-book ratios, he said. If stock market participants believed that the Fed was about to alter its policy - and bond yields were going to rise sharply in the near future - then there might well be a flight from the stock market, he said. \"We're re-evaluating our position week to week,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, the Dow closed up 14.32 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 15,976.02, while the S&P 500 fell 6.65 points, or 0.37 per cent, to 1,791.53. The Nasdaq composite index also fell, by 36.9 points, or 0.93 per cent, to 3,949.07.\n\nTim Hayes, chief global investment strategist for Ned Davis Research in Venice, Florida, said that he expected global stock markets to remain in an upward trend for the next few months. But then, he said, \"with valuations getting stretched and monetary conditions becoming less favourable, there are, unfortunately, high probabilities that there will be a serious correction next year\".\n\nLonger term, however, Hayes said, once that battering is over, the bull market is likely to resume.\n\nMr Kleintop said that for the market to keep climbing, it's important that \"the economy start growing a little faster\", adding, \"I think it can do that.\"\n\nStill, he said, it's quite possible that investors who jump into the market now might experience an immediate 10 to 15 per cent decline, one that is probably overdue in a bull market of this duration.\n\n\"It would be unfortunate,\" he said, \"if people who have stayed out of the market see the momentum, come in and get hurt. You'd hate to see that happen, but people should know that it could.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

UE had indicated earlier its intention not to preserve the listing status of WBL.\n\nIn a joint statement issued yesterday, both UE Centennial Venture and WBL said that the WBL board had already considered the delisting proposal.\n\nThe board also plans to make an application to the SGX for a waiver from the need to hold an extraordinary general meeting to get approval from shareholders for the delisting.\n\n\"The offeror (UE Centennial Venture) is of the view that the delisting will provide the UE Group and WBL with greater control and management flexibility in utilising and deploying the available resources of the WBL Group,\" said the joint announcement.\n\nUnder the delisting proposal, all remaining shareholders will be offered an exit at $4.45 in cash for each stock unit.\n\nThis price is calculated using the previous stock unit offer of $4.50 and adjusting for a five-cent interim dividend per stock unit that was paid by the company in August to shareholders.\n\nEach shareholder who accepts the exit offer will receive $4,450 for every 1,000 offer stock units tendered.\n\nThe exit offer presents shareholders who find it difficult to exit their investments in WBL as a result of the stock's trading suspension with a chance to liquidate and realise their investment before the company is delisted from the SGX. The stock has been suspended from trading since May 30.\n\nShares of UE ended trading yesterday at $1.79, up half a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The firm, controlled by Eike Fuhrken Batista, once touted as one of the richest men in the world, could run out of cash by year-end, according to news reports.\n\nPetronas' move could spell the end of what might have been a promising find for OGX, a development that could have meant a lifeline for the struggling Brazilian group. But OGX may not just cave in without a fight. According to Reuters, the firm said it was evaluating its options and might consider taking legal action against the Malaysian firm.\n\nIf so, the dispute would go to an arbitration tribunal in Brazil in line with the original conditional agreement between the two companies. Indeed, when OGX filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct 30, it had said it expected the dispute to end up in arbitration over the deal struck with Petronas.\n\nPetronas does not seem concerned. Indeed, it had set as a pre-condition to the deal that OGX restructure its debt.\n\n\"The deal is still pending full clarity with regard to the restructuring exercise,\" Petronas president Shamsul Azhar Abbas told reporters in Kuala Lumpur last week. \"OGX hasn't met the condition precedent. The debt restructuring has to happen first.\"\n\nOn another level, Petronas could also be trying to scale down its overseas investment after its C$5.2 billion (S$6.2 billion) buyout in 2011 of Canada's Progress Energy Resources, which has enormous shale gas assets. The firm hopes to rope in other partners to reduce its costs and secure a market in Asia for the liquefied natural gas (LNG) it would eventually produce and export from Canada.\n\nThose costs, which include building an LNG facility and a 900 km pipeline, could be prohibitive. So in March, Petronas sold a 10 per cent interest in the project to Japan Petroleum Exploration Co.\n\nMr Shamsul also disclosed to reporters last week that the firm was close to selling another 10 per cent in the project to an undisclosed partner, identified by the Indian press as Indian Oil Corp, the country's biggest refiner.\n\nEven so, the unwinding of the OGX deal could bring closure to what might have been a promising find. The Tubarao Martelo fields could hold as much as 108.5 million barrels of oil, including proven, probable and possible reserves, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, an oil-reserves auditing company, said in a report posted on OGX's website.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Another group which delivered a proposal is said to be infrastructure firm Invepar and Germany's Fraport, which operates Frankfurt Airport. The winning bid will be announced on Friday.\n\nCAI, a wholly owned subsidiary of Changi Airport Group (CAG), confirmed that it has submitted a bid each for the two airports.\n\nThe minimum bid for Galeao, the country's second busiest airport, has been set at 4.83 billion reais (S$2.62 billion) while that for Confins is 1.1 billion reais. However, the appointed operator will also be expected to pump in investments to the tune of 5.7 billion reais for Galeao and 3.5 billion reais for Confins over the course of the concession period in order to upgrade infrastructure and facilities.\n\nFor Galeao, this includes 26 loading bridges and a new parking facility, in addition to expansion of the airport apron, while Confins will require a second runway. The airports are run by state-linked airport management firm Infraero.\n\nBrazil has been privatising some of its airports in a bid to revamp its existing and ageing infrastructure, which have failed to keep up with the pace of growth.\n\n\"For the great challenge of renovating and modernising infrastructure in the country, there is the new possibility that with international operators - operators with great experience - we can encourage a cultural change in our airports,\" Brazilian Civil Aviation Secretary Moreira Franco was quoted by Bloomberg as saying.\n\nBrazil's domestic and international passenger growth slowed in 2012 as weaker GDP growth had a knock-on effect on travel demand, forcing the nation's carriers to scale back capacity and shelve expansion. This comes on the heels of sharp double-digit growth in 2010 and 2011. However, despite the ongoing challenges in the short term, the \"outlook over the medium to long-term remains bright\", noted CAPA, or the Centre for Aviation, in a report earlier this year.\n\nGaleao, which handled about 17.5 million passengers in 2012, is expected to see this rise to 60 million per year by 2038 when the 25-year contract ends, while Confins' 10.4 million passengers is set to increase to 43 million passengers per year by 2043.\n\nLast year, Brazilian national civil aviation agency Anac sold the rights to three other airports - including Sao Paulo International which drew a bid from CAI and its partner Odebrecht.\n\nCAI, which provides management and consultancy services, has a track record that spans over 40 airports in more than 20 countries.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

CapitaLand currently holds about 59.1 per cent, or 341.9 million stapled securities.\n\nCitigroup Global Markets Australia is underwriting the sale, which is being done through an overnight accelerated book build.\n\nCiti is the sole bookrunner and underwriter. When contacted, Citi said it was unable to comment on the pricing. Transaction terms seen by newswires, have, however, put the pricing at A$3.685 to A$3.75 per stapled security.\n\n\"There could be sufficient buyers in the market and giving these buyers little time to think about the price will allow CapitaLand to get the best price,\" said Roger Tan, chief executive of Voyage Research.\n\nThe quick book build \"may also reduce the speculation on the counter as CapitaLand tries to sell their stake\", Mr Tan said. But the sale might also signal that there is little upside left to Australand's share price, he added.\n\nAustraland shares last traded at A$3.75, down 13 Australian cents, or 3.4 per cent, before a trading halt yesterday. They had been on the climb from adjusted lows of below A$1 in 2009, hitting a high of A$3.96 earlier this month. Home prices in some parts of Australia have risen rapidly in recent months, sparking talk of a bubble.\n\nAustraland was a subsidiary of DBS Land before the latter's merger with Pidemco Land in 2000 to form CapitaLand. Australand had launched an initial public offering in Australia and Singapore in 1997. Its Singapore secondary listing was delisted in 2011 because the costs of maintaining the listing outweighed the benefits.\n\nLate last year, Australand rejected a proposal by larger rival GPT Group to buy its commercial and industrial business and investment property portfolio.\n\nCapitaLand said at the beginning of the year that it was reassessing its investment in Australand as well as its commercial and residential investments in the UK, India and Gulf Cooperation Council nations, as it sought to sharpen its focus on its key markets in Singapore and China.\n\nIn May this year, GPT abandoned its bid to buy Australand, citing differences over pricing.\n\nIn July, CapitaLand concluded its business review of Australand and said that it remained a key investment. Offers for the whole and parts of Australand were not sufficiently compelling, CapitaLand said.\n\nCapitaLand last traded at $3.06, down four cents, or 1.3 per cent, before a trading halt took effect yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/malaysias-economy-remains-resilient", "site_title": "Malaysia's economy remains resilient", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nMalaysia's economy remains resilient\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 20, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nDESPITE sluggish growth among nearly all its neighbours, Malaysia's third-quarter growth accelerated unexpectedly to 5 per cent on the back of strong domestic demand and a turnaround in exports. That means real GDP (gross domestic product) growth for the whole of 2013 is likely to fall within the government's projection of between 4.5 and 5 per cent.\n\nIf anything, economists have become even more bullish. RAM Holdings economist Yeah Kim Leng thinks that the country will grow at between 5 and 5.5 per cent. It is a view that is shared by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the government of Malaysia. Barclays Bank, on the other hand, estimates next year's growth at 5.7 per cent. And all talk that the country might face a \"twin deficit\" as it did in 1997 has vanished.\n\nA country experiencing a budget deficit as well as a current-account deficit on its balance of payments can be vulnerable to speculative attacks, as Malaysia discovered during the 1998 Asian financial crisis. The talk surfaced after the country's current-account surplus in the second quarter declined sharply to less than RM3 billion (S$1.17 billion).\n\nThe current account's sharp recovery in the third quarter - to almost RM10 billion - indicates that the second-quarter performance was just a glitch. Even so, lower commodity prices have seen a systematic decline in the current-account surplus over the last four years. So any return to the years of huge surpluses is unlikely. Still, Malaysia can expect yearly surpluses of RM35 billion to RM40 billion over the next two years - which is fairly robust. And commodity prices have begun turning upwards.\n\nPrime Minister Najib Razak has indicated that a 6 per cent goods and services tax will be imposed beginning April 2015. That's good, but some of his other promises in his recent budget speech have been vague. For instance, in his promise to bring the budget deficit down to 3.5 per cent of GDP, he said he would cut subsidies by 20 per cent. That's over RM7 billion, which can only come from increases in the price of fuel. While cutting down the fuel subsidy is politically doable now that the elections are over, it remains to be seen if the government's resolve will be sustained.\n\nThen there is all this waste and leakages in government procurement. It could run into over RM40 billion. That's almost 5 per cent of GDP which, if addressed, would change a 15-year budget deficit into a surplus. Clearly, there is virtue in a surplus. Consider that the Selangor administration was one of the few lauded by the Auditor-General's latest report. The state has racked up a budget surplus of almost RM3 billion.\n\nThere is only one conclusion to be drawn. Despite the warnings from international rating agencies such as Fitch, the Malaysian economy remains resilient amid an uncertain global recovery. Rightly then, Moody's Investors Service has set Malaysia's government bond rating at A3 and upgraded the outlook to positive from stable.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Alternatively, StarHub's prepaid users may subscribe to WeChat on a daily basis for 40 cents a day.\n\nWhile the pricing set up between the two telcos is similar, there is a critical difference - SingTel's arrangement with WhatsApp was launched as an exclusive one, but StarHub's partnership with WeChat was not.\n\nIn response to queries from The Business Times yesterday, SingTel said it is \"open to working with WeChat and other providers to offer services to its prepaid customers\". It added that it has seen \"strong demand\" for its WhatsApp plans since their launch.\n\nStarHub has about 1.13 million prepaid users to SingTel's 1.77 million as at the quarter ended Sept 30, 2013. M1, with about one million prepaid customers, still intends to roll out Rich Communications Services (RCS), the mobile industry's alternative to third-party mobile apps such as WhatsApp. StarHub, which also announced plans for RCS earlier this year, will launch it in the first half of 2014.\n\nAsked how StarHub's plans for Joyn fit alongside its tie-up with WeChat, the telco's spokesman replied: \"We believe it is important to offer our customers choice.\"\n\nIn Singapore, there are no official active user numbers for WhatsApp and WeChat, but according to iOSappStats, WhatsApp is ranked seventh on the iTunes store in the free app stakes, while WeChat is in 12th place.\n\nGlobally, the WhatsApp-WeChat rivalry rages on. WhatsApp remains in the lead with more than 350 million monthly active users (MAU), but WeChat is on its tail with 271.9 million MAU for the quarter ended Sept 30, 2013.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2013, StarHub's average monthly SMSes sent by its prepaid users plummeted by almost a third year on year as consumers increasingly used messaging apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat and KakaoTalk for free.\n\nAt the same time, StarHub's mobile consumption of data has taken off in the opposite direction, as it has across the industry. It is in this direction, too, that the money has moved.\n\nOn rival SingTel's end, non-SMS data accounted for 27 per cent of the average revenue per user for the quarter ended Sept 30, up from 20 per cent in the same quarter last year.\n\nOver the coming quarters, both telcos will look to their messaging app partnerships to shore up average revenues, at least on the prepaid front.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This regional centre, to house northern Singapore's first business park cluster, could put 100,000 jobs on the market when it is fully developed in the next decade or so.\n\nIndustrial parks such as Seletar Aerospace Park, Defu Industrial Estate and Lorong Halus Industrial Park will continue to be developed;\n\nexisting industrial estates such as Tanjong Kling and Tukang Innovation Park, Tuas Biomedical Hub and Sungei Kadut will be rejuvenated by JTC Corporation\n\nto raise land productivity and keep businesses there competitive.\n\nBut even as decentralisation plans are made, the city centre will continue to grow. New offices, retail space and homes, as well as redevelopment and sales sites near Tanjong Pagar MRT station are in the pipeline.\n\nThe URA envisages a new shopping and entertainment belt along Bayfront Avenue, which will stretch from Marina Bay Sands to Marina Bay Station Square, which will create more jobs.\n\nAs for housing, the land set aside in Holland Village, Kampong Bugis and Marina South makes up part of the land set aside in this Draft Master Plan for half a million homes. Most of the land will be for public housing.\n\nHolland Village will be extended by six hectares, anchored by a mixed development project that will have a parking station. Two other residential sites have been earmarked in that precinct, along with pedestrian-friendly streets and a community park.\n\nThe 18-ha Kampong Bugis site is slated to become a high-density residential precinct offering around 4,000 private homes.\n\nThe 21.5-ha Marina South area, just off Gardens by the Bay, is set to be turned into a mixed-use residential district offering around 9,000 private homes. Being explored is the idea of having an 800-metre-long underground mall and an elevated walkway from Bay South Gardens to the seafront. Development is expected after 2017 or 2018.\n\nKampong Bugis and Marina South will be testbeds for fenceless residential communities and more pedestrian and cyclist-friendly designs.\n\nWith creating green spaces a key thrust in this Draft Master Plan, one goal is to have 90 per cent of residents living within 400 metres of a park. Plans are in the works to create more than 60 km of nature trails, 360 km of park connectors and a 150 km Round-Island Route; 900 ha of reservoirs and 100 km of waterways are to be opened up for recreation.\n\nOn the heels of the recently announced plans to boost public transport under the Land Transport Master Plan 2013, the URA will promote cycling-friendly environments with other agencies. All HDB towns will have their own cycling networks, and cycle paths will grow from 230 km to more than 700 km.\n\nIn the area of enhancing the Singapore identity, the URA will preserve various landmarks; it plans to gazette more than 70 buildings for conservation, adding to the list of more than 7,100 buildings. The latest additions include the Queenstown Library, Alexandra Hospital and the former Commonwealth Avenue Wet Market.\n\nNeighbourhoods such as Holland Village, Serangoon Gardens and Jalan Kayu will join 15 other locations with distinct character, so that their vibe and unique qualities will be preserved and even enhanced.\n\nAs for plans for Singapore further into the future, the URA envisages a Greater Southern Waterfront, where about 1,000 ha of land - freed up by moving out the City Terminals and Pasir Panjang Terminal from 2027 - will be developed. Plans for this area have not been finalised, but six concepts have been mooted.

In terms of the timing, that's where we need to be practical and realistic and we need to accord sufficient time for the phasing out to happen,\" said JTC assistant chief executive officer of Cluster Development Group 2, Eunice Koh.\n\nShe added that there will be clarity only in the year 2015 on what the Master Plan would entail for the three industrial estates, as the review of the plan is still ongoing.\n\nOn whether it is certain that all firms currently located in the three areas will have to relocate, Ms Koh said: \"We don't know the extent until 2015.\"\n\nThe industrial estates at Sungei Kadut, Yew Tee and Kranji together house the operations of many firms from the furniture, timber, construction and engineering industries. JTC said that it currently does not have details on the number of firms with operations in these industrial estates.\n\nMs Koh's comments were made yesterday after JTC held a closed-door meeting with some industrialists who have their firms in the affected areas, at the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI). The chamber helped to facilitate discussions between JTC, the industrialists and their respective trade associations.\n\nJTC is now working to help 116 firms whose leases expire between next year and 2019. The affected industrialists are worried about their future because of the uncertainty over the renewal of their leases. The Master Plan, which decides how land will be used in the future, is still in the works, although a draft is being made public today.\n\nAt yesterday's meeting, JTC said the affected firms can apply to extend their leases until 2020.\n\nTo do so, companies will have to fill in a one-page form. A JTC officer will then engage the individual firms and assess their application.\n\nCriteria that they will be assessed on include their value added and productivity projections over a three-year period, which starts from the time the lease extension is granted.\n\nSaid JTC's Ms Koh: \"There must be a productivity increment, so they have to declare it and at the end of three years we have to look at it again.\"\n\n\"We are looking at whatever the members are achieving (currently), plus a certain growth. That is a reasonably achievable level . . . It is the spirit of improvement that we are trying to encourage.\"\n\nMs Koh added that JTC hopes to process all applications by June next year.\n\nSCCCI president Thomas Chua said that industries such as the furniture and timber sectors are very happy with JTC's gesture.\n\nAt the very least, it gives industrialists a timeline so that they can continue to make plans for the business, said Mr Chua in Mandarin. \"We have come to a happy conclusion.\"\n\nFreddie Ng, president of the Singapore Timber Association, said: \"Most of our members' leases expire in 2015 and 2016, so actually this is quite urgent . . . In view of (how) the Master Plan is still on review, JTC has come up with this solution to extend (our lease) to 2020, of course with certain criteria . . . so my members are definitely aware that they have to pay attention to productivity and value add.\"\n\nHe added that JTC's offer is \"very welcome\" news because from now to 2020, my members have seven years to plan to bring in what is necessary to do value adding\".\n\nOf the 116 firms whose leases are up in the next six years, 76 are from the timber trade.\n\nTony Pang, assistant honorary secretary at the Singapore Furniture Industries Council, said that the five affected furniture firms - which include his company V-Mark Woodcraft - will now be able to continue with their business plans knowing that they have seven years, up till 2020, to work with.\n\nThe offer to extend their leases means that the firms can \"still continue with their business knowing that there is seven years to play with\", said Mr Pang.\n\n\"They can manage cost, they can rethink their business strategy for management in line with the new labour situation we are facing in Singapore right now, and then plan ahead for the future growth of the company. So this news we are getting today is very beneficial and we are very thankful for it.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They also experienced the strongest surge in wealth - 13 per cent to US$1.18 trillion. Globally, there are some 2,170 billionaires, according to the Wealth-X and UBS Billionaire Census 2013.\n\nLast month, Credit Suisse said that it would speed up the strategy of rebalancing resources to its two businesses of private banking and wealth management (PB&WM) and investment banking (IB) by shifting more capital to the PB&WM unit.\n\nRisk-weighted assets allocation to PB&WM came to 29 per cent in 2011 and this had grown to 40 per cent, but the infusion of an additional 15-20 billion francs of risk weighted assets will take that to 50 per cent, said Mr Meister. \"It's quite an important shift in allocation.\"\n\nThe additional capital will boost the bank's ability to sell more loans to the clients, mainly in emerging markets.\n\n\"If you want to be successful in the ultra high net worth segment, lending is a pre-condition,\" he said.\n\nEntrepreneurs - and there are many among the Asian wealthy - require credit, said Francesco de Ferrari, Credit Suisse head of private banking Asia Pacific.\n\nCredit Suisse is not just about preserving and growing wealth, it's also about helping clients via the investment bank to monetise their businesses with corporate finance solutions such as public offerings, he said.\n\nThe aim to increase collaboration revenues is working pretty successfully in Asia. Collaboration revenues generated through the provision of cross-divisional solutions to the super- wealthy in Asia grew by 125 per cent in 2012, and a further 58 per cent year on year in the first nine months of 2013.\n\nGlobally, collaboration revenues, which made up 17 per cent of net revenues in the first nine months of 2013, rose 5 per cent.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2013, Credit Suisse ranked second in share of wallet across all products in investment banking in South-east Asia, according to Dealogic. It ranked third in equity capital markets in Asia-Pacific ex-Japan.\n\nIn Asia, Credit Suisse employs over 7,000 people, with about 4,000 in Singapore.\n\nIts Asian private banking business employs about 1,000 people with the bulk in Singapore, which is also its largest private banking operations outside Switzerland.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The segment recorded an increase in revenue of 108 per cent from US$6.4 million last year to US$13.2 million. The jump was due to improvement in utilisation rates and higher demand for their vessels.\n\nWhile gross profit increased 33 per cent to US$20 million in the third quarter and gross profit margin also went up by one percentage point to 41 per cent, the bottom line was hurt by \"other operating income\" falling 84 per cent, from US$11.7 million last year to US$1.9 million due mainly to the different timing for vessel sales.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses also increased by 72 per cent to US$7.9 million as the group ramps up its operational capabilities to support expected growth plans.\n\nFinance costs went up 41 per cent, from US$2.4 million to US$3.4 million in the third quarter. This was mainly attributable to more vessel loans obtained which increased bank borrowings as the group expanded its fleet.\n\nFor the first nine months, net profit rose 36 per cent to US$40.4 million while revenue climbed 25 per cent to US$126.2 million.\n\nThe company recently completed its initial public offering (IPO) which raised net proceeds of S$150.6 million.\n\nPang Yoke Min, executive chairman of Pacific Radiance, said that the company was well-positioned to capture growth opportunities ahead.\n\n\"These IPO funds will be channelled into growing our presence in targeted high-growth markets of Malaysia, Indonesia, Africa, Australia and Latin America, where exploration and production (E&P) budgets are expected to expand rapidly,\" he said.\n\nThe group is planning to launch its shiprepair yard in 2015, which will provide it with greater control over its fleet enhancement programme.\n\nPacific Radiance owns and operates more than 130 offshore support vessels and has moved to establish a range of complementary businesses.

The deal is expected to close by the end of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nThe acquisition will give ICE, which also owns NYSE Euronext, a quick boost to its Singapore presence without having to run the full regulatory gauntlet.\n\n\"The acquisition of SMX represents an important step in ICE's growth trajectory as we look to expand our customer base and markets in Asia by establishing a local exchange and clearing presence,\" ICE chief strategy officer David Goone said in a statement. \"In recent years, Asia-based trading activity in our benchmark energy and interest rate products has been rising as the region increases in importance in global markets.\"\n\nSMX offers 17 types of contracts, including black pepper futures and gold futures linked to Indian gold prices.\n\nSince opening trading in August 2010, SMX has seen turnover climb steadily, with US$71 billion of traded contracts in 2012. But both SMX and SMX Clearing have struggled to turn a profit, posting losses in the year ended March 2013, according to FTIL's latest annual report.\n\nSMX is considered a very small player in Singapore, and several analysts told The Business Times that they did not know enough about it to comment.\n\nBut the lack of attention paid to SMX suggests that it was not seen as a major competitor for SGX, which posted $30.9 million profit from its derivatives business in the quarter ended September 2013.\n\nEven though ICE's entrance could present a more powerful rival for SGX, the competition for SGX on the derivatives front is already global in nature.\n\nSMX's persistent losses suggest that it is not so easy to create a vibrant and profitable commodities derivatives market in Singapore, CIMB analyst Kenneth Ng said.\n\nBoth SMX and SGX \"have been trying to grow their commodity business\", Mr Ng said.\n\n\"By and large, SGX's derivatives business is still largely driven by the index futures,\" he said. \"They've been talking about growing commodity contracts for a while, oil palm, energy and the like, but those things have not really taken off so much.\"\n\nThe challenge is that commodities contracts are traded on a global basis, and incumbents tend to enjoy strong momentum that makes it difficult for newcomers to draw business, Mr Ng said.\n\nFollowing the acquisition, ICE expects to move SMX and SMX Clearing to ICE's trading and clearing platforms.\n\nWith SMX, ICE will also be able to offer regional hedging opportunities to market participants.\n\nICE said it would continue to base SMX in Singapore with an independent board of directors, but told The Business Times that decisions on management changes have not been made yet.\n\nThe SMX acquisition comes as FTIL is facing pressure in India after regulators there shut down its National Spot Exchange on charges of allowing illegal trades. FTIL said it would use the proceeds of the sale to pay down debt.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Located at the convergence of two major waterways - Rochor Canal and Kallang River - the area has also been identified as a pilot area for a high-density, water-sustainable precinct. This means developments there will incorporate effective stormwater management and urban design features such as vegetated swales, bio-retention basins and detention ponds to manage rainwater runoff.\n\nDevelopment of the 18 hectares of land in Kampong Bugis may begin after 2016. Of this area, about 80 per cent will be given over to about 4,000 units of private housing.\n\nTo support the envisaged reduced dependency on cars, developers will be encouraged to set up car-sharing and bicycle-sharing schemes, which will operate alongside the network of bus services and two MRT stations in the area.\n\nThe upshot of promoting these greener, alternative modes of travel is that future residential projects in the area will need to provide fewer car park lots.\n\nPreliminary feedback from developers has been positive, with many of them noting that demand for car park space is already generally lower in places nearer the city centre.\n\nAlthough the proposed concept of greener commutes and being \"car-reduced\" is not expected to rock the boat significantly, public feedback is being sought in this area.\n\nAnother facet of the URA's vision for Kampong Bugis is fenceless housing, to encourage community interaction. Such a \"fenceless precinct\", as distinct from the conventional \"gated condominium\" approach, entails through-block links, courtyards and open spaces; developers will also be encouraged to include community amenities such as childcare centres, kindergartens, cafes, clinics and playgrounds in their plans.\n\nThese amenities will be set amid greenery.\n\nKampong Bugis, with its urban features supporting \"water-sustainable\" practices, is expected to enhance sustainable water management practices here and to become a new high-density model for sustainable water practices internationally.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He also said there is space on the greenfield site to accommodate further expansion.\n\n\"In our overall business expansion plan, the South-east Asian market is extremely important to us due to its geographic location, strong projected growth and our customer base,\" highlighted Mr O'Shea at the ground-breaking ceremony yesterday.\n\n\"We recognise the immense importance of this market and are taking these steps to expand our presence here with close proximity to our customers.\"\n\nAccording to Mr O'Shea, there are about 100 PW150A engines in service in the region, with the number set to double over the next decade.\n\nThe group expects that the new facility - its first in Asia - will mean faster turnaround times and lower shipping costs for owners and operators of the PW150A engine.\n\nWhile Vector Aerospace does have a sales office in Malaysia, this will be moved to Singapore once the new centre is opened.\n\nPhilip Ang, whose past roles include vice-president (heavy maintenance) for SIA Engineering Company, has been appointed general manager of Vector Aerospace Asia.\n\nVector Aerospace Asia expects to ramp up the current staff strength of four to 140 over the next three years. Staff will be sent for training at another of its facilities in Canada, which is already overhauling PW150A engines.\n\nAcquired by Eurocopter Holdings - a subsidiary of European aerospace giant EADS - in 2011, Vector Aerospace earned revenues of about US$750 million in 2012. It has 21 MRO facilities across six continents.\n\nLim Kok Kiang, assistant managing director at the Economic Development Board (EDB), said: \"Vector Aerospace's introduction of PW150 engine MRO capabilities here further enhances Singapore's position as a leading engine MRO hub. With the rapid growth in air travel and the regional aircraft fleet in Asia, this new facility will enable Vector to capture the increased demand for MRO services here.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even so, it was not enough to offset its escalating costs which surged 16.6 per cent from a year ago.\n\nThe full-service carrier had previously said it would stick to a load active-yield passive strategy - even at the expense of yield compression - believing it would deliver the desired results as long as costs could be contained.\n\nThat was not the case in the period under review. Fuel costs rose 11 per cent owing to a 17 per cent increase in fuel volume. A weaker ringgit against the greenback also offset the fall in jet fuel prices. Other expenses also jumped: aircraft-related by RM90 million, marketing costs by RM174 million and non-aircraft related, RM46 million.\n\nYields thinned to 21.9 sen, or 16 per cent lower year on year, as competition also forced MAS to slash fares. With privately owned Malindo Air introducing low promotional fares to win market share, yields could come under further attack.\n\nRHB Research aviation analyst Jerry Lee said MAS management had guided the airline would continue to focus on cost-restructuring to keep expenses under control as well as rationalise its routes by leveraging the profitable ones. Other measures include improving ancillary income, boosting productivity, more effective hedging and reducing wastage.\n\nMAS unions have complained about working conditions and employee fatigue which they said could affect staff safety and welfare.

The joint appearance at the signing ceremony accentuated the airlines' status as the dominant force in global aviation, with unmatched buying power.\n\nSome 86 per cent of the new 777 backlog is with Gulf airlines, while Emirates accounts for almost half of bookings for Airbus SAS's A380 super-jumbo, tipping the balance of global aviation towards the Mid-East at the expense of other carriers. Minutes after Boeing exited the stage, Emirates announced another record deal with Airbus, for 50 A380 super-jumbos.\n\nMr Al Baker, whose airline is the second-largest among the three major carriers, wouldn't say which of the two made the overture towards cooperation, while adding that the approach is good for employment and for the aviation industry and \"shows the world that we're competitors, but we also work together\". Emirates representatives weren't available to comment on the cooperation with Qatar.\n\nThe joint approach let Qatar Airways and Emirates exchange information on technical aspects and performance of the aircraft, and take their findings back to Chicago-based Boeing, Mr Al Baker said. The two carriers are known to be particularly demanding customers, with Emirates running its wide-body aircraft in high-frequency operations, while Qatar has put particular focus on the luxurious outfit of its cabins.\n\n\"It has been a very successful negotiation for both of us,\" Mr Al Baker said. \"We always had leverage on aircraft manufacturers, we place such large orders and so often.\"\n\nQatar Airways is building Doha into one of three major hubs for aviation in the Gulf, alongside the Emirates base in Dubai and Etihad Airways PJSC's home airport of Abu Dhabi, stripping away traffic from traditional inter-continental crossroads such as Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.\n\nThat has intensified competition between the three carriers, making cooperation seem unlikely. Qatar Airways has also become the first Gulf heavyweight to join a global alliance, signing up to the British Airways-led Oneworld partnership, and might have been expected to favour joint purchasing within that group.\n\nStill, aircraft orders are not always spurred by a desire to heighten competition, according to Mr Al Baker.\n\n\"We don't order so often because we want to keep on growing, but because we want to keep our fleet young,\" he said. Emirates said before placing the 777 order that the new planes were required chiefly to replace older variants.\n\nDeutsche Lufthansa AG, which had been talking with Boeing about development of the 777 for two years, sought to offset the clout of the Gulf carriers by getting in with an order first, according to Nico Buchholz, its fleet planning chief.\n\nDoing so locked in performance guarantees for the plane, he said. This ensured that its economics will work well for the Cologne, Germany-based company even if Boeing adapts other parameters to meet extreme operating demands of Gulf carriers flying long distances with full loads out of hot locations.\n\nEtihad, the third-largest Middle Eastern airline, also bought 25 upgraded 777s, though wasn't involved in the collective negotiations with Emirates and Qatar Airways. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The latter's capacity is less than one-third Shell's new project.\n\nMr Cheong earlier told BT that Shell was gearing up to build a new 350,000-tpa facility there, replacing its current 240,000-tpa plant at Woodlands, a site which it will give up when the new Tuas facility is ready by 2015.\n\nThis will boost its lube and grease manufacturing capacity by over 40 per cent.\n\nShell explained that a lube oil blending plant (LOBP) is where base oil is blended with additives to make finished lubricants.\n\nIt comprises three separate areas, namely the base oil and additives storage and blending area; the filling area, and the warehouse.

The report was commissioned by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\"There are times when the airplane will do something that's unexpected and the pilots will go, 'Why did it just do that?'\" Patrick Veillette, a corporate pilot who wrote his PhD thesis on cockpit automation, said in an interview.\n\nAuto-throttles, computer navigation systems and other automation on planes have improved safety, said Mr Veillette, who didn't participate in the report. Airline safety is at an all-time high, according to accident statistics.\n\nThe downside of these new technologies is that they may be incorrectly programmed more than previous systems and are so complex that pilots don't always understand their actions, Mr Veillette said.\n\nThe report's findings were earlier reported in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe report, entitled Operational Use of Flight Path Management Systems, said it studied 26 accidents from 1996 to 2009 in which automation played a role. The authors also relied on incident reports, cockpit audits and anonymous pilot accounts gathered by airlines and government agencies.\n\nSeveral recent accidents that weren't considered in the report, including the Feb 12, 2009, crash of a regional turboprop approaching Buffalo operated by Pinnacle Airlines Corp's former Colgan unit, are also related to how pilots are trained on cockpit automation, Mr Veillette said. The Colgan accident killed all 49 on the plane and a man on the ground.\n\nA pilot on an Asiana Airlines plane that struck a seawall while attempting to land in San Francisco on July 6 said he thought the plane's auto throttle was maintaining speed, National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Deborah Hersman said after the accident.\n\nPilots accustomed to having autopilots and other devices have allowed basic manual skills to erode, the report said. They also have greater difficulty handling malfunctions of automated systems because they may not understand the systems or haven't been adequately trained.\n\nThe report included 18 recommendations for better training on how cockpit devices work, improved design of the systems and new procedures to minimise the impact of malfunctions or mistakes.\n\nThe FAA, starting when the group that wrote the report began its work in 2006, has taken action on the 18 recommendations. The agency on Feb 5 issued new regulations changing pilot training to emphasise more realistic simulator sessions. That action addresses several of the report's recommendations. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The increase in operating expenditure is also attributed to a one-off cost incurred for redelivery of aircraft.\n\n\"In addition, the group intensified its advertising and promotional activities amid intense competition as part of its long-term strategy to continuously strengthen its presence in key markets,\" the carrier said in its filing with Bursa Malaysia.\n\nMAS said that despite the loss in the current quarter, the group's cash position remained strong at RM5.4 billion.\n\nSeparately, the Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, Shahidan Kassim, has responded to questions on why Prime Minister Najib Razak does not fly MAS on official visits.\n\nHe said MAS does not cover all areas, adding that it is unsuitable for the country's leader to board commercial aircraft together with other passengers.\n\n\"It involves the country's image.

His appointment follows the promotion of current CFO Loh Chin Hua to chief executive officer (CEO) on July 18. Mr Loh, now CEO-designate, will assume Keppel's top position on Jan 1, when current CEO Choo Chiau Beng retires.\n\nAs Keppel's CFO, Mr Chan will be responsible for the group's financial functions, including managing its capital, finance, treasury and tax, as well as its legal matters.\n\nHe has been with SIA for more than 10 years and has been the airline's senior vice-president (SVP) of finance since June 2006. As SVP Finance there, he was in charge of investor relations, corporate accounting and reporting, treasury, risk management and insurance.\n\nKeppel CEO Choo said the group had mounted a rigorous succession management process, examining both internal and external candidates to find the best fit for the CFO role.\n\nHe said: \"I am pleased that we have found a strong candidate in Hon Chew, who possesses leadership, financial and management expertise spanning several companies and industries.\"\n\nCEO-designate Loh said: \"Hon Chew is well-versed with capital structuring and a wide range of corporate functions - abilities he has used to help strengthen companies financially and operationally. Hon Chew is also adept at working with huge, diverse teams and has proven to be both an effective leader and a strong team player.\"\n\nWhen SIA had announced last Friday that its CFO of more than seven years was leaving \"to pursue other career opportunities\", market speculation was that he would most likely be moving over to Keppel's top finance job.\n\nIn April, Mr Chan was appointed by Singapore's Ministry of Finance to the board of the Singapore Accountancy Commission; in the same month, he was elected to the council of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants.\n\nPrior to SIA, he was assistant general manager for finance and corporate services at Wing Tai Holdings from 1998 to 2003, and was the financial controller of IBM Singapore Storage Systems Division earlier in his career.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the Philippine government's approach and response to the disaster raise questions.\n\nThe latest official death count from the typhoon as at yesterday was close to 4,000, although the actual number remains unclear as many thousands more could also have perished, including at sea. Given the lack of food, water and medicine in the affected areas, the death toll is certain to rise; heartbreakingly, people have died even from easily treatable injuries such as a broken leg. The danger of the spread of disease is also present and there are particularly vulnerable groups such as the elderly, children and pregnant women. The dangers will hopefully recede as aid starts to reach the victims and disaster response teams get to work.\n\nThe response to the disaster has been hampered by the destruction of logistical infrastructure, prolonged power outages, the destruction of local facilities such as hospitals and relief centres and the breakdown of local governance and security structures.\n\nBut for all this, it must be said that the government could have done better, even by its own admission. Most importantly, the measures to prevent the loss of life were seriously inadequate. Early warnings of the typhoon were received, but the authorities underestimated the intensity of the storm. People were moved from coastal areas a few kilometres inland, but the evacuation centres, such as schools, churches and stadiums were themselves devastated. This contrasts sharply with the admirable job done by India's authorities in the lead up to cyclone Phailin in the state of Orissa just last month. Almost a million people were evacuated prior to the arrival of the cyclone - which, like Haiyan, was also a category 5 storm. Food and medicines were moved close to the affected areas in advance, and helicopters, aircraft and warships were put on standby. Although crop and material damage was extensive, thousands of lives were saved, compared to 10,000 lost in a 1999 cyclone in the same area. The Philippines, which faces some 20 typhoons a year, urgently needs to step up its pre-disaster preparedness, which also eases the task of post-disaster relief. As we have seen in disaster after disaster, the job cannot be left to local governments alone. This is probably the single biggest lesson from typhoon Haiyan.\n\nNow will begin the task of reconstruction. This will take years, but it will be done, as it has been done several times before, thanks in large part to the resilience of the people. The Philippines will recover soon from this disaster; its economy, which is in decent shape, is unlikely to suffer lasting damage. But one of the big questions the government must ask itself is what more it could have done, and should do in future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economists now expect the government to upgrade its 2013 GDP growth forecast to as high as 4 per cent, when it announces third-quarter figures on Thursday.\n\nNon-oil domestic exports (NODX) expanded for the first time since January, growing 2.8 per cent year-on-year in October - in stark contrast to market expectations of a contraction of 1.1 per cent.\n\nThe pleasant surprise is the latest addition to recent positive economic indicators, including hearty showings in the purchasing managers' index and industrial production numbers.\n\nFindings from the latest Business Times-UniSIM Business Climate Survey, published yesterday, also showed that the economy could expand by up to 3.7 per cent in 2013.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, economists BT spoke to believe growth momentum will strengthen in Q4 and into 2014, and most expect the government to raise its full-year GDP growth forecast beyond its current 2.5-3.5 per cent range.\n\nDBS' Irvin Seah and Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Chua Hak Bin expect the government projection to be revised upwards to 3.5-4 per cent.\n\nYesterday, Dr Chua also raised his 2013 GDP forecast to 3.7 per cent (up from 3.5 per cent) and his 2014 projection to 3.2 per cent (2.8 per cent previously).\n\nSaid JP Morgan economist Sin Beng Ong: \"Following relatively weak prints in Q3 2013, the October trade report builds on the slightly more positive tone seen in the September print and suggests that a modest upturn in external demand appears to be underway.\"\n\nOctober's trade numbers reflected a broad- based improvement across various product categories, as the increase in non-electronic NODX outweighed the decline in electronic NODX.\n\nNon-electronic NODX expanded by 4.9 per cent in October, following a 0.8 per cent increase in September. Apart from printed matter and petrochemicals, IE Singapore said the growth in non-electronic NODX was led by pre-fabricated buildings.\n\n\"This month's high sales of pre-fabricated buildings are likely to be a one-off spike for this half of the year,\" IE Singapore told BT, noting that the segment accounted for around 2 per cent of total NODX in October.\n\nBut electronics exports were no slouch either. Even though the sector continued to remain in contraction mode for a 15th consecutive month, its drag on overall NODX has narrowed to its smallest in a year.\n\nElectronic NODX declined 1.4 per cent year-on-year in October, after a 5.5 per cent contraction in the month before.\n\nSaid Mr Seah: \"I think this October NODX number essentially hints at a strong finish to the year. The improvement in electronics has turned out to be quite a surprise, and ties in nicely with September's electronics industrial production numbers in hindsight.\"\n\nDespite the expected uplift to full-year GDP, however, economists from ANZ, DBS and UOB reckon that NODX is likely to undershoot the official growth forecast of 0-1 per cent this year because of the sector's weakness for much of the year.\n\nSaid Mr Tan: \"With only two more months of NODX releases to go before we end the year, our forecast of a -3 per cent growth in NODX for 2013 is on the optimistic side, as it will imply an average of 14 per cent year-on-year growth in the last two months of this year.\n\n\"Singapore's trade agency's forecast of 0-1 per cent will imply an average growth rate between 33.5-40 per cent. As such, based on recent momentum in trade flows, we think that full-year NODX may likely come in around -4.5 per cent instead.\"\n\nExcept for the US, the EU 27, Japan, South Korea, and Indonesia, shipments to all of Singapore's 10 biggest markets expanded last month.\n\nChina was the top contributor to October's NODX increase, with Taiwan and Malaysia following in second and third places respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the mix could shift towards more ECs, given that demand remains strong while transactions in the private residential market have slowed.\n\nECs, a public-private housing hybrid, are expected to continue to sell well as they are not hit by the TDSR framework.\n\nAlan Cheong, research head at Savills Singapore, said that the authorities would have to read the market carefully to see where demand is, in selecting private housing sites for H1 2014.\n\n\"They may have to release mid-sized sites that can yield 300-500-unit projects, instead of sites for mega projects of say, 700-1,000 units. And the sites should be well-located, preferably near MRT stations, and not be in 'saturated areas'.\n\n\"Ideally, I think they should moderate confirmed-list supply in H1 2014 although the market is still undersupplied until 2015. But they may have other objectives in mind such as town planning.\"\n\nHe thinks that the authorities could trim the quantum of private homes excluding ECs on the confirmed list from about 3,200 for H2 2013 to 2,800 for H1 2014.\n\nThe four sites on the H2 2013 slate yesterday can yield about 2,350 homes in total.\n\nMost property consultants forecast that the private housing site at Upper Paya Lebar Road would fetch top bids of $500-650 psf ppr. Ong Kah Seng, executive director of R'ST Research, sees the winning bid as $470-520 psf ppr, which is more measured compared to Knight Frank's $700-750 psf ppr - the most bullish. Alice Tan, Knight Frank Singapore research head, puts the selling price at about $1,350-1,400 psf.\n\nThis would be significantly higher than the $1,260-1,280 psf average price achieved by the developers of Bartley Residences and Bartley Ridge nearby, said Jones Lang LaSalle.\n\nJLL national director Ong Teck Hui sees the latest site as being less attractive than the two earlier projects since it is bounded by two major roads - Bartley and Upper Paya Lebar, which will result in a project being affected by noise.\n\nTwo EC sites are being offered on the confirmed list - at Canberra Drive and Anchorvale Crescent. Analysts estimate the winning bid for the Canberra site, about 1.2 km from Sembawang MRT Station, to be in the range of $320-380 psf ppr. The previous benchmark in the area was the SkyPark Residences site, which fetched $324 psf ppr last December. The project was launched on Saturday, with 52 per cent of the 506 units sold over the weekend, at an average price of $793 psf.\n\nAnalysts forecast the Anchorvale site's top bid tol be in the $330-400 psf ppr range. Nicholas Mak, executive director at SLP International, sees the site, right next to Cheng Lim LRT Station, and one stop away from Sengkang MRT/LRT Station, as \"arguably the most attractive of the five EC sites on the confirmed list of the H2 2013\" slate.\n\nAlong Choa Chu Kang Drive, next to the Rainforest EC project, an EC site was made available for application yesterday on the reserve list. Mr Mak thinks it is unlikely to be triggered in the next half a year, citing the large EC supply expected in the Choa Chu Kang area. Next month, two adjoining sites in Choa Chu Kang Grove will be launched on the confirmed list.\n\nHowever, R'ST's Mr Ong said the Choa Chu Kang reserve list site has a high chance of being triggered for sale in H1 2014 and that bids might be fairly optimistic. He points to pent-up interest in EC projects going ahead, as projects on any EC sites sold around now are likely to be launched only in 2015 at the earliest, under current rules which allow an EC project to be launched for sale only 15 months from the date of site award or after the physical completion of the foundation works, whichever is earlier.\n\nA maximum 3,110 EC units that are likely to be launched next year (all in the second half) may be insufficient given the average yearly demand of 3,770 EC units bought from developers in the past three years. \"EC demand is set to grow even stronger going into 2014 and beyond, with TDSR encouraging prudent buying and more EC-eligible buyers opting for it over private condos,\" added Mr Ong.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The New York-based company has so far invested US$2 billion in India since its entry in 1989.\n\n\"India is a country with huge potential and it remains an attractive, high-priority market for PepsiCo. We've built a highly successful business in India over the course of many years, and we believe we've only scratched the surface of the long-term growth opportunities that exist for PepsiCo and our partners. This investment is PepsiCo's vote of confidence in India's future and it represents our deep commitment to this great country,\" Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO, PepsiCo, who is on an India visit, told The Business Times (BT).\n\n\"India is a market for the future,\" added the India-born Ms Nooyi. \"We do not invest based on short term, we are here for the long term. For a long term, India has the demographic dividend, democracy, it has entrepreneurial environment, and a functioning government.\"\n\nPepsiCo and Coca-Cola's investments, driven by an exponentially growing middle class (estimated to be over 200 million people), are likely to be welcomed by the Indian government which is struggling to restore foreign investor confidence in the wake of GDP growth plummeting to a decade low of 5 per cent, a string of corruption scandals involving top officials and high inflation.\n\nAccording to data from researcher Euromonitor International, PepsiCo's share of the carbonated beverage market in India plunged to 36.4 per cent last year, from 40.1 per cent in 2007 while Coca-Cola's has surged to 60.9 per cent from 57 per cent in the same period.\n\nHowever, both companies are betting on robust growth from a low-consumption base of soft drinks in India to rev up sales. Currently, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo together dominate the Indian market for carbonated soft drinks.\n\nIndia, a country of 1.2 billion people, remains one of the most appealing markets for the two beverage titans due to its low per capita consumption of carbonated beverages. Indians on average drink 12 eight-ounce - about 240ml - bottles of Coke a year compared with 92 bottles globally according to industry estimates.\n\nAlso, growth rates in Asia, the Middle East and Africa are almost four to five times those in the US and Europe, making emerging countries such as India a very attractive growth market, said PepsiCo.\n\nPepsiCo and its bottling partners plan to more than double production capacity in India by 2020. Pepsi entered the country at a time when the Indian government was liberalising the economy and opening up a plethora of sectors to foreign investment in the 1990s. Coca-Cola returned in 1993 (after leaving India over a dispute involving handing over its secret recipe) buying out top local cola, Thums Up.\n\nIndia is one of Pepsico's biggest markets globally and the investments will help expand its repertoire of food and drinks in the South Asian nation, the company said. Pepsico has also been adding to its list of offerings while roping in Bollywood actors to endorse its range of products estimated to be worth US$4.25 billion by 2018.\n\n\"A stronger distribution in the existing categories and strong forays into new rural markets have helped the company retain its toehold,\" Mumbai-based trade analyst Murli Menon told BT.\n\nSince entering India, Pepsi claims it has created opportunities for more than 200,000 people through direct or indirect employment and agriculture collaborations. It is estimated that the strategic initiative announced last week will add more than 100,000 additional employment opportunities. Pepsi has 42 plants in India, including franchises. The company also intends to step up collaborative farming that it claims has benefited 24,000 farmers.\n\nOn the other hand, Coca-Cola says that it has already pumped over US$7 billion in India since it re-entered the country in 1993. Coca-Cola India directly employs over 25,000 people and about 150,000 people indirectly.\n\nMarket analysts believe that growth for both companies in the future will be determined by rural sales as the cities are witnessing a level of saturation. Besides, they point out, the dynamics in the urban segment is changing towards healthier options, such as fruit/\n\nvegetable juices and bottled water. It is on the rural turf, therefore, that both companies will joust to enhance their share of the Indian soft drinks pie.\n\nEven so, analysts add that despite a first-mover advantage in the market, PepsiCo has not been able to capitalise on this to elbow past Coca-Cola. \"The latter's well-fleshed out strategy both at the top and bottom-end of the market spectrum, combined with a price-point edge, have so far helped it remain ahead in the race. But in the future, it could be anybody's game,\" sums up Mr Menon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

That acquisition at a court-ordered auction was free of debt and encumbrances and SingHaiyi said that it was at a 77 per cent discount to the unaudited net book value.\n\nFor Vietnam Town, SingHaiyi said that the acquisition price - already settled in full by the company - comprised US$29.8 million to repay an outstanding secured debt and US$3.3 million for the freehold project.\n\nThe project has several parcels of land sitting on a total site area of 853,502 square feet. Of the 256 planned condominium units - each about 1,000 square feet - 115 have been built, of which 64 have been sold.\n\n\"SingHaiyi intends to sell the 51 unsold units in the next one to two years and use the sale proceeds to construct and sell the remaining 141 units within the next three to five years,\" it said.\n\nThe project was launched in 2005 but ran into difficulties in 2009 and was subsequently placed under receivership when its developer lost funding for the project.\n\nSingHaiyi acquired it at a trustee's auction and funded the purchase using proceeds from a recent rights issue and share placement exercise that raised some $226 million to help the company expand its real estate investment to the US.\n\n\"While acquisitions at auctions require cash and quick execution, we will be looking to tap bank financing,\" said SingHaiyi non-executive chairman Neil Bush, who is also a brother of former US president George W Bush.\n\nSingHaiyi, which was recently included as a component of the MSCI Singapore Small Cap Index, has been pursuing a strategy of identifying undervalued US property projects that are facing payment problems and are on the brink of bankruptcy. The company believes that there is upside and money to be made in the moribund US property market as it recovers its value on the back of a broader US economic recovery.\n\nIn its first set of results since its restructuring that saw an injection of fresh funds, the company formerly known as SingExpress showed a half-year profit of $8.4 million and a net cash position of $160.4 million.\n\nYesterday, SingHaiyi's stock closed unchanged at 2.3 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And, to be sure, there are good reasons to expect Ms Yellen to persevere with Mr Bernanke's strategy of buying housing-market bonds in order to lower long-term interest rates, while simultaneously keeping short-term rates close to zero in a twin-pronged approach to stimulate growth.\n\nThis was obvious in her nomination testimony to the Senate banking committee last Thursday, when she said it is imperative that the Fed does what it can to encourage a strong recovery and defended the three rounds of QE that the Fed has implemented since 2008. She pointed out that the Fed is aiding the recovery \"by continuing our asset purchase programme, which we put in place with the goal of assuring a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labour market. We are taking into account the costs and the efficacy as we go along. At this point, I think the benefits exceed the costs.\"\n\nThese statements were taken as confirmation of Ms Yellen's \"dovish\" credentials, which, in turn, are founded on her past staunch support for Mr Bernanke's policies and her reputation for being more concerned with employment than with inflation.\n\nHowever, investors would do well to note that, in the same speech, Ms Yellen also warned that QE cannot continue indefinitely, citing potential risks to financial stability. \"The longer this programme continues, the more we will need to worry about these risks,\" she cautioned. Indeed, previous favourite for the top Fed job Lawrence Summers - who was President Barack Obama's first choice - openly expressed scepticism that QE has any substantial benefits for the real economy.\n\nInvestors should also bear in mind that markets are currently over-reliant on QE, to the extent that investment risk may be systematically understated while valuations could be overstretched.\n\nAs it stands now, though, assuming Ms Yellen is confirmed as the new Fed chief, expectations are that the earliest the Fed is likely to taper QE would be in March, when she would be presiding at her first Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\n\nWith other major central banks in Japan and Europe also operating in accommodative mode, the \"risk on\" phase which has kept equities afloat should continue - at least for a few more months.\n\nHowever, after that, investors should tread cautiously.

The Nikkei rose 2.5 per cent following the announcement, with construction stocks being the notable beneficiaries.\n\nThe Olympics boost came just in time. One year after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Abenomics was introduced, Japan's economy is seeing a revitalisation after more than two decades of stagnation.\n\nIn Q2 2013, Japan recorded positive GDP growth for the third consecutive quarter. The Property Business Confidence Index by the Land Institute of Japan also recorded positive numbers for all three segments (developer, brokerage and building management) for the first time since January 2007.\n\nThis is a good sign as it indicates that sentiment has returned to the pre-global financial crisis level. But the question remains whether the property market will generate enough interest from investors and whether the recovery in the sector is sustainable.\n\nBased on the past, the direct implications of hosting major sports events such as the Olympics depend on the size and relative maturity of the property market. The impact also tends to be greater in smaller and less mature markets.\n\nHowever, these are not apple-to-apple comparisons as each city differs in size, geography, economic condition and so on. For instance, when Beijing hosted the 2008 Olympics, China was in the midst of an economic boom, which benefited the property market.\n\nIn contrast, property prices in London dropped prior to the 2012 Olympics. Although this can be mainly attributed to the global financial crisis and the eurozone debt crisis, London's property prices did not recover to the 2005 post- Olympics announcement level until a year after the Games.\n\nSo how will Japan fare leading up to the 2020 Olympics?\n\nThere are a few positive demand drivers. Firstly, interest rate in Japan is among the world's lowest. Inexpensive senior debt can be obtained from Japanese megabanks at 50-70 per cent loan-to-value. With the Bank of Japan continuing to pump money into the economy, the low interest rate environment is expected to stay which could spur demand for property.\n\nSecondly, Japan's inexpensive and readily available debt financing produces one of the highest yield gaps in the world. Although a low yield indicates a higher real estate price, the yield spread that investors enjoy over interest rates offers the allure to invest in Japan properties. Over the past decade, Tokyo has consistently offered attractive yield spreads among major global cities (see Exhibit 1).\n\nBeing the second-largest property investment market after the US, the size of Japan's institutional grade real estate market is estimated to be worth around US$2.7 trillion as at 2012.\n\nThis constitutes 10 per cent of the world's total real estate investment universe, making Japan too big a market to ignore. But foreign investors should note that the investment size for individual assets may not be as large as that in their home countries. This is because many Japanese properties are of smaller sizes compared to many other countries.\n\nIn 2012, Japan was ranked third, after the US and China, for having the highest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the country. Tokyo alone has 48 such companies, the highest among all major cities globally.\n\nGiven its mature economy and advanced infrastructure, Japan will continue to be a preferred destination for international companies to set up their operations. This may fuel demand in the property market, especially the commercial sector.\n\nBased on this, the allure of Japan's real estate sector was in place before the Olympics came into the picture. The Games only serves as a catalyst to further boost market sentiment. It is certainly not a key factor that will lift property prices for a sustainable period, nor is it an essential element in enticing property investors to jump on the bandwagon. At most, the Olympics creates a \"steroidal boost\" to property prices, especially in the Tokyo Bay area, which is the venue for the Olympics.\n\nIn short, even without the boost from the Olympics, Japan is undergoing a major turnaround. The beacon of light in the form of Abenomics has helped to inject market confidence, kickstart growth and hopefully will end decades of economic stagnation.\n\nIf the momentum continues, there may be potential for capital upside in the near future. Historically, land prices have lagged the stock market. For instance, the stock market peaked in 1989 while land prices only peaked two years later in 1991. (See Exhibit 2)\n\nLand prices are now 66 per cent and 22 per cent below the peak in 1989 and the pre-global financial crisis level, respectively.\n\nShould the economy continue to improve, demand for real estate could rise in tandem. Demand from foreign investors may also run high, as Mr Abe's policies are favourable to foreign investment. As there is a high possibility for real estate prices to improve, potential investors should time their investment strategy accordingly so as to catch Japan's property upcycle.\n\nThe writers are adviser for Japan Business Development Unit at OrangeTee, and the head of research and consultancy at OrangeTee, respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The White Paper is expected to be released next month.\n\nHong Kong is also expected to reform its funds framework to allow the establishment of open-ended investment companies (OEICs), to encourage more funds to set up bases in Hong Kong.\n\nMany global asset managers have set up operations here, but their fund vehicles are likely to be domiciled offshore in jurisdictions such as the Cayman Islands, Dublin or Luxembourg. The survey involved focus group discussions with 21 companies, which included five of the top 10 asset managers in Singapore. The respondents' combined global assets under management was about US$1.2 trillion.\n\nThe study found that managers agreed the current regime is not conducive to efficient fund operations. Some pitfalls include the lack of alternative financial statement reporting frameworks, the lack of investor privacy and the lack of a variable capital structure.\n\nAbout 90 per cent of respondents agreed to having an OEIC structure. An \"overwhelming majority\" were open to launching their next fund in Singapore if such a new framework was introduced.\n\nMost managers felt that the current company law creates complications and is not suitable for fund companies. Most also felt that there is a need for a separate legal fund framework to cater for various investment funds - for instance, a separate funds law for traditional (retail) investors and for non-traditional strategies including hedge funds and private equity funds.\n\nIn a paper on the survey findings, PwC said the concept of a legal entity structure and investment funds law vehicle should be distinct and separate. This is the model followed by Luxembourg, and 46 per cent of respondents alluded to or recommended that model. Almost all the respondents think the proposed investment fund law should allow for umbrella-like structures with underlying sub-funds.\n\n\"... a careful evaluation of the Luxembourg model should be done, as the many years of hindsight and evidence of its success will help in developing and implementing a new funds law framework in Singapore,\" said PwC.\n\nRespondents felt there was a need for funds to have their own financial reporting framework. Most also felt that funds should be allowed the option of using any of the current international reporting standards.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

HSH Nordbank has an additional nine billion euros in a restructuring unit, or bad bank, Mr Nies-wandt said.\n\nOne pre-condition for financing new construction is that the vessels meet recent energy efficiency standards. About 90 per cent of the vessels the bank financed are older models, he said, referring to ships built before the financial crisis started in 2008. Since then, high bunker prices and low charter rates have accelerated technological development, he added.\n\nAs of January 2015, shipping lines must comply with low sulphur fuel regulations in North Europe, the US and Canada, obliging them to buy more expensive fuel or equip vessels with equipment to cut exhaust fumes.\n\nThis probably will result in more ship insolvencies in the next 12 months than in the previous, especially among companies with older, less competitive vessels that face additional costs meeting new environmental regulations, the executive said.\n\n\"There have hardly been any insolvencies of shipping companies, but what we have seen is insolvencies of closed-end shipping funds that have hit individual shipping companies to a greater or lesser extent,\" Mr Nieswandt said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Singapore has linked borrowers' maximum debt levels to their incomes and raised stamp duties and capital gains taxes, while Hong Kong has increased minimum down payments six times in less than three years and in February doubled stamp-duty taxes for all properties over HK$2 million (S$321,403).\n\n\"The property curbs in Singapore and Hong Kong have stymied and paralysed the market,\" Mr Eshelby said. \"Buyers are disenchanted with the local markets so they are looking overseas now.\"\n\nPrices in central London are estimated to climb 25 per cent in the next five years, Mr Eshelby said. London home prices have \"massively outperformed\" the rest of the UK over the past five years, he said. Meanwhile, prices in other parts of the UK are still not back to where they were in 2008, he said.\n\n\"It is possible London will do less well, but not by much,\" Mr Eshelby said. \"There are millions of high-net-worth individuals in the world and there are thousands of new homes in London,\" which suggests a continued imbalance between supply and demand, he said.\n\nLuxury homes in central London have been the best performing in the UK since at least 2009, rising more than 60 per cent from their low that year, according to broker Knight Frank LLP. Home prices in central London's most expensive neighbourhoods rose 6.8 per cent in October from a year earlier, the slowest pace since December 2009, as asking prices deterred buyers, according to an index compiled by Knight Frank.\n\nLand Securities will start marketing its 170-unit residential project - part of a 5.5 acre (2.2 hectare), \u00a32.2 billion (S$4.4 billion) development of offices, retail, shops and homes in the Victoria area - early next year, Mr Eshelby said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

But more needs to be done for the global integrated supply chain manager and processor of agricultural produce and food ingredients to keep itself on an even keel.\n\nThe group finds itself better fortified after a year of restructuring. Profit margins have improved. And initiatives announced so far will release $96.9 million in capital gain and $368.6 million in cash.\n\nThe firm has also generated positive free cash flow - the first time in four years for a seasonally weak quarter.\n\nIts executive director of finance and business development A Shekhar told analysts and reporters: \"We're very pleased that we're striking the right notes on both objectives of profit growth as well as free cash-flow generation.\"\n\nThe first quarter results made for a \"good, steady start\" to the year, especially as the bottom line increased despite flat volumes and lower revenue on weaker commodity prices.\n\nBut scratch a little deeper beneath the surface, and there remains some causes for concern in Olam's results.\n\nIts net gearing remained at 1.93 times as net debt levels stayed unchanged. The gearing ratio is within the firm's internal limit of two times, but in times of higher commodity prices - which would result in a need for more working capital - this limit could be breached on occasions, Olam conceded.\n\nAt the same time, the interest expense that the firm is incurring on its debt is not included in the free cash flow definition it has adopted - that of free cash flow to firm (FCFF).\n\nUsing this measure, Olam generated positive free cash flow of $46 million in the first quarter, compared with the negative free cash flow of $706.8 million in the corresponding period last year.\n\nBut when interest expenses are taken into account, the number turns negative. Free cash flow to equity (FCFE), a measure more relevant for stock investors, was a negative $117.2 million, although this was much improved from the negative $844.3 million last year.\n\nOlam plans to be FCFF-positive at the end of the new financial year, a target it brought forward by a year after its strategic review in April.\n\nIt remains on track to do so, it said, through higher operating cash flow from existing businesses, a lower pace of capital expenditure and initiatives such as the sale-and-leaseback transactions and divestments to unlock value from past investments.\n\nTo be FCFE-positive - necessary to improve the comfort levels of investors - will, however, take a few more years.\n\nThis will be achieved by FY2016, Olam chief executive officer Sunny Verghese told The Business Times last Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the question of whether Olam will be able to divest part of its stake in the capital-intensive Gabon fertiliser project remains. Olam had invested in the urea-based fertiliser plant in western Africa in November 2010. While it estimated the cost to be at US$1.3 billion, the World Bank has placed the costs at between US$1.5 billion and US$2 billion.\n\nThe investment was also one of nine cited by Muddy Waters, which said little progress had been made on the plant.\n\nOlam now plans to cut its 80 per cent stake to below 50 per cent. The firm has spent S$141.2 million so far on dredging works and developing the site for construction, but will be capping its spending on the project at S$150 million until there is further progress.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Verghese said two groups of investors were doing due diligence on the project, and that whether the negotiations will come to pass will have a bearing on Olam's success in the execution of its new strategy.\n\nTo the firm's credit, much work has been done to achieve its latest results since its strategic review ended less than a year ago. These include two sale-and-leaseback transactions of its almond orchards in the United States and Australia, the sale of a basmati rice mill in India and a cotton gin in Australia, and the divestment of a stake in a noodle-manufacturing plant.\n\nIn particular, the amount it will cost Olam to lease the almond orchards through the sale-and-leaseback transactions will be lower than the cost of its long-term debt, hence improving overall returns to the firm, Mr Verghese said.\n\nOlam has also restructured four business units. It has:\n\nTo enhance the communication of its results to its stakeholders, Olam unveiled a new results format last Thursday, doing away with its previous performance metrics of gross and net contribution in favour of the more universal Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation); it also added a management and discussion analysis segment.\n\nThese represent a good start. But the firm remains a work in progress. Like a large ship that needs time to re-calibrate its direction, it will be a long while more before it is able to reduce its gearing level and turn FCFE-positive - and thereby lay to rest anxiety in the market over its stock once and for all.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What makes for an effective social media strategy, in handling both good news and bad?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nIF you don't exist on the Web today, you simply don't exist. Decisions are influenced by information on the Web. Castlewood Group has harnessed these beliefs. Our Web presence is our \"window on the world\".\n\nSocial media is neither a luxury nor an entertaining diversion; it is a very important spoke in the marketing wheel. There is no short-cut strategy; it's long haul. Each social media platform has its own quirks and pace, and your contributions must follow the language. All news, good or bad, requires content creation and communication. You need dedicated resources in place 24/7 to participate successfully.\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMHC Medical Network\n\nTHE new TGIF (Twitter, Google, iPhone and Facebook) generation is fickle with their news consumption, and have a very short attention span. It is impossible to predict what goes viral for them - good or bad. I will be lying if I say we got this figured out. That being the case, there cannot be a SOP (standard operating procedure) in crisis management as each situation differs from another. But TGIFs tend to believe social media more because of its immediacy and perceived independence, compared to traditional media. For a start, businesses should build up their brand goodwill on social media so that when crisis strikes, what is communicated through these channels will not be seen as afterthoughts.\n\nCharlie Foo\n\nVice-President, Asia-Pacific\n\nBrocade\n\nJUST like fire, social media can be a good servant but a bad master. We now live in an era of transparency and greater accountability where information can be accessed anytime, anywhere and in real time. Enterprises must come to terms with this reality, and institute standard processes, best practices and tools to handle social chatter and respond promptly to unfavourable viewpoints and sentiment. Data analytics tools can help automate the process and enable an organisation to address an issue quickly before it turns into a crisis. Enterprises should also have a clear and lawful set of social media policy and guidelines in place to manage employees' social media usage and the potential impact on their reputation.\n\nArvind Agarwalla\n\nCEO\n\nFACT Software International Pte Ltd\n\nOUR in-house design team has created a crisp corporate website, in line with our communications and branding strategy. The site is updated regularly for the public - no one wishes to read yesterday's news.\n\nSince we are a B2B (business-to-business) company, there is limited scope for Facebook engagement. My Twitter account relates to personal branding. We are experiencing better results on LinkedIn in engaging with our stakeholders.\n\nTo sum up, the social media strategy is integral to our operations - it is a full-time job. To think of it any other way would be dangerous. The key is to respond, not react.\n\nDane Anderson\n\nVice-President, Research Director,\n\nAsia-Pacific Region Manager\n\nForrester Research\n\nWE believe that the only true competitive advantage in this Age of the Customer is to be customer-obsessed. As our customers increasingly lead \"always connected\" lifestyles, we strongly encourage our employees to be active on social media, regularly connecting with customers and widening their networks. We also build into their performance reviews, social metrics on blogs as well as activity on platforms such as Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nIn times of crisis, affected customers want to be regularly updated so the speed of communication needs to be even more frequent. But more important than that, the principles of consistent, clear and transparent online and offline communication are critical to ensure that customers feel that they can continue to trust the brand.\n\nPaul Endacott\n\nSouth-East Asia Managing Director\n\nAmbition\n\nWITH the popularity of social media and its increased importance as part of a marketing strategy, we now see a greater emphasis on our corporate Web presence. That is because Web presence is the \"shop front\" of a company and, in this digital age, usually the first point of contact between an organisation and a consumer.\n\nWe recognise that a mismanaged Web presence will have a negative impact on our company image and employer brand, and having an effective online strategy is critical to maximising commercial opportunities. When everything is online and the audience has a wider platform to lend their voice, organisations have to be transparent and maintain integrity when it comes to dealing with information and news, whether good or bad. How a company conducts itself when communicating or dealing with issues will not escape the eyes of the public, and this needs to be properly managed in a fast and transparent manner.\n\nMax Loh\n\nCountry Managing Partner\n\nErnst & Young LLP\n\nTHE use of social media must be based on the principles of transparency, accuracy and timeliness when delivering information - be it good or bad news - so as to maintain the trust of the audience. Social media use must be purpose-driven.\n\nAt EY, we leverage such platforms at the corporate and individual leadership level to build both the EY brand and personal brand of our leaders in the market, and drive conversations with a wide spectrum of stakeholders from clients to recruits.\n\nSocial media is a double-edged sword, hence having a strategy, policy and governance for its use is critical. Leading companies create social media strategies that are aligned with business objectives which include measurement plans; develop enterprise-wide policies to guide employee usage; and educate and train staff to operate safely and effectively in social media.\n\nTony Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nAedas Architects Singapore\n\nTHIS is the Web Age. Information and news go viral in seconds, which pushes us to think thoroughly before designing. It is important that the actual buildings stay faithful to the original concepts because what we design may be seen by many in an instant. The Web then helps improve and define our work.\n\nSocial media, on the other hand, allows us to establish and enhance our relationship with our global following. It offers a connecting platform for publishing updates, sharing news and exchanging ideas. We have to be engaging and reactive, informing people that we are willing to be acceptive.\n\nSeah Kian Peng\n\nCEO (Singapore)\n\nNTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd\n\nSOCIAL media provides an organisation with another platform to engage with its stakeholders and the public at large. It is an important presence that facilitates communication and engagement. Given its reach and pervasiveness, positive or negative issues can spread and escalate very quickly. Messaging in social media must therefore focus on building social capital and trust - and in turn, become a trusted source where people can verify information from.\n\nNTUC FairPrice recognises the strength of social media. We were one of the first retailers in Singapore to start a Facebook community, which currently has about 99,000 fans,and to initiate mobile applications to provide services such as grocery shopping and wine pairing.\n\nFor the uninitiated, social media can appear daunting but it serves as a communication platform where valuable feedback can be sought and also quickly acted upon. I am glad we started our social media presence early in 2009; we have not looked back since.\n\nLionel Lim\n\nPresident, Asia-Pacific and Japan\n\nCA Technologies\n\nTHIS is a new connected world. CA Technologies has embraced social media in all interactions with our customers, partners and employees globally. Never before have we had such a communications platform enabling so many new ways to share thoughts, ideas, stories and feedback.\n\nAs social media is inherently transparent and shareable, companies need to know how to embrace both good and bad conversations. We harness social media channels in an integrated way, where we listen in to what our internal and external stakeholders are saying, as well participate in conversations.\n\nToday, we are building social media elements into all our communication and marketing campaigns to engage and support our customers. This has truly helped us become more responsive and engaged in a region that is so digitally connected and socially interactive.\n\nPhilip Brett\n\nPresident, South & South-east Asia\n\nTBWA\\Asia-Pacific\n\nAS an international communications company, we are intimately involved in guiding the online presence of our clients, and there are some golden rules of engagement from a social media viewpoint. The key in effective online management lies in timely, honest and open communication, be it positive or negative news; indeed, even more so if there is a need to manage bad news. If an organisation is at fault, there should be an immediate response to acknowledge the situation. Internally, it is crucial to appoint a community manager empowered to take charge in the event of a crisis, the go-to person that everyone can quickly identify. That way, timely effective responses can ensure that the ball always remains firmly in the organisation's court.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB\n\nOUR business is about testing, auditing, certification and inspection. As a B2B business, social media is an important tool for us to communicate with the public and our customers directly. We understand the viral influence of this hyper trend, and have put in place a robust policy to ensure that we use it effectively. We have embraced Facebook and Twitter to educate the public about the latest safety and quality standards, our thought leadership on issues affecting society today and, of course, about what we do.\n\nIn our opinion, an informed public makes a knowledgeable public, who will in turn demand higher levels of quality and safety from their vendors and suppliers. This will ultimately raise industry benchmarks. In the event of negative publicity or circumstance, open, honest and timely communication with the public and our customers is key. Social media is a good channel to keep them in the loop and assure them that we are on top of things, thereby avoiding speculation and dissemination of inaccurate information.\n\nJulien Le Noble\n\nManaging Director\n\nCME Group, Head of Asia-Pacific\n\nCME Group was the pioneer among exchanges in using social media. Since 2007, we have been actively using these tools to help us educate our audiences about our products, services and the crucial role of risk management. Social media allows us to be relevant to our followers as we engage in real time. For instance, we launched our Weibo account two years ago and our Japanese Twitter account in September. These allow us to talk and listen to people in those countries and demonstrate that we not only want to share information but we also are there to listen. For us, social media is about being in close proximity to, and deeply engaged with, our many stakeholders in a timely manner.\n\nChris Wei\n\nGroup CEO\n\nGreat Eastern Holdings\n\nAT Great Eastern, we have a very open approach to social media as a two-way communication channel. Over the past two years, we have embraced many different channels from Facebook to Pinterest and LinkedIn across the region. In today's world, we believe that these are essential communication channels for Great Eastern to engage with our customers and deliver on our brand promise. Harnessing social media has enabled Great Eastern to obtain real-time feedback and deeper insights into our customers' needs, enabling us to make more timely and proactive improvements across our customer touchpoints.\n\nWe have found social media to be a powerful tool in increasing our visibility, building relationships with our customers as well as in sharing ideas, knowledge and information. A recent example of how we connected with our users in real time was for the Great Eastern Women's Run where we posted regular updates to the 14,000 participants prior to the start of the race. As a result, we achieved a very good turnout despite the challenging weather conditions.\n\nOur Great Eastern social media strategy is anchored on ensuring consistency in branding and messaging; creating quality content as well as adopting a listening-and-responding approach. Above all, we place priority on transparency and honesty in our communication.\n\nIn a world where words travel in seconds thanks to social media, companies must be prepared to handle situations at lightning speed. It is essential for crisis communications plans to include messaging via the various social media platforms should the need arise.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nAN effective social media strategy keeps up with the pace of news. Prompt responses and interactions on these platforms are critical in allowing the company to generate interest for positive news and to handle arising issues in a timely manner. More importantly, an effective strategy would deliver consistent branding for the company and enhance corporate communications for its stakeholders.\n\nAt Fircroft, the team has effectively leveraged on social media platforms to articulate its corporate developments, as well as featuring topical and engaging blog items on engineering work from its website, which sees 100,000 unique visitors a month. Our Facebook and Twitter pages have also been gaining a steady following.\n\nShawn Balakrishnan\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nThe Hoffman Agency Singapore\n\nAS a global communications agency, we have been managing both our clients' and our company's corporate presence in the media for decades. With the surge of social media, it is no surprise that we have been seeing demand for reputation management services on the Web for our clients. Indeed, many companies are eager to jump on the bandwagon but are ill-prepared to deal with a crisis online.\n\nAt The Hoffman Agency, we take special attention to create protocols for crises and appoint community managers who are well-trained to deal with them. For example, there should be an agreed set of social media guidelines for community managers to respond to any situation within a stipulated time (within an hour for most cases). Community managers should also be culturally-sensitive and possess the relevant skill sets to relay information with accuracy and tact. Social media is indeed a double-edged tool for companies and should not be taken lightly. When correctly used, the benefits are tremendous for the brand.\n\nHari Krishnan\n\nManaging Director\n\nLinkedIn Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nCONTENT is king and relevance is its chief strategist. Bill Gates' first LinkedIn Influencer post underscores how relevant content drives conversations. Within 48 hours, it generated over a million page views.\n\nCompanies leveraging social media should fully understand the context of each social platform. For example, over three million companies use LinkedIn to engage a community in a professional context, to elevate their corporate brands.\n\nWhile a benefit is real-time dialogue, companies need to sustain it by being authentic and \"always on\", particularly when communicating bad news.\n\nSuccessful companies \"listen\" to conversations and deploy analytics to make content even more relevant. Done well, your content can go viral and you can strengthen your bond with multiple stakeholders.\n\nThomas Zilliacus\n\nCo-Founder, Chairman & CEO\n\nYuuZoo Corporation\n\nYUUZOO Corporation is a global provider of dedicated e-commerce enabled social networks for companies. MANY companies have a very low level of understanding of the importance of their own dedicated social network. This is alarming in view of the very rapid growth of social media, e-commerce and m-commerce.\n\nMost young consumers already communicate and make their buying decisions within social networks. Companies that do not understand this and do not have a complete social media strategy stand the risk of not only losing market share, they - in many cases - risk disappearing all together. The future is already here; companies must make sure that they understand what is required and create the solutions to stay in control.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA)\n\nTO meet our members' expectations in this digital age, we strive for timely communications. Apart from our corporate website, we have an ISCA mobile app that provides real-time updates and have a presence on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Blogger and Google+. These channels enable ISCA to engage our members in a more personal way.\n\nFor example, we held a Facebook Chat for students and aspiring accountants to understand transitional arrangements for the Singapore Qualification Programme. To celebrate our 50th anniversary this year, we ran a photo contest on Facebook. Recently, we held a Google+ Hangout on Air session with ISCA members to dialogue with ISCA president Ernest Kan.\n\nOur social and digital channels allow us to be immersed in the digital conversation that is taking place 24/7. We engage in social listening to understand our members' needs, using the knowledge to craft relevant, exclusive content.\n\nTo ISCA, the digital sphere is not just a means to increase the number of digital connections with members but part of a holistic, integrated strategy to create a digital customer experience that builds brand equity, member engagement and loyalty.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nTHE strength of social media is undeniable, given that the world today is wired 24/7. It is imperative to have a Web presence for any entity, especially one that engages in global business. The extent of usage, however, varies across industries.\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures is largely a brick-and-mortar business where physical facilities and real-time human touch far supersede virtual experience. We have in recent times jazzed up our corporate website to generate greater targeted traffic with refreshing visual treats and news flasheswhich encourage repeat hits as well as to facilitate search engine optimisation. Interactions with users is restricted only to registered clients as an attempt to control Web activity within corporate boundaries. We have also key administrators to oversee all online portals - corporate website, corporate Facebook page and corporate LinkedIn account - with strict social media etiquette.\n\nFor businesses that engage heavily in social media, especially the B2C (business-to-consumer) industry, good online governance and strict protocols are mandatory and key to effective deployment. A team of Web-savvy public relations trained administrators will be needed to safeguard the company's interest and ensure quick turnaround in both seizing opportunities and crisis management.\n\nLeong Soo Yee\n\nHead\n\nACCA Singapore\n\nA RECENT report entitled Digital Darwinism: Thriving in the face of technology change by ACCA (the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and IMA (Institute of Management Accountants) identified social technologies as one of the top 10 technologies with the potential to drastically reshape the business landscape.\n\nOrganisations must explore the possibilities offered by social media and \"enterprise\" social tools that can enhance decision-making and productivity, and build brand loyalty. They need to continuously innovate to keep up with the digital revolution. Compelling content and the ability to present it in creative ways are key elements of an effective social media strategy.\n\nGood news should be supported by credible facts and reasoned analysis. In managing bad news, organisations should always be prompt in addressing customers' queries and ensure transparency in providing information.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE proliferation of social media today has made it all the more imperative for companies to actively manage their corporate presence, as well as have strong contingency plans in place for crisis management. At PrimeStaff, our corporate presence extends from a website that is professionally managed and regularly updated, to leveraging on social media as a tool to connect with our clients and job candidates, as we are in the recruitment business.\n\nAn effective social media strategy calls for authenticity, tact and sensitivity. The communication needs to be real as you are, interacting with people on a very direct, personal level. It also requires a good grounding in public relations, as crisis management skills are needed when something goes wrong. For example, when handling a negative situation on social media, timeliness of response is critical as news can go viral at the touch of a button, and the socialsphere can be very unforgiving.\n\nMichael Jenkins\n\nChief Executive\n\nRoffey Park Asia-Pacific\n\nBY not embracing social media, organisations are missing out on a valuable source of conversation and feedback, and may be viewed as out of touch. Any social media strategy must be authentic and specific to your needs so that your organisation retains its identity and stands out from the crowd.\n\nOrganisations need to deepen their understanding about how to develop people who have grown up with social media. These are colleagues who enjoy and use social media extensively and who recognise its (still understated) value in building human relationships. As chief executives, we need to ensure that our social media-savvy staff identify with our goals and that we have a consistent, compelling and generationally sensitive approach to messaging across both digital and traditional communication methods. We also need to relinquish \"control\" over access to social media platforms during work time. Social media is active 24/7 so we need to trust our people and give them access wherever and whenever they need it.\n\nPoh Mui Hoon\n\nGroup CEO\n\nIconz-Webvisions\n\nAS an enterprise business, we use social media as a way of connecting with our stakeholders. For example, we use LinkedIn to not only source for talent but also to provide updates on our corporate activities and offer technology advice. We see social media as an extension of our existing communication platforms, where specific ground rules based on human resource and management policies are already in place.\n\nAll content posted is cleared through rigorous review processes, and only approved spokesmen can communicate on social media. While the control of negative comments can be tricky, we believe that the best approach is to respond quickly and calmly, and to always be open and honest in our communication. Often, it may mean taking the conversation elsewhere - whether e-mail, phone or face-to-face. Just like the offline business world, developing relationships takes time and effort, and the same holds for social media.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\njobsDB Singapore and Malaysia\n\nJOBSDB has been actively managing our corporate presence on the Web since 1998. From our experience, the best way of handling both good news and bad news on social media is to be authentic, consistent and focused - and in times of strife, speed is of the essence.\n\nWe work hard to develop real connections with our customers and the public by injecting our posts with our personality, values and passion. Our communication strategy is surrounded by the theme \"Let's Explore\" - to encourage people to explore their potential and capabilities through the many opportunities that jobsDB offers. With the Web's reach, it is important that jobsDB remains focused in knowing its followers and having genuine interactions to grow our reach organically. With an approach rooted in authenticity and consistency, we often find our online followers to be the ones amplifying our message by sharing our posts via their personal social media channels.\n\nRiaz Mehta\n\nPresident and Founder\n\nImagine Group\n\nSOCIAL media has given us a direct communication channel with our audience, which is a real asset in the world of content and entertainment. We are currently focused on building communities, and this is enabling us to learn more about what our viewers love about the content that we are creating. In effect we are using social media to amplify the conversation around our shows airing currently, such as The Apartment, as well as increase the global reach of our brands.\n\nI feel that we are still in the infancy of social media with Imagine Group, but I am very excited about the future. The key for us has been forward planning and developing a clear strategy from the outset, defining what social media means for us and our business.\n\nNews, both good and bad, travels like wildfire online so preparation and process is key. When you get this right, the value multipliers are huge - but you do have to be prepared for the negatives as well. The upside for us is that in our industry any news is good news, and social media is the most effective channel to drive this conversation - so we feel we are on a really good thing here.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nIN today's world, it is crucial to keep content relevant and current. With the rise in social media platforms, organisations have to stay relevant and be prepared for crises as well as understand the benefits of having an engaged and strong following. The key to effective social media strategies is in ensuring that key stakeholders are well-informed and kept in the loop regardless of the news type. Having all employees follow company social networks can be very beneficial. Social media can be advantageous in many ways, such as in helping to build strong corporate culture as well as corporate branding.\n\nLouis Song\n\nSingapore Country Manager\n\nInternational Business Group at Tencent, the company behind the WeChat app\n\nSOCIAL media is not only here to stay, it is spreading beyond desktops and onto mobile platforms. We see signs of this trend as teenagers abandon established social media platforms such as Facebook for newer, innovative mobile social media. At WeChat, we have seen a staggering 1,021 per cent increase in active usage among teens 16 to 19 years old between Q1 and Q3 in 2013.\n\nThe implications of this in the business arena are multifold. To engage well with consumers, partners and employees, businesses need to be able to understand and navigate the mobile social communications space. They also need to start enhancing their digital and communications capabilities to be able to defend their corporate reputation on the digital, mobile front. To do this, companies need to start looking into new processes and training that can help them successfully weld mobile social technologies and remain relevant in the marketplace and with consumers. By proactively investing in building its communications capabilities and delving into this new landscape, business will be able to ensure that they are leading the way rather than playing catch-up with its competition and customers.\n\nJanet Ang\n\nManaging Director\n\nIBM Singapore\n\nIn a new study by IBM's Institute for Business Value, 54% of C-suite executives surveyed said they will need to embrace the use of digital channels to drive customer interactions.\n\nIn Singapore, IBM recently partnered the Institute of Systems Science to set up the first ever Enterprise Social Business Centre of Excellence in Singapore. The centre aims to transform companies into social businesses by leveraging on social media platforms and tools to improve productivity, connect for innovation and create communities for competitive advantage.\n\nCompanies that are successful with social media usually do two things well: they enable a candid dialogue with their stakeholders and offer them meaningful, value-added content.\n\nDavid Crammond\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMaachu Pte Ltd\n\nSOCIAL media is a news accelerator, and the audience now dictates the urgency of response. Having an effective social media strategy requires the company to have a streamlined decision process around public comment. Traditional top-down decision making requires new skills that first recognises and then leverages on the many social platforms.\n\nMaachu, which has developed the next generation recruitment platform, communicates to all our stakeholders, especially consumers, in a timely manner when we provide information on our products and services. This ensures that we provide them the avenue to make well-informed decisions.\n\nDoina Palici-Chehab\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nCORPORATE presence online needs to move beyond simply presence. At AXA, some of our popular products can be purchased online, whether on our website or through our partners' websites. Recognising that our stakeholders may also want to interact with us online, we recently started using social media for some of our recruitment needs. This has been effective in giving prospective employees an additional opportunity to interact with us before even applying for a job. Globally, AXA also recently announced the creation of AXA Lab in Silicon Valley, with one of its missions being to connect with Internet leaders. I believe that this will put us in a good position to leverage on innovations online as a Group.\n\nMatthew Overington\n\nRegional Co-Lead, Technology Practice, Asia\n\nHill + Knowlton Strategies\n\nHAVING a social media presence is essentially a commitment to customers, consumers or stakeholders to a conversation. When an organisation chooses to interact via social media, it has an obligation to interact with speed, openness and transparency regardless of positive or negative conversations.\n\nThe most successful social media strategies have two things in common: structure and commitment. Structure is important to ensure that content is engaging and updated regularly, and that interactions with the public are conducted according to guidelines that ensure honesty and transparency. It is important to note that building a presence on the Web is a long-term process, and organisations must ensure that they plan accordingly instead of gunning for quick successes that are not sustainable.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nSocial media, if harnessed appropriately, can help enhance the relationship between a company and its customers. In today's digital age, where almost everyone is connected virtually, having a corporate presence on the Web can help organisations connect and reach out to their virtual community.\n\nOrganisations need to be mindful that just as technology evolves, so do customers. Today's customers are more discerning and will rarely rely on a single source of information. It is therefore important that companies develop a strategy that evolves around their own distinctive brand with authenticity and focus.\n\nWhile it is good to have a presence in as many online portals as possible, community engagement can put a strain on employees. In view of this, targeted choices should be made based on the company's brand elements, to ensure that the online portals align with the organisation's vision and mission. Along with this, companies need to be transparent and clear on what they are trying to communicate. This applies to admitting mistakes. In doing so, it makes the organisation seem \"human\" and will help earn that element of trust that can make a difference between an organisation's success and failure.\n\nBenjamin Tan\n\nGroup CEO\n\nYolk / Grey Group\n\nTHE undeniable truth is that in today's digital age no company can avoid this. So it will do better in dealing with this head-on as both a potential banana skin as well as an opportunity to connect.\n\nHave a crisis management system in place so that crises are handled fast and effectively. This entails identifying stakeholders and getting them involved in designing and buying-in to a process workflow that is defined for more common scenarios. Prepare responses to scenarios in advance when there is no pressure. This will ensure the right, well thought-out response because it is just as important not to overeact. Utilise tools to be alerted to any potential crisis situations - there are many social listening tools out there where you can set up alerts for, say, a sudden upsurge in mentions of your brand or products. Look for signs. For example, if you have a relationship with key influencers, sometimes they will be the ones to give you a heads-up. Take interest in your own brand. The fact of the matter is, a lot of brands leave it up to third parties to engage on social media with customers without truly embracing it themselves. Nobody else can or should be able to speak for your business or brand better than you. If you treat your fans right, you may notice that when things go wrong, often they will be the first ones who come to your defence, and in numbers too.\n\nSteve Melhuish\n\nCo-Founder and Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nPropertyGuru\n\nTHE cold hard truth about companies with social media and website presence is that this digital function is still very much in its nascent stage and, at best, a corporate online entity borne out of good governance. Companies run their online assets perfunctorily rather than as a means to refreshing and extending their database and building revenue streams. Company leaders still adopt a brick-and-mortar attitude to raising equity value and prefer face-to-face interactions with stakeholders and sealing mega deals in the traditional boardroom realm. It is inconceivable to maintain strong investor relations through a social media portal that is deemed more for entertaining and personal updates. At the end of the day, issuing company announcements in print to the press and shareholders is the preferred route of ensuring sustainable counter performance. Not micro-blogs or postings on social media sites! Operating a successful corporate social media platform has to be larger than a brand marketer's lofty dream. This is a communications platform that companies are hesitant to take on. That is because true engagement and conversations on social media just does not happen. Clicking \"Likes\" and commenting on a posting has no inherent value but is just a superficial, social response to something of entertainment value - so \"style\" to amuse social onlookers rather than substance rules the social sphere. Because people talk to people and not to a social media postings, I go back to companies developing positive connections with consumers and stakeholders. This is never based on a traditional advertisement model but through offering true value that fulfils needs and aspirations. Singapore is run very much in a controlled corporate and media environment with a strong culture of checks and balances. Social media crises would occur more in the west because of total corporate liberalisation.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nSOCIAL media is seen as a double-edged sword by most companies. Due to the potential risks involved, many companies remain undecided about leveraging on social media as a crucial business resource. We need to realise that once we begin real-time engagement with our customers, we no longer have a grasp on the way that our brand image takes. To ensure that social media strategies are effective, it is important to identify and communicate the evolution of social media within the enterprise. Social media efforts are unlikely to increase brand commitment and customer relationships of a company overnight, so there should be continuous dedication and regular evaluation of its effectiveness on marketing strategies, customer relations and sales and promotion if the company decides to launch a social media marketing campaign. Social media does produce many benefits and increased profits to a company if done strategically. As an organisation, it is important to comprehend all aspects of social media for your company and implement a tactical plan. The organisation's adaptive approach for reputation issues should be clearly defined, just as any other risk management process within the company. With apposite planning, chances for social media success should increase.\n\nEric Hoh\n\nVice-President, Asia South Region\n\nSymantec\n\nSOCIAL media is an integral part of any marketing strategy and fast becoming a strategic tool for engaging customers. However, it is important to be aware of what is being circulated in the Internet as inappropriate content can sometimes result in backlash from your customers that not only impact a company's reputation but also affect sales.\n\nTo execute an effective social media strategy, a first step is real-time monitoring and listening so that you are clued in to the latest conversations, crisis or otherwise, and assess how the situation impacts your industry, and when the dialogue has moved on. It is also important to review scheduled posts from both corporate and personal accounts and avoid communications that could be considered insensitive or capitalising on a tragedy. Always evaluate the situation, particularly in issues management as early details are often inaccurate. Be it good or bad news, it's essential to be prepared to react quickly. Be factual, human and sensitive when sharing information on social media platforms and your customers will respect you for it.\n\nAndrew Dobbins\n\nGroup Vice President\n\nVerizon Enterprise Solutions\n\nAll companies need to expect and accept that any presence on the social media is an open invitation to both praise and criticism. How companies choose to manage the risk is the key to a successful social media strategy. Understanding your audience is the first step. Verizon is in the business of driving open a new, connected world of opportunity for business and society through industry-specific enterprise technology solutions, hence our social media audience is vastly different from say, a retail business'. Through all our social media assets, and media as a whole - blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Slideshare sites - our key concern is to engage all our stakeholders via news, opinions and information. In return, we hope to encourage a two-way dialogue. It is important for us to be able to engage with customer and industry discussion as it happens, embrace all feedback, and take it back into the organisation and continue the conversation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The residential rate is half that level, at 6 per cent.\n\nLawmakers, inundated by their constituents' requests to fight the hike, reckon that assessments would go up by 100 to 300 per cent.\n\nBut DBKL maintains that the hike is justified because valuations have not been revised for 21 years even as property values have gone up significantly, as have the council's operating costs.\n\nRate-payers counter that revisions ought to be more gradual, every five years, for example.\n\nFurthermore, owners - many of them retirees - say that they do not benefit from higher property values as most occupy their homes, and believe that the proliferation of new developments should have added to DBKL's revenues.\n\nSlamming the council for its lack of consultation, they complain that its services have not improved as roads continue to be full of potholes and drains clogged, while many parts of Kuala Lumpur are dirty.\n\nThe fault does not entirely lie with DBKL since quite often, a newly resurfaced road is messed up when a utility company decides to lay down new water pipes or telco cables, and its independent contractor does a shoddy patch-up job.\n\nIn a column, tycoon Tong Kooi Ong wrote that DBKL's expected total revenue for 2013 of RM1.62 billion more than covered the RM1.4 billion budgeted in operating expenses. Although it anticipates incurring RM782 million in development expenses, about half of it would be paid from federal government funds. It is unfair to overly tax KL residents, he said, as they also pay Putrajaya hefty corporate and personal taxes.\n\nAn increase in assessment payable is likely to result in higher inflation and rentals. However, because the supply of commercial space and high-end residential units in Kuala Lumpur outstrips demand, rental hikes might be smaller.\n\nIn the past five to six years, many high-end apartments have mushroomed in Malaysia's biggest city, fuelled by strong demand on the back of low interest rates, easy credit and financing schemes such as Dibs (developer interest bearing scheme), and more relaxed real property gains tax (RPGT).\n\nBut the party could be coming to an end as RPGT rates have been doubled and Dibs has been banned to the delight of those such as Chang Kim Loong, honorary secretary-general of the National House Buyers Association (HBA), who blame speculators for ramping prices up.\n\nMr Chang said that an assessment payable increase would unduly penalise the majority of private home owners who have one or two properties. \"If City Hall wishes to increase the (assessment) for private homes . . . HBA proposes a hike of not more than 10 per cent.\"\n\nOwners who do not agree with the new assessment have about a month to object in writing.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The mother of two and her husband will pay 43 per cent more for a similar-sized apartment, moving their children away from friends after disagreeing with their landlord over terms of a new lease.\n\n\"This is insane,\" said Ms El-Said, who pays 8,750 dirhams (S$3,000) per month for an apartment on the Palm Jumeirah man-made island. \"It's like you have to move house every two years. You feel no stability in where you live and you're always at the mercy of landlords whose sole interest is making more money.\"\n\nRent increases and the conflicts that go with them are climbing in the city of about 2.2 million, rattling a workforce that's mostly foreign, as a rebounding property market and a surging economy embolden landlords. Buying a home has become more difficult after the central bank damped lending for most of the year by proposing tighter mortgage restrictions and imposing new transaction fees.\n\nRents rose by 15 per cent for apartments and 14 per cent for single-family homes on average in the past year, Jones Lang LaSalle wrote in an October report, citing data compiled by researcher Reidin.com. Salaries for non-government employees increased 5.6 per cent in the United Arab Emirates during that time, according to a survey of more than 200 companies by Mercer LLC, a New York-based consulting firm.\n\n\"Dubai should be worried about rising rents because there is no upside to the government or society,\" said Farouk Soussa, the London-based head of Middle East economics at Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. \"It goes against Dubai's best economic interest because it erodes its competitiveness.\"\n\nLegal disputes over leases have jumped since the property market began to rebound, Sultan Bin Mejren, director-general of Dubai's Land Department said in September. The regulator in September said it will create a rental dispute tribunal to simplify the way disagreements are handled and more than double the capacity to about 250 cases a week. The purpose of the centre is to achieve \"social and economic stability for all concerned\", the Land Department said in a statement.\n\nDubai's economy is headed for the fastest expansion in six years as it benefits from an increase in hotel occupancy and manufacturing. Gross domestic product grew 4.9 per cent in the first half, compared with a 4.4 per cent increase in 2012,the statistics office said on Nov 6.\n\nRents are \"definitely becoming a concern for companies as prices have shot up in the past 12 to 18 months\", said Nuno Gomes, who advises businesses on employee compensation for Mercer. \"If things continue at this pace, the allowances that are being provided won't be enough.\"\n\nAnnual rent for a mid-range three-bedroom villa was 212,500 dirhams on average. Rents range from 167,500 dirhams to 338,000 dirhams depending on the quality and location, according to Cluttons LLC. That compares with an average of US$3,862 per month, or US$46,344 per year, in Manhattan, where rents, charged monthly, rose 0.2 per cent last year.\n\nLeasing costs in Dubai rose this year amid expectations that the government would step in to cool the emirate's surging homebuying market. Mortgage lending stalled in the first quarter after the United Arab Emirates central bank said it would cap the value of mortgages taken by foreigners to 50 per cent of a first home's value.\n\nAfter holding talks with lenders, the central bank in October limited mortgages to foreign buyers to 75 per cent of the value of a first home valued at five million dirhams or less. It also capped loans for second homes and barred payments made with credit cards or personal loans. Dubai doubled property sales fees to 4 per cent from 2 per cent in October.\n\nLandlords in Dubai are already getting yields that are twice the global average. Rental income as a percentage of the purchase price ranges from 5 per cent to 6 per cent compared with a world average of 2 per cent to 3 per cent, Goldman Sachs Group said in an Oct 21 report.\n\nDubai's Real Estate Regulatory Agency allows increases of 5 per cent to 10 per cent based on an index that tracks the values across the city. Conflicts arise when the owners try to get tenants to move out to achieve a bigger increase, Ludmila Yamalova, a partner at law firm HPL Yamalova & Plewka JLT, said.\n\nFaced with a rent increase they couldn't accept, Ms El-Said and her husband agreed to vacate the house in one year. Their new home, also on the Palm Jumeirah island, will cost 45,000 dirhams more, plus another 20,000 dirhams in moving costs and fees.\n\n\"This isn't justified because salaries didn't climb anywhere near the rents,\" she said. She is already making plans to move back to the US before her children reach school age because the additional costs \"make moving back a no-brainer financially\". - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

She also added that she might have to make frequent trips to London as a result.\n\nMs Ng declined to go on the record when asked why she was suing the investment banking firm.\n\n\"I'm not at liberty to discuss the details of the suit as the solicitors are still working on it,\" she said.\n\nAs for her future plans, Ms Ng said that she was still an independent director at LionGold, and would continue to serve at that company. She also plans to concentrate on her legal practice for the time being.\n\nIn its statement to SGX, Blumont said that it was in the process of identifying a suitable replacement. The commodities company also thanked Ms Ng for her services and contributions as a director.\n\nBlumont and LionGold are part of the infamous trio of penny stocks - Asiasons Capital being the third company - that suffered a crash in their shares after huge rallies in their share prices earlier in the year.\n\nThe fiasco resulted in the Monetary Authority of Singapore saying that it would conduct an extensive review of the share price volatility.

That compares with a gain of 1.3 per cent for corporate sukuk from the Gulf Cooperation Council, according to HSBC/Nasdaq Dubai indices. Emirates ordered 150 planes from Boeing Co and 50 from Airbus SAS at this week's Dubai Airshow.\n\nThe airline has exploited Dubai's location to turn the city into an intercontinental hub, linking Europe and the Americas with Asia-Pacific and Africa. The world's largest international carrier said last week that it transported 15 per cent more passengers in the six months to Sept 30 than a year ago after receiving new planes and adding routes. Emirates said in August it's mulling sukuk sales to help finance aircraft purchases.\n\n\"New plane orders result in new routes and more frequent flights,\" Yaser Abushaban, executive director of asset management at Emirates Investment Bank PJSC said last Thursday. \"That higher cash generation means a stronger ability to finance debt.\"\n\nThe carrier's order for the Boeing 777X jets has a list-price value of US$76 billion and that placed with Airbus for 50 A380 superjumbos is worth US$23 billion. Customers typically buy aircraft at a discount.\n\nWhen investing in airline industry debt, \"you are looking for operational efficiency\", Doug Bitcon, a fund manager at Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd, said last Thursday. \"Emirates has that. They have access to a home airport that can run 24 hours, a proactive and supportive government, and room for expansion.\"\n\nEmirates, which isn't rated, transported 21.5 million passengers in their fiscal first half and posted revenue of 39.8 billion dirhams (S$13.5 billion). That compares with about US$6 billion for the same period in 2008.\n\nThe carrier will have space to grow as Dubai last month opened a new airport, Al Maktoum International, that plans to have capacity for 160 million passengers a year. Dubai Airport saw 5.4 million passengers in September, up 13 per cent from a year earlier, according to airport data. The world's busiest hub, Heathrow, handled 6.6 million passengers.\n\nEmirates needs to raise US$4.5 billion in the next financial year to pay for new aircraft, Brian Jeffery, senior vice-president for corporate treasury, said in August. It needs an average of US$5.34 billion a year over the next five years, including 2013, to finance 119 planes, he said. \"If there's more issuance and it gets more frequent, it will impact the paper out there,\" Mr Abushaban said.\n\n\"At some point, the increase in issues starts cannibalising returns on older paper, and that can turn investors away. Demand is strong at the moment but with more issuance that can taper off.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Emirates raised the US$1 billion 2023 sukuk within two months of selling a US$750 million non-Syariah compliant bond. The yield on the earlier bond maturing in February 2025 gained for 11 consecutive days in March as the sukuk was announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n\"At the back of investor minds, there's always this concern that Emirates will be coming with the next order, and will be tapping the market again,\" Mr Bitcon said. \"If that was not the case, you would see the debt trade a lot tighter.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Across England and Wales, average prices fell by 2.4 per cent.\n\nAs the economy strengthens and the government ramps up property stimulus measures, Rightmove said the underlying recovery remains in place. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said this month its house price index rose to the highest in more than a decade in October.\n\n\"The excitement about Help to Buy's early launch failed to buck the seasonal trend,\" said Miles Shipside, Rightmove director. \"At this time of year it's mainly those with a more pressing need to sell that come to market, driving average asking prices down.\"\n\nOver the past quarter prices in London have risen 3.2 per cent, Rightmove said. From a year earlier, values in the city are up 6.9 per cent, while the national increase is 4 per cent.\n\n\"Estate agents expect a more buoyant 2014 as they pick up early signs of an increase in buyer interest and demand,\" Mr Shipside said. \"This side of Christmas could be the time for eager buyers to hunt out keen sellers and do a deal.\"\n\nRightmove said its survey shows almost a quarter of potential buyers are unaware of Help to Buy's second phase, which expands the government-guaranteed mortgage scheme.\n\nWith the plan facing some criticism that it may overstimulate the market, Prime Minister David Cameron defended it last week, saying it is allowing \"hardworking people\" to get onto the property ladder.

It also ordered 50 Airbus A380s, the world's biggest passenger plane, worth US$23 billion.\n\nWith demand from other Gulf carriers including Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, Boeing announced commitments for a total of 259 of the new 777 jet, previously codenamed 777X, worth about US$100 billion at list prices - the largest combined order in its history and confirming earlier Reuters stories.\n\n\"The response to the 777X has been astounding,\" Boeing chairman James McNerney said at a packed news conference to officially launch the new plane, in front of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.\n\nGulf airlines are competing with each other for a share of the traffic flooding through the region due to its growing prosperity and strategic location between East and West. And with many recession-hit European airlines strapped for cash, Gulf business is increasingly important to Boeing and Airbus.\n\nThe revamped 777 marks a new front in the battle between the two aircraft manufacturers that dominate the civil aviation industry.\n\nBoeing's new plane is aimed at heading off competition from the largest version of Airbus's A350 in the mini-jumbo market that drives growth and connectivity between continents.\n\nBoeing pledged not to let a dispute with Seattle assembly workers over where the new 777 should be built interfere with its launch, which kicked off the Nov 17-21 Dubai show.\n\nThe US group is looking for a home for the new jet after members of the International Association of Machinists rejected a proposed contract that would have seen Boeing commit to keeping the latest member of the 777 series near Seattle in exchange for restructured benefits.\n\nWith Boeing also agreeing on deals for 30 of its 787 Dreamliners with Etihad and for over 100 of its 737 planes with budget carrier flydubai, the US manufacturer looked on course to defeat Airbus in the battle for orders at the Dubai show.\n\nHowever, as well as the order from Emirates, Airbus announced a deal for 87 aircraft with Etihad which, including options for 30 more, could be worth US$26.9 billion.\n\nThe European group also has a record of springing surprises, and is keen to prevent a smooth lift-off for the new 777.\n\n\"Airbus is desperate to blunt the impact of the 777X,\" said a senior industry source, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nEmirates' A380 order was something of a coup for Airbus, which is under pressure to revive the fortunes of a plane that previously hadn't found any buyers this year and faces a cut in output unless empty 2015 production slots can be filled.\n\nEmirates is already the biggest customer of the A380 and its order for 50 more was at the top end of expectations, and brings its total orders for the plane to 140.\n\nIn a sign of the Gulf's increasing power in the industry, Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said he was confident of a shift in stance in the West that would allow the group to fly more of its planes to airports there.\n\n\"We are buying a product from their countries. So why would they not allow us to fly to these airports? If they don't, they can take their planes back,\" he said.\n\nBoeing's new 777 comes in two models including what will be the world's longest-distance passenger jet - a 350-seat model to be known as the 777-8 once the aircraft has been launched.\n\nThe larger 777-9 edition, carrying 406 people, will be the main version and be delivered starting 2020.\n\nTogether, the modernised planes call for development of carbon-fibre wings that fold at the tips to fit in the same parking spaces and new engines from General Electric.\n\nAirbus says Boeing has packed in passengers densely to make the revamped aircraft's economics work against its own all-new 350-seat model, the A350-1000, due to enter service in 2017.\n\nIt has launched a campaign for a minimum standard seat width of 45.7cm on long trips, aiming to draw attention to what it says will be the 777's narrower seats. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Its growth rate is slowing, and there is some uncertainty over policy changes that the new team will be introducing. Indonesia is losing its shine because of many difficulties, such as higher inflation and currency depreciation.\n\n\"Compared to the two countries, Singapore is recovering well from its anaemic performance in the past two years and is thus viewed as holding rela-tively better prospects.\"\n\nOf the 166 firms polled from late September to mid-October, 21 per cent named Singapore as the most promising market, 19 per cent chose Indonesia and 15 per cent selected China.\n\nThis contrasts with last year's survey results, where the top spot was held by Indonesia (20 per cent), the second by Malaysia (15 per cent) and the third by China (14 per cent).\n\nEven though one-fifth of respondents believe Singapore to be the most promising market for them, the survey's business prospects indicator showed that overall, companies here remain pessimistic about the next six months - albeit to a lesser degree than they had been a quarter ago.\n\nThe business prospects net balance, which ignores the indifferent to take the difference between the proportion of upbeat and pessimistic firms, was a negative 11 per cent - up just two percentage points from the previous quarter.\n\nStill, business activities continued to improve in Q3 2013, even though results from the quarterly survey showed that performance remained in contraction mode.\n\nSaid Ms Chow: \"Business activities strengthened across all groups of firms in Q3 2013, signalling an imminent turnaround to an expansion path.\"\n\nIndeed, fewer firms registered contracting sales, profits, and orders or new business, compared to the previous quarter.\n\nAfter stagnating for four consecutive quarters, sales picked up in Q3 due to a reduction in the number of firms that encountered lower sales of up to 25 per cent.\n\nBetter profit and orders results were recorded across all firms, whether large or small, local or foreign. Just over half of all respondents said they had business overseas.\n\nThe four indicators tracked by the survey - sales, profits, orders and business prospects - have proved to be correlated with economic growth over the survey's 18-year history.\n\nThe business prospects indicator, lagged a quarter, has shown the closest correlation to GDP (gross domestic product) growth rates. This time round, it predicts growth of between 4.2 and 5.3 per cent in Q4.\n\n\"The predictions indicate that the Singapore economy could expand by 3.5-3.7 per cent for the whole year of 2013, which would be more than double the rate of 1.3 per cent growth in the previous year,\" said Ms Chow.\n\nWhile this is already above the government's full-year growth forecast range of 2.5-3.5 per cent, some economists believe such a growth outcome is possible - especially with recent economic indicators performing better than expected.\n\nSaid UOB economist Francis Tan: \"I certainly think that the results both for Q4 and full year 2013 GDP from the survey is plausible at this stage, especially given that our manufacturing industries' business activities are on an uptrend and the services industries remained robust in growth.\"\n\nIndustrial production for September outstripped even the most bullish of market forecasts to grow 9.3 per cent from a year ago, on the back of a 20 per cent surge in electronics output and a busy time for rig and ship-builders.\n\nAdding to expectations of a better finish to the year was October's PMI reading, which rose to 51.2 from 50.5 in September, signalling a stronger-than-expected pick-up in manufacturing activity.\n\nWith this, Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin believes growth momentum could strengthen in Q4, and expects the government to raise its full-year GDP growth forecast to between 3.5 and 4 per cent.\n\nBut OCBC economist Selena Ling has her reservations: \"We are looking at 3.3 per cent for full year 2013 so (the survey's predictions) look a bit high for both the Q4 and full-year growth. While the leading indicators are improving, the US Christmas season orders may not have materialised in a big way, partly due to the fiscal uncertainties over the US partial government shutdown.\"\n\nAdded Barclays economist Joey Chew: \"We think the government may narrow its growth forecast for 2013 to 'around 3.5 per cent', but probably not raise the entire forecast range again just to be cautious and avoid sounding too bullish.\"\n\nNevertheless, DBS economist Irvin Seah, who expects GDP growth to register 3.8 per cent for 2013 and 4 per cent in 2014, said: \"Global economic conditions are improving. Barring any pre-emptive unwinding of loose monetary policy, the developed economies, specially the US and eurozone, remain firmly on their recovery path. China's economic momentum is picking up again. These factors should remain supportive of Singapore's growth outlook in the coming quarters.\"\n\nWith final GDP figures for Q3 due for release this Thursday, the median forecast of 14 economists polled by Bloomberg points to an expansion of 5.3 per cent - ahead of the government's flash estimate of 5.1 per cent year-on-year growth.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWorking on a holiday mood\n\nTripAdvisor\n\nYOU know the high that you get when you go on a holiday? The staff at TripAdvisor are on that constant high, thanks to the design of their office at Cross Street.\n\n\"People really enjoy working here, it is like being on a vacation while working,\" says Lewis Ng, TripAdvisor's commercial director for business listings.\n\nDesigned by Kyoob-id, the office has plenty of travel elements in it. \"The world is one big playground. We want to emulate a fun environment akin to a travel experience,\" says Maggie Yeo, Kyoob-id's associate director.\n\nThe fun starts when you step into the office. Strips of light-oak timber stretch across the reception ceiling to create a larger-than-life bird cage. A large pair of eyes stares back at you, but that is just Ollie the owl, TripAdvisor's brand mascot, welcoming you into the office. \"The owl icon is not only a feature wall for the reception area, but also separates the reception and the meeting rooms behind it,\" says Tiwe Tan, Kyoob-id's senior designer. The office gets views of Raffles Place, Clarke Quay and the Marina Bay area, so most of the workstations are placed along the circumference to let staff enjoy these views. Meetings and managers' rooms are in the central core.\n\nJust so that no one forgets this is the office of the world's largest travel site, there are always reminders. Instead of plain glass walls, the managers' rooms have frosted decals of well-known travel icons, such as the Statue of Liberty and the Leaning Tower of Pisa on them. Glass partitions that separate the different departments have stickers that resemble passport stamps. Some meeting rooms are named after renowned island destinations such as Bora Bora and Santorini, which are also winners in TripAdvisor's 2013 Travellers' Choice Islands awards.\n\nEven the carpet is not spared, with directional and speed-limit icons worked into the design. And, of course, it would make sense for the office to have a map of the world. This is at the pantry, where a world map collage reminiscent of a travel scrapbook is emblazoned on the wall. Another wall has been set aside for staff to put up their framed travel pictures. The office may have been designed by Kyoob-id, but the 90-strong staff from TripAdvisor played a role too. The company held a photo competition, and two of the best photos of Singapore's skyline have been printed on the walls.\n\nThe directional signs come with quirky names such as Smart Connections and A Click Away From Happiness that were thought up by the staff. The names point to the Mobile Partnerships and Cost Per Click teams respectively.\n\nBefore they moved into this office two months ago, staff were asked for their feedback on what they wanted in their new office. Among the wants were height-adjustable tables, a better stocked pantry, a recreation room and shower area which are now all in place. Mr Ng notes that his colleagues are now spending more time in the office. For example, there are many food joints around the office, but most are choosing to do takeaway meals so they can lunch in the recreation room. \"I see more people staying back in the office to do non-work stuff, which is good, since we encourage bonding among staff,\" he says.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The new leaders really delivered and promised a number of concrete changes. China's reform boat has finally set sail,\" said Yao Wei, economist for Societe Generale.\n\nWhile restating it will increase the role of the market and pursue financial reform, the document fills many holes including that China will grant migrant workers more rights, abolish labour camps and modify it's very contested one-child policy - all issues which were omitted from the first draft.\n\nXi Jinping addressed many issues close to the heart of the Chinese including pollution, redistribution of wealth and corruption. \"To solve all these problems, the key issue is reform,\" he said. \"We absolutely must not waver\".\n\n\"This is the most impressive statement of reform intentions that we've seen this century. This document is clear, wide-ranging and does not shy away from areas of contention. This is the \"Master Plan\" that President Xi promised,\" commented Mark Williams, China economist with research firm Capital Economics.\n\nThe plan's first aim is to restructure and rebalance the economy to a more sustainable model by providing greater spending power to the population. Many imbalances are addressed such as the overpowering role of the state which will be cut back and that of state-owned enterprises (SOE), the main beneficiaries of growth so far, which will see more of their profits redistributed in the form of higher taxes.\n\nMigrants and farmers, most of whom have benefitted far less than the urban middle class from China's 30 years of double digit growth, will be granted more rights to unleash earnings and better redistribute GDP.\n\nMore specifically on the economic and financial front China will ease pricing regulations in transportation and telecommunications, water, oil, natural gas and electricity, all currently strictly controlled by the state.\n\nInvestments for private and foreign firms will be simplified, on a par with what is being tried out in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone. Private investors will be allowed to set up banks. Appraisal of local governments' performance will focus more on aspects other than GDP, such as pollution, excess capacity and debt. And fiscal spending will decouple from fiscal revenue or GDP. Furthermore China will allow private capital to take equity stakes in state-funded projects.\n\nThe plan adds that dividends paid by state-owned companies, which include some of China's largest firms, would increase to 30 per cent by 2020, from the current five per cent to 15 per cent.\n\nChina will also launch a series of experiments including putting together markets for farmers to swap land, further imposing property taxes, creating an intellectual-property court and expanding carbon-trading exchanges to more cities.\n\nThe document also points to reform of the judiciary currently intertwined with vested interests of local government officials, party members and businessmen. China will \"boost the judicial system to protect human rights\" the plan said and \"improve mechanisms to avoid false accusations and confessions obtained through torture\".\n\nThe country will abolish the re-education through labour system, will reduce the scope of the death penalty and reform its petitioning system.\n\nAnother breakthrough is the easing of the one-child policy in place since 1979. The number of couples allowed to have two children under the law will be expanded to include families where only one parent is an only child.\n\nPreviously the law granted this concession only to couples where both parents were the only children. This comes at a time when reports show that China's fertility rates are dropping, the population aging drastically, and point to a looming labour shortage in the coming years.\n\nAs a first and important step to reform China's household registration system, or hukou, which leaves millions of migrant workers unable to access public services in the cities, requirements for access to social welfare and affordable housing will be abolished in small cities and eased in medium-sized cities.\n\nNone of these reforms are particularly new and many such as reform of the household registration system have been in the works for years, endlessly delayed by internal politics in the rigid one-party system and by vested interests. But this is the first time specifics have been so clearly spelt out in a general plan offering a global vision for the country.\n\nPresident Xi who came into power exactly one year ago has been promoting the need for reform - stalled by the previous team - at home and overseas.\n\nAlong with Premier Li Keqiang the pair have been adamant about the need to change China's economic structure to better address the country's new challenges and imbalances inherited from a growth model mostly led by uncontrolled and often unproductive investments.\n\nAhead of the Plenum, President Xi had pledged a \"profound revolution\" raising expectations of how he would go about reforming the economy, the second largest in the world. Before him, former Premier Wen Jiabao also had the ambition to rebalance but reforms were on paper only.\n\nAlongside the plan published Friday, President Xi placed his name on a long document defending his reforms and explaining why China has to embark on a new journey. This is a sign analysts see as positive for implementation as the leaders' next challenge will be resistance from SOEs and local government which won't easily give up their privileges and abundant wealth.\n\nBut the document entitled \"Decisions of the Central Committee on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms\" leaves little if no room for political change or questions the one-party rule. On the contrary, it reinforces the role of the Communist Party on the country and Xi Jinping as its leader.\n\nPart of the reform plan is the creation of an agency reporting directly to the president. And the document also clarifies that the national-security committee, announced on Tuesday, will largely focus on domestic issues, adding that a mechanism is needed so that \"contradictions can be defused\" referring to mounting signs of outspoken protest on the Internet and in the streets. President Xi's regime has intensified control on a much bigger scale than his predecessor, making dissenting voices all the harder to be heard.\n\nMany analysts question whether China can truly reform without the omniscient Party agreeing to let go of some power and granting citizens a bigger role in how they choose their leaders.\n\n\"Xi Jinping has really positioned himself as a political conservative and economic reformist,\" said one senior diplomat who has met with him several times.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

A face scanner may check your age and gender while sensors pick up your body heat to help locate popular parts of the store.\n\nConsumers have become used to players such as Amazon closely following their shopping habits online, triggering targeted product recommendations, advertising and offers. To counter the online threat, bricks and mortar retailers are playing catch-up, using increasingly sophisticated technology to improve staffing, layout and marketing.\n\nSome people are less comfortable being watched in the offline world, prompting many in the business to promise to use only anonymised and aggregated data unless shoppers explicitly give their permission to be tracked.\n\nBut as retailers get more sophisticated and link the data they collect to loyalty card schemes, shoppers are starting to sign up to schemes that follow their movements in return for targeted discounts and apps that help them find products.\n\nGerman fashion house Hugo Boss is using heat sensors to help place premium products. Luxury chocolate store Godiva has installed meters to count shoppers so it can match staffing to peak hours and measure the draw of window displays.\n\n\"Our customers are trying to run their stores or malls more efficiently,\" said Bill McCarthy, Europe and Middle East head of ShopperTrak, the US firm behind the Godiva counters. \"They are just trying to get real smart with data in the way the e-commerce guys are smart with data.\"\n\nThe Chicago-based company says its counters helped Godiva's store in London's Regent Street improve customer service and hone its window displays, boosting transactions by 10 per cent in six weeks.\n\nAs retailers seek ever more information, ShopperTrak has been investing in high-tech video and phone tracking systems to analyse how customers and staff behave inside a store.\n\n\"The information that we collect is strictly anonymous. We make extra efforts to ensure we keep nothing that is potentially personally identifiable,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\nTesco, the world's third biggest retailer, drew criticism from British privacy groups earlier this month with plans to scan the faces of queuing customers to determine their gender and rough age to better target adverts.\n\nThe company, which put the tracking of customer behaviour on a whole new level with its Clubcard loyalty card two decades ago, said it would not record images or store personal data. Its advisers say some other retailers are less responsible.\n\n\"Too much is happening without consumer consent,\" said Simon Hay, chief executive of Dunnhumby, the customer science company owned by Tesco that is behind its loyalty scheme. \"You have to be transparent with data, tell people what you're doing with it and why and give them something in return.\"\n\nThat has long been the philosophy behind loyalty schemes, which are getting ever smarter as retailers link data from more sources. British shoppers now access an average of six loyalty schemes via their mobile devices compared to four in their wallets, a survey by mobile payments firm CloudZync showed.\n\nEven if a customer does not use their smartphone while in a store, retailers can deploy WiFi signals to track their location to within three metres, said Darren Vengroff, chief scientist at US data company RichRelevance. \"Every retailer wants to better understand their customer,\" said Mr Vengroff, previously the principal engineer at Amazon who helps clients such as Wal-Mart, Sears and Marks and Spencer provide more targeted offers to shoppers. \"The challenge is to make it really personal and not just a bunch of technology like 'Big Brother' watching you.\"\n\nLast month, a group of US companies specialising in location data for retailers agreed to a privacy code of conduct which includes signs posted in store to alert shoppers to the use of tracking technology and instructions for how to opt out.\n\nTelecoms group Telefonica dropped plans last year to sell location data it collects from its mobile phone customers to German retailers due to a backlash over privacy concerns. But it proceeded elsewhere, saying it gains insights only from aggregated data and does not sell personal information.\n\nTelefonica helped Britain's No 4 grocer Wm Morrison hone its marketing by using phone data to analyse how far potential shoppers would be prepared to travel to a store. That allowed it to target coupons to more households, driving a 150 per cent increase in new or reactivated customers.\n\nMany consumers are already shrugging off privacy concerns and embracing tracking technology: European retail consultancy Jupiter has seen a 90 per cent opt-in rate for a platform which offers marketing and mobile payments on smartphones.\n\n\"Messages are less and less likely to be annoying because they will become more and more targeted as you interact,\" said Robin Bevan, Javelin director of location and analytics. \"The system is self-learning: it tests the response rate to ensure that people don't get messages that aren't relevant.\"\n\nThe software is proving popular even in Germany, where data privacy is tightly controlled. Lufthansa has integrated it into its \"Miles & More\" loyalty app, signing up more than 400,000 users since its launch in 2010.\n\nOn Valentine's Day, the airline offered male app users aged 20-50 in Frankfurt airport a 20 per cent discount at jeweller Swarowski. It was redeemed by 30 per cent of those targeted, a much higher redemption rate than for normal promotions.\n\nSian Rowlands, an analyst at consultancy Juniper, sees the trend towards such promotions helping triple global spending on mobile advertising to US$39 billion in 2018 from US$13 billion now. \"At the moment, mobile users frequently see irrelevant adverts which are infringing on their mobile experience. Being able to target a user while they are out shopping versus at home has a greater impact.\"\n\nThe ability to track customers on their smartphones in the vicinity of a store should help \"bricks and mortar\" retailers fend off the online threat in other ways too, says Dan Wagner, head of e-commerce and mobile payment firm Powa Technologies. \"Geolocation is what is going to transform the leverage that a physical retailer has versus an online retailer. If I transmit my location to the retailer, they could say I have a store 300 metres away. You could drop by in half an hour and I'll have your goods for you. Amazon can't do that.\" Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

But a lot of people are now beginning to bet on London.\n\nOn Oct 29, the British government created a stir that reverberated across the financial capitals of the Islamic world. On that day, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the UK Treasury would soon issue a \u00a3200 million (S$401 million) \"sukuk\" or Islamic bond. This will be the first sovereign sukuk issued by a Western country (a sukuk differs from a traditional bond in that it pays no interest; investors get a share of profits from an underlying syariah-compliant asset).\n\nMoreover, the UK sovereign sukuk could serve as a global benchmark for Islamic bonds, which at the moment have none.\n\nMr Cameron was speaking at the 9th World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) in London at the end of October - the first time this annual convention - known as \"the Davos of the Islamic world\" - has ever been held in a non-Islamic nation. He was expansive about his country's ambitions in the realm of syariah-compliant finance.\n\n\"London is already the biggest centre for Islamic finance outside the Islamic world,\" he said. \"I want London to stand alongside Dubai and Kuala Lumpur as one of the greatest capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world.\"\n\nThere's a lot to play for. According to a report by PwC, Islamic finance assets (including banking assets) total US$1.6 trillion globally. Between 2008 and 2012, they grew at close to 20 per cent per year and, by 2020, the market is expected to cross US$6 trillion. While Islamic finance assets are barely one per cent of all global financial assets, the number of players is also small.\n\nNearly all of the Western world does not participate in this market - London being the significant exception. Nine countries hold about 90 per cent of Islamic finance assets and just three (Iran, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia) account for more than 50 per cent.\n\nMoreover, in certain areas of Islamic finance, demand exceeds supply - and this is particularly true of bonds. Sukuks outstanding at the end of 2012 totalled US$240 billion, with Malaysia being the biggest issuer, followed by Saudi Arabia.\n\nLast year, Ernst & Young forecast that sukuk demand is likely to jump to US$900 billion by 2017, partly driven by rising risk aversion following the global financial crisis. Sukuks are popular because they are backed by real assets or real projects. Significantly, they are also favoured by investors from the non-Islamic world.\n\nAt the WIEF, Musaffar Hisham, CEO of Maybank Group Islamic Banking, pointed out that about half of the group's customers for Islamic products in Malaysia are non-Muslim. In Singapore, the figure is around 70 per cent.\n\nThe wider world's interest in Islamic finance products also derives from the growing interest in \"ethical finance\". During a session on Internationalising Islamic Finance at the WIEF, Hasan Al Jabri, CEO of Sedco Capital, an asset manager in Saudi Arabia, said: \"Syariah-compliant finance intersects 90 per cent with ethical finance, which is a US$6 trillion market.\"\n\nHe added that common features include investments in sustainable development and avoiding investments in companies associated with gambling, alcohol, tobacco and weapons. A growing number of pension funds - such as Calpers, the California public employees retirement system, the biggest in the United States - and several foundations have strict guidelines mandating that they invest ethically. Many have Islamic finance products in their portfolio.\n\nHowever, even its promoters and practitioners acknowledge that Islamic Finance has some way to go before it becomes truly mainstream. Sajid Javid, a British MP and Financial Secretary to the UK Treasury, who is one of the key personalities driving the development of Islamic finance in Britain pointed out: \"Islamic scholars don't always agree on what constitutes Islamic finance; they come from different schools of thought.\"\n\nAmr Al Menhali, head of Islamic Banking at the Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank in the UAE called for more simplicity in Islamic finance, including in the use of terminology.\n\nMaybank's Mr Hisham called for clearer global regulation to ensure more uniformity of syariah-compliant products.\n\nBut the UK is undeterred by these obstacles. It is pulling out all the stops to promote itself as the centre for Islamic finance. It has set up an Islamic Finance Task Force. Its infrastructure is already relatively advanced: more Islamic products are listed on London exchanges than anywhere else. London has 25 law firms that provide services in Islamic finance and more syariah-compliant banks than anywhere in the Western world. And 16 British universities offer courses in Islamic finance.\n\nEven London's mayor Boris Johnson (who spoke at the WIEF) is on board.\n\nThe mayor's office co-finances a corporation called London & Partners, which is the official promotional organisation for London, including for business, tourism, education, and conventions. Its director for International Business, David Slater told BT that London has seen what Islamic finance can do and likes what it sees.\n\nOn the proposed British sovereign sukuk, he said: \"Investors are demanding more Islamic finance products, so it's about following the market, responding to what the market wants.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More broadly, it's a way of feeling the pulse of what's happening globally. Because Singapore is a key export base and hub, it gives us a sense of what's happening to the world's biggest economies.\n\n\"It also tends to correlate well with some of the services components in Singapore's GDP. Although these are re-exports, and there's not much value added in terms of the production cycle, there is value added in terms of the trade-related services that Singapore provides.\"\n\nWith the wholesale trade and transport and storage segments making up approximately 20 per cent of the Republic's GDP, economists say NORX's cheery showing in October - due to an increase in both electronic and non-electronic NORX - augurs well for Q4 growth numbers.\n\nUOB economist Francis Tan pointed out: \"This is also consistent with the monthly growth rates in the sea-cargo handled statistics provided by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, where it showed a 3.2 per cent year-on-year growth year-to-date.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Barclays economist Joey Chew highlighted the \"diverging fortunes\" of Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) and NORX, which in part reflects the rising services output from the manufacturing sectors, due to structural changes in the economy.\n\nSaid Ms Chew: \"NORX rose 26.7 per cent year-on-year and (10.3 per cent on a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis) to a record high; in contrast, NODX remains some 10 per cent lower than its historical high in early 2012. Although NODX and NORX used to trend together, reflecting common global and regional drivers of demand, we think the recent divergence reflects (two things).\n\n\"One, (it shows) Singapore's growth underperformance relative to global and regional trends due to domestic drags from restructuring; and two, (it reflects) Singapore's increasing ties with the regional economies via services, rather than traditional manufacturing supply chains,\" said Ms Chew.\n\nShe added that while some types of mass production may no longer be economically viable in Singapore, the provision of supply chain logistics solutions and port services continues to be relevant.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's very clear that there has been a turnaround. The worst is over,\" states CEO Patrick Chew unequivocally in an interview with The Business Times last Friday, a day after the company - which makes aluminium parts for trains - reported that it swung to a net profit of 16.4 million yuan (S$3.4 million) from a net loss of 6.1 million yuan a year ago.\n\n\"The last few quarters of negative cash flow have now turned positive. The environment is clearly improving, and when the tender for high-speed trains was announced in August, we got it very fast, by October.\n\n\"Gross profit margins, that have come down to 21 per cent, should be at a floor and will creep back as we shift our product mix back to more transport.\"\n\nThe lucrative high-margin contracts for making aluminium bodies for high-speed train cars might be starting to roll in again, two years after the deadly 2011 Wenzhou high-speed train crash threw the train industry into a slump and along with it, Midas's fortunes. Compared to 2011, Midas's 2012 revenues fell by a fifth to 870 million yuan, while net profit had dived 85 per cent to 28 million yuan.\n\nBut even as its China order book is perking up, Midas is looking beyond grubbing from the same pot of gold.\n\nIt is expanding its core business of making aluminium components for train cars beyond China into Europe, and even won a contract to make Singapore MRT car bodies earlier this year. It is innovating by prefabricating ready-made parts for companies instead of just supplying the aluminium profiles for them to shape.\n\nThe company is also collaborating with local universities to do research and development work into new aluminium-related products for use in another industry altogether. Mr Chew, however, declined to divulge further details.\n\nA new plant that manufactures aluminium plates and sheets to supply other transport industries such as automobiles or aviation is also being built and will be ready by 2015.\n\n\"In those days, from 2007 to 2009, everything was booming. It was only in 2011 that things started unravelling. We know now that we cannot be too single-sector focused,\" Mr Chew says.\n\n\"We are diversifying our product offerings, mitigating our risks. Who knows if sometimes things happen again and set you back by another two years.\"\n\nFor its third quarter results ended Sept 30, Midas also reported that revenue increased by 48.5 per cent from 203 million yuan a year ago to 301 million yuan. In a report last Thursday, CIMB Research also noted, in a report, the improvement of some financial metrics.\n\nDays of sales outstanding - a measure of how long a company takes to collect revenue after a sale is made, the lower the better - have come down from a peak of almost 500 days in the first quarter of the year to just under 400 days in the third quarter.\n\nDays of inventory outstanding, or how long a company holds its finished goods before selling it - again, the lower the better - have come down from over 350 days in the first quarter to just over 200 days in the third quarter.\n\nWhile Midas has announced a stream of contract wins in the past year for slower metro train cars, the moment the market was waiting for came on Oct 21, when the company announced it had won high-speed train contracts worth 167.5 million yuan by subsidiaries of state-owned enterprise China CNR Corporation, which manufactures trains for the domestic market.\n\nThe contract was a harbinger of what could come. Midas shares, which had been trading at around 45 cents, shot up to around 50 cents. Maybank Kim Eng Research had said in September that it estimates Midas to snag around 1 billion yuan of contract wins each year in 2014 and 2015 in the high-speed sector alone.\n\n\"Now there's a second round of tenders for (more) train sets than the first round. We expect the results to be known before mid-December,\" Mr Chew says. \"We have a very good relationship with all the major train makers as we have been supplying them since 2002 or 2003, and participated in most of their projects in China.\" The two main state-owned enterprises that make trains are China CNR and China CSR, and Midas gets contracts from their subsidiaries.\n\nThe Chinese central government is committed to driving a recovery in railway infrastructure spending, Mr Chew notes. The China Railway Corporation, China's national railway operator, had announced raising its annual investments in fixed assets to 660 billion yuan in 2013.\n\nMidas's slice of the pie goes something like this. Out of the total amount of committed infrastructure spending, 20 per cent is on train equipment. The niche area of aluminium parts Midas makes accounts for 2 to 3 per cent of that. And in China, Mr Chew estimates that Midas has a 60 per cent market share of the train aluminium profiles business. \"We were a very early player, the second company in China that started manufacturing all this in 2002. We built our market share over the years,\" he says.\n\nOn competition, he says: \"The number of industry players have since grown to around 12, versus five when we first started. But only five or six now have the track record and quality to supply train companies.\"\n\nBorn in 1962 to a fisherman father and housewife mother, Mr Chew was the second youngest sibling in a large family of 10. He left school after his A Levels in 1980 and was involved in various businesses, including prawn farming, shipping and a timber business in China.\n\n\"I may not have excelled academically, but I have an urge to do well in life. Coming from a poor background, it's all about hunger. It drives you. You must do something, work for it and lead a better life,\" he says.\n\nIt was during his days in the timber business in China 20 years ago that he noticed how vital transportation is - when he had difficulty getting the timber cargo out of forested areas.\n\nHe set up Midas in 2000 with a partner, and the company was listed in Singapore in 2004.\n\nSays Mr Chew: \"When we stumbled upon this (aluminium) business, we saw the potential for China. Rail is still the most economical form of transport. Aluminium is three times lighter than steel, which was used for trains then ... as a businessman, you have to see the trend.\"\n\n\"There are always risks associated with the material aluminium,\" he continues. \"But in the near future, even if (China) does away with aluminium, we can still use our capacity for other industries and go into lower margin products.\n\n\"For now, we will make as much as possible, and strike while the iron is hot.\"\n\nThis column is an expanded version of CEO Speaks, where views are curated from a wider range of corporate leaders to better capture all that's going on in the business world\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For instance, firms can now shorten bandwidth provisioning time to minutes, compared to 15-20 days required by conventional network approaches.\n\nUsers can also order network capacity by the hour instead of being locked into a contract for a particular quality of connection for a year.\n\nPacnet believes that this network-as-a-service offering which allows commercial usage by the hour is the first to be available in the region.\n\n\"Today, rigid commercial network practices remain one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to tapping the full benefits of cloud computing,\" said Jim Fagan, Pacnet's president of managed services. \"You can turn up 1,000 servers on a cloud provider's platform in minutes, but connecting those servers in a reliable, secure and scalable fashion on an enterprise-class platform could still take months.\n\n\"Probably the most disruptive attribute of cloud computing is that you can turn off those 1,000 servers as quickly as you've turned them on. On the network side you can't just give the connection back - you are either stuck paying for the network connection in a prolonged contract, or have to pay a hefty early termination fine,\" he added.\n\nIt is not just the online flash sales portals and content providers which require support for temporary or seasonal spikes in traffic that will find such a service useful.\n\nIn terms of disaster recovery, companies no longer have to be weighed down by heavy network costs since they can go for bandwidth on demand.\n\nAlso, users can now segregate traffic flows for different applications and determine different levels of the quality of service accordingly. So low-latency connections can be sourced for critical applications, and best-effort delivery opted for non-critical applications to minimise costs.\n\nUsing PEN has given one of Pacnet's customers a whole new level of diagnostics too, as the separate traffic flows allow it to monitor and fine-tune each application as needed, said Mr Fagan.\n\nThis network is enabled by software-defined networking (SDN), where control of the network is de-coupled from the physical hardware and instead managed by a software controller. With this software layer, network administrators can better manage the network and its performance without having to physically access network devices, thus gaining flexibility and efficiency.\n\nCurrently available in 10 of Pacnet's data centres in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney and Melbourne, PEN will be officially launched next February.\n\nDepending on customer demand, Pacnet may expand this offering throughout its global network of data centres, said Mr Fagan.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, it operates 18 data centres that are all interconnected by its high-speed network.\n\nPEN offers customers access to major multiple or large carriers and data centres through the Pacnet network, and creates a virtualised cross-connected environment. This means that customers can provision a network from Pacnet's Singapore data centre to their on-premise facilities in Australia, said Mr Fagan.\n\nSince undergoing a business revamp last year that saw it shed its residential Internet service and wholesale voice businesses, Pacnet has put a lot of focus into building up its managed services arm. It is investing US$100 million annually in upgrading and expanding its data centre footprint this year and next.\n\nEarlier this year, it expanded its facilities in Singapore and Sydney as well as launched a new one in Chongqing, China. Another facility is expected to be completed in Tianjin next year. These will not only support its new initiative but also meet the growing need for data centre services in the region.\n\nWith PEN, Pacnet hopes to accelerate its data centre business growth. The company's data centre business currently contributes to less than 20 per cent of its total revenue, and it aims to raise this to 50 per cent in the next three to five years, said Mr Fagan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/samsung-android-extend-domination-smartphones", "site_title": "Samsung, Android extend domination in smartphones", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSamsung, Android extend domination in smartphones\n\nPrice a key factor in popularity of Android OS\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGOOGLE'S Android smartphone operating system (OS) continued its domination in the global smartphones market with an 81 per cent share in the third quarter of 2013. Apple's iOS operating system came in a distant second with a 12.9 per cent market share, according to results released by IDC.\n\nDespite the high base effect, the Android OS has increased its market share from the 74.9 per cent in the year-ago quarter. In total, 211.6 million devices running on the Android OS were sold in the third quarter of this year, up 51.3 per cent from the year-ago period figure of 139.9 million, the IDC study shows.\n\nApple also saw an increase in device sales with an increase of 25.6 per cent year on year from 26.9 million to 33.8 million during the third quarter. In an apparent indication that Microsoft may have got its mobile device strategy in order with its latest mobile OS, Windows devices saw an impressive 156 per cent increase in sales to 9.5 million units from the 3.7 million sold last year during the quarter. Not surprisingly, BlackBerry was a big loser with its share going down 41.6 per cent to 4.5 million units from the 7.7 million it sold in the third quarter of last year.\n\n\"Android and Windows Phone continued to make significant strides in the third quarter. Despite their differences in market share, they both have one important factor behind their success: price,\" said Ramon Llamas, research manager with IDC's mobile phone team. \"Both platforms have a selection of devices available at prices low enough to be affordable to the mass market, and it is the mass market that is driving the entire market forward.\"\n\nSmartphone average selling prices (ASPs) have continued to decline as the appetite for more affordable devices grows, according to IDC. ASPs were down 12.5 per cent in the third quarter, accounting for an average price of US$317. At the same time, the market has seen a large influx of large-screen smartphones (5-7 inch screens), also known as phablets.\n\nThese generally come with a higher selling price than smaller screen devices, due to the need for more powerful and expensive components. Phablet ASPs in the third quarter were notably higher than the market average at US$443. However, the third quarter ASP was down 22.8 per cent from US$573 in the third quarter.\n\nIn its research report on the mobile phone market, Gartner said worldwide mobile phone sales to end users totalled 455.6 million units in the third quarter, an increase of 5.7 per cent from the same period last year. Sales of smartphones accounted for 55 per cent of overall mobile phone sales during the quarter and reached their highest share to date.\n\nWorldwide smartphone sales reached 250.2 million units, up 45.8 per cent from the third quarter of 2012, it said. (IDC puts this estimate at 261.1 million, up 39.9 per cent). Asia Pacific led the growth in both markets - the smartphone segment with 77.3 per cent increase and the mobile phone segment with 11.9 per cent growth. The other regions to show a rise in the overall mobile phone market were Western Europe, which returned to growth for the first time this year, and the Americas.\n\nAmong the device makers, Samsung sold 80.3 million units in the third quarter with a 32.1 per cent market share, compared to 30.3 million units sold by Apple for a 12.1 per cent market share. While Samsung's share of the growing market remains the same as it was a year ago, Apple's share declined to 12.1 per cent from 14.3 per cent in the third quarter of 2012. In terms of number of units shipped, Samsung and Apple were the top two, followed by Lenovo, with 5.1 per cent market share and LG Electronics with a 4.8 per cent share.\n\nIn overall mobile phone sales, Samsung again came on top with 117 million units sold with a market share of 25.7 per cent. Nokia, with its strong line-up of feature phones, came in second with 63 million phones, taking a 13.8 per cent market share. Despite only selling high-end smartphone, Apple came in third with a 6.7 per cent market share.\n\nWhile Samsung has started to address its user experience, better design is another area where Samsung needs to focus, said Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner. \"Samsung's recent joint venture with carbon fibre company SGL Group could bring improvements in this area in future products,\" he added.\n\nTalking about Apple, he said Gartner believes the price difference between the iPhone 5c and 5s is not enough in mature markets, where prices are skewed by operator subsidies, to drive users away from the top of the line model (5s). In emerging markets, the iPhone 4S will continue to be the volume driver at the low end as the lack of subsidy in most markets leaves the iPhone 5c too highly priced to help drive further penetration.\n\n\"Sales of feature phones continued to decline and the decrease was more pronounced in markets where the ASP for feature phones was much closer to the ASP affordable smartphones,\" Mr Gupta added. \"In markets such as China and Latin America, demand for feature phones fell significantly as users rushed to replace their old models with smartphones.\"\n\nGartner analysts said global mobile phone sales are on pace to reach 1.81 billion units in 2013, a 3.4 per cent increase from 2012. \"We will see several new tablets enter the market for the holiday season, and we expect consumers in mature markets will favour the purchase of smaller-sized tablets over the replacement of their older smartphones\" said Mr Gupta.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

If that were not enough for the stock bulls, Ms Yellen dismissed the notion that the run-up in stocks constituted a bubble.\n\nEven as Ms Yellen insisted that the Fed had nothing to do with the stock market, her testimony echoed statements from central banks and governments worldwide. All share the sense that the only way out of a five-year stagnation of growth is to stimulate private investment by keeping interest rates at record lows.\n\nLast week, a top official at the European Central Bank said that the central bank would keep every option on the table to fight the onset of deflation. A high-ranking Japanese official said that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government would intervene in currency markets if necessary to prevent yen appreciation from hurting the export-oriented economy.\n\nThe power of central banks to drive up stock prices is evident when you consider that the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the week within 40 points of 16,000 - more than twice its 2009 low and up nearly 25 per cent for the year to date - even as jobs, industrial-production and earnings data broadly disappointed last week.\n\n\"In the broad Standard & Poor's 500, there have been 83 negative (earnings) pre-announcements issued by corporations for the fourth quarter compared to nine positive (earnings) pre-announcements,\" said analysts at Thomson Reuters, in a research note.\n\n\"By dividing 83 by nine, one arrives at a Negative/Positive ratio of 9.2 for the S&P 500 Index. If this persists, it will be the most negative N/P ratio on record.\"\n\nEffectively, investors have decided to hold their noses and buy stocks. After all, the economic and corporate outlook simply does not justify the recent torrid stock gains. As illustrated by the Thomson Reuters data, the outlook for corporate profits has, if anything, worsened.\n\nAnd economic data is, at best, ambiguous, and, to some prognosticators, ominous. Europe and the US are dangerously close to the position Japan found itself in after its financial crisis in the early 1990s. Japan's recovery was similarly slow. After several years waiting for wages to increase, many Japanese people settled for part-time work. Consumer spending declined, and the economy atrophied for a decade.\n\nIn the eurozone last month, consumer prices rose just 0.7 per cent from a month earlier, and were down 1.1 per cent from a year earlier. Screening out the effects of volatile energy prices, many European countries have seen consumer prices decline recently.\n\n\"I think deflation is a much bigger concern for central banks around the world including the US,\" than the danger of asset bubbles,\" said Oliver Pursche, president of money manager Gary Goldberg Financial Services.\n\n\"You can argue that we've been in somewhat of a deflationary cycle or certainly in no inflation,\" Mr Pursche said. Petrol and cotton and produce are not costing more today than they did a year ago and that's a plus. (But), we've had no real wage growth in Europe, Asia or the US in quite some time. That's what central banks are worried about . . . they're worried that people's purchasing power is in fact declining.\"\n\nIn the US, wages are stagnant largely because there are very few new jobs available. As long as people feel it's difficult to find another job, employers do not have to boost salaries to hang onto workers. Mr Pursche estimates this will remain the case for another five years.\n\nLast week, October industrial data reflected a drag from the slowdown in government orders related, and this week's retail sales data could show the effects of furloughed government workers.\n\n\"Obviously, the government shutdown had an impact on sales - the question is by how much,\" said Quincy Krosby, investment strategist at Prudential Financial.\n\nStock bulls argue that the fourth quarter will mark the nadir of the current global economic cycle. By this reading, there was a burst of activity between 2009 and 2011, in the immediate aftermath of the recession, as retailers and wholesalers were forced to replenish empty shelves. When the \"restocking\" finished, governments worldwide have cut their spending, causing another dip in demand for steel makers and heavy manufacturers such as Caterpillar ran out of steam in the last couple of years as government spending retrenched. Now, the restocking is supposed to start again, and another couple of lean years will be followed by some fat.\n\n\"US global profits are poised to expand over the near term as global growth rebounds in the developed and developing nations,\" said Joe Quinlan, market strategist at Bank of America Private Wealth Management.\n\nLong-term, the bull market depends on this rebound materialising. But the upward momentum could be enough to keep it going in the short term.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This translates to an effective annual rate of 9.68 per cent.\n\nA three-month loan will have a flat interest rate of 1.75 per cent, or an effective annual rate of 7.12 per cent. And the six-monthly flat rate is 2.5 per cent, or an effective annual rate of 5.13 per cent.\n\nThis compares to interest rates of 20 per cent a year at pawnshops, which target similar clientele.\n\n\"This promotion is aimed at blue-collar workers who might need bridging funds for a short holiday or to buy some things urgently,\" head of marketing services Yet Pek Yeen told The Business Times.\n\nApplicants typically take out a loan for three months amounting to around $10,000, a Hong Leong Finance spokesman added.\n\nThe Express Share Loan promotion has been around since the 1990s, but it does not run every year. This current promotion is running from Nov 15, 2013, to Feb 15, 2014. The loan amount is up to 70 per cent of the market share price or Hong Leong Finance's own cap, whichever is lower.\n\nThe market for short-term finance has been booming in Singapore. The amount of loans given out by pawnshops jumped from $4.9 billion in 2011 to $7.1 billion last year.\n\nThree pawnshops have listed on the Singapore Exchange since 2012 - Maxi-Cash, MoneyMax and ValueMax.\n\nHong Leong Finance closed unchanged at $2.69 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is a far cry from the company's previous office, which was bigger, but had the typical cubicle-and-partitioned wall combination.\n\nWarner Music Singapore's general manager Simon Nasser says, \"the office now has a more homely feel\".\n\nHe would know. Mr Nasser worked with interior design firm Forward 50 on the new look, without revealing anything to his staff in Singapore or to his superiors in Hong Kong. \"Everyone had a pleasant surprise when we moved in four months ago,\" says Mr Nasser. The office has a chic industrial look - think cement and brick walls, mixed with steel and wood. \"I was confident that people would like it, since this is similar to my home. And they all love coming over to my place,\" quips Mr Nasser.\n\nThe office was also shortlisted this year for the Herman Miller Most Liveable Office Award.\n\nForward 50 director Christopher Kwek had a clear idea of how he wanted the office to be. \"Since this is the office for a music company, it would have been easy to put music symbols around the space. But that is so cliched and overdone,\" he says.\n\nInstead, he focused on using materials to bring life to the space. Cement flooring and walls all around give the office a raw feel. To add interest to the reception area, Mr Kwek created a feature wall out of recycled railway sleepers, that is adjacent to a brick wall. The breakout area by the reception, with its mix of mid-century furniture pieces and a hanging, bespoke TV console that resembles a fireplace, could easily be mistaken for a living room rather than a space for discussions. It also doesn't help that the pantry area, with a bright orange Smeg fridge, is next to it.\n\nThe initial idea was for the office to not have any rooms, but Mr Kwek advised otherwise. \"This was the first time that I had to suggest the need for rooms,\" he says. There are only two here - a glass-enclosed one for Mr Nasser, and the second which is the meeting room.\n\nMr Kwek did away with the typical conference table, and had a table made of African mahogany in its place. \"It is narrower than the usual width, so everyone can get closer in a meeting,\" he says.\n\nMr Nasser chose pieces for his office, such as a stainless steel beaded curtain, which he bought from the now-defunct Ink Bar.\n\nThe remaining staff sit in an open area, with workstations arranged in a boomerang configuration, \"to encourage more mingling\", says Mr Kwek.\n\nWhereas the old office used to have storage for CDs, visitors would be hard-pressed to find a single CD in this office. \"We have gone totally digital,\" says Mr Nasser. Music is now stored in a computer, and every day, each staff member gets to play music from their personal playlist. \"We all have different tastes in music, but so far, we have not had any problems,\" he says.\n\nThe industrial chic look is going so well with the management office in Hong Kong that Mr Nasser's boss wants to recreate this look for its other offices in the Philippines and Malaysia. There will be competition to see who has the best office. Mr Nasser is unfazed. \"I say bring it on.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Observers say demolition responsibility belongs to the shipbuilding countries.\n\nIn Kesennuma - where the 330-ton, 60m long Kyotoku Maru No 18 was washed ashore by tsunami following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake - heavy machines roared as they carried steel plates cut from the fishing vessel. Although plans to preserve the ship as a reminder of the disaster were once discussed, work to dismantle the ship was completed on Oct 28.\n\nDemolition work was contracted to Ship Recycle Muroran, a non-profit organisation based in Muroran, Hokkaido. Steel parts taken from Kyotoku Maru No 18 will become car parts, manholes and other useful items. The ship's screw was also sold. Most of the ship's parts have been recycled.\n\nDemolition work was conducted in a way that prevents toxic substances, such as asbestos, from spreading to the environment, and unclean water created during the work was purified before being released into the ocean.\n\nShip Recycle Muroran is also working on improving water jet technology to cut steel plates. The technology can prevent heavy fuel oil and chemical substances in ships from catching fire because pressurised water is used in dismantling ships.\n\nAs of 2012, 94 per cent of the world's ship demolition was carried out by four countries - India, Bangladesh, China and Pakistan - because of low labour costs and strong demand for iron in these nations.\n\nAlthough Japan is a leading shipbuilding and maritime country, which builds 18 per cent of the world's ships and owned 14 per cent of ships in terms of tonnage as of the end of 2012, ship demolition has decreased in this country after peaking in 1985.\n\nExcept for vessels belonging to the Self-Defense Forces and Japan Coast Guard, hardly any ships are scrapped here.\n\nThe move is spreading into other areas in Japan. In April, The Ehime Toyo Shippu Risaikuru Kenkyukai, a ship recycling study group based in Niihama, Ehime Prefecture, completed scrapping the Yotei Maru, a 8,310-ton former ferryboat that plied the Tsugaru Strait between Aomori and Hakodate, Hokkaido, in cooperation with a ship demolition firm in Kagawa Prefecture. The aim of the project was to improve ship-scrapping techniques. Study groups were launched in other areas, including Nakatsu, Oita Prefecture.\n\nThe main problem is the cost for dismantling ships. In scrapping Kesennuma's Kyotoku Maru No 18, only 10 people were engaged in the demolition work and the time they were allowed was shortened to six weeks. Even so, they only managed to cover about 50 million yen (S$620,000) out of the total cost for scrapping the ship through insurance taken out by the ship's owner and the sale of iron and other materials from the ship. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Simple APs commonly found in these set-ups lack reliability and robust performance, which then makes the simple task of loading a Web page or downloading documents a time-consuming chore for employees, he noted.\n\nOn the other hand, implementing a full-featured Wi-Fi controller to provide the security, management and access policies in these branches would be costly and most of the features unnecessary for such a small setting, Mr Tay added.\n\nThis is the market segment the networking vendor was targeting when it announced its Aruba Central cloud-based management service in October. Within Asia-Pacific, the executive noted the opportunities would likely lie with big retail brands, food and beverage outlets, and the education sector, particularly among pre-school centres.\n\nFor instance, there are 11,000 pre-school centres in Thailand alone, which illustrates the ample market space for Aruba to carve a niche for itself and promote its Wi-Fi management service, he said. The ease of deploying its Instant brand APs, which come pre-configured according to the management and access policies set on Aruba Central, is a key differentiator for the vendor. The other is offering companies' IT teams the ability to monitor and manage the performance of the APs with one log-in process rather than having to log in multiple times for the individual branches, he elaborated.\n\nThe main customers for Aruba Central are from the United States and these are multinational retail companies and coffee-shop chains. Given their global nature, however, some of their satellite branches in Asia would also be equipped with Aruba's Instant APs, Mr Tay said.\n\nHe added that in Asia-Pacific itself, there would be a big launch event in Macau during the coming week to showcase the product and educate the wider business audience about its potential benefits.\n\nAsked what kind of market value Aruba sees in this part of the region, he said \"it is going to be big\". He added: \"We wouldn't have spent so much time and engineering resources to build Aruba Central from the ground up if we did not think there is a big opportunity going forward.\"\n\nAccording to Dell'Oro Group, the annual Wi-Fi market is valued at US$4 billion and the cloud Wi-Fi segment constitutes about 5 per cent. However, Mr Tay believes this will grow to 35 per cent going forward. As for market competition, particularly from Cisco Systems and its Meraki brand cloud Wi-Fi tools, Aruba is in a good position because of the \"seamless integration\" between its APs and the central management platform, he said.\n\nThis is because while Meraki is aimed at small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) because of its \"cheap and simple\" AP devices, it remains incompatible with Cisco's other Wi-Fi management platform Aironet, which provides control over a wider, campus-level WAN (wide area network).\n\nSo in the case of a fast-expanding SME, for example, they would have to replace their Meraki APs to Aironet-based ones as they scale up. Even if they do not, the organisation would face roaming management challenges given that different branches are on different APs, he stated.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We will do this by engaging the country (and help in its reconstruction).\"\n\nIt's a more useful and tried stand that goes well with Singapore's belief not to meddle in the domestic affairs of others, he said. \"We hope that this would promote the recovery and reconciliation,\" said Mr Lee, who is now back in Singapore. \"But really, you cannot impose reconciliation from the outside, nor is it our business to intervene in other country's affairs.\"\n\nAsean, of which Singapore is a member, seems to have succeeded in persuading Myanmar to introduce democracy and open the country to investors with constructive engagement. And Singapore companies are among those rushing in to do business.\n\nWill Singapore back Singapore companies to invest in Sri Lanka as well? Mr Lee said the government will encourage them to invest in \"the region\" but won't tell them where exactly to put their money. \"Whether they come to Sri Lanka or (go) elsewhere, it's up to them. It's their decision.\"\n\nInvestment is different from constructive engagement, he said. \"It's a matter of security environment, business environment, political outlook and basically a decision of the company - whether the timing is right, favourable for investments, what opportunities are here, elsewhere, whether they want to put their money and bet and go for it.\"\n\nSri Lanka has a population of 20 million and an estimated per capita income of US$3,200 in 2012. The economy has expanded by up to 8.2 per cent yearly since the end of the civil war in 2009. Tourism is a main sector of the economy and a record one million tourists visited the country last year. The other key sectors are tea, agriculture and apparel and textile.\n\nWith the country now stable and at peace, the Sri Lankan government has set ambitious targets to develop economic hubs in ports, aviation, commerce, knowledge and energy.\n\nA United States Department of State report says that apart from tourism and ports, there's also ample scope for foreign investments in information technology, business processing, franchising, retail and services as well as light manufacturing.\n\nBut it cautions that doing business in Sri Lanka can also be challenging, with \"high transaction costs related to an unpredictable economic policy environment\".\n\nMr Lee noted that there are Singapore companies in Sri Lanka - and some have been there for many years. \"Some are doing OK, some have various issues which they are sorting out,\" he said. \"It's a situation which is developing, the government is working very hard to bring in investments and develop the confidence and momentum. I am sure our businesses are watching it closely.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The office tower has been fully leased, and the mall is over 90 per cent leased. RevPar and occupancy rates for the hotels were not disclosed, but Mr Teo said occupancies were \"steady\".\n\nHiap Hoe has plans to replicate the integrated development concept overseas, having acquired three sites in Melbourne, Australia, in the past few months. There are opportunities for hotels at all three plots.\n\n\"As you are aware, the Singapore market is now getting very tough, margins (have) become very thin,\" Mr Teo said, explaining the expansion overseas.\n\nThe company is also looking at areas such as London, and for opportunities in the United States and New Zealand, he said.\n\nBut that does not mean that it is giving up on the Singapore market.\n\nAssuming the price is right, Mr Teo said that \"we will still continue in Singapore and develop more properties, depending on the timing and what kind of opportunities we have here\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's not the fanciest of locations with its mish-mash of learning centres, supermarket and mid to low-end eateries.\n\nBut, at least, Home is on the slightly better end with an Italian deli and bakery as neighbours, although it still sits a little conspicuously with its posher decor that hints at Chef Tan's fine-dining chops.\n\nSo while you do get city restaurant quality, it's at pretty wallet-friendly prices. Where else can you get half a Peking duck for $38 - perfect for smaller groups who want variety instead of being force-fed a whole bird with little stomach room for much else?\n\nChef Tan's lychee wood-smoked duck yields scant slivers of paper-thin skin that you dip in pink sugar, followed by a larger portion of sliced meat and skin to be savoured the traditional way with steamed, almost chewy pancakes.\n\nYou need to eat the meat really fast because the chef deliberately drains the fat so the duck is leaner - and thus gets dry and chewy within minutes of cooling. The duck course doesn't end there, though. For an extra $10, you'll get the remaining meaty bones in your choice of soup or stir-fried in ginger and green onion.\n\nWhile the duck is adequate - the chef's roasting skills come into force with his crisp crackling roast pork belly ($16) - equal layers of juicy meat and decadent fat topped with a thin layer of crunchy skin without any excess salt. The char siew is good too - juicy slabs of pork loin ($14) which have the bounce and bite of pork collar. Makes you wish he could serve dim sum as well, though, but he doesn't.\n\nInstead, he's got heftier tricks up his sleeve such as marble goby ($9 per 100gm) which doesn't get the familiar treatment of being steamed or deep-fried. Instead, the whole fish is cooked in a claypot so you can enjoy the smooth texture of well-steamed fish with the bonus of a fragrant but slightly oily broth scented with Chinese wine, lemongrass and galangal.\n\nHe also makes his own tofu ($18) - eggy and fluffy with bits of prawn and crab roe in an enriched yellow gravy that can be quite heavy-going. Same with the braised vermicelli with braised pork knuckle ($20) - unfortunately bland with few slivers of meat.\n\nThe main grouse about chef Tan's cooking is that while it's generally tasty, the food sits heavily in the stomach.\n\nDon't expect light, delicate flavours or super-refined cuisine. This is rich, robust comfort food for hearty appetites - so if a slap-up meal is the goal, then chef Tan is your new best friend who would like to take you Home with him.\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

When he says \"dance\", they dance. And when he turns around (metaphorically, of course) to the audience and says \"laugh\", there is no way you can resist his command.\n\nSuch is the skill of Japanese director Yukio Ninagawa, who can tug at your heartstrings one moment and have you doubled-over in laughter the next.\n\nIt's no wonder he has been billed as one of the Three Titans of Theatre and tickets to his staging of Hisashi Inoue's Musashi at the Esplanade Theatre last weekend sold out in no time.\n\nThe story kicks off in the year 1612 with a battle between two rival samurais that ends with Musashi Miyamoto (Tatsuya Fujiwara) sparing the life of the younger Kojiro Sasaki (Junpei Mizobata) after the latter's defeat.\n\nSix years later, Musashi is at a retreat at a Buddhist temple when a revenge-seeking Kojiro makes an appearance and challenges him to another duel.\n\nMusashi accepts the challenge and they decide to fight in three days, much to the chagrin of the monk Soho Takuan (Naomasa Musaka).\n\nThe retreat's inhabitants including the monk, his abbot Heishin (Keita Oishi), shogun advisor Munenori Yagyu (Kohtaloh Yoshida), and two female temple patrons Mai Kiya (Kayoko Shiraishi) and Otome Fudeya (Anne Suzuki) launch into various schemes to persuade the two samurais to give up their rivalry.\n\nFor a moment then, it threatened to get monotonous as they deliver parables and sermons along the lines of \"people make the chain (of revenge) so they can also break it\".\n\nBut this was peppered with enough mischief, humour and timely quips like \"listen to old people, they're closer to heaven\" to keep audience entertained.\n\nNoh-enthusiast Munenori also kept stealing the scene with his whimsical, unexpected outbursts into the Japanese musical performing art.\n\nSo much so for the revered image of samurais, which popular culture often portray as masculine and dignified. In the world of Musashi, these proud Japanese warriors are made to look a little goofy too, as when they had to perform a hilarious Hollywood-style training montage.\n\nThere's a breezy, irreverent quality to the storytelling that both parodies the samurai stereotype and pays homage to its sacred traditions.\n\nAs with all Ninagawa productions, the beautiful set design is a thing of constant marvel with trees that seemed to sway and shiver along with the action on stage. Set designer Tsukasa Nakagoshi deserves his own applause.\n\nThe previous fondly-remembered Ninagawa production of Macbeth in 1992 showed the director's unadulterated dramatic side. Musashi showed Ninagawa's playful side as he turns what was potentially a reverent affair into a rollicking ride.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWHEN your family once owned sprawling tea plantations and have the knowledge and capability in manufacturing tea, then reading the tea leaves at the bottom of the tea cup is easy.\n\nThe dregs can only read \"Build a tea brand\" - which is what Singapore's BP de Silva Group's fifth-generation scion Rehan Amarasuriya, 27, was tasked with and set out to do. With the explosion of interest in branded and designer coffees in the last couple of years, he sees Singapore consumers wanting more quality in their teas as well.\n\nBP de Silva Group's 1872 Clipper Tea was launched earlier this year, pitched at a cut above supermarket grades. The brand has been making an impact in boutique settings such as PasarBella and Tangs' recently revamped basement store.\n\n\"The idea of 1872 Clipper Tea is to elevate the tea experience beyond a simple beverage and make it a simple daily luxury since tea is something accessible to everyone. We take the best of each tea-growing region - Ceylon, India and Taiwan,\" he adds.\n\n\"The whole idea is to close the gap between buying tea based on sight and smell - and tasting,\" Rehan says of 1872 Clipper Tea's comprehensive clipper-themed booth, which also offers tea sampling and tea gifts.\n\n\"From what we've noticed, customers want something they can experience while we want to educate them about tea. Consumers should be able to taste the teas they buy, at the retail level,\" he adds.\n\nThe current trend points to flavoured teas as well as herbal, non-caffeinated teas. \"People are beginning to take to infusions. And then there are specialist teas we carry, such as Oolong from Alishan, recommended by a staff member who discovered it while on holiday in Taiwan. The estate sent us their first flush and we've been buying from them ever since,\" says Mr Amarasuriya.\n\nThe label has some 40 different types of tea at the moment, but Mr Amarasuriya envisions a total of 60-70 varieties in the near future.\n\n1872 Clipper Tea is blended and packaged by BP de Silva Group's tea production plant, Tea Tang, in Sri Lanka. Tea Tang Ltd, incorporated in 1979, also packages tea for the Sri Lanka Tea Promotion Board and Sri Lanka's Jetwing hotel chain, while its overseas clients include the Raffles Hotel in Singapore.\n\nThe 1872 Clipper Tea label was started over a year ago; leveraging on its existing expertise. The majority of Tea Tang's products actually head to the Middle East and Russia, which are also Sri Lanka's biggest customers.\n\nThe year 1872 refers to the time the BP de Silva family owned its first tea plantations, which sprawled over 100 acres. In 1970, the government nationalised tea estates so each family was limited to only 50 hectares. The family subsequently sold its plantations, but kept its hold on the tea production business instead.\n\nGlobal leader\n\nBP de Silva is, of course, a household name in Singapore, originally associated with jewellery - a business established in Singapore by entrepreneur Balage Porolis de Silva, who had set sail in the late 1800s from Galle to Singapore. The company has, over 140 years, grown from a small jewellery business on High Street to a diversified conglomerate, focusing on luxury goods and commodities.\n\nRehan, the second child of BP de Silva Group chairman Sunil Amarasuriya works closely with the company's Value Addition division in Colombo which looks after the development of brands.\n\nTea production, by the way, is a lot more complex than tea-bagging a bunch of dried leaves. Over at Tea Tang, there is a whole laboratory, full of canisters and tin boxes of tea leaves, dedicated to the daily tasting of teas and grading.\n\nEvery week, thousands of samples from over 600 estates in Sri Lanka get sent to the factory, and tea tasters sip their way through some 2,000 cups a week. \"We have three master tea-tasters with a combined 100 years of experience in tasting teas,\" explains Mr Amarasuriya.\n\nTea leaves are then blended so that they always fit the taste requirements of clients. \"Customers from the Middle East like their tea strong in flavour and colour. And colour is also important in Hong Kong,\" he explains.\n\nJapanese and British tea-drinkers like theirs with milk, so there tends to be more Dimbulla-originated tea in the blend which is more tannic and bitter. Nuwara Eliya teas, on the other hand, are lighter.\n\nTea Tang does the tasting, cleaning, blending, bagging, packaging and then exporting of Ceylon Tea. In Sri Lanka, Tea Tang is one of the more progressive factories in terms of utilisation of technology.\n\nFurther plans are being made for more modern machines in various parts of the production facility. As part of their business model, the group is constantly on the look-out for the latest technology, in order to be at the forefront and a global leader in tea production .\n\nBP de Silva have moved from its River Valley office to a new building at Leng Kee, where the entire group's business concerns will be located on one floor. The space will allow for a warehousing and even a tea-tasting room, says Mr Amarasuriya. Grander plans for the tea business are a-brewing.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/amazons-workspaces-brings-cloud-enterprise-users", "site_title": "Amazon's WorkSpaces brings the cloud to enterprise users", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nAmazon's WorkSpaces brings the cloud to enterprise users\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 17, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nAMAZON Web Services (AWS) has always been a big player in the bits and bolts deep in the back-end data centre space, but the cloud giant is moving up the value chain and may soon start streaming your PC to you.\n\nAndy Jassy, senior vice-president of AWS took to the stage last week during the company's developer conference in Las Vegas to announce a new service called WorkSpaces.\n\nThe product will see the company supplying virtual desktops to end-user enterprises, run and managed off Amazon's sprawling clouds all over the world. A virtual desktop differs from the regular PC, in that the virtual instance exists on a server elsewhere, not on the PC itself. The user's PC acts as a window through which the desktop image is accessed. This marks quite the radical step in the direction of taking over more of a company's IT resources, because AWS' main play has always been in the infrastructure space.\n\nAWS is the e-commerce giant, infrastructure-as-a-service product, and it owns nine huge data centres globally serving storage and computing resources on tap.\n\nFor some, the virtual desktop service may be reminiscent of Sun Microsystems' grand vision of thin client computing back in the late-1990s. It released the Sun Ray, a workstation that was just a connected display, that relied on a server elsewhere to serve its apps. The aim was to save companies money on expensive, standalone desktops, and instead benefit from a pooled resource, centrally managed.\n\nThis sounds a lot like the cloud, and perhaps the Sun thin client was too early for its time. They couldn't achieve the same kind of performance for high-end needs such as graphics, because of the latency happening over the wires between thin client and central server. HP and Dell still make thin clients, and Dell's marketing material brands them as \"cloud client computing\" devices.\n\nMore recently, Google's been eyeing the thin client market. In 2011, it introduced its Chromebook devices - low-cost laptops that run very minimal Linux-based OSes, designed just to power a browser that will pull apps from Google's Web app family.\n\nBut thin clients have never really taken off because it took added complexity for companies to manage and virtualise desktops from internal servers, when supplying individual laptops and desktops worked fine. Moreover, connectivity needs to be relatively stable in order to ensure an undisrupted experience, so that remains another factor that companies need to beef up.\n\nStill, Amazon thinks it has a one-up over the competition because of its experience in optimising networks for latency issues. It uses more recently developed streaming protocols such as PC-over-IP, which compresses the amount of data needed to be transmitted, and uses variable bit rate (VBR) encoding to overcome choppy performance that can occur during unstable connections.\n\nEssentially, keeping things lean going over network connections is aimed at making the experience better and more reliable for end-users.\n\nFurthermore, it's priced the service very competitively. A basic subscription offering one virtual CPU and 50 Gbs (gigabits) of storage space costs US$35 per user, a month, and 2 virtual CPUs (central processing units) and 100 Gbs of storage is US$60 per user, per month.\n\nThe subscription price takes care of the Windows OS licence cost, and an extra US$15 will give users access to Microsoft Office and anti-virus software, said Mr Jassy. Still, some companies continue to have reservations about abandoning regular workstations for the virtual variety. Brian Chen, CEO and founder of Taipei-based mobile development firm Herxun, said users need to ensure a strong mobile signal to use the desktop on the go, which is reliant on telcos and largely out of companies' control.\n\nAdditionally, many public agencies won't be able to jump on the cloud this way, because sensitive data needs to remain on private servers, he said.\n\n\"From previous experience, the virtual desktop is only suitable for limited situations,\" he said, indicating that the resilience of virtual desktops needs to be more widely proven before mainstream businesses consider it a viable option.\n\nAmazon's keenness to enter the end-user experience is also buoyed by the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend, said Mr Jassy. One interesting feature of WorkSpaces is the ability to transfer the desktop between devices, allowing users to carry their desktops with them. For instance, a user on a desktop will be able to transfer everything they were doing to a tablet device or a phone, and continue work uninterrupted. \"You can use it on your laptop, close it when you leave the office, and switch to your Android or iOS device, and the desktop picks up where you left off,\" he said.\n\nBYOD refers to a growing trend in the enterprise where users are choosing to use their own devices - in particular smartphones and tablets - for work, and requesting access to company data through them.\n\nAccording to Gartner, worldwide smartphone sales hit 250.2 million units in the third quarter of 2013, representing an increase of 45.8 per cent over the same period last year.\n\nSmartphones accounted for 55 per cent of overall phone sales during the quarter, and the Asia-Pacific continued to lead the growth with 77.3 per cent more smartphones sold in the quarter, year-over-year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This sent Asian and other stocks soaring yesterday. Tokyo re-entered \"bull market\" territory as the Nikkei average broke above the 15,000 level.\n\nThe yen's fall against major currencies, including the euro and the Australian dollar, was less expected because the continuation of quantitative monetary easing in the US would normally imply dollar weakness, just as tapering hints had earlier sent the dollar jumping, analysts said.\n\nBut comments on Thursday in the parliament by Finance Minister Taro Aso that the country must retain the means to intervene in foreign exchange markets appear to have convinced markets that Japan is intent on maintaining a yen rate no stronger than 100 to the dollar.\n\nThe yen sank to 100.3 at one point in Tokyo yesterday before recovering slightly. It also sank below 160 to the pound and hit 134.93 against the euro and 93.66 against the Australian dollar.\n\nThe yen could sink as low as 105 to the dollar in the coming months, Deutsche Bank strategist Taisuke Tanaka was quoted as saying, while a trader at a Japanese bank said that \"the yen can only go down now\", adding that Ms Yellen's dovishness will spark a fresh rally in risk assets.\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 Average rose 289.51 points, or 2 per cent to 15,165.92 taking the index up by 7.7 per cent this week alone and by 46 per cent over the year to date.\n\nOther Asian equity markets also moved up sharply. Seoul's Kospi climbed 1.9 per cent and was on track for its largest gain in four months, while Australia added 0.8 per cent and shares in Shanghai surged 2.3 per cent, encouraged by reforms reportedly approved by China's Communist Party at its national congress.\n\n\"Confirmation of Yellen's dovishness, a risk-embracing mood toward equities globally, and considering the amount of idle cash that had been waiting to be invested, this kind of move (is not) a huge surprise,\" SMBC Nikko Securities general manager of equities Hiroichi Nishi said in Tokyo.\n\nFor Japan, the fall in the yen's value is welcome news at a time when exports have been flagging, presenting a threat to the success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Abenomics policies, aimed at boosting economic growth and ending deflation in Japan.\n\nJapanese firms are reluctant to undertake the capital investment needed to meet the targets of Abenomics until they can be sure the yen will not enter a new round of strength. Mr Aso's comments this week were aimed at creating an environment for yen stability at around current rates, analysts said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

After the results were announced, F&N said the company and its treasury \"will consider their options in light of this result and will make an announcement at the appropriate time\".\n\n\"While F&N can, legally speaking, push for default, it's a matter of principle and bondholders seem to want a better price, but the question is what is the fair value (of the bonds),\" he said.\n\nSaid a fund manager: \"If the terms were attractive and fair, most would have voted in favour.\" He warned, however, that \"triggering a default is very dangerous\" as it could cause other outstanding loans to trigger on cross default clauses. \"If they cause a default by going through with the demerger without the waivers, this could be seen as an act of very bad faith. Such actions can adversely impact future debt offerings,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, holders of the $108.25 million 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 and the $200 million 6.0 per cent notes due 2019 voted against the tabled amendments, while voting for the $80 million 3.15 per cent bonds due 2018 was adjourned because of the lack of a quorum.\n\nResolutions for another three bond issues were passed. These were the $220 million 2.48 per cent bonds due 2016, the $150 million 3.62 per cent bonds due 2015, and the $50 million 2.45 per cent bonds due 2015.\n\nF&N had offered to pay 100 cents on the dollar and a fee worth half of the note's coupon and the accrued interest on the date that it can call the securities, its Extraordinary Resolution documents showed.\n\nAccording to earlier reports, the terms offered for F&N's higher coupon bonds were below market value, and some investors in the $108.25 million 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 had reportedly said they intended to vote against the proposal.\n\nF&N needed approval from holders of six series of bonds given that the proposed spin- off would breach some of the bond covenants. The company had also indicated its intention to include in all the bond issues the option to call by June 30, 2014, which means a redemption of all of the outstanding bonds well ahead of maturity.\n\nThe company, controlled by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, had asked holders of $808.3 million of bonds to waive certain default clauses, allowing the company to buy back the securities on or before June 30, 2014, for a fee, according to the Oct 28 announcements.\n\nF&N plans to spin off its property division through a Singapore listing later this year. The conglomerate is seeking to separate that division from its other operations, including its beverages and publishing units, to focus on each unit's individual expansion strategies.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHEY may lack the flash, sex appeal and superstar names synonymous with luxury marques such as Gucci, Vuitton and Prada, but the latest continental labels to land in our malls make up for it in their stealth wealth cachet.\n\nBrioni, an Italian fashion house specialising in made-to-order men's suits and luxurious tailoring, recently unveiled its first standalone boutique at Marina Bay Sands. The company, which has created suits worn by Pierce Brosnan in all his appearances as James Bond, and Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, has long appealed to the more discerning male customer. As Francesco Pesci, chief executive officer of Brioni, explains, the true pedigree of a Brioni suit is determined by how it feels when worn, and not just by its appearance.\n\n\"The Brioni suit is hand-tailored and crafted using traditional Italian tailoring techniques,\" says Mr Pesci, who was in town for the opening of the 1,720 sq ft store in September. \"And just like how there may be many beautiful cars on the street and the difference between a luxury car and a regular one lies in its engine, the way a suit is crafted on the inside changes its performance. The comfort of a Brioni suit is second to none.\"\n\nIn an era when brandishing brand logos or even an \"It\" bag borders on sartorial vulgarity, understated luxury is the ultimate status symbol. And lesser-known European houses are more than happy to satiate the savvy shopper's thirst for low-key style.\n\n\"Like a private members' club, we are recognised by those in the know,\" says Marco Franchini, chief executive officer of Italian leather goods label Valextra. \"We believe that true luxury lies in absolute discretion and exclusivity as symbolised by our signatures such as our Costa black ink (used to hand-lacquer the edges of bags) and the discreet V-cut detail. It takes a knowledgeable eye to identify our products and only a true connoisseur of style would truly appreciate and value our rich heritage, craftsmanship, innovation and uniqueness.\"\n\nThe 75-year-old house has just opened its 800 sq ft boutique in Paragon, which embodies minimalist chic, from its slate-thin shelves to logo-free products. And the brand's focus on understated classics have found a following among very well-known fans, including Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston, David Beckham and Michelle Obama. And while the Singapore outpost for Brioni is the first in the world to feature the brand's new store concept, it is more about sleek architecture than the ostentatious glamour associated with Italian fashion.\n\nUnderstated elegance\n\nThis recently launched blueprint melds the masculine aesthetics of an old-world gentleman's club with the elegance of a private dressing room. Indeed, one almost expects a coat-tail-wearing valet to stride across the boutique's Navona travertine floors and help a client into a jacket.\n\n\"We don't want to do things that have been done by other brands,\" says Mr Pesci. \"We want to convey luxury in a discreet way and to stand out through the use of details and raw materials. It's tough work trying to communicate elegance without showing off.\"\n\nAnd rather than set up a branch here right away, David Mason, creative director of Savile Row tailoring house Anthony Sinclair, has gone even more insider - flying over to discuss the creation of a bespoke fragrance with a niche perfume house, and offering private fittings to clients upon request.\n\nHowever, the demand for bespoke tailoring in Asia has prompted Mr Mason to view potential sites for a permanent retail outlet while he was in town. \"Asia has suddenly become our fastest-growing market,\" says Mr Mason. \"Consumers here are style-savvy and sophisticated, and Singaporean men are no exception. They want the best products available, and when it comes to tailoring, they know that Britain's history and reputation is unrivalled.\"\n\nFamed for being the tailor to Sean Connery in the James Bond movies directed by Terence Young, Anthony Sinclair certainly boasts the superstar connection required of any luxury label of repute. But he's best known for an understatedly flattering cut: The Conduit, which creates a subtle hour-glass silhouette with a firm shoulder, slightly flared skirt and suppressed waist.\n\nA bespoke, hand-tailored suit takes 50 hours of hand-tailoring over the course of several weeks, and involves a series of fittings, \"each taking the garment through successive stages of production, allowing the client to witness the true bespoke experience of having his clothes built around him,\" adds Mr Mason.\n\nBespoke tailoring also lies at the heart of Brioni, which has been owned by French luxury apparel holding company Kering since 2011. \"Brioni was established as a tailoring shop and the made-to-measure business is in our DNA,\" says Mr Pesci. \"We're the first to introduce a silk lining, the first to introduce colour into formal menswear, the first to hold a men's fashion show in 1952, when it was almost sacrilegious for men to be seen on the catwalk.\"\n\nThe go-to atelier for the likes of Donald Trump and Nelson Mandela employs over 1,000 staff in its Italian manufacturing facility, and it takes from 18 to as many as 48 hours to complete a suit. A rigorous apprenticeship programme helps safeguard the craftsmanship so integral to the brand's ethos.\n\n\"A tailor doesn't just excel in the technicalities of crafting a suit, he should be able to look at a customer and, apart from providing the perfect fit, analyse the way he walks, his posture and the colour of his hair and eyes, to ensure a suit that is flattering in every respect,\" adds Mr Pesci.\n\nStrategic alliances\n\nLikewise, the clean lines of each Valextra creation bears delicate details produced in Italy by a team of 60 craftsmen, who create quiet embellishments like the special hand-lacquered piping, soft, light-coloured leather lining and hardware accents used for its accessories.\n\nAnd our small but discerning shopper demographic offers plenty of potential for brands that eschew showy luxury. The family-owned company has its eye on going public in the long term, and will be opening five freestanding shops in the world's fashion capitals in the next two years, following its partnership with home-grown retail group FJ Benjamin on its boutique here. In fact, Mr Franchini states that Singapore represents \"almost half of the whole South-east Asian market, which grew by a remarkable 24 per cent last year.\"\n\nJohnny Manglani, the president of the Uomo Group, who has been selling Brioni products in his multi-label store and partnered with Brioni to open its monobrand boutique here, has also noticed a rise in demand for accoutrements appreciated by those in the know. While Brioni has been traditionally favoured by greying business honchos and heads of state, Mr Manglani has encountered fans of the brand in their 20s.\n\nThe purveyor of upscale menswear labels here and in Russia adds: \"There are so many young millionaires in Asia and Brioni appeals to a certain discerning type of person who could discover the brand in his 20s, and wear it until he retires.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Here, they are given prime space, and have taken on a fancy term too. Called Social Hubs, these areas are spacious, tastefully done up and, in fact, look more attractive than the actual work area.\n\nAt DBS Asia Gateway in Toh Guan Road, there are four social hubs, each done up with a different colour theme, such as green and purple. \"The staff really embrace these social hubs. Instead of merely gathering at their desks, they come here,\" says a DBS spokesman. \"Rather than head to the meeting rooms, some choose to have their discussions at the social hubs.\"\n\nDBS has three offices across Singapore - at Changi Business Park, Marina Bay Financial Centre and at Toh Guan. Social hubs can be found at all three locations. The bank has about 1,000 employees working at Toh Guan, since September. They span a cross-section of departments from customer service, consumer banking, investment banking to private banking. It is difficult to tell that the office was previously a warehouse space. \"One of the challenges was how to make staff feel they are entering an office rather than a warehouse,\" says Jessi Ong, senior interior designer at HBO+EMTB. The firm also designed the DBS office at Changi Business Park.\n\nThe design team did this by tearing down concrete walls and replacing them with glass ones. Social hubs are placed along the corridor so that staff can look out onto a courtyard and vice versa. Out of the four social hubs, the red themed one is the largest, as this is where the cafeteria is. Here, townhall meetings can be conducted, via video-conferencing to connect with staff at the two other locations. Ms Ong says that red represents flowers, so some of the customised furniture resemble trees, as seen on the table legs. There are also meeting rooms here, that have been designed to resemble houses.\n\nMuch effort was also placed in doing up the courtyard, which the staff frequently use during the cooler times of the day. A pair of white statues from Chinese artist Gao Xiaowu greet staff as they walk past. At night, the courtyard is lit up by cone- and globe-shaped lights.\n\nMs Ong says that when it came to designing the office, the team had to keep in mind DBS's tagline: Living, Breathing Asia. \"So we incorporated Asian elements, such as a water theme for a department's social hub,\" Elsewhere, there are bird-cage-like lights and dining chairs inspired by kopi-tiam chairs. The bank also worked with a social enterprise, Social Creatives, to design a mural. DBS staff also got involved with the painting. The bank's new office has gone down well with its staff. Operations manager Lim Chun Hwa says, \"I don't feel so constrained working here, and I appreciate the spaciousness.\" As a new employee to the company, the social hubs have also come in handy for him. \"There are definitely more opportunities to meet with colleagues from the other departments, unlike in the previous office.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

(Hacktivism) is a crime and can affect society in ways (that) we can't imagine . . . it can bring down the power system, telecoms system, affect hospitals . . . so there are implications,\" said Singapore Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim.\n\nDr Yaacob was responding to a question about whether the recent issue of hacktivism was a worrisome one, during a media conference at the 13th Asean Telecommunications and IT Ministers Meeting (Telmin) yesterday.\n\nIn addressing the matter, inter-governmental cooperation would be key, he said. \"Obviously, we need to be able to share certain information. We need that cooperation between countries in order to deal with this in a very decisive manner.\"\n\nAs Singapore grappled with threats to its online infrastructure after various government sites were compromised in recent weeks, other countries in the region have had brushes with Anonymous, a disparate group of hacking activists.\n\nEarlier this month, several government websites in the Philippines were defaced by individuals purporting to be part of Anonymous.\n\nBasuki Yusuf Iskandar, secretary-general of Indonesia's Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, noted that cybercrime had become a \"hot issue\" in his country as well.\n\n\"The government is trying to promote awareness (among) the people, (trying to) get individuals to protect themselves . . . it is not a single-country issue, . . . it's a global issue and a global problem,\" he said.\n\nEven as governments ponder the vexing problem of virtual anarchy, Brunei's Minister of Communications Pehin Dato Abdullah Bakar pointed out that there was plenty to be done by the various countries' citizenry as well.\n\n\"If you're looking at hacking sites and getting information . . . what we're worried about is the weak human element. There are people (who do not) guard their personal information properly,\" he said.\n\n\"So, yes, we are worried, but there are two aspects . . . (The first) is to guard the data itself and (the second) is to have a standard operating procedure for people accessing the data.\"\n\nAs the 13th Asean Telmin drew to a close yesterday, a memorandum of understanding between Asean and China was signed, focusing on cooperation in areas including human resources and infrastructure development, as well as new technologies.\n\nThe mid-term review of the Asean ICT Masterplan 2015 was also issued, in which the masterplan was judged to have \"developed well\". The Singapore Declaration - adopted at the event yesterday - acknowledged the need to start developing a new Asean masterplan for the post-2015 period.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So far it is working.\n\nThe central bank said that domestic demand was the key driver of growth coming in at 8.3 per cent compared to 7.4 per cent in the second quarter.\n\nA mild global economic recovery also saw exports turning around to grow by 1.7 per cent versus a contraction of 5.2 per cent in the previous quarter.\n\nThe ETP has been generating momentum. Private investment grew by 15.2 per cent (12.7 per cent in the second quarter) driven by capital spending in the services and manufacturing sectors, as well as oil and gas projects.\n\nPutrajaya had also assured international investors that there would be no deficit on the country's current account of its balance of payments. It proved to be right.\n\nThe current account surplus in the third quarter rose to RM9.8 billion (S$3.8 billion) compared to RM2.6 billion in the second quarter. Indeed, the surplus for the first nine months clocked in at RM21.2 billion.\n\nEven accounting for a net deficit of RM11.5 billion on the nation's financial account, the central bank said that the overall balance in the third quarter was in surplus amounting to RM11.8 billion from a mere RM1.5 billion in the second quarter.\n\nTotal foreign direct investment for the nine months rose 8.7 per cent year-on-year to RM27.6 billion.\n\nInterestingly, reverse investment by Malaysian firms overseas for the nine months rose 6.7 per cent year-on-year to RM35.7 billion.\n\nMore than 75 per cent of the amount, however, came from the oil and gas sector (Petronas' investment in Canada's shale gas) and the finance sector (Malaysian banks expanding regionally).\n\nMeanwhile, the international reserves of the central bank as at end-September rose to almost US$136 billion, enough to finance over nine months of retained imports.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia, the central bank, seemed to indicate that monetary policy would remain easy. It has maintained its overnight policy rate of 3 per cent for more than 16 months now, a rate that it said \"remained supportive of economic activity\".\n\nBank Negara was bullish on the economy going forward, saying that both domestic demand and the gradual recovery in the global economy would support growth. \"The economy is therefore expected to remain on its steady growth trajectory,\" it concluded.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In fact, most staff do that, judging from the many pairs of shoes placed at the entrance.\n\n\"It is all very cool and casual here,\" says Cherry Bacolod, Roomorama's marketing and public relations manager.\n\nSince April, the 30-strong staff have been working from this office located on the third storey of a shophouse on Amoy Street. The four-year-old company was founded by Jia En Teo and her husband Federico Folcia, and today is Asia's fastest growing short-term rental platform.\n\nIt was Mr Folcia who designed the office. The space is not overly generous but still feels spacious and airy, because of its white walls and an airwell, where natural light streams in. Just like his home in the Toh Tuck area, Mr Folcia recreated a similar look for the office - a mix of modern, minimalist and industrial.\n\nMost of the staff have their workstations in a central area, where a large Roomorama logo is emblazoned on the wall. Roomorama's chief user-experience officer, Josh Kennedy is the man behind the cute graphics seen around the office. For example, in place of a sign that says \"Meeting Room 1\", he has drawn graphics of two talk bubbles. On some of the other doors, are graphics of a bicycle and shoe, indicating the respective use of the storerooms.\n\nThere's a media wall in the office, where framed articles of Ms Teo and Mr Folcia are put up. The couple sometimes bring their dog, Pato, to the office too.\n\nActual cinema seating salvaged from the old Capitol Theatre have found their way into a meeting room. Mr Folcia has more of them in his home. The casual vibe of the office naturally extends into the pantry area, where staff gather for weekly meetings on Monday mornings. \"Breakfast is provided, so we all grab some fruit or yogurt before the meeting,\" says Ms Bacolod.\n\nJust by the side is a foosball table which is actively used. \"Sometimes we hold championship games,\" says Ms Bacolod. On some Fridays, the company holds poker nights.\n\n\"The company is young and hip, so naturally the office reflects this too,\" says Ms Bacolod.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Also disappointing was developer City Developments.\n\nMeanwhile, the Straits Times Index (STI) is fairly valued at historical averages with not much upside potential, though this widely followed barometer of the Singapore market could rise by 10 per cent next year in line with earnings growth, analysts said.\n\nAmong market worries are the US tapering of its financial asset purchases, a margin squeeze in the construction sector and a residential market correction.\n\n\"The third quarter does spell out a weaker tone of earnings. The number of misses were double those that were above expectations,\" said Kenneth Ng, head of Singapore research at CIMB. \"For the consumer sectors, revenues seem to be hurt by competition and currency fluctuations in the region. For the industrial sectors, execution of orders seems to be a bit of a problem.\"\n\nAfter a rally that began in 2012 and lasted till May this year before fears of a US rollback of quantitative easing set in, the Singapore stock exchange has been trading within a tight range in the past five months. The FTSE ST All-Share index, which tracks most of the 800 companies listed in the Republic, has been in a 740-780-point rut since June - with the low of 740 points reached at the end of August amid an emerging-market currency crisis scare. Similarly, the STI, an index of the 30 largest and most liquid stocks on the local bourse, has been stuck between 3,100 and 3,200 points for most of the past five months.\n\nAnalysts do not see much growth for the Singapore market in 2014.\n\nSTI's current valuation is around 13.5 times of next year's consensus price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, compared with its five-year historical average of 14.2 times, said Lee Chok Wai, senior equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. \"Valuation looks fair. We are neutral on Singapore with an end-2014 target of 3,590, implying a 12 per cent upside.\"\n\nKum Soek Ching, Credit Suisse private banking and wealth management South-east Asia research head, said: \"It is hard to see a PE re-rating for the market in the next 12 months. While we expect the economy to grow . . . the ongoing economic restructuring presents headwinds.\"\n\nAdded Vincent Fernando, director of Asean research at Religare Capital Markets: \"We remain cautious on . . . Singapore . . . Within Asean, it offers the weakest growth profile, with falling earnings expected for this year. . . . we like banks and telecoms, while we are cautious on industrials, developers and real estate investment trusts (Reits).\"\n\nCiti Research has a 3,278-point target for 2014, slightly above its historical PE average calculations for the STI. Given risks of increasing household debt here and labour cost issues, stocks with external exposure are preferred, it said. Its top picks include rigbuilder Keppel Corp, China-exposed firms Wilmar International and CapitaMalls Asia, DBS Bank and Keppel Land.\n\nDuring this past earnings cycle, local banks outperformed expectations. Loan growth was better than expected, even though net interest margins - a measure of bank profitability - do not seem to be rebounding yet. DBS's total loans grew 19 per cent year on year, OCBC's went up 16 per cent and UOB's loan growth was 15.8 per cent.\n\nStripping out divestment gains a year ago, OCBC's core third-quarter net profit of $759 million was 5 per cent higher than the $724 million a year ago because of higher fee income and better insurance contributions from subsidiary Great Eastern. This handily beat estimates of $658 million in a Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.\n\nCredit Suisse's Ms Kum said she expected mid to high single-digit earnings growth for banks next year.\n\nShipping and marine stocks, such as Cosco Corporation, NOL and Vard Holdings, disappointed. They also accounted for some of the largest quarterly net profit falls in absolute terms, figures compiled by BT showed. NOL's third-quarter net profit slipped 60 per cent to US$20 million, owing to lower freight rates and volume.\n\nConglomerate Jardine Cycle & Carriage's third-quarter net profit fell 31 per cent, as a result of increased competition in the car market, higher labour costs and lower commodity prices.\n\nSteel producer Sapphire Corp took a $46.4 million impairment hit to its assets in China, causing third-quarter net losses to widen to $52.3 million. The steelmaking industry is facing overcapacity amid a weak market outlook.\n\nThird-quarter net profit for palm oil producer Golden Agri-Resources fell 65 per cent to US$30 million from US$86 million the year before. The counter, however, had surged in the past weeks to more than 60 cents from around 53 cents.\n\nNo such luck for Super Group, however. The instant food and beverage maker saw its shares plunge a third from around $4.50 to almost $3 a share after it surprised the market with a 17 per cent fall in net profit to $18.7 million, cutting its growth story short. The stock has since recovered to around $3.50.\n\nKeppel Corp recorded one of the largest absolute profit gains for the quarter, with third-quarter net profit rising $111 million, or 32 per cent, to $457.6 million. Higher contributions from its property business offset a drop in core rig-building earnings.\n\nLooking ahead, Carmen Lee, head of investment research at OCBC, talked of uncertainty in an environment of potentially higher interest rates once the US starts tapering its asset purchases. Among Reits, the retail rental market should remain steady and Central Business District office rentals should remain positive next year due to limited supply, but the industrial market is \"showing signs of fatigue\", she said.\n\nAll in all, North Asia, notably China, might be more attractively priced than Asean or Singapore. Said Raymond Chan, AllianzGlobal Investors' chief investment officer for Asia Pacific: \"Chinese equities markets, including both onshore A-shares and offshore H-shares, at current levels offer attractive opportunities for long-term investors.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There, the cryptocurrency has become a way to circumvent Chinese capital controls and an alternative form of speculation amid a dearth of investment options.\n\nWhat is more surprising is that the Chinese government has done practically nothing about Bitcoin, for now at least.\n\n\"The Chinese firewall will stop you from going to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter but it doesn't stop you from going to bitcoin.com. In China, they have this fantastic service, BTCChina, that allows you to buy Bitcoins with your Chinese yuan,\" Hakim Mamoni, co-founder of Seedcoin, noted at the Bitcoin Singapore conference yesterday.\n\nToday, China is the second-largest downloader of Bitcoin wallets - a virtual program that stores users' Bitcoins - after the United States. In May, 84,000 wallets were downloaded in China, vaulting it into pole position for that month, according to Zennon Kapron, managing director of Kapronasia, a research and advisory firm for financial services.\n\nIncidentally, since May, the price of Bitcoins has surged from about US$100-US$150 to about US$450. This being a currency that is prized for keeping its owners anonymous, it is hard to pin the spike in price on the Chinese, but all signs point their way.\n\nThe draw of the Bitcoin is dual-fold. High net worth individuals use the virtual currency to get money out of China and at the same time, the same currency controls being circumvented have increased Bitcoin's appeal as an alternative investment.\n\n\"For the average investor in China, there are very few investment choices and that's why we've seen real estate prices skyrocket. Now we're seeing that with Bitcoin as well,\" Mr Kapron said yesterday at Bitcoin Singapore.\n\nThe infrastructure that sprang up to support the burgeoning Bitcoin trade is coming into its own. China's largest transaction platform, BTC China, recently surpassed the transaction volume of incumbent Mt.Gox.\n\nAmid all this activity, the Chinese government has kept an intriguing silence, and might - in some quarters - tacitly approve. Earlier this year, CCTV, China's official network, aired a Bitcoin documentary which caused awareness of the currency to soar.\n\n\"In theory, anything that goes across CCTV is government-approved. (But) the government hasn't said anything about Bitcoin yet,\" Mr Kapron said.\n\nWhat the Chinese authorities ultimately do will have ramifications across Bitcoin markets, including Singapore's.\n\n\"If China makes a move on the regulatory front, the US will almost be forced to follow because there's such a large economic connection between the two of them,\" he said. Singapore will in turn take its cue from the US and the European Union.\n\n\"If the currency is going to take off, China is going to have to be a part of it,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Consider only what by oneself is done or left undone.\"\n\nThe 67-year-old president, after whom the theatre venue is named, is the chairman of the three-day pow-wow, at which Britain is represented by Prince Charles, standing in for Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Commonwealth, in particular, has drawn flak for holding the summit on this Indian Ocean island, given that its government has for years refused to allow independent probes into war crimes and rights abuses allegedly committed during and after a 27-year civil war that ended in 2009; recent reports of reporters being harassed and the continued violation of human rights have also raised alarms.\n\nThe leaders of Canada, India and Mauritius have boycotted the summit, but the Commonwealth and other CHOGM leaders, including Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, defended the meeting as a way to engage Sri Lanka constructively on these issues.\n\nSingapore Minister for Foreign Affairs K Shanmugam, who attended the CHOGM Foreign Ministers' meeting on Thursday, told Singapore reporters that political reconciliation in Sri Lanka cannot be imposed by external parties. Isolating the country will not automatically improve the welfare of its people, he said.\n\n\"Singapore's approach is to support Sri Lanka in its reconciliation process through constructive engagement, as well as by helping with development projects in the north and the east,\" he said in a statement.\n\nIn his opening speech yesterday, President Rajapaksa said the Commonwealth should stay focused on social-economic issues that improve the welfare of its people, and not be \"judgmental\".\n\n\"If the Commonwealth is to remain relevant to its member countries, the association must respond to the needs of its people and not turn into a punitive or judgmental body,\" he said.\n\nResponding, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbot said \"we are here as much to praise as to judge\", and noted that Sri Lanka has made much progress since the end of its civil war. The economy has enjoyed growth rates of up to 8.2 per cent, and a record high of more than a million tourists visited the country last year.\n\nAustralia hosted the previous CHOGM summit.\n\nDuring his impassioned speech, Mr Rajapaksa said his government deserved credit for managing to bring an end to the conflict. \"We asserted the greatest human right - the right to life. In the last four years, there has not been one single terrorism-related incident in Sri Lanka.\"\n\nThe theme for CHOGM 2013 is \"Growth with Equity: Inclusive Development\"; its agenda includes sessions on debt restructuring and climate change.\n\nMeanwhile, Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has given his \"full support\" for an early ratification of the recently inked European-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting with Mr Lee on the sidelines of CHOGM, the two leaders also said they looked forward to expanding their good ties with \"enhanced bilateral cooperation in the areas of training of officials and pursuing new economic opportunities together\", according to Mr Lee's press secretary Chang Li Lin.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For instance, the announcement that the exchange and Monetary Authority of Singapore are looking into the trading of the three designated counters should have been made before trading resumed and not after. But to blame the exchange exclusively is both naive and oversimplistic. Wisdom in hindsight is a wonderful thing, but considering that SGX - whose primary role as a regulator is to signal warnings - can only query, designate and suspend stocks and that all three tools were employed in the case of the three counters mentioned above, it's difficult to see what it could have done differently during last month's sorry penny episode.\n\nSome have asserted that SGX should have sounded a warning much earlier while the three stocks were rising with not much fundamental backing. But so did dotcom stocks during the Internet/Nasdaq boom more than a decade ago, and so did China stocks in 2005-2007. So did many penny stocks during the periodic bursts of activity that drove the old Sesdaq and now Catalist to new highs throughout their life spans, one of the most spectacular being 1998-2000 after the Asian financial crisis.\n\nNobody would reasonably have expected the exchange to step in and warn investors of their folly during those run-ups - if it did it might have been accused of unwanted interference - so why should this have been any different?\n\nSGX is not in the business of passing judgment on the quality of its listings or of warning retail punters to be careful - though it is probably wincing inwardly every time the local bourse is described as being \"nothing more than a penny market\" - it is in the business of running a marketplace where buyers and sellers can transact with minimal friction.\n\nThe truth is that here we have a classic case of SGX being the convenient whipping boy when things go wrong. Or to be more precise, when prices fall suddenly and people lose money, scapegoats have to be found to take the blame. And there can be no easier target than the exchange, given that it labours under an outdated and unwieldy mandate that requires it to balance the pursuit of commercial profit with the performance of regulatory duties.\n\nPundits and letter writers have correctly pointed out that this arrangement (among others) needs urgent reviewing. No argument here. Even though it is inconceivable that SGX would ever sacrifice regulatory ideals for profit, the reality is that as long as a conflict of interest is perceived to exist by those in the market, then the exchange's credibility will suffer and criticism will abound when things go wrong, notwithstanding numerous checks and balances being in place to ensure conflicts are properly resolved.\n\nHowever, to focus on what the exchange could have done better would be to wrongly ignore the part played by the other major actors in the penny drama - retail punters, their trading representatives and the broking firms.\n\nAll are also culpable - retail punters for chasing speculative stocks ever higher into uncharted heights when there may have been no fundamental reason to support this; dealers for not reining in their clients; and broking houses' backrooms for ignoring what must have been increasingly risky exposure over the many months it took for the three counters to reach the levels they did.\n\nThe responsibility for ensuring good governance and for protecting investors isn't solely the SGX's; it rests with everyone connected to the market. The quicker everyone admits this, the better.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With the latest merger, it drops to three,\" he said. \"It is likely we'll be sitting around in 2020 saying, 'I wish we still had eight carriers.'\"\n\nDelta's merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008 led to price increases of more than 10 per cent on four of the routes they dominated, as well as service cuts on another route, according to research by the American Antitrust Institute.\n\nBased on the details on a settlement announced on Tuesday, antitrust specialists said that the consumers who could benefit would be those who use New York's LaGuardia, Reagan National outside Washington DC and other major airports.\n\nConsumers flying outside those markets, for example from Dallas to Charlotte, could be hurt, said Jeffrey Shinder, an antitrust specialist at Constantine Cannon LLP. \"Some consumers will end up being better off,\" he said. \"(But) I think in the long run, because it will take a bit for this to play out, that prices will be higher because of the transaction.\"\n\nHowever, Herbert Hovenkamp, who teaches antitrust law at the University of Iowa College of Law, praised the decision as farsighted. \"The leg-up that the government has given some of the low-cost carriers, I think, is going to have a very positive impact on the industry,\" he said.\n\nUnder the deal announced on Tuesday, US Airways and American Airlines agreed to sell 104 take-off and landing slots at Reagan National and 34 at LaGuardia, along with supporting gates and ground facilities. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Loss per share was 4.89 cents, against 0.79 cent previously.\n\nThis, it said, was due to $49 million fair-value loss on financial assets, which led its \"other income\" to register a negative $46.6 million for the quarter.\n\nThe financial assets were mostly market securities tendered as consideration for the disposals of its interests in three companies: Industrial Power Technology, Think Greenergy and Think Environmental, it said.\n\nLionGold had adopted the November valuations of these securities (based on their closing price on Nov 8), rather than their value at end-September, because their prices have since seen \"significant declines\" and \"the higher valuations (at end-Sept) are not supportable as at the date of this announcement\".\n\nIts revenue, however, increased 52 per cent to $45.6 million on higher contribution from its gold-mining division and China manufacturing operations.\n\nUnlike LionGold, which incurred huge losses on its financial assets at fair value, profits of Blumont and Asiasons were boosted by substantial gains in their financial assets' fair value.\n\nFor Blumont, its net profit at $33.7 million was 7.6 times the $4.4 million a year ago, even as revenue fell 16 per cent to $1.3 million in its third quarter. The product sterilisation firm's earnings per share swelled to 1.97 cents for the quarter, from 0.29 cent a year ago.\n\nThis was driven by \"other gains\" of $40.9 million in Q3, comprised mainly one-time unrealised fair value gains of $38.9 million on quoted financial assets, which it revealed were \"a portfolio of equities investments in companies listed in Singapore Exchange and Bursa Malaysia\".\n\nInvestment firm Asiasons returned to the black with a net profit of $33.4 million, reversing year-ago net losses of $5.7 million, while revenue jumped fourfold to $1.3 million - barely a fraction of earnings. Its earnings per share swelled to 3.41 cents, against losses of 0.6 cent per share a year ago.\n\nAsiasons explained its revenue surge as financial advisory and media revenue contributed by two units acquired this year, on top of its usual fund management fees.\n\nIts \"other income\" was $34.4 million - against just $37.8 million a year ago - on the gain on dilution of associated company ISR Capital (one of the stocks also queried but not suspended by SGX on Oct 4), as well as unrealised fair value gains on financial assets in its portfolio of mostly quoted securities listed in Singapore. Share of income from its associated companies also helped, it said.\n\nDeputy head of Voyage Research, Ng Kian Teck, said the common huge swings in gains and losses across the fair value of these companies' financial assets is likely related to the fact they supposedly belong to a broader group of penny stocks linked through a web of cross-holdings. Some links such as direct shareholdings are more obvious and others less apparent.\n\n\"Why LionGold incurred losses while Blumont and Asiasons gained from financial assets could be because of the mixture of counters they held. But you can tell that the assets they are holding on to exhibit quite volatile price movements,\" he said.\n\nAsiasons in its results also noted that the prices of certain securities which it has a \"significant stake\" in have declined sharply and if this keeps up, the group is likely to incur fair value losses of $106 million in its next quarter.\n\nOn its move to raise net proceeds of $17.1 million, LionGold said yesterday that it plans to place 98.2 million new shares at 18.3 cents each.\n\nThe issue price carries a 7.85 per cent discount to its volume weighted average price of 19.86 cents for trades done on Thursday.\n\nThe shares will be placed to three subscribers: hedge-fund manager Wintercrest Advisors, financial consultant Stephen Yeo, and Sia Ah Kheng, a businessman with interests in a construction business. Wintercrest is owned by New York-based Platinum Partners' Value Arbitrage fund, which last month also subscribed for US$200 million worth of convertible bonds from Blumont.\n\nLionGold's shares yesterday fell 2 per cent to end at 19.2 cents on the news.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

There is no definitive evidence that aspirin is effective for those who have never had a heart attack\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH an ageing population and with advances in medicine, more people are taking blood thinning drugs daily for the prevention and treatment of stroke and heart disease. A common question is whether taking an aspirin a day is useful. Before commencing on these drugs, it is important to understand whether blood thinning agents are safe and what the precautions are to prevent bleeding complications.\n\nTypes of blood thinning agents\n\nBlood thinning agents can be broadly divided into two groups. The first, termed anti-platelet drugs, encompasses all the drugs that prevent clot formation by preventing blood platelets from clumping together. When platelets clump together, a biological reaction is activated and a clot is formed. This is frequently the mechanism for a heart attack. In a heart attack, the inner lining of the channel at the site of the narrowed segment of the artery may tear (\"plaque rupture\" ) and the body reacts by activating the platelets to clump together at the site of the tear with subsequent formation of a blood clot blocking the heart artery.\n\nAnti-platelet drugs are routinely given to patients with severely narrowed heart arteries - those with heart attacks, those who have undergone insertion of stents into heart arteries, those with heart bypass surgery and those with strokes due to blocked arteries.\n\nThe second group of drugs, anticoagulant drugs, act on a different blood clotting mechanism which is activated through proteins, called blood clotting factors, which are mainly produced by the liver. This is given to patients who are at risk of spontaneous blood clot formation as a result of abnormal heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), severe damage to the heart pump or artificial mechanical valve replacement.\n\nSigns of bleeding\n\nEarly signs of thinning of the blood include easy bruising on the skin and gum bleeding. More serious bleeding will usually involve the gut. Bleeding from blood thinning agents can arise from the stomach or the small intestine and it can either present as vomiting of blood (which may be fresh red blood or altered blood that looks like coffee) or stools which are almost black in colour (as a result of altered blood). It can also present as passage of dark red or fresh blood in stools as a result of bleeding in the large intestine.\n\nRisk of bleeding\n\nBased on data published by US researchers from Mayo clinic in September in the Circulation journal on patients of age 60 years and above, the overall incidence of stomach or upper small intestinal bleeding with use of blood thinning drugs was about two in 100 patients who were followed up for one year. The overall incidence of bleeding from the large intestine was about seven per 100 patients who were followed up for one year. The risk was highest in those who were on anti-platelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs together. Those on this combination were also most likely to require hospitalisation and to require blood transfusion, especially if aspirin was the anti-platelet agent being prescribed.\n\nFor every 100 patients who are started on a combination of aspirin and an anticoagulant drug for the first year, there will be about two who will have bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine, almost seven who will bleed from the large intestine, three who will require hospitalisation, and about six who will require blood transfusion. The numbers are slightly better if aspirin was replaced with another anti-platelet drug when used in combination with an anticoagulant drug.\n\nThe use of two antiplatelet agents (aspirin plus another antiplatelet agent) is the routine medication for all patients who have just had stents placed in their heart arteries to open up blockages. For every 100 patients started on this combination for the first year, about one will have bleeding from the stomach or upper small intestine, about six will bleed from the large intestine, 1.5 who will require hospitalisation, and about two who will require blood transfusion.\n\nHence, it is clear that the use of long-term blood thinning agents is associated with significant risks of bleeding from the gut.\n\nDo all blood thinning agents damage the stomach and intestine?\n\nAspirin, even at a low dose, doubles the risk of a major bleed compared to those given a placebo. Aspirin can cause direct injury to the lining of the stomach and intestines, resulting in bleeding. Unlike aspirin, the other blood thinning agents including the other types of anti-platelet drugs (such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), and anticoagulant drugs (such as warfarin, rivaroxaban and dabigatran) do not directly injure the lining of the stomach and the intestines but will increase the likelihood of bleeding if there is damage to the wall lining.\n\nPrecautionary measures\n\nThere are several precautionary measures to take when taking blood thinning drugs. First, do not take aspirin for prevention of heart attack if you do not have significant heart disease. There is no definitive evidence that aspirin is effective for the prevention of heart attacks for those who have never had a heart attack. This is so even for those with known heart disease but with no prior heart attack.\n\nThere is evidence that microscopic vessels in the wall of the heart arteries can bleed into the narrowed segments of the heart artery and worsen the heart condition. Aspirin can potentially predispose to this in those with pre-existing narrowing of the heart arteries. In addition to the risk of bleeding from the stomach and gut, aspirin can cause serious bleeding into the brain. In a review of the role of aspirin in heart disease published earlier this year in the European Heart Journal, the author concluded that there was no reliable evidence that aspirin used in the current fashionable doses of 50-100 mg/day is of any benefit in any common clinical setting.\n\nSecond, if long-term anti-platelet drug treatment is necessary, another alternative antiplatelet medication (such as clopidogrel) can be considered in place of aspirin. Third, underlying medical conditions that can predispose to bleeding in the gut should be treated, including gastritis, ulcers, and piles. Fourth, drugs that reduce acidity and protect the stomach and the upper small intestine from bleeding should be given to those who require long-term blood thinning medication.\n\nFifth, for those who have an increased risk of bleeding because of age or underlying medical conditions or may require surgery in the future, when undergoing stenting of their blocked heart arteries, they should consider the use of the new generation of heart stents which do not require long-term blood thinning medication (usually not more than six months) as opposed to older generation of stents which require lifelong anti-platelet medication.\n\nSixth, when starting oral blood thinning drugs, avoid drugs that can increase the risk of bleeding in the gut such as painkillers under the group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroids, anti-depression drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and injectable blood thinners called heparin.\n\nSeven, if you are on warfarin, you will need to understand the multiple food and drug interactions with this drug and the risk of foetal abnormality when becoming pregnant while on medication. Finally, wherever possible, try to avoid having to take anti-platelet drugs and anticoagulants together.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

Whether he eventually prevails over the many opponents to his view could shape China's future growth trajectory.\n\nHis view matters because he was the only scholar from the emerging world to take the top economist job at the World Bank, with the backing of the Chinese government. From 2008 until June last year, he oversaw the bank's research, coming up with economic guidance to help the global communities cope with the fallout of the recent financial crisis.\n\nHis domestic credentials were burnished more than 30 years ago when he defected from Taiwan's army by swimming across a frontline island to the China mainland. An arrest warrant from Taiwan is still out on him.\n\nThose credentials were boosted early this month when he was retained by Prime Minister Li Keqiang as an adviser to China's Cabinet, the State Council. Along with five other fresh appointees, the advisory team is now 64 strong and comprises specialists in fields ranging from art to technology and economics.\n\nCuriously, Mr Lin's expectations of China growing incessantly at 8 per cent seems to have run ahead of what the Chinese leaders are willing to say these days in public. It makes him stand out in Chinese academia, which tilts in favour of a remedy for the country to modify, if not radically alter, its current growth path.\n\nAt issue is not his underlying assumption about China's potential, but whether such a high rate of growth would be beneficial to China and the world, or even feasible to pursue.\n\nBy now, the magical figure of 8 per cent has virtually disappeared from top officials' vocabulary. Premier Li has been sticking to 7 per cent as the government's bottom line for growth in despatches published at home and abroad by the state media. More recently, on Nov 4, he raised the bar marginally to 7.2 per cent, which he said was the minimum needed to cap urban unemployment at 4 per cent and to ensure the creation of 10 million jobs.\n\nMr Li made the comment at a national congress of China's trade union, citing a national capacity to generate between 1.3 million and 1.5 million jobs for every percentage gain in gross domestic product (GDP) now, up from a million jobs in the past for the same pace of growth.\n\nHis prescription for China's economic transition, along with his vision for it to double the size of its economy before 2020, is fundamentally Keynesian, an approach entailing expansionary fiscal policy and public investment along the lines of China's current investment-led growth model.\n\nWhen it is done, China will achieve a per capita GDP of US$12,000 by 2020, almost double the current US$6,100 and possibly catapulting the nation into the league of high-income countries.\n\nMr Lin aired the same optimism in Singapore this week at the inaugural China Forum at the Singapore Management University, and later that same day in Hong Kong to a small evening audience at the Asia Society. This time in Singapore, however, he qualified his view by stressing the need to allocate resources more effectively and remove the distortions and bottlenecks in the official distribution mechanism.\n\nIn Hong Kong, he focused on promoting a global initiative to launch a multilateral infrastructure fund, styled in the spirit of the Marshall Plan for post-World War II Europe, and the invention of a currency called paper gold to replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency. These are ideas proposed in his new book, Against the Consensus: Reflections on the Great Recession.\n\nAt home, Mr Lin, a specialist in development economy, has engaged in heated public debates with economists over China's future course of growth.\n\nAmong his adversaries is Gary Liu, the deputy director of Shanghai-based CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance.\n\nMr Liu said: \"Lin is a radical voice. He is catering to officials' mentality. He provides them (with) an ideological cover. His view poses many dangers (for China). It could mislead officials and cause reform to backtrack.\n\n\"The chance for China of achieving such growth rate is very small. Theoretically, we can continue to grow at 8 per cent, but it would come at a huge cost, environmentally and socially.\"\n\nAnother high-profile opponent of Mr Lin's ideas is the founder of Primavera Capital Group, Fred Hu, a former partner and Greater China chairman at Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the same week the Communist Party issued its communiqu\u00e9 for the next decade, Mr Hu voiced his objection to Mr Lin's proposed use of an expansionary fiscal policy to achieve 8 per cent growth over the next 20 years.\n\n\"I do not agree with Mr Lin. In effect, fiscal and monetary policies are short-term, counter-cyclical policy tools. For example, in 2008, during the global recession, our government offset the negative impact with short-term demand expansion. But regrettably, this short-term counter-cyclical policy became a long-term policy, causing a large expansion in government spending and leading to over capacity and high local debt. It's a very dangerous situation,\" he said on Phoenix TV.\n\nDiscarding the old growth model may be the prevailing consensus, but Mr Lin's opponents are far from carrying the day. The problem is how much political will the leadership can muster from various political factions to implement reform.\n\nCEIBS' Mr Liu said: \"The signal of the current leadership is clear, judging from their statements and official papers that they want structural reform and rebalance away from an investment-dependent model.\n\n\"But the government is still very vague on many things, such as on the reform of state-owned enterprises, an issue of popular concern. My personal view is the speed of reform in China will always lag behind public expectations.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gross profit margins remained flat at 28 per cent.\n\nOn a nine-month basis, the group's net profit also declined 50 per cent year on year to 12.5 billion baht, again on the lack of the 12.7 billion baht associate gain.\n\nManagement highlighted that the group's business has also been impacted by a new excise tax on alcohol beverages in Thailand, which is now based on both value and alcohol content, instead of either value or volume. This has affected the price of all alcohol products. Higher labour costs from the broader implementation of a minimum wage policy are also expected to impact earnings, the group said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yesterday the index stood at 104.5028.\n\nMid-cap investors have been keen. This week, contractor KSH Holdings' $75 million 2.5-year 5.25 per cent issue received $150 million orders or was subscribed two times. \"The appetite is still good as the fundamental demand for bonds remains strong,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nDBS is the bond market leader, handling a total of 51 deals worth $4.9 billion with a 27 per cent market share so far this year. Bond issuance year-to-date totals $18 billion, according to Bloomberg data. In 2012, bond deals totalled $31 billion.\n\nThe increasing activity by mid-caps is also a sign of the market's growing maturity, as investors gain more comfort with high yield, less familiar names, as well as foreign companies, said Tan Kee Phong, OCBC Bank head, capital markets.\n\n\"From where I'm standing, it's kind of natural development of the market; in the beginning, it's high-grade issuers, the next level normally it's going down the credit curve or extending the tenure,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nEarly last year's three-year $250 million 8 per cent sale by Shui On Land, a Hong Kong company, sparked off interest from local investors for high-yield foreign names, he said.\n\nThere were also many high- yield deals by Indian corporates.\n\n\"Next step, if I can look at foreign names, I can also look at local names,\" said Mr Tan, of investors' growing demand for mid-cap bonds.\n\nMid-cap issues are typically small size, with many less than $100 million, and short tenures like two years as that is what investors are most comfortable with.\n\nThe pipeline for more mid-cap deals in the next two weeks is pretty good, before December, when the market quietens as many go on holidays, he said. \"Generally, interest rates are still low historically, growth wise, it's positive, inflation is benign and liquidity is still available,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Gold rose 70 per cent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more than US$2 trillion into the financial system, fuelling expectations of accelerated inflation and a weaker US dollar. President Barack Obama nominated Ms Yellen, the bank's vice-chairman, last month to succeed chairman Ben S Bernanke, whose term expires on Jan 31.\n\nThe economy and labour market are performing \"far short of their potential\" and must improve before the Fed will consider curbing its US$85 billion of monthly bond purchases, Ms Yellen said at her nomination hearing on Thursday.\n\nWhile gold is heading for its first annual drop in 13 years after some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value, lower prices boosted jewellery, bar and coin purchases. Demand from China, India and the Middle East surged a combined 27 per cent in the 12 months through September, the World Gold Council (WGC) estimates.\n\n\"It's unlikely that Bernanke will do anything at his last meeting if he perceives that his successor would prefer to leave policy unchanged,\" said Nic Brown, head of commodities research at Natixis SA in London. \"The dollar may drop back, too. This is all potentially positive for gold prices in the very short term.\"\n\nBullion, down 23 per cent this year to US$1,282.86 an ounce in London, added 1.7 per cent since touching a four-week low of US$1,261.42 on Nov 12. The Standard & Poor's GSCI gauge of 24 commodities dropped 4.6 per cent since the end of December, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 17 per cent. The Bloomberg US Treasury Bond Index lost 2.3 per cent.\n\nEconomists surveyed by Bloomberg News on Nov 8 forecast the Fed probably will delay reductions in bond purchases until March. Gold slid earlier this week as the Bloomberg US Dollar Index set an eight-week high on Nov 12, after the US reported more job gains for October than economists forecast.\n\nBullion's 30-week correlation coefficient to the dollar index, a measure against 10 major currencies, is at minus 0.59, with a figure of minus one meaning the two always move in opposite directions.\n\n\"Supporting the recovery today is the surest path to returning to a more normal approach to monetary policy,\" Ms Yellen said in prepared remarks to the Senate Banking Committee. Through her testimony, she publicly voiced her views for the first time in seven months on the unprecedented monetary stimulus that she's supported.\n\nChina's demand for jewellery, bars and coins rose 30 per cent to 996.3 metric tonnes in the 12 months through September, the WGC said in a report on Thursday. Usage gained 24 per cent to 977.6 tonnes in India and 25 per cent to 225.8 tonnes in the Middle East.

Her comments during the week, widely interpreted as indicating that the Fed will continue pumping money into the system via its QE (quantitative easing) programme, have soothed worries that if the money printing stops, then stocks might actually have to rise or fall on fundamental or economic factors.\n\nNow, thanks to reassurances from the incoming Fed chair that the taps will remain open, it's \"risk on\" again - at least on Wall Street. US indices rose to two all-time highs on Wednesday and Thursday - first because Ms Yellen's thoughts were released ahead of her testimony to the Senate Banking Committee and then again when she actually stood before the committee. In response, the Straits Times Index (STI) gained 24 points or 0.8 per cent over the week, with the index yesterday rising 10.19 points to 3,201.27.\n\nAt her confirmation hearing on Thursday, Ms Yellen said it was \"imperative that (the Fed does) what (it) can to promote a very strong recovery\". Ms Yellen did not sound happy with the current state of affairs, saying that \"it's important not to remove support, especially when the recovery is fragile\" and that the labour market was still performing \"far short\" of its potential.\n\nAt the same time, she strongly set out the case for quantitative easing, saying that while the Federal Open Market Committee was monitoring potential negatives of the programmes, she judged that the benefits still outweighed the costs.\n\nMind you, take a step back and look at the STI's performance for the year and the picture isn't anything to write home about. In almost 11 months, the index's gain is now a measly 34 points or 1.07 per cent. Compare this to a stunning 26 per cent rise in the S&P 500 so far in 2013, the main market benchmark for the country which originated the great financial crisis of 2008 and still remains mired in recession, and investors have an idea of how powerful money printing can be and where fund managers' priorities lie.\n\nBlue-chip underperformance aside, the slump in penny stocks that started last month with the crash in Asiasons Capital, Blumont and LionGold continued this week, manifesting itself in significantly reduced daily volume and only sporadic bursts of interest in low-priced issues. In yesterday's session, only 1.6 billion units worth $1.02 billion were traded, figures which at the height of the penny boom earlier this year could well have been chalked up by a single counter instead of the entire market.\n\nIn the commodities segment, eyes were peeled on Olam International, which on Thursday reported a 5.7 per cent rise in profit for its first quarter ended Sept 30. In response, Olam's shares yesterday added 3.5 cents to $1.53 with 5.4 million units traded, even if the company's figures only stirred lukewarm interest from analysts.\n\nHSBC Global Research, for example, rated the stock \"neutral'' with a $1.64 target. It said Olam was on the right trajectory to achieve the goal of turning free cash flow (FCF)-positive in FY2014. \"However, turning FCF to equity positive will take longer, in our view. For that, overall gearing levels (including inventories) need to moderate further from the current 1.9x,\" said HSBC. \"While below the self-imposed 2x limit, it is not sufficient to improve the comfort levels of investors, in our view.\"\n\nNomura called a \"buy\" on Olam with a $2 target while OCBC Investment Research maintained a \"hold\" with a $1.45 fair value.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Tay Suan Chiang checks in on them\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nVillage Hotel Katong\n\nA FAMILIAR icon in the East Coast has returned with a new name and new look. What was once Paramount Hotel and Shopping Centre is now Village Hotel Katong, a five-minute walk away from Parkway Parade.\n\nThe facade of the buildings and the number of rooms have not changed, but everything else is new, following a $30 million refurbishment.\n\nThe design of the hotel, which opened earlier this month, is inspired by its surrounding Katong and Joo Chiat neighbourhoods. The Peranakan theme is clearly put across the hotel.\n\n\"The Peranakan culture is unique to the South-east Asian region and synonymous with the Katong precinct. Since the Village brand is all about giving guests authentic and local experiences, the infusion of Peranakan influences in Village Hotel Katong makes for a perfect fit,\" says Arthur Kiong, chief executive officer of Far East Hospitality, which owns the hotel. Far East Hospitality bought over Paramount in 2011.\n\nAll 229 rooms in Village Hotel Katong come with Peranakan motifs on the mirrored walls, carpets, wallpaper, furnishings and even on the bathroom tiles. Regardless of the size of the room, the Peranakan decor is consistent. What differs are the colour schemes, such as light green, fuchsia and blue.\n\nMr Kiong says the hotel will be popular with guests who have previously stayed in town but now want something different on their subsequent visits to Singapore.\n\nGuests who want something different can opt for the Club Room, which comes with a free standing tub in between the bathroom and sleeping area. The hotel also has eight suites, which come with a kitchenette, laundry and sitting area, which is suitable for long-staying guests.\n\nThose with a keen eye will also notice that even the artworks and decorative items in the hotel carry the Peranakan theme. Some of the rooms have Peranakan tea sets or ceramic jars, and the hotel collaborated with heART Studio, a local private art studio, to create pieces with a Peranakan theme. Some of the artworks were painted by kids as young as five years old.\n\nThe hotel's restaurant naturally has a Peranakan design. Called Katong Kitchen, it serves Nonya, Macanese, Asian, local Chinese and Western cuisine.\n\nNaumi Hotel\n\nMOST hotels undergo a face-lift after more than a decade of operations. But not the Naumi Hotel at Seah Street. The hotel opened in 2007, recently completed a year-long transformation and reopened its door last month.\n\nFounder and managing director, Surya Jhunjhnuwala says: \"We decided on a complete revamp as the trends have changed and what people want today is very different from what they wanted six years ago. Following the revamp, we ensured that we have retained the luxurious feel of Naumi but also provided guests with a more contemporary feel.\"\n\nThe entire hotel was gutted out save for the very popular infinity pool on the roof top.\n\nWith better space planning, the number of rooms has increased from 40 to 73. They are now slightly smaller than before, but with the clever use of lighter tones and space saving features, they don't feel constrained.\n\nRepeat guests to the hotel will notice that Naumi's floral motif has been retained in this face-lift, and can be spotted on the carpet and hanging lights. To give guests that luxury feel, beds come with seven-layer bedding in 400 thread-count Egyptian cotton, and premium bath amenities from organic New York brand Malin + Goetz. Some rooms come with free standing tubs, positioned such that guests can watch TV even when they are in it.\n\nThe new Naumi now comes with two-themed rooms, a black and white room inspired by Coco Chanel, and another in more masculine tones, inspired by Andy Warhol.\n\nLike before, Naumi offers guests a privacy floor to cater to the needs of the female traveller.\n\nTable by Rang Mahal, the hotel's new all-day dining restaurant, extends a holistic dining experience that Rang Mahal Restaurant is best known for. It offers all-day dining and bento sets designed for efficient, speedy lunches for business travellers.\n\nThe hotel also worked with a nutritionist to come up with a healthier breakfast menu. There's still bacon and ham, but these are cooked with less oil. Guests can also load up on specially concocted mixed juices with shots of collagen or vitamins.\n\nThe Westin Singapore\n\nTHE Westin brand was a familiar name when the hotel was in Singapore from 1986 to 2001. After more than a decade's absence, the American brand is making its comeback to Singapore.\n\nBack then, Westin The Stamford was once the world's tallest hotel. This time round, The Westin Singapore boasts the highest hotel lobby in the country, on the 32nd level of Asia Square Tower Two near Marina Bay.\n\nThe Westin occupies levels 32 to 46, making it a first for Singapore to have a hotel within an office building.\n\nSince it is located on the uppermost floors of the building, it only makes sense that the hotel is designed so guests can fully enjoy the view.\n\nThe lobby boasts 11-metre high floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook Marina Bay, and the lobby lounge by the side will leave guests feeling on top of the world.\n\nSimilarly, the hotel's 305 rooms all have floor-to-ceiling windows. Depending on the room category, guests could either enjoy the heritage city view, which looks out onto Shenton Way and Chinatown; the sea view, which has views of the port and Sentosa Cove in the distance, or the bay view, where they can look out onto Marina Bay and the South China Sea. There are only seven rooms which offer the bay view, making them more exclusive.\n\nHotel rooms in the city tend to be on the smaller side, but here they are surprisingly spacious, and decked out in soothing tones. All rooms come with standalone bathtubs, some of which are placed next to the windows, giving guests a bath with a view. The good thing is that the nearest buildings are a safe distance away, so there is no chance of peeking.\n\nThe hotel also has an infinity pool and a spa which will soon open to public.\n\nFood-wise, the hotel offers three options: an all-day dining restaurant called Seasonal Tastes, Daily Treats, a deli located on the ground floor, and Cook & Brew, a gastro-bar on the 33rd level. Cook & Brew serves local food, and offers over 100 different types of beer from 17 countries. This is the first Cook & Brew for the Westin brand, which will be introduced in subsequent hotels later. With its location in the CBD, the hotel expects a majority of its clients to be corporate guests.\n\nChuck Abbott, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide's regional vice president for South-east Asia, says: \"The Westin Singapore will play a significant role in the transformation of the Marina Bay development as we inject a unique and revitalising experiences into this urban oasis.\"\n\nThe Westin is owned by Starwood.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Still, most dealers foresee at least a 10 to 15 per cent fall from current certificate of entitlement levels.\n\nFrom February next year, the engines of Cat A cars not only have to be limited in displacement to under 1,600 cc, but their power cannot exceed 97 kW or 130 hp.\n\nThis means 42 models currently in Cat A are affected and will have to move over to Cat B (for cars above 1,600cc), including luxury rides like Singapore's top model last year, the Mercedes-Benz C180, and the BMW 316i. There will be about 100 models in the new Cat A.\n\nWith their bigger profit margins, distributors of high-end cars were said to have driven Cat A COE premiums to an all-time high of $92,100 in January this year. The premium has since slipped to $72,609 now.\n\n\"Next February should see the return of bread-and-butter models from those Japanese and Korean brands which have been priced out of Cat A for over two years,\" said the sales manager of a mass-market dealership. \"There are many prospective upgraders who have been waiting on the sidelines because of high car prices and they should be returning to the market next year.\"\n\nHe added that after the new rules kick in, he expects the Cat A COE premium to drop to the $60,000 level.\n\n\"Also, with the loan curbs still in force, affordability is an issue when the COE premium is high. So when Cat A softens, we will see more people coming back into the showrooms,\" he said.\n\nBut will the influx of these buyers keep the Cat A COE premium where it is today?\n\n\"No, premiums should soften despite the fact that there will be strong demand,\" said the sales manager. \"This is because this group of buyers is not in the same league as those who buy Mercedes-Benz or BMWs. While they are interested in buying a new car, they are not prepared to pay a high price.\"\n\nThe general manager of another mass-market dealership agreed.\n\n\"Those who buy our cars are relatively conservative,\" he explained. \"The moment the Cat A COE goes up too much, they don't want to buy anymore. They can probably still afford it but they just refuse to.\"\n\nIf and when the Cat A COE premium falls, what is stopping those buyers of small Mercs and BMWs from looking at the Japanese and Korean offerings instead?\n\n\"Some of them may consider a Toyota or a Honda, but most of them won't,\" said the sales manager. \"There is this thing called branding and prestige and for them, it does not include a Japanese volume model.\"\n\nThe all-new Toyota Corolla Altis will, however, be a bigger and more refined model than the current one, which costs about $120,000 now. The exterior looks like the present Camry mid-sized sedan, while the brand new interior is said to be very roomy because its wheelbase has been lengthened by 100mm to 2,700mm. The 1.6-litre engine is mated to a seven-step continuously variable transmission instead of the old four-speed automatic gearbox.\n\nThe Thai-made Altis has traditionally been Toyota's best-selling model here. It was the Republic's most popular model from 2002 to 2006. After dropping out in 2007, it remained in the top three until after 2010 as the COE quota contracted substantially. The model is expected to be launched in January.\n\nThe new Mazda3 is slated to arrive in the first quarter of 2014 from Japan. This 1.5-litre model will feature the familiar SkyActiv technology, which combines efficient engines with a smooth transmission in a lightweight but strong body.\n\nAs for the new Honda City, it is scheduled for a Q2 introduction here. It has a new platform and new continuously variable transmission (from a five-speed auto previously) but retains its existing 1.5-litre engine.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Underlying net profit, at $884 million, was flat but would have been up 5.9 per cent in constant currency terms.\n\nGroup operating revenue fell 8.9 per cent to $4.16 billion, mostly because of the weaker Australian dollar. Independent of currency fluctuation, operating revenue was still down 2.7 per cent. This remained Australia's fault as Optus's mobile revenue took a hit, falling 6.2 per cent to A$1.34 billion (S$1.55 billion) on lower equipment sales and a mandated reduction in the mobile termination rate.\n\nAs a whole, Optus saw operating revenue fall 5.4 per cent to A$2.12 billion for the quarter, but Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) grew 15.1 per cent to A$644 million on \"improved cost structure\".\n\nFor the half-year ended Sept 30, SingTel's group net profit was up 3.8 per cent at $1.88 billion despite a 7.1 per cent drop in operating revenue to $8.46 billion. The bottom line was bolstered by a net exceptional gain of $101 million.\n\nSingTel's mobile customer base in Singapore grew by 84,000 over the quarter ended Sept 30, taking the total to 3.93 million. Mobile revenue stood at $516 million, up 7.3 per cent year on year.\n\nMonthly average revenue per user (Arpu) on the postpaid front stood at $79 for the quarter, one per cent lower. Excluding data-only SIMs, however, Arpu would have increased 2 per cent.\n\nMio TV's residential subscriber base stood at 414,000 - an increase of 8,000 customers over the quarter.\n\nThese 414,000 customers include 8,000 who are on rival StarHub's platform, but are counted as mio TV subscribers by virtue of their subscribing to English Premier League (EPL) content from mio TV through the cross-carriage arrangement.\n\nOf these 8,000, 5,000 are new customers and 3,000 were on the mio TV platform before the EPL season and are now on StarHub's.\n\nSingTel said yesterday that the exposure to the new customers \"presents us with a great opportunity to pipe in mio TV content during commercial breaks\", and that the impact from cross-carriage \"is not significant\".\n\nMio TV's monthly Arpu for the quarter stood at $29, up from $22 in the corresponding quarter a year ago.\n\nIn local currency terms, Indonesia's Telkomsel stood out with growth in its pre-tax profit for SingTel, with a 2 per cent gain year on year.\n\nThailand's AIS posted pre-tax profit in local currency terms that was down 6 per cent for the quarter on higher network expenses for 3G expansion, while Airtel's contribution - down 8 per cent - suffered from network and spectrum expenses.\n\nOperating revenue from the group's digital division grew 44 per cent to $42 million, driven mostly by mobile ad unit Amobee. Even so, the division's loss widened from a negative Ebitda of $31 million for Q2 last year to $40 million.\n\nAllen Lew, SingTel chief executive officer of group digital life, said that these results were to be expected given the \"start-up\" nature of the division.\n\nSingTel will continue to focus on differentiating Amobee from its competitors, he added.\n\nSingTel's counter closed three cents higher at $3.79 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/no-waiter-please-weve-e-menu", "site_title": "No waiter, please! We've the e-menu", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nNo waiter, please! We've the e-menu\n\nDeveloped by local tech firms, these automated systems not only help ease manpower crunch at eateries but also eliminate the chances of errors in orders, reports RACHEL LOI\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 14, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nBLACK-FACED waiters, disputes over wrong orders and maybe even service charge could all be a thing of the past if the food and beverage industry here decides to go down the automated route.\n\nIt could also solve the manpower crunch that's crippling eateries all over Singapore, with more eateries turning to solutions such as iPad menus and iPhone apps developed by local technology companies to run their operations.\n\nOne of the frontrunners in the business is 10-year-old local company Aptsys Technology Solutions Pte Ltd. Three years ago, it developed its iPad e-menu as well as an iPod touch system that waiters can use to send orders directly to the kitchen instead of having to key it into a separate point-of-sale terminal.\n\nRestaurants simply have to provide their own iPads, and Aptsys will install its customised menu into them. Customers can then browse at their own leisure and place orders without the hassle of flagging a flustered waiter. Using a solution like this also means restaurants no longer have to reprint their entire menu every time they come up with a new dish.\n\nRemoving bottleneck\n\nSays Aptsys founder Ernest Lim: \"This app removes the bottleneck in the entire workflow of the restaurant operation, and hence greatly increases productivity. Waiters can concentrate on serving food and presenting the bill, and customers can now get service easily with just a tap on the iPad.\"\n\nHis e-menu system took about half a year of research and development (R&D) before he could release it into the market, and restaurants can now purchase the app off-the-shelf for a minimum of $28,000 for their first outlet.\n\nThis initial fee covers customisation, installation, as well as commission. Each iPad then costs $1 a day to run, and that is capped at $10 a day per outlet, to cover the service charge incurred when the restaurant needs help with any technical issues such as the adding and removing of items from the menu.\n\nThis bodes well especially for European restaurant Napoleon, which carries 32 different wines that change every one or two weeks as part of their restaurant concept. \"I cannot afford to always be printing a wine list, so this way I can avoid the printing cost,\" says Jean-Christophe Cadoret, one of Napoleon's owners.\n\nThe Aptsys iPad menu has also caught the eye of many other establishments. Currently, over 40 restaurants in Singapore are installed with one of Aptsys's systems, and the number of requests has been rising.\n\nSo much so that Mr Lim has his own manpower issues and can install only about three or four systems a week for now. This is because each process can take up to two months depending on the clients' demands. New applicants would now have to join a three-month waiting list.\n\nMr Lim foresees that about 80 per cent of local sit-down restaurants will eventually have to introduce an e-menu system in order to cope with the lack of manpower and high wages.\n\nIn response to the growing demand for such system, a new start-up company, BigSpoon, is also developing its own e-solution. Fronted by two graduating students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) who managed to get a $10,000 grant from the NUS Innovation and Entrepreneurship Practicum Grant to help kick-start their project, BigSpoon's app shares some similarities with the one Aptsys offers but it also includes additional functions such as the ability to get a waiter's attention.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that restaurants do not have to get iPads to install the e-menus, as it will be downloadable for customers to carry around on their own smartphones.\n\nThink of it as a personal virtual waiter that you can take to any restaurant that subscribes to the service - one that even knows your favourite dishes as well as your allergies. Their app is still in the making, and will be released to the public only after January next year when initial tests with selected restaurants are complete.\n\nTo develop such an elaborate programme is not cheap, however. BigSpoon co-founder Jay Teo reveals that most of the NUS grant has already been used up just to develop this first version of the app and he is mentally prepared to eventually dig into his own pocket for more R&D.\n\n\"We are just at the beginning of changing the delivery of dining services to consumers. The demand for better service will always be there, and to meet these demands, the right tools are required,\" says Mr Teo.\n\n\"To some, it may seem impersonal to interact with a mobile device as opposed to a human. But one of our survey respondents said they would be fine ordering on a device if it knows them better and has more timely service than a human,\" he adds.\n\nBut some restaurant owners see things a little differently and feel a personal touch is still important.\n\nThe Lo & Behold Group's chief operations officer Andrew Ing, who has equipped three outlets with the Aptsys iPod Touch system, says: \"I hated the idea of e-menus at first because I thought where is the interaction between the server and the guest? That's still very important. So I was not keen on iPad e-menus but I thought the Aptsys iPod Touch system was much more efficient and it allows servers more time to interact with guests.\"\n\nGuests impressed\n\nWith the system, customers still use hardcopy menus but waiters punch orders onto their iPod Touches instead of walking back and forth from the POS system. It has also allowed Mr Ing to cut manpower at the rooftop bar Loof, from about 14 staff on a Friday to about 10 or 11, making his investment a worthwhile one.\n\n\"Technology is cheaper now. An iPod Touch is only about $100 each, and of course there's investment in software and programming but that is almost a one-off cost,\" he explains.\n\nAccording to Mr Ing, the system impresses guests with how the company is moving forward with technology. Sometimes there's just a \"mental block\" that needs to be gotten over, he says.\n\nSharing his view is Shaun Markus Lee, owner of Thai barbecue restaurant Moojaa and founder of the mobile dining app Alfred, which is similar to BigSpoon's. His app will be launched next month but it is already in use at Moojaa.\n\n\"So far, using the system has cut my manpower by two,\" says Mr Lee. \"It's between the devil and the deep blue sea, really. Because as much as restaurants might want to keep the human element . . . when it comes to a point where they can't find people to hire, they won't have much of a choice.\"\n\nAs for Timbre Group's establishments, they have an iPad e-menu installed at almost every table of their four biggest and most bustling outlets.\n\nManaging director Edward Chia expresses surprise when customers in their 50s embraced the idea of an e-menu. \"We are lucky because our customers are generally working executives, so they are more tech-savvy. But from time to time, of course, you do get people who still prefer the traditional method for the human touch,\" he says.\n\nTimbre has also digitalised another aspect of their dining experience - feedback it gets from its diners. Using an e-feedback app called triibe, they see between 50 and 100 feedback comments from each of its outlets every fortnight.\n\nUnlike the apps by Aptsys and BigSpoon, triibe is more consumer-driven. Established last year, it attracts diners to give feedback by offering rewards like a $10 voucher for their next visit.\n\nThe app costs between $65 and $130 per month per location depending on what features clients want - such as a consolidated bi-weekly report of the feedback so clients can evaluate their own service performance levels.\n\nAnother specialised app is Ticktok - the brainchild of three Singapore Management University (SMU) graduates who love to eat but hate to wait. It was funded by the Spring Singapore Young Entrepreneurs Scheme for Startups (YES! Starups) grant, which gives young entrepreneurs up to $50,000 to start their own business.\n\nWhat they do is provide busy eateries such as Saveur, Grub, and Wild Honey an automated queuing system where customers just have to key their phone number onto an iPad placed at the door, and they will receive an automated phone call once their table is ready.\n\nSays co-founder Chong Zi Xin: \"Instead of standing aimlessly in front of a restaurant, customers can move around and do some shopping even. And restaurants increase manpower productivity as manual calling processes have become automated. The host can easily call customers with a single tap.\"\n\nBut even with the wide array of digital options in the market, it seems there are still restaurants that are hesitant to jump on the e-solutions bandwagon.\n\nNapoleon's Mr Caboret, for instance, does not intend to subscribe to any of the other technologies even if he expands his business.\n\n\"For the moment the e-menu is enough. We don't want too much technology here as well. Though I am thinking of opening a second outlet, and will definitely keep the e-menu because it's very efficient. But the thing is you cannot survive on just iPads. You still need people because that's still very important,\" he says.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Even so, he vowed that SingTel would \"come up with something that is just as good\", stressing that this was part-and-parcel of coming up with new services.\n\nIt is unclear if this next product will land in WhatsApp territory again, but the telco had ambitions for the mobile messaging space for the best part of the year. LoopMe, an app that allowed free messaging and calling, was slated for launch in August before SingTel scrapped it.\n\nSpeaking at SingTel's quarterly earnings briefing yesterday, Mr Lew said LoopMe had been a stab at creating a superior alternative to other mobile messaging apps in the market. \"We had a partnership with a company based in Israel to do this; it didn't quite work out,\" he added.\n\nLoopMe was developed by New York Stock Exchange-listed Amdocs, which has its roots in Israel. In July, T-Jat - an Israeli start-up that had also worked on LoopMe - accused Amdocs of copyright infringement and breach of a licensing agreement involving the app. This legal dispute - which Amdocs called \"groundless\" - eventually went into arbitration, a process which does not involve SingTel.\n\nCourt documents filed by Amdocs last Tuesday claimed that SingTel had postponed the commercial launch of LoopMe as a result of T-Jat's initiation of the lawsuit. Amdocs also alleged that last month, its supply contract with SingTel was terminated and the launch of LoopMe cancelled altogether after the telco became \"concerned by the allegations\".\n\n\"Despite many months of development, and millions of dollars invested in the LoopMe app by Amdocs (and SingTel), LoopMe has been terminated because of T-Jat's litigations,\" Amdocs told the court.\n\nYesterday, SingTel's Mr Lew said: \"At the end of the day, we're still determined to come up with something that will make a difference and will allow us to continue to engage our customers in what is a core part of our business.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on when this new product would be released, but said SingTel was \"working internally to overcome the setback from LoopMe\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Last year, China and South-east Asia saw US$400 billion in trade between them. By 2020, China and Asean have committed to increase trade volume to US$1 trillion.\n\nMr Lian said that Chinese companies played a central role in trade activities in South-east Asia, particularly in the oil and gas, real estate, food and beverage, and telecommunications sectors. \"Chinese companies are increasingly looking to South-east Asia to fuel their next stage of growth.\"\n\nInitially, the \"going out\" strategy of Chinese companies focused on securing natural resources, he said. \"We are now seeing a new phase of growth arising from the opportunities that South-east Asia offers. The focus has since shifted to catering to the region's rising middle class through offering goods and services or building and infrastructure projects.\"\n\nUOB is aiming for double-digit growth from its China business over the next five years, he said. Annual revenue from China had trebled in the last five years. Over the same period, UOB's headcount has grown four-fold from 236 employees to almost 1,000. Last year, operating profit grew 115.6 per cent to 282.2 million yuan (S$57.8 million).\n\nTo help state-owned enterprises and private companies enter and expand into South-east Asia, UOB set up a Foreign Direct Investment Advisory Unit in China this year. The unit provides assistance ranging from company incorporation to borderless financial services through the bank's regional network.\n\nUOB also said that one of its strategies was to focus on providing banking services to China's growing wealthy segment. The latest sub-branch, which is on the Bund in Shanghai, will provide wealth management advisory to Chinese clients, it said.\n\nSeparately, DBS Bank yesterday opened its renovated representative office in Myanmar to better serve its customers investing in the country. In 2011, bilateral trade between Singapore and Myanmar reached $1.8 billion. Singapore is Myanmar's sixth-largest investor, with cumulative foreign direct investments of $4.4 billion at the end of 2011. Singapore is also Myanmar's third-largest trading partner, after China and Thailand.\n\nThe new office, in Yangon's business district, marks DBS's next phase of growth in Myanmar, where the bank has been present since 1993, the bank said in a statement.\n\n\"This move underscores DBS's continued execution against strategy to grow its presence in Asia and strengthen its banking franchise in the region,\" the bank said.\n\n\"Most of the business activity we are seeing is in trade finance,\" said Chan Weng Meng, DBS Yangon representative office chief. \"We have seen a significant increase in enquiries from our customers for trade finance - double the amount over the last 12 months.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It puts a hilarious twist on popular fairy tales, adding Singlish jokes, topical issues and a very light touch of racy humour for good measure.\n\nIn the case of Jack & the Bean-Sprout!, the 200-year-old fairytale has been duly given a local spin: Jack is recast as a humble boy living in a HDB flat with his beer-promoter mother.\n\nJack's mother, however, loves to gamble away her money at the casinos.\n\nOut of desperation, Jack trades their cow for a bag of \"dream beans\" with the karung guni man. When his mother finds out, she is furious and throws away the beans in the field next to Marina Bay Sands. Overnight, a massive bean sprout grows out of the soil and into the sky, where giants live and gooses lay golden eggs.\n\nIf the localised tale sounds vaguely familiar, it's because Wild Rice had already staged a version of it in 2006 written by Desmond Sim.\n\nA new version, however, has been penned by young playwright Joel Tan, who has also thrown out the original songs and written new ones. \"The new songs are more Broadway and showtune-y, unlike previous Wild Rice pantomimes that used a lot of pop songs and chart-topping hits,\" says Tan.\n\nShowtunes are, of course, the perfect vehicle for lead actor Goh - he spent the past decade perfecting his musical theatre skills: first as a masters student in musical theatre at the San Diego State University, then as a teacher of musical theatre and dance to kids aged nine to 12 at the La Jolla Country Day School, where he also served as the Glee Club director. Now, Goh is completing his PhD at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, while teaching at various tertiary institutions. His dissertation investigates the dearth of Asian-specific roles on Broadway.\n\nIf Goh's presence guarantees the music hitting some high notes, the casting of comedians Darius Tan cross-dressing as the mother, Siti Khalijah as the goose that lays golden eggs, and Karen Tan as the \"golden hits harp\" guarantees some big laughs.\n\nDarius Tan says: \"I get to wear about 5,001 costumes - really. Because as the mother, at first I'm this poor beer-promoter auntie. But when my son gets rich from stealing the giant's gold, I become this ultra tai tai with big hair and different dresses everytime I enter the stage.\n\n\"Wild Rice pantomimes have a long tradition of men wearing womens' clothes - Ivan Heng, Sebastian Tan, Jonathan Lim ... But I dare say I'm the prettiest of them all.\"\n\nJack & the Bean-Sprout! plays at the Drama Centre from Nov 21 to Dec 14. Tue - Fri: 7.30pm, Sat and Sun: 2.30pm and 7.30pm. Tickets from $45 to $75 from Sistic. Wild Rice is also participating in #GivingTuesdaySG, where members of the public are encouraged to donate so that the less-privileged can watch the pantomime.

Debbie Yong looks at a journalists' bar, a cat cafe and two eateries specialising in ribs and wings that are offering fresh dining experiences with their esoteric concepts\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 15, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nScoop\n\n19 Ann Siang Hill\n\nTel 6536 2308\n\nHours: 5pm to midnight (Mon-Sat)\n\nwww.facebook.com/theinsidescoop.sg\n\nOpens Nov 20\n\nTHE notion of journalists as beery misfits who lurk in questionable drinking establishments while awaiting their next juicy scoop is rather the stuff of Hollywood imaginings and Hunter S Thompson novels than reality in Singapore; but that isn't stopping F&B entrepreneurs Patrick Fok and Kevin Cheng from starting up a journalists' bar here.\n\nScoop, which opens on Wednesday, takes over the Ann Siang Hill shophouse formerly occupied by apparel store Fred Perry and takes a leaf from the \"flacks and hacks\" bars - slang for public relations people and news scribes respectively - common in Europe and the United States.\n\n\"PR people are always looking to meet journalists, and journalists are always looking for the inside stories to things, and everyone can swap updates on the latest job vacancies in the industry,\" says Mr Fok, 33. But contrary to its main theme, the bar won't be exclusive to media folk. \"You go to any Foreign Correspondents Club in most cities and it's packed with all sorts. Everyone likes to meet with journalists,\" he laughs.\n\nMr Fok himself holds a day-job as a television news presenter. He and Mr Cheng, 32, also own a cluster of F&B outlets such as Bartini, 1980s-themed eatery The Retrospective, and month-old Mexican bar Hombre Cantina in Boat Quay.\n\nWhile the concept of a journalists' bar isn't entirely new to Singapore - an older generation of newshounds may recall the now-defunct Front Page, Next Page and Newsroom pubs in Mohamed Sultan Road started by BT journalist-turned- nightlife tycoon Peter Wong in the 1990s - both Mr Fok and Mr Cheng are recent Hong Kong transplants who say they are starting on a clean slate.\n\nSo expect, perhaps, a more sanitised, circa 2013 iteration at Scoop. The 1,600 square foot bar will screen news and sports programmes from its two televisions all day and serve up comfort food and popular dishes from its other outlets such as burgers, pizza and a mac-and-cheese dish flavoured with truffle paste. All food items will cost under $20 and beers will start from $10, and media professionals will get one-for-one deals on Wednesdays.\n\nIn keeping with the theme, the two men - both printmaking enthusiasts - plan to plug in screen-printing classes when the bar is closed in the afternoons. Attendees can later display and sell their works at Scoop, which will feature distressed concrete interiors accented with newspaper reliefs. A 10m bar counter will span the length of the space.\n\nA small lounge area by the bar's entrance can double as a quiet spot for broadcast journalists to conduct video interviews - something Mr Fok himself has found lacking in his own job.\n\n\"Sometimes, we'll have interviewees from abroad or who have unpresentable offices and don't want to be filmed in them,\" he observes. He has often ended up using other bars and his own establishments as a venue for his interviews. The bar's lamps can double as studio lights, he says.\n\nFancy yourself a bit of a whistleblower? You now know where to hang out and whisper a little too loudly. \"It would be nice to get a scandal out of Scoop,\" quips Mr Fok.\n\nNeko no Niwa\n\n54A Boat Quay\n\nwww.catcafe.com.sg\n\nOpens end Nov\n\nTHE cat cafe phenomenon that originated in Taiwan and sparked a craze in Japan and the rest of the world will soon be upon our shores for the first time.\n\nWhen it opens on the second floor of a Boat Quay shophouse at the end of this month, Neko no Niwa - which means \"cat garden\" in Japanese - will be home to 10 cats, which cafe patrons can play with as they sip their java and take in views of the Singapore River.\n\nCafe owner Tan Sue Lynn, 36, is a cat lover who has visited cat cafes in Tokyo, Osaka, Naoshima and Sapporo in Japan. Says the former marketing executive of an asset management company: \"It has always puzzled me why there isn't a cat cafe in Singapore even though they have been getting a lot of hype recently.\"\n\nPreviously a North Asian preoccupation, cat cafes have sprouted to instant popularity in European cities such as Vienna, Budapest, Madrid, Berlin and London over the last year. Le Cafe des Chats in Paris, for instance, is an entirely crowd-funded project and was fully booked for two months when it first opened in September.\n\n\"Cat cafes are great for people who enjoy interacting with cats and would like to have one at home but can't for whatever reason, whether it's because someone in the family is allergic to cats, or because their parents feel they are too young to be a responsible pet owner,\" says Ms Tan.\n\nBut unlike some cat cafes overseas, Neko no Niwa won't be about showcasing rare cat pedigrees. Ms Tan is working with local animal welfare organisations and independent cat fosterers to adopt the 10 abandoned or stray felines that will permanently reside in the cafe.\n\n\"Part of our social message is to discourage unethical breeding, and show that even cats that are not pedigrees can make just as lovely companions,\" she says. The cats will most likely range from one to four years in age, but will be chosen for their ability to interact with humans and other cats rather than for their age.\n\nThe cafe will seat about 20 to 25 people in a homely space fitted out with sofas, dining tables and scratching poles for the cats. The cats will be free to roam in the 500 sq ft space and will reside there overnight, while the rest of the cafe's pantry and toilet premises will be cordoned off from the animals.\n\nAccess to the cafe will be charged at $12 per person per hour - following the business model of overseas cat cafes, says Ms Tan - and patrons will have to remove their footwear and wash their hands before entering. Food orders are optional and no cooking will be done on-site: only coffee, canned drinks and covered desserts sourced from independent local pastry shops will be served, with prices kept under $5.\n\nThere will also be a small retail corner selling cat accessories, and Ms Tan is working with local designers to introduce cat toy crochet classes in the future.\n\n\"The concept is so new here that there are already some misconceptions about what a cat cafe is about,\" observes Ms Tan. Unlike existing pet cafes in Singapore, where humans can bring in their pets to dine next to them, you won't be able to bring your own cats to Neko no Niwa, nor will the cafe's cats be up for sale or for adoption.\n\nAlluding to the cafe as an educational platform, she elaborates: \"If you are not sure about cat ownership, you can spend more time at the cafe before deciding to take the plunge into cat ownership. And when you do, we can link you up with organisations such as the Cat Welfare Society for guidance on taking care of your cat.\"\n\nRibbery and Wine Co\n\n#01-04, Sixth Avenue Centre,\n\n805 Bukit Timah Road\n\nTel 6463 2830\n\nSO what if the nose-to-tail dining concept is winning over adventurous eaters and environmentalists worldwide? There are some among us who already know which part of an animal we love best, and don't want to spend five minutes winnowing through a menu to get to it.\n\nEnter the Ribbery and Wine Co, a ribs specialist opened by a ribs lover for ribs lovers. Affectionately referred to as RAWC, the two-storey 80-seater eatery in Bukit Timah offers beef, lamb and pork ribs in 12 exciting variants, from lamb ribs braised in Italian Marsala wine, to beef ribs barbecued with Texan barbecue sauce and pork ribs glazed in Marmite.\n\nUninspired name aside - the restaurant has no links to Bayern Munich midfielder Franck Ribery either - the ribs here are actually very good. The five-spiced lamb ribs ($30) are first rubbed with a house blend of five spices before being roasted, resulting in fall-off-the-bone tender meat with a heady, herbal aroma that renders the accompanying dish of mint sauce quite unnecessary. If you don't want to dirty your fingers, order the beef short ribs braised in Shiraz ($32); the slightest prod of a fork is all it needs to separate the meat.\n\nNot one to discriminate against non-ribs lovers who get towed in reluctantly by rib-obsessed friends and family, there's also a small selection of ribs-free mains such as baked chicken or barramundi and sirloin steaks, along with a fairly large section of starters such as calamari, chicken nuggets and cheese and sausage platters.\n\nFood aside, the eatery also doubles as a bottle shop for the neighbourhood's residents, as Malaysian founder, Wong Yin How, also runs the Vintry group of wine shops in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, as well as eight-year-old rib joint, Ribs, also in the latter city. Prices for the mix of Old and New World wines start at an affordable $28 per bottle and go up to $3,000 for the higher-end labels that can be transferred over on request from the Vintry outlet in Clarke Quay.\n\nLike a truly competitive Singaporean, the group's local executive chef Wayne Chan adds that the aim of his game is to have the largest selection of ribs in Singapore.\n\n\"Tony Roma's has about eight or nine types of ribs, and we have 12, so we have a buffer. If they come up with more, at least, we will still be ahead,\" he jokes.\n\nStill, he acknowledges that it will be hard to carve a niche for themselves with such a specialised concept. \"Tony Roma's is already a household name that everyone knows but we have to slowly build a name for ourselves.\"\n\n\"It can go both ways, if you go too niche then nobody wants to come, but if you offer something too generic that can be found everywhere, then no one will bother either,\" says Mr Chan. Though no further Singapore expansion is in the works, the group is planning a new concept in Malaysia next year.\n\nWings World\n\n214 East Coast Road Tel 6247 7477\n\nHours: 11am-11pm daily\n\nYOU know the old wisdom when it comes to picking hawker stalls? The one that says the stall that specialises in Hokkien mee will serve a far better version than the one that sells Hokkien mee, carrot cake and char kway teow all at once?\n\nThe same reasoning lies behind the founding of Wings World, a casual eatery along restaurant-mobbed East Coast Road that serves only, well, wings.\n\nInspired by the ferocious hunger for chicken wings in the United States - more than 1.23 billion chicken wings are consumed in the US during Super Bowl weekend alone - the casual 40-seater is Taiwan-born, US-raised Jimmy Hsiao's homage to them in Singapore.\n\nCiting the popularity of other chicken-centric American fast-food chains such as 4Fingers and Kentucky Fried Chicken here, he adds: \"Once considered just a snack, chicken wings are gradually being treated as a meal. You're starting to see wings everywhere in Singapore, even in places that they aren't traditionally in, like Japanese restaurants and even Ikea.\"\n\nPriced somewhere between a fast food joint and a proper restaurant, Wings World serves up wings that can be customised according to your preference. You order them in servings of six ($5.75) or 10 ($8.95) - or in party platters of 50 and 100 - and you can opt for either just winglets, drumlets, or a mix of both. Top them off with your choice from over 13 different dry seasonings and sauces, including barbecue sauces spiced with imported American chillies such as chipotle and jalapeno.\n\nTheir signature buffalo sauce comes with four levels of heat, while the mango habanero is a familiar tangy, tropical flavour with just the right amount of chilli kick. Not a fan of smothering your wings in sauce? The citrus pepper and Italian herb dry-rubs keep things fragrant and super-crispy. The wings are cooked by the double-fry method, that is, they are first fried at low temperature and again at a high temperature to cause a \"blistering effect\" that creates shatteringly crisp chicken skin, Mr Hsiao explains. Sides such as vegetable sticks with blue cheese dip and fries, coleslaw and potato salad provide a carbohydrate boost, and should you tire of wings, there's also a range of wraps made with chicken breast meat tinged with the same array of sauces.\n\nWings World - named after Mr Hsiao's favourite American comedy, Wayne's World - is also the the F&B veteran's return to the restaurant industry in Singapore. The 46-year-old previously ran a trio of eateries under the California brand and Bobby Rubino's restaurant at Chijmes, which he sold when he left for the US in 2006. He returned to Singapore four years later as an F&B consultant and was drawn back into the front end of things again this year. He hopes to open a second outlet by the middle of next year, and sees regional expansion on the cards.\n\n\"Too many restaurants are being bogged down by high rent and labour costs, and also high food costs from trying to offer too much variety,\" says Mr Hsiao. \"It's all about streamlining to keep your service and operations consistent. We're not a chef-centric restaurant and we'll only expand our food menu if it doesn't take away from our main product, so all these savings can be eventually passed on to the consumer.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's a global hub now and Dubai did this by buying planes and constantly renewing its fleet,\" said John Sfakianakis, chief investment strategist at Riyadh-based asset management firm Masic.\n\n\"Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia are also investing billions in aviation to be able to connect to the world. These states have to continue to invest if they want to expand.\"\n\nAfter playing cat and mouse with rival Airbus in the market for big twin-engined jets, industry sources say that Boeing is expected to launch the 777X on Sunday with the record Emirates deal and 25 jets for Abu Dhabi's Etihad.\n\nDepending on final negotiations, Boeing could also announce orders for dozens of 777X jets from Qatar Airways and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific during the Middle East's largest business event, which runs from Nov 17 to 21.\n\nThe 777X launch is expected to include confirmation of a tentative 34-plane order from Germany's Lufthansa.\n\nWhether Boeing can reach around 250 launch orders depends partly on uncertainty over whether it can close a potential deal for around 20 777X with Cathay, but the new plane is heading for a haul of above 200 orders, industry experts said.\n\nLeading Gulf airlines have made Boeing's long-distance 777 warhorse and other big jets a spur for growth as they redraw the world's aviation and logistics map around the Gulf.\n\nThe revamped 777X is the largest twinjet yet designed and will come in two versions, seating 350 to 406 people. It is Boeing's response to the Airbus A350-1000, which will seat 350 in three classes or about 380 people in two classes.\n\nThe US company hopes the airshow will also mark a turning point for the 787 Dreamliner after its temporary grounding this year because of melting batteries. Industry sources expect orders to top 1,000 in Dubai as Etihad buys a further 30, while Airbus is in negotiations to sell competing models of its A350.\n\nThe latest medium-haul aircraft will also be in focus as low-cost airline Flydubai places a US$7.8 billion order for 75 of the revamped Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus negotiates to sell A320neos to airlines that may include Etihad, industry sources said.\n\nQatar Airways, which has complained about the reliability of its 787s, has said it may buy more Airbus A330s.\n\nBut Airbus, which outsold Boeing in the first nine months of the year, will be looking to end a dearth of orders this year for its A380, the world's largest airliner.\n\nDoric Lease Corp aims to firm up an order for 20 of the superjumbos \"soon\", its top executive said last month.\n\nThe European company cooperates closely with the largest A380 customer Emirates, which has consistently said it could buy up to 30 more of the aircraft once it unlocks extra capacity in its network to handle the double-decker jets. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Aussie pop princess Lenka, whose full name is Lenka Kripac and who will be performing here at the end of the month, does the same on her latest album Shadows.\n\nWritten while she was pregnant with her son - who's now 20 months old and could be heard trying to get his mummy's attention in the background while she was on the phone from Sydney earlier this week - it marks a departure from the head-bopping pop songs of her first two albums.\n\n\"I was supposed to take a break and have a baby, not make an album, but I was still writing songs because it's quite a nice thing to be writing songs for your baby,\" chuckles the 35-year-old.\n\nCalling Shadows her \"motherhood album\", she compares the slower-paced songs to lullabies but added that there are also darker moments as the reality of becoming a parent hit home.\n\n\"I let myself go to places I've never been before which my pregnancy brought about,\" explains Lenka, who studied acting under Cate Blanchett when she was a teenager and has starred in various Australian television dramas and movies.\n\n\"Things got heavier; for example, I've never written a song about death but it felt like the right time to do it here as life was starting to get more serious (with motherhood).\"\n\nBesides writing the songs for her son, Shadows became a family affair in more ways than one because it features the artwork of her visual artist husband James Gulliver Hancock.\n\nIt also finds her reuniting with a former bandmate from Decoder Ring, the Australian electronic rock group that she started out with before she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a solo career.\n\nLenka's jaunty pop songs have graced numerous film and television soundtracks as well as commercials.\n\nFor instance, her debut single and biggest hit to date, The Show, from her eponymous 2008 debut album, has been used to sell clothes, insurance and phone services all over the world.\n\nShe said that there's a chance she could return to familiar grounds on her next album now that her son is becoming a bundle of energy at his age.\n\n\"I'm beginning to write poppier songs again because he wants rhythm and also just watching him explore the world and growing up is so inspiring,\" Lenka reveals.\n\nHer upcoming gig in Singapore - her third and biggest to date - will be her final major show for this year. It will be the first time that local fans will be hearing songs from Shadows.\n\n\"It will be quite quiet and stripped-down acoustic but we also have the older songs which are quite upbeat so there will be a strong dynamic flow,\" she says.\n\n\"I enjoy having three albums to pick songs from and there will be a few cute surprises which I won't say,\" she coos. \"I want to have a nice connection with the audience.\"\n\nLenka plays at the Esplanade Theatres on Nov 26 at 8pm.

Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had predicted 664 million euros in profit. EADS cut its cash-flow outlook.\n\n\"We achieved good improvement in revenues and profitability over the first nine months thanks largely to our civil aircraft business\" CEO Tom Enders said. Airbus, which contributes more than two-thirds of revenue and the majority of profit, delivered 504 planes through the end of October.\n\nEADS lifted the year-end delivery goal to 620 planes from \"more than 600\". It generated 1,215 net orders in the first 10 months, surpassing a goal of 1,200, and will probably attract further deals at Dubai Airshow starting on Nov 17.\n\nEADS revised its free cash flow guidance for the end of 2013 to negative 1.5 billion euros from breakeven, saying it is incurring higher development costs and feeling the impact from government budget constraints.\n\nAirbus contributed 409 million euros to earnings, up from 281 million euros a year earlier as its sales rose 15 per cent to 9.85 billion euros. It maintained its outlook for Ebit before one-time items of 3.5 billion euros and earnings per share of about 2.50 euros, prior to a share buyback.\n\nEADS will change its name to Airbus after January to benefit from the prominence of that brand in aerospace, and will combine its defence and space businesses into one unit. That move is designed to help the company present its military and space products in international markets and tackle costs.\n\nCosts associated with the change will be reviewed in the fourth quarter, EADS said.

The multi-talented Doucette, meanwhile, whom Thomas affectionately referred to as \"The Reverend\", alternated between the drums and rhythmic guitar and stole the limelight at several points with his spritely contributions, particularly during an extended blues jam.\n\nCounter to any criticism of Matchbox Twenty as an ageing band from a music era past, Cook - in keeping with the social media-obsessed times that we currently live in - ran forward to tweet a picture of the 5,000-strong crowd from his mobile phone as the band stood for its final applause. Thomas then apologised for taking so long to come.\n\nOh, not at all, Matchbox Twenty, it was worth every minute of the wait.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It marked a fourth straight quarter of growth, the best run that the world's third-largest economy has had in three years.\n\nFinance Minister Taro Aso indicated that the government will not rule out foreign exchange market intervention to prevent shifts in the yen rate from derailing economic recovery.\n\nHis remarks in Parliament yesterday pushed the yen down to close to 100 to the US dollar, which many Japanese exporters see as a level that will help maintain export competitiveness and encourage business investment.\n\nExports weakened in Q3 as large capital outflows from South-east Asia dented growth, though economists expect export levels to improve going into next year as overseas economies stabilise.\n\nThe success of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's \"Abenomics\" this year has hinged mainly on aggressive monetary easing by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), which has had the effect of weakening the yen. But a senior BOJ official said yesterday that it was not the object of monetary policy to influence the exchange rate.\n\nMr Aso indicated that the government is ready to assume this role, if needed. Japan no longer faces criticism from other major economies that its \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies are aimed at intentionally weakening the yen and giving exporters a trading advantage, he said.\n\nHe added that as with any other country, Japan needs to ensure that it retains the currency intervention option as a policy tool and be ready to take action when markets are excessively volatile, Reuters reported.\n\nHis comments pushed the yen down to a two-month low against the US dollar and at the same time buoyed Tokyo stock prices, with the Nikkei 225 stock average rising 309.25 points or 2.1 per cent to 14,876.41.\n\nGrowth is expected to accelerate in Q4 on the back of government stimulus and improved external demand in China and elsewhere.\n\n\"Economic growth is expected to accelerate in the final quarter of this year. Despite the soft headline figure today, there's no need to be pessimistic about the outlook,\" Reuters quoted Junko Nishioka, chief economist at RBS Securities, as saying.\n\n\"The government's stimulus package is likely to help boost capital expenditure. The ball is in the government's court so I don't think the Bank of Japan will come under pressure for further monetary easing any time soon.\"\n\nJapan's minister in charge of economic revitalisation, Akira Amari, also said that the economy continued to look up because of firm domestic demand.\n\nMr Amari said that exports will recover in the current quarter as the US economy recovers and uncertainty over the Chinese economy subsides.\n\nDomestic consumption is also expected to accelerate further in the final months of this year as consumers buy in advance of a scheduled increase in the national consumption tax from 5 per cent to 8 per cent from April next year. A tighter labour market and signs of rising wages should also bolster consumer spending in coming quarters, economists said.\n\nHowever, capital expenditure growth slowed to 0.2 per cent in Q3, well below a median estimate of 0.8 per cent, suggesting that companies remain reluctant to deliver the increased investment needed for a sustained recovery.\n\nDomestic capital investment remains the biggest uncertainty but a government stimulus package is expected to boost overall levels of spending, and the government's determination to maintain a steady exchange rate for the yen should also encourage domestic business investment, economists say.\n\nMeanwhile, the results of a Reuters survey published yesterday showed that confidence levels among Japanese firms rose for the first time in three months in November, and is expected to improve further over the coming three months.\n\nRevised official data published yesterday also showed that Japan's industrial output rose 1.3 per cent in September from the previous month. Though slightly less than the initial reading, it confirmed ongoing economic recovery.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The property group said this yesterday as it posted a 76.7 per cent slide in third-quarter net profit to $7.3 million due to lower revenue from property development.\n\nThe Metropolis' Tower 2 received Temporary Occupation Permit (TOP) earlier this week while Tower 1 received the same approval in July this year. To date, more than 90 per cent of the space in the development has been pre-committed.\n\nBeyond producing the expected revaluation gain in Ho Bee's next earnings statement, The Metropolis will generate a recurring rental income stream for the group. The process has started to show in Ho Bee's Q3 financial statement, with rental income from Tower 1, as well as from the group's Rose Court office development in London acquired in June this year, helping to boost the group's turnover from property investment for Q3 and the first nine months of 2013 by 200 per cent and 60 per cent to $7.8 million and $13.3 million respectively.\n\nHowever, revenue from property development for Q3 2013 slumped 84 per cent year-on-year to $8.5 million. For the nine-month period too, development revenue was down 69 per cent at $69.9 million from $228.4 million previously. This was chiefly due to higher revenue recognition last year for the One Pemimpin industrial project, when it was completed.\n\nIn all, Ho Bee's revenue from continuing operations slipped 71.1 per cent to $16.3 million for Q3 this year from $56.3 million a year ago.\n\nFor the first nine months, Ho Bee posted net profit of $85.7 million, reflecting a drop of 28.7 per cent.

The Fund conducts such assessments of key financial centres every five years.\n\nIts report on Singapore was released last night.\n\nWhile it found much to praise, it also suggested that Singapore needs to enhance its existing frameworks, further develop its crisis management arrangements, and remain vigilant over credit growth.\n\nThe IMF noted that overall compliance with all supervisory standards - banking, insurance, securities, and financial-market infrastructures, notably for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives - were very high compared with other major financial sectors.\n\nFor example, banks' capital requirements are higher than those established by Basel III, and there is a clear legal framework for capital-market activities.\n\nIt said that crisis management and resolution arrangements are generally strong here - with responsibilities being clearly allocated among several public bodies - with the necessary legal framework in place.\n\nHowever, it added that the resolution framework needs to be reviewed and strengthened, to enhance the operational independence and the efficient resolution of issues by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which oversees the entire financial system.\n\nOne weakness it noted was \"the allocation of certain resolution tools to the minister-in-charge (which) may compromise the operational independence of MAS in resolution matters\".\n\nIt also said that Singapore's arrangements for cooperation in cross-border resolution are broadly in line with international best practice, but that it could enhance these and mitigate legal risks arising from conflicts in laws from different jurisdictions.\n\nThe IMF team also noted that, while Singapore is exposed to a broad array of domestic and global risks - especially in the light of its interconnectedness with other financial centres - its stress tests have found that banks and insurers can manage these risks.\n\n\"This reflects banks' large capital and other cushions, and the decisive macroprudential actions taken by the MAS to address the threat of a bubble in the housing sector.\n\n\"Moreover, the MAS has sought to address potential spillovers from other major financial centres by converting large retail branches operating in the domestic market into domestically incorporated subsidiaries, and by pressing in international fora for greater sharing of supervisory information on global systemically important financial institutions.\n\n\"Looking forward, the analysis suggests the importance of continuing to monitor closely cross-border interbank liabilities, and also of continuing to adjust macroprudential measures in response to domestic housing market conditions,\" it added.\n\nIt noted that bank regulation and supervision is of a high calibre, but that there is room for improvement in some areas.\n\nFor example, even though the stress tests proved that banks' funding gaps appear manageable, the IMF said that liquidity shortages in foreign currency could affect some banks under very adverse conditions, and that the MAS should therefore closely monitor liquidity coverage ratios on an individual foreign currency basis.\n\nThe IMF team also said that \"the structure of the MAS board, which includes several government ministers, was considered by assessors to be potentially inconsistent with full supervisory independence, and consideration should be given to addressing this situation\".\n\nAs for Singapore's capital markets, the IMF team said they do not appear to pose material threats to financial stability. It noted that enforcement is effective, but that shareholder protection - in regard to participation in corporate decision making - could be strengthened to meet standards set by the International Organization of Securities Commissions.\n\nAs for Singapore Exchange's performance, in particular, it noted that \"self-regulation by exchanges remains an integral part of the regulatory framework and is subject to effective supervision\".\n\nThe IMF team also noted that the MAS should continue intensive monitoring of the asset management industry, particularly the operations of hedge funds and prime brokers, in order to minimise reputational risks.\n\nResponding to the assessment, the MAS said in a statement that it will review the recommendations and take appropriate measures.\n\nRavi Menon, its managing director, said: \"The FSAP is a rigorous and comprehensive programme. It provided us the opportunity to be independently benchmarked against international best practices and to evaluate policy actions to address any vulnerabilities in our financial system. The assessment is a testament to the MAS's long tradition of prudent regulation and supervision.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its property segment did not record any revenue for the quarter.\n\nHigher revenue at the engineering and construction segment was helped by contributions from the group's subsidiary UE E&C. This segment also registered substantially higher operating profit before interest because of cost-saving from completed projects. Meanwhile, the property rental and services segment also saw increased rental contributions and higher operating profits.\n\nUE's bottom line was dragged down by losses incurred by WBL's listed technology subsidiary, Multi-Fineline Electronix, as well as lower car sales and lower recognition of property sales by WBL.\n\nUE said that it will continue to work on a number of major property developments in Singapore and China, including orchardgateway mall in Singapore and mixed development Orchard Summer Palace in Shenyang, China.\n\nHowever, the property development segment will continue to have an uneven performance because of lumpy revenue accounting. Property cooling measures in Singapore and China will also impact home buyer sentiment. \"The group . . . will continue to adopt a cautious approach when bidding for new property projects in the next 12 months,\" UE said.\n\nUE said that it remained optimistic about its engineering and construction business because of strong construction demand in Singapore this year.\n\nFor the nine-month period, revenue was up 184 per cent at $1.2 billion and net profit was up 18 per cent at $35.4 million.\n\nTotal assets at end-September stood at $6.3 billion.

Next in line is a reinvention of the fund management industry. In this respect, two major parallel initiatives are underway in terms of the development of a cross-border funds passport, which would facilitate the marketing and distribution of funds across the region. One is an agreement to get a collective investment scheme framework off the ground for the Asean region. The second is an intent to jointly develop an Asian funds passport, involving Singapore, Australia, South Korea and New Zealand.\n\nThere is a third and arguably even more pivotal proposal: that Singapore should re-examine its legal framework for investment funds to encourage more asset managers to choose to domicile their funds here. The stakes are potentially enormous, as wealth burgeons in the region and more of the wealthy choose to book their assets in Singapore. The MAS annual fund management survey at end-2012 reflected total assets under management (AUM) here of about $1.6 trillion, an increase of 21 per cent from the previous year. The five-year average growth rate in AUM is about 9 per cent per annum. The catch is that most of these funds are likely to be domiciled in offshore centres such as Cayman Islands or Luxembourg because of the inflexibility of the existing structures open to funds in Singapore. At the moment, investment funds that want to be domiciled here have to be set up as trusts, limited partnerships or private companies, which fail to cater to the needs of various types of investors.\n\nIn a paper last week, however, PwC has proposed a change of rules to allow funds to be set up under corporatised investment vehicles, such as open-ended investment companies, which offer a number of benefits. Funds in such structures can benefit from tax treaties, for instance, and provide flexibility in terms of share subscriptions and redemptions. The proposal has come none too soon. Hong Kong has started the ball rolling with the intent to create a similar framework and establish itself as a \"world factory\" for asset managers. Creating an integrated ecosystem here for funds can generate business for various support services such as legal and accounting services, and fund administration, further enhancing Singapore's status as a financial hub.\n\nSo far, based on a PwC survey earlier this year, asset managers have given the thumbs-up to such an initiative. Given the pace of economic growth in Asia and the emerging markets, investment allocations into these regions will grow. Singapore already proffers a favourable environment for investors with its strong financial institutions, tax efficiency, and a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework. In the next lap, it should aim to capture an even larger share of fund flows in ways that also benefit the local economy. Enhancing the funds infrastructure to encourage more firms to base their operations here is surely a must.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the exit from palatial houses in ritzy areas was also seen as reflecting the changing nature of diplomacy, with extravagant displays of nationalism deemed inappropriate in a tough economy and greater security needed.\n\n\"Embassies took over grand houses at a time when diplomacy was serving drinks and eyeball-to-eyeball contact which was the way of doing business then,\" Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell, told Reuters. \"Things have changed and nowadays these buildings are not really fit for purpose.\"\n\nThe US kick-started the exodus after announcing in 2006 it was moving from Mayfair.\n\nIt sold its current embassy to Qatari state property firm Qatari Diar for what the Wall Street Journal said was about \u00a3500 million (S$999.3 million) and it will move in 2017 to a site in south-west London. The embassy declined comment on the figure.\n\nUS Ambassador to Britain Matthew Barzun told a groundbreaking ceremony at the site at Nine Elms near Battersea Power Station that the move would help develop that area of London.\n\n\"We're proud to provide an anchor for more businesses and jobs, bringing thousands of new neighbours to fuel economic revitalisation here,\" he said.\n\nThe US will be joined in the development by the Netherlands and possibly China, lured by the high security made possible by building from scratch on a new site and quick access to Westminster, the seat of the British government.\n\nMr Wetherell said that the embassy exit came amid a trend to revert grand houses in elite London areas back from offices into apartments with residential prices at record prices of up to \u00a35,000 per square foot.\n\nHe said that foreign governments were increasingly aware that they were sitting on property goldmines and opting to sell and save costs or not to renew leases and move further afield.\n\nMr Wetherell this year sold the Brazilian embassy in Mayfair for \u00a340 million and almost all diplomatic properties are snapped up for apartments for wealthy Britons or overseas buyers.\n\nThe Wetherell/Diplomat survey found other embassies relocating or looking to move included Nepal, Greece, Lithuania, Belgium, Tajikistan, Kosovo, Turkmenistan, Gambia, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and the Czech Republic.\n\nReal estate agent Savills last month won the contract to sell the Canadian High Commission in Mayfair which is expected to fetch up to \u00a3250 million and could double that value as flats. Bids are due in by the close of this week. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

And it's one that photographer Rodney Smith takes very seriously with regard to his beloved craft. That's why he shoots only with film, mostly in black and white, and wears a look of pride when separating himself from the horrors of Instagram and Photoshop.\n\n\"Although digital is probably a good change for a lot of people, it's not definitive that it's better. All that digital offers don't interest me,\" says the 67-year-old Smith who honed his skills under documentary photographer Walker Evans in the early 1970s.\n\nColour in black and white\n\n\"A teacher of mine once said there's more colour in black and white than there is in colour. Colour is about the surface of things. It's about fashion, style, and has a contemporary look. But it doesn't go to the heart of the matter as far as I'm concerned.\"\n\nSo at his first-ever exhibition in Singapore, titled Surreal Reality, Smith will be showcasing only a careful selection of black and white set of about 20 photos from his portfolio that best represent him as a photographer. He is a regular contributor to Vanity Fair, and his images have also appeared in various other publications including The New York Times Magazine, Departures Magazine and on the covers of Time Magazine.\n\nHis prints at the FOST Gallery are on sale from US$7,000 and up.\n\nSmith recalls one of the first times he ever held a camera was when he was 16 years old and his father gave him a camera to take on a student trip to Mexico. Their train's route was obstructed by an avalanche for a few days, so some local kids came up to the train to sell food and other items to the trapped passengers.\n\nWhen he got home after the trip, instead of bringing home photos taken with his friends like most other students did, he brought home a roll of pictures of these local kids.\n\n\"My dad was not very happy about it,\" says Smith, with a grin. \"That was the first time I noticed I was interested in the things most people weren't interested in.\"\n\nAnd while his heart ultimately still resides with black and white, Smith now shoots in colour about 20 per cent of the time - simply because technological advancements have given him more appealing options when it comes to the type of paper he can print his images on.\n\nHe is much more insistent on shooting with film, however, and easily comes up with a list of nuances about film that he refuses to give up in exchange for the conveniences of digital photography.\n\nFor instance, there is a grainy texture that shows up only in film photos which he likes, and the detailed atmosphere and sense of perspective that he feels all digital equipment can never fully capture.\n\nFilm and vinyl records\n\n\"I have nothing against digital, and I'm sure for the next generation film won't exist. But right now, film is like a vinyl record. Recently there's quite a resurgence of people liking vinyl records over digital and it's the same thing now with film. I think this will give film a small new life,\" he explains.\n\nNot that he is particularly upset that the art of film photography is going the way of the dodo, because \"I'm going extinct too, anyway,\" he jokes.\n\nIn the meantime all Smith is focusing on is trying to produce something timeless, by creating work that people can connect with.\n\n\"I think what most people respond to is sentiment - an emotion being expressed that they can relate to. Because all the same sentiments that existed 100 years ago, exist today. Nothing has changed.\n\n\"And that's what I want. I want people to connect emotionally to my photos. I would like somebody to like my photos, not because I'm well known or somebody else says they're good, but because they feel something inside themselves and have a connection,\" adds Smith.\n\nSurreal Reality runs at the FOST Gallery at Gillman Barracks, on 1 Lock Road till Jan 5. Opening hours are from Tue to Sat, 11am to 7pm and Sun, 11am to 6pm. Admission is free.

London's New Bond Street took fourth place with a 15.6 per cent rise in rent to US$1,047 per square foot.\n\nGlobally, retail rents at prime locations rose on average by 3.2 per cent, with the Americas the strongest region, increasing by 5.8 per cent, according to the review of the top 334 shopping destinations across 64 countries.\n\nRents in the Asia-Pacific rose by 4.5 per cent, led by strong demand in Hong Kong that helped offset the impact of slower trading in China's luxury sector and lower consumer spending in South Korea.\n\nEurope recorded a 2.1 per cent rise, with only seven of the 33 countries surveyed recording rental falls despite challenging markets. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

It supports our plan to secure long-term energy supply at competitive prices to meet the need for clean energy in Asia,\" said group CEO Seah Moon Ming.\n\n\"It is also an important milestone for us as we work to develop an Asian LNG hub,\" he added.\n\nPavilion said that recent major gas discoveries off the shores of Tanzania are set to position the country as a key LNG exporter. Currently owned 60:40 by BG Group and Ophir Energy, the Tanzania Blocks 1, 3 and 4 are estimated to hold about 15 trillion cubic feet of gas in moderate water depths.\n\nThe offshore exploration concessions cover a 28,050 sq km area of the Mafia Deep Offshore Basin and northern portion of the Ruvuma Basin, located in water depths ranging from 100 metres to more than 3,000 metres.\n\nBG Group is the designated operator of the Tanzania concession from which first gas delivery is expected in 2020.\n\nBG is also Singapore's initial LNG aggregator or buyer. Singapore is now starting the process of picking a buyer, even possibly two, for its next batch of long-term LNG supplies, beyond the current volumes imported by BG.\n\nPavilion Energy chairman Mohd Hassan Marican said that \"the natural gas developments in Tanzania hold tremendous potential - not just for Pavilion Energy but for Singapore and Asia\".\n\n\"Pavilion Energy looks forward to the partnership with BG Group and Ophir Energy in realising the LNG project. The LNG from the Tanzanian project will provide another source of supply to the Asian markets,\" he added.\n\nThe investment is subject to regulatory, governmental and other required third party approvals, as well as approval by Ophir's shareholders by way of a general meeting. The transaction is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nPavilion's latest upstream investment follows two LNG supply deals reported by the company last month.\n\nThese comprised a 10-year LNG supply deal for 0.5 million tonnes per annum, estimated to be worth US$500 million annually, and with first LNG deliveries into Singapore and Asia in 2018; and a spot deal with delivery to Asia next February. It has yet to identify the sellers for these.\n\nThe company was set up by Temasek Holdings in April to trade and ship LNG, and also to invest in both LNG upstream assets as well as downstream ones, including regasification terminals.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It's written by Billy Ray and helmed by Paul Greengrass, a director who never met a confined space or close-up he didn't like. He did it with plenty of panache in a couple of Jason Bourne films and he does it here with stomach-churning precision with Richard Phillips, the beleaguered title character who for a few terrifying days in 2009 was at the centre of a ship-jacking storm off the Somali coast.\n\nIt's a story that contains the necessary ingredients for a real-life contemporary thriller - far from the world of super-spies and international intrigue - involving a crew of ordinary workers heading blissfully unaware into danger, a handful of angry, trigger-happy desperadoes and an Everyman who is reluctantly thrust into a heroic situation.\n\nWhen it comes to Everyman movie heroes, they don't come any more convincing than Tom Hanks, an actor who has made a career of representing the ordinary-guy- in-extraordinary-situations with ease and grace and sometimes even humour.\n\nHis knack for projecting decency and Zen-like calm serves him well here, when two very different worlds collide and shatter the workday routine of a ship simply transporting goods to Africa.\n\nThe situation may be mundane to begin with - a captain and crew are tasked with delivering cargo from Oman to Mombasa on the Kenya coast - but things quickly escalate when their route takes them into pirate-infested waters, and into the world inhabited by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), a fisherman hit by hard times and lured by the prospect of big paydays for himself and his warlord bosses.\n\nMuse, smart and memorably gaunt, has precious few resources to launch a pirate attack on a giant target but he's determined to the point of desperation. Meanwhile, Phillips is a capable captain who takes his job seriously. When he perceives a potential threat caused by two approaching skiffs, he does all he can to ward off the danger.\n\nThere's an electrifying moment when the two adversaries first lock eyes through binoculars and Phillips realises he's about to face the greatest challenge of his career.\n\nThe movie has the look and feel of a taut and well-structured thriller, a rollercoaster ride filled with alternating moments of excitement, suspense and despair - even though we already know the outcome.\n\n\"I'm the captain now,\" says Muse to Phillips after boarding the ship and shooting his way onto the bridge. There are displays of bravery on both sides but the balance tips when the four pirates leave the ship aboard an enclosed life raft - with Phillips as hostage.\n\nThe tension heightens and the claustrophobic atmosphere inside the raft is palpable - along with a growing sense that a bad situation is about to get a whole lot worse. Phillips' captors know that their mission has not gone according to plan, but they are sustained by bravado and false hopes - even when the US Navy shows up.\n\nThe subsequent showdown, with military ships and Navy Seals shadowing the tiny raft, plays out as a high stakes game of cat and mouse on the high seas.\n\nWatching this film is a bit of an ordeal, which in this case is a good thing and an indication of just how effective the moviemakers were at re-creating reality. \"It was supposed to be easy,\" groans one of the hijackers as realisation slowly sinks in. Captain Phillips is a powerful, absorbing and unsettling movie, and viewers who value its unrelenting commitment will find it to be in ship-shape condition.\n\nRating:\n\nB\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

While analysts point to several breakthroughs and a clear reform drive, they remain sceptical because several key areas were deliberately omitted. They say this indicates an internal conflict over important issues which have yet to be definitely resolved.\n\n\"As we expected, there are no detailed measures mentioned in the statement, only general guidelines. However, judging from this shortened version, the plenum probably meets our expectations,\" said Wao Yei, an economist for Societe Generale based in Hong Kong.\n\n\"We should learn more in the days ahead, but based on what has been revealed so far, the decisions taken at the plenum fall some way short,\" said Mark Williams, an economist with Capital Economics, a research firm based in London.\n\nInvestors were unimpressed with the outcome, which some Communist Party leaders ahead of the plenum had claimed would be nothing short of a \"revolution\".\n\nShares in Hong Kong and Shanghai tumbled yesterday. The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 1.91 per cent, while the mainland Shanghai Composite Index slipped 1.83 per cent.\n\nThe main takeaway from the Third Plenum remains the role assigned to market forces, which was changed from \"basic\" to \"decisive\".\n\nA change in vocabulary is always closely watched in China and any shift in language is heavily debated within the party.\n\nAlso important is the creation of an agency to oversee reform that will report directly to the top leadership. This could be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's commitment to reform, which he does not want stalled in China's bureaucratic hallways.\n\nThe communique also addressed fiscal and tax reform, which will probably have a good chance of being launched next year.\n\nThe main surprise was the mention of the reform of land rights for farmers. China's leaders said they would \"better guarantee rural residents' property rights\" and \"ensure that rural residents can equally benefit from China's development\".\n\nLand reform is particularly sensitive as change in current legislation will cut local governments from their main source of revenue - land sales. Analysts expect this is a first step in allowing farming land transactions at market prices and granting farmers the right to access healthcare and education.\n\nWhat was lacking though was specific mention of the break-up of the big state monopolies. Ahead of the plenum, analysts had said the issue was too thorny to be directly addressed. Many still question whether China can truly reform itself without dismantling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and granting more privileges to the private sector.\n\nThe fact that the communique includes an explicit call to \"consolidate and develop the state sector\" underlines that reformers have certainly not carried the day\", said Mr Williams of Capital Economics.\n\n\"Indeed, strong backing for the state sector is hard to square with the desire to give markets a much greater role. The party leadership may believe it can achieve both, but as long as state-owned enterprises retain their privileged position, markets will remain skewed,\" he added.\n\nIn the absence of a clear stance on the role of the state, analysts expect reforms to first materialise in the financial sector with interest rate liberalisation and more experiments in the Shanghai free trade zone, which could then be rapidly expanded to other cities.\n\nOther important reforms missing from the communique included reform of the hukou, or household registration, which would grant the same rights to China's millions of migrant workers as their urban counterparts.\n\n\"SOEs, urbanisation and rural land issues are featured in this document, but with language that does not suggest a major breakthrough any time soon,\" wrote Royal Bank of Scotland analysts Louis Kuijs and Tiffany Qiu.\n\nAnalysts will be closely watching how reforms are implemented and whether the new leadership team has the strength and support to bypass interest groups and impose their vision.\n\n\"The fate of (President) Xi's reform is likely to be determined by a detailed policy design and policy execution. The ball is back in the court of bureaucrats, and interest groups will likely try to influence the process,\" said Dong Tao, an analyst at Credit Suisse.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Whether it tapers in December or sometime next year will eventually be (only) a footnote in history.\n\n\"At some point, it's going to have to taper - and it's important for all of us to start preparing for this eventuality.\"\n\nWhat this means is that all countries must, among other priorities, put in place domestic reforms, raise productivity, and liberalise and remove roadblocks to infrastructure investments.\n\n\"The eventual tapering on the Fed's part will, I think, (be) a net positive for emerging Asia - a net positive as long as we respond to this likely outcome, start preparing for it now, have a little more urgency in domestic reforms,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nHe revealed that Mr Lew had assured that the US was serious about getting a clear resolution of its current budget and debt impasses.\n\n\"Resolving this problem is important not just to the United States, but for the global economy and sustaining the global recovery,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe two leaders also discussed the latest state of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) negotiations, which are now in the final stages after three years of talks and are expected to be concluded soon.\n\nThe US-led TPP talks involve 12 Pacific Rim countries, including Singapore. The TPP is billed as the world's largest free-trade agreement and accounts for about a third of world trade and nearly 40 per cent of the global economy.\n\n\"We are both committed to achieving a high-standard TPP agreement that will ultimately boost trade, boost investment and boost job creation in all our countries. Our negotiators are working intensively to resolve the outstanding issues,\" said Mr Tharman.\n\nThe aim is still to strike a deal by year-end, and Mr Tharman said that every country involved \"should try our best\" to reach a consensus.\n\nThe negotiators from the 12 countries are set to meet in Salt Lake City in the US next week before Singapore hosts the next TPP Ministerial Meeting in December.\n\nSeparately, Mr Lew also met Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the Istana, where they exchanged views on international and regional developments, including the global economic and financial outlook.\n\nMr Lew's two-day trip to Singapore, which ended yesterday, was the second leg of his five-nation swing through Asia that began earlier this week in Japan and will wrap up in China.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Of the six global institutions investing alongside GLP, four are new to GLP's fund management platform.\n\n\"While we are unable to disclose our fee structure, on average the fund management platform increases our internal rate of return on our investments by approximately 400 to 500 basis points,\" noted Mr Schwartz, during yesterday's teleconference.\n\nIndeed, China is the world's best market for investment in logistics, given that the country has only one-fourteenth the amount of warehouse stock per capita of the United States, he added.\n\n\"Even if China needs only half the amount of warehouse space of the US on a per capita basis, it would need a total market supply of 3.4 billion sq m, a market opportunity in excess of US$2 trillion,\" he said.\n\nEquity commitments to the fund stand at US$1.5 billion, with a total investment capacity of US$3 billion over a period of three years.\n\nFollowing the launch of the fund and the recently announced sale of nine properties to GLP J-Reit, GLP's fund management platform stands at US$11.4 billion of assets under management, up from US$2.6 billion a year ago.\n\n\"We expect to continue to grow our development starts in China by 20 to 25 per cent annually; setting up the fund will allow us to fund this growth in the long term,\" said Mr Schwartz.\n\nOn the portfolio front, China registered a strong quarter of leasing in Q2, with 575,000 sq m of new and expansion leases, up 60 per cent year-on-year. Rent grew 6.9 per cent on renewals while average rental rates increased 5.0 per cent year-on-year.\n\nIn Japan, rents increased 3.0 per cent on renewals while average rents remained stable at 1,081 yen (S$13.50) per square metre per month.\n\nThe lease ratio in Brazil stands at 95 per cent. The portfolio has a long weighted average lease expiry period of eight years and the development pipeline remains healthy at 800,000 sq m.\n\nGLP's counter ended trading up eight cents at S$3.00 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He allegedly transferred US$10 million out on March 5 last year.\n\nThe Business Times understands that the judgment will ensure that there are funds available to satisfy any liabilities, should the Commercial Affairs Department's probe end in a fine or a penalty assessed for breaches of the Securities & Futures Act.\n\nJustice Ang also found that portions of evidence given by Mr Huang's daughter, Huang Yiling, and Lau Kam Sze - the alleged beneficial owners of Build Up and the Trony Solar shares - to be \"inherently improbable, strained and unconvincing\".\n\nShe wrote that the pair, named as Mr Huang's business partners, were \"particularly unsatisfactory witnesses\": \"Their ambivalent attitudes towards the opening of the bank account went towards showing that they were nominee directors and shareholders, and were acting on Mr Huang's instructions.\n\n\"Mr Lau's inconsistent evidence is the product of a story that was being made up at each turn. This accounted for his inability to properly justify his decision to set up Build Up with Ms Huang and to jointly invest in Trony Solar. Upon further cross-examination by Mr Bull, Mr Lau blamed the inconsistency on the incompetence of the translators of his affidavits.\"\n\nIn finding Mr Huang to be the true owner of the assets, Justice Ang accepted evidence by MAS' key witness Lillian Liao, a Credit Suisse relationship manager who had handled the account, as \"consistent with the documents\", and that she took instructions almost exclusively from Mr Huang or his Hong Kong assistant, Sunny Hui, on how the account was to be run.\n\nMs Liao gave evidence that Mr Huang had asked the bank to retain executed copies of the account-opening documents because he did not want to carry these physical documents into China; Justice Ang said such instructions were consistent with the sophisticated use of the BVI company.\n\nThe judge also noted that Mr Huang's instructions had not surprised Ms Liao, who had come across such behaviour from high net worth private-banking clients seeking to preserve the secrecy of their private account information.\n\nJustice Ang disagreed with Build Up's contention that Ms Liao had forged Mr Lau and Ms Huang's signatures on the bank's declaration of beneficial ownership, finding it a \"conjecture\" and \"unsupported by the evidence\".\n\nShe added that the failure of both Mr Huang and Mr Hui to turn up as witnesses at the trial (without offering valid reasons) to be cross-examined on the issue of beneficial ownership was \"a factor which the court is entitled to give some weight\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I don't think we can completely forgo the possibility of things turning worse next year.\"\n\nHanjin, South Korea's largest shipping company, and Hyundai Merchant are expected to post losses next year as well, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nSTX, the largest commodity-mover and under court receivership since June, may post its first profit in four years in 2014.\n\nShares of Hanjin Shipping fell 1.3 per cent to close at 6,990 won in Seoul. STX Pan Ocean fell 3.9 per cent to 1,115 won. Hyundai Merchant advanced 2.3 per cent after it teamed up with Posco and Korea Railroad Corp to develop a rail project linking Khasan on the Russian border and North Korean port of Rajin.\n\nHanjin Shipping's chief executive Kim Young Min resigned on Monday to take responsibility for the company's losses and a delay in receiving financing from creditors. The company has 1.1 trillion won of bonds due in the next two years, compared with cash and near-cash items of 507 billion won at the end of June.\n\nHanjin has been selling assets and has sufficient cash for payments, said spokesman Kim Young Tae. The carrier will continue to look at financing options, including a perpetual bond sale, he said.\n\nHyundai Merchant has one trillion won to pay in the same two years, compared with 706 billion won in cash. STX owes 900 billion won with a cash pile of 248 billion won in that period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. STX is in talks with its main creditors on maturing debt, according to its response to Bloomberg News.\n\nHyundai Merchant has secured funds to meet payments until the first half of next year, said Lee Jun Ki, a spokesman. Hyundai will look at \"various options\", if the shipping industry doesn't improve, he said.\n\n\"The amount coming due may not seem big, but it's a problem if you have a similar size of loan maturing for three straight years and you are not making enough money,\" said HI Investment's Mr Kim.\n\nThe government holds one of the keys to easing the debt crisis for companies through its Korea Development Bank (KDB).\n\nTo help troubled shippers and other companies pay down the bonds, the government in July put forward a temporary plan in which KDB will help raise 80 per cent of funds needed for repayment. The companies need to bring the rest. That enabled Hyundai Merchant to refinance 280 billion won of maturing bonds last month.\n\n\"We prepared corporate bond market stabilisation steps in July pre-emptively,\" Shin Je Yoon, chairman of the Financial Services Commission, said on Oct 24. \"I don't have immediate concerns about the debt market, but we can review easing the July measure to provide help to a broader range of companies if needed.\"\n\nKDB declined to comment.\n\nThe state-owned bank has played a key role in helping distressed companies restructure in the past. It's taking the lead role in rescheduling debt for STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co and one of its funds became the biggest shareholder of Daewoo Engineering & Construction Co by swapping debt for equity.\n\n\"KDB is very important,\" HI Investment's Mr Kim said. \"If not for them, the circumstances in the shipping industry could be far worse than what they are now.\"\n\nHanjin, which has reported a loss in each of the past 10 quarters, got a loan from affiliate Korean Air Lines Co last month while Hyundai Merchant sold shares this month.\n\nHanjin is considering selling stakes in port terminals, it said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.\n\nA glut of vessels has contributed to the slump in the Baltic Dry Index. The most popular global measure of commodity-shipping rates plunged 90 per cent from its peak to a record low of 647 in February last year. The gauge has since more than doubled.\n\nSpot rates to haul container cargo from Asia to Europe, the world's busiest trading lane, have dropped 12 per cent from this year's high, according to the Shanghai Shipping Exchange.\n\nThe global downturn has claimed two victims in Japan.

Still, shipbuilding and ship repair & conversion continued to be the main profit contributors, with combined gross profit of $14.2 million or 60 per cent of group gross profit of $24 million.\n\nShipbuilding margins, however, weakened to 8.6 per cent (21.4 per cent in 1QFY13 and 10.8 per cent in 4QFY13) on lower margin jobs recognised due to depressed pricing and rising labour costs. However, higher shipbuilding revenue on progressive recognition of more units of offshore support vessels and a dredger narrowed shipbuilding profit decline to 4 per cent, while repair and conversion margins remained firm at 27.4 per cent.\n\nASL Marine's management highlighted that the group's shipbuilding orderbook from external customers stood at $268 million as at Sept 30, with 23 vessels including offshore supply vessels, AHTS, dredgers and tugs and barges.\n\nGross profits at the group's ship chartering business slipped 4 per cent year on year to $7 million, as the group no longer consolidates earnings from PT CNI. Gains from vessel disposals of $1.4 million helped lift earnings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The problem is that properties are measured in hugely different ways around the world,\" said Mr Newey.\n\nUsing residential property valuation as an example, floor space in Spain would include outdoor swimming pools, while in parts of the Middle East it would include the hypothetical maximum number of floors that can be built on existing foundations, said Mr Newey.\n\nIn India on the other hand, there is no standard measurement basis, and residential and commercial property are sold or leased on the basis of \"super area\", said Sachin Sandhir, managing director for Rics South Asia.\n\nGiven that the super area includes common areas and amenities including lift lobbies, terraces and common spaces, there can be a difference of anything between 25 per cent and 50 per cent between the super area and the actual usable area, he said.\n\nThe same problem occurs when measuring commercial property space across countries.\n\nUsing Rics net internal area - the standard used in the United Kingdom - as a base, \"leased area\", depending on where in the world you are looking at it, can vary by up to 24.1 per cent according to Jones Lang LaSalle's global leased space comparison tool.\n\nThis is largely due to the various elements, including columns, floor lift lobby, lifts and other common areas, which can potentially be included in the standard leasing practice of different countries.\n\nLooking at it from a valuation standpoint, this undermines the issue of transparency and introduces a risk element to the valuation, said Mr Newey.\n\n\"This means you have a risk element to whether the financial reporting of companies' assets particularly were correct,\" he added.\n\nIt is for this reason that the IPMSC was created in May this year - to address the creation of international property measurement standards (IPMS).\n\nTo date, more than 20 professional bodies from around the world have joined the coalition and have undertaken to adopt the standards. In addition, Dubai was the first government to officially support the IPMS in September this year.\n\nMr Newey said that he had a \"positive meeting\" with the Urban Redevelopment Authority, to raise awareness.\n\nFollowing the roll-out of office standards, the coalition will look into other commercial assets including retail, warehousing and industrial. This will culminate in the creation of valuation standards for residential property in 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The person the farm is near matters more than the type of farm,\" said Bruce Huber, an Illinois real estate broker who handled a sale in central Illinois last week.\n\nIf the sale of the 217 hectare grain farm in Carlinville, Illinois, for US$14.5 million is any indication, farmland values in the most productive areas of the grain belt will stay steady during harvest, the traditional season for farmland auctions.\n\nThe farm in question, which included grain storage facilities for more than four million bushels, was sold in seven tracts with the top parcel of 200 acres - about 81 hectares - bringing in US$13,600 an acre.\n\n\"We decided US$13,000 was our top dollar. We exceeded our expectations. But I'm glad we did it,\" said David Fullington, a local CPA who organised a partnership of farmers to make the successful bid for that parcel, which will be farmed by one of the buyers' sons in the coming year.\n\nThe sale price was as strong as a year ago when corn was at US$8 a bushel versus the US$4 being paid today. Corn prices have been the catalyst for sky-high US farmland values in recent years.\n\nWhy the strength? The usual reason: the neighbours wanted the farm.\n\n\"We wouldn't have bought this if we didn't own other land,\" said Mr Fullington, who said that top grade land four years ago had been selling for US$4,000 an acre. \"It would have been a poor investment for somebody to go out and buy land for the first time.\"\n\nMr Huber said that he had seen a common theme at this autumn's grain land auctions in Illinois, typically the nation's No 2 corn and soya bean grower behind Iowa.\n\nIf the farm is in the right spot, and the land is good quality, farmers are paying top prices and quickly - the 200-acre parcel, a US$2.72 million sale, was done in 15 minutes, Mr Huber said.\n\nBut if those factors are not present, sales go slow and often disappoint sellers.\n\nThere is a wide audience for farm land prices this season. Federal Reserve policymakers, farm bankers who use land as loan collateral, seed and fertiliser dealers and equipment makers are closely watching land sales as an indicator of future farmer spending at a time grains prices - if not revenues, given higher yields - have fallen back.\n\nJason Henderson, a Purdue University agricultural economist, said that the Illinois auction was in line with what many have expected.\n\nPrime grain land in Illinois, Iowa and other Midwest states rose 20 to 30 per cent last year alone. Soaring demand for corn from ethanol makers, strong demand from China and other importers, and rock-bottom US interest rates have all combined to feed the farm land boom.\n\nBut skyrocketing land values have stirred nightmare memories of the ruinous land bubble of the 1980s, when over-leveraged farmers lost their farms as interest rates jumped. Farmers who lived through those times remember them well.\n\nFor some, the sale was a sober reminder of the bad old days and bitter lessons repeated. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The location is yet to be determined.\n\nAccording to Lori Arpin, GM vice-president for communications, about 40 GM employees from the region will move here to join the existing staff at GM Overseas Distribution LLC.\n\nGM Overseas looks after the Singapore and Brunei markets for the Chevrolet and Opel brands, as well as the distribution of car parts under the AC Delco brand to Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.\n\nThe unit, which was set up here in 1972 as a regional distribution hub but has since played a smaller role, is headed by a financial controller.\n\nMs Arpin said: \"We looked at a number of countries and Singapore was the best location in terms of an operational standpoint.\"\n\nThe new HQ will include representatives from GM's regional sales and marketing, product planning, finance, government relations, human resources, IT, legal and communications functions.\n\nIt will oversee key parts of GM's business in Africa, Asean, Australia and New Zealand, India, South Korea and the Middle East, as well as Chevrolet and Cadillac Europe.\n\nWhile GM makes Singapore its new centre of operations, it will retain the China and Korea offices.\n\n\"It makes good business sense to maintain this backbone operation to support these markets,\" said Ms Arpin. \"China is the world's largest vehicle market. Our feeling is that it demands our singular attention and focus to remain a leader.\"\n\nGM is the dominant player in China. But it is facing stiff competition from Germany's Volkswagen, while its compatriot Ford - although still some way behind in the sales stakes - has been making strong progress on the mainland.\n\nObservers say that the relocation to Singapore would split the carmaker's HQ functions and allow it to better focus on both its cash cow as well as the rest of the region.\n\nThey added that while there may also be tax and other considerations, GM's move will let it concentrate on growing the business outside China, especially in fast-rising and consumer-driven markets of South and South-east Asia where incomes and the appetite for cars continue to grow.\n\nGlobally, the US giant was also the biggest carmaker from 1931 up until 2008 when it was overtaken by Toyota. GM reclaimed the title in 2011 for one year when the Japanese giant stumbled over the tsunami in north-eastern Japan and worldwide recalls, before slipping again to No 2 behind Toyota.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

High operating costs and infrastructure limitations are other issues the industry is grappling with.\n\nIndia's emerging middle class, sizeable young population as well as its current low level of trips per capita are driving factors for the airline to participate in the growth market, aside from enabling SIA to diversify its traffic base. Other airlines are also trying to gain a foothold in the market, including AirAsia, which is setting up a budget carrier, also with Tata.\n\nSIA and Tata are aiming for their airline to be operational by mid-2014, although decisions have yet to be made with regard to aircraft type, fleet size, and whether planes will be purchased or leased.\n\nNoting that SIA-Tata has received very good response from both the Indian authorities and the public, Mr Goh said it had no reason to believe the airline wouldn't take off.\n\nOn Oct 24, India's Foreign Investment Promotion Board gave its verbal approval for the joint venture, but the two partners are still waiting for the written approval. Once that is received, SIA-Tata will need to get a no-objection certificate and then an air operator's certificate.\n\nCommenting on potential future synergies between the joint venture and SIA, Mr Goh said: \"We have an extensive network to South-east Asia and when (this venture) wants to reach South-east Asia eventually, it will be able to tap the network much more effectively than if it were to mount its own flights directly to small points in South-east Asia.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the group announced its results for the second quarter ended Sept 30, 2013, with net profit rising 78 per cent year-on-year to $160.6 million, boosted by share of profits from associated companies, gains from the sale of aircraft as well as higher operating profit, while revenue increased 2.8 per cent to $3.9 billion.\n\nHowever, yields have been declining - down 3.5 per cent in Q2 FY2013/14 - hit by the effect of the strong Singapore dollar on revenue-generating currencies as well as intensifying competition from other carriers, such as the cash-rich Gulf airlines.\n\n\"With the demand outlook for both the passenger and cargo business still shaky, SIA's best hope for a vastly improved financial performance is for fuel prices to fall significantly,\" reckons DBS Group Research analyst Paul Yong, although he expects the group to post a slight improvement over last year's performance given its interim numbers.\n\nSIA yesterday said it has hedged 60 per cent of its fuel needs for the period October 2013 to March 2014 at US$118 per barrel.\n\nThe counter closed at $10.28 yesterday, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Earnings per share were 0.0065 yuan, compared with 0.0029 yuan a year ago. Revenue for the period ended Sept 30 rose 50 per cent to 134.1 million yuan on jumps in construction revenue and recurring water treatment income.\n\nNew mineral resource estimate for Liongold\n\nLIONGOLD Corp said yesterday that a new mineral resource has been estimated for its Amayapampa Gold Project in Bolivia which raises the amount of gold contained to 1.79 million ounces, a 40 per cent increase on the previously reported Mineral Resource of 1.28 million ounces. This is due to a significant increase in the gold grade of the resource. This means that there will be an overall decrease in the expected tonnage to be mined, even as gold production volumes remain similar to its original plan, said Liongold.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With some US$3.9 billion in its existing orderbook, the group said its China-based shipyards will be operating at close to full capacity up to 2016.\n\nThe containership options in particular bear watching, according to analysts, as these are for Seaspan's outstanding nine 10,000 TEU (twenty foot equivalent units) vessels.\n\nSeaspan has already ordered 16 vessels from Yangzijiang, making the shipyard the first in China to build these mega vessels. The first two 10,000 TEU container vessels were launched at their yard at end September 2013.\n\nThe New York listed Seaspan had declared five options in October with Yangzijiang, with deliveries from 2015, and had said it would sign long-term charters for the newly confirmed newbuilds with a major container line soon.\n\nYangzijiang's management also highlighted that the group plans to move away from building smaller vessels to focus on higher value-added vessels such as Capesize, 10,000 dwt Panamax vessels as well as LPG carriers.\n\nThe China-based, Singapore-listed shipbuilding group posted a 6 per cent decline in Q3 net profit attributable to equity-holders, to 820.7 million yuan (S$168.1 million), despite a 2 per cent rise in revenue to 3.6 billion yuan. EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) was up 2 per cent to 1.24 billion yuan.\n\nAccording to analysts, the better-than-expected earnings were helped by sustained shipbuilding margins. In Q3, shipbuilding margins stood at 22 per cent, slightly below 23 per cent in Q3 the previous year, despite the group recognising revenue from relatively lower value and lower priced contracts during the period.\n\nGroup pre-tax profit was actually up 6 per cent year-on-year to 1.17 billion yuan but management highlighted that Q3 earnings at the net level were impacted by a higher tax rate of 29 per cent versus 22 per cent previously.\n\nFor the nine months of 2013, group net profit is down 15 per cent year on year to 2.34 billion yuan, with revenue down 2 per cent to 10.96 billion yuan.\n\nThe group's held to maturity assets increased to 12.5 billion yuan as at September 2013 (up 10 per cent from Dec 31, 2012), with cash holdings at 10.3 billion yuan and net gearing at 5.8 per cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The project has drawn owner-occupiers as well as potential investors, given the appeal of the location.\n\n\"Residents will enjoy the prestige of living a short distance from the Chatsworth Park Good Class Bungalow Area and yet enjoy the convenience of amenities in the Redhill area ranging from a wet market and food centre to restaurants and cafes.\"\n\nThe $1,650 psf average pricing for Alex Residences is a tad lower than the $1,700 psf early-bird average pricing for City Developments' launch of the next-door condo Echelon last December. However, the overall project-average achieved for Echelon was $1,795 psf.\n\nAlso, Singapore Land has not minted large units, with the project comprising entirely one, two and three-bedroom units - unlike Echelon which also has four-bedders and penthouses. Three-bedders in Echelon are also generally larger than those in Alex Residences.\n\nThis has allowed about 95 per cent of the 429 units in Alex Residences to be priced below $2 million.\n\n\"Yes, the TDSR (total debt servicing ratio) framework has restricted access to funding for some potential buyers. But for those who can get financing, they find a strong value proposition in our product, which is near the city,\" reasoned Mr Ng.\n\nIn early September, Keppel Land released The Glades next to Tanah Merah MRT Station at an average price of around $1,500 psf. In late June, on the same evening that the TDSR framework was rolled out, MCL Land sold its J Gateway condo near Jurong East MRT Station like hotcakes at $1,480 psf on average.\n\nMr Ng said that buyers of Alex Residences yesterday were predominantly Singaporeans and permanent residents although some foreigners, mostly mainland Chinese, were also spotted buying units.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/govt-reins-cpf-defaulting-employers", "site_title": "Govt reins in CPF-defaulting employers", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nGovt reins in CPF-defaulting employers\n\nPublished\n\nWed, Nov 13, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN the World Economic Forum's annual assessment of country competitiveness, Singapore consistently ranks among those with the best employment practices, placing high in the top 10 on just about every measure of labour market efficiency. Interestingly though, the same survey in the 2013 Global Competitiveness Report also had Singapore executives citing \"restrictive labour regulations\" as by far \"the most problematic factor for doing business\", well above \"inflation\" or \"insufficient capacity to innovate\". One should assume that the statutory requirement to pay Central Provident Fund (CPF) contributions - and, indeed, wages - for every employee isn't among the onerous labour regulations that employers take issue with.\n\nBut Singapore has this week passed two pieces of legislation to mete out stiffer penalties to employers who fail to pay CPF contributions - and salaries. In May, the CPF Board said that it recovered $293 million in CPF arrears owed to more than 200,000 workers in 2012. Most of the cases involved late payment, but still, 11,000 workers were either shortchanged or failed to receive their CPF dues from some 4,000 companies, to the tune of $9.4 million. Shocking as the $293 million arrears is, the figure covers only the sums that were recovered; a good number of errant employers may well have slipped through the cracks, especially in the past before the CPF Board stepped up its enforcement audits and on-site inspections to deter recalcitrant employers late last year.\n\nWorkers need their CPF and not only for retirement-- the CPF has long evolved from being merely a retirement savings scheme to meeting Singaporeans' home ownership and healthcare financing needs. CPF defaulters, especially repeat offenders, must be taken to task - just like employers who fail to pay salaries. With the amendments to the CPF Act passed in Parliament on Tuesday, first-time offenders can be jailed up to six months or fined up to $5,000 (double the previous maximum fine) or both. Similarly, the Employment Act has been amended to hand out a mandatory minimum fine and much higher maximum fines (up to $30,000 for repeat offenders) for those that withhold salaries.\n\nA case was made in Parliament for employers that default on CPF by \"negligence or honest mistakes\". That concern is misplaced. Try arguing that the firm somehow \"forgot\" to pay CPF contributions that month or is in fact unaware of its obligations; perhaps this should then call, all the more, for the mandatory issuing of payslips, which the government has for now deferred.\n\nThe most probable scenario is that cashflow issues lie behind many of the default cases - which speaks to the separate issues of business health and viability, and rising costs. But things are unlikely to get easier. With companies now looking to hire more Singaporeans than foreigners, and with rising wages in the lower to middle rungs, employers can expect to pay even more CPF contributions.The need for vigilance against those who don't meet their obligations can thus only increase.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue rose 15 per cent to $413.5 million from $360 million.\n\n\"I am happy that we are continuing our turnaround momentum,\" said chairman and managing director Chia Kim Piow, of Rotary's Q3 performance.\n\nIt marks the company's emergence this year from problems encountered at the tail-end of its mega US$745 million tankfarm project for the Saudi Aramco Total Refining and Petrochemical Company (Satorp).\n\nThe group said yesterday that \"the Satorp project has been substantially completed and Rotary has handed over the 62 atmospheric storage tanks and eight bullet tanks\".\n\nIt is currently engaged in two major projects here - a $300 million expansion of a oil terminal on Pulau Busing and another EPC contract, reportedly for around $300 million, for the new Singapore Lube Park in Tuas by Shell, Total and Sinopec. Rotary is also involved in a US$250 million EPC deal for the Fujairah Oil Terminal. All these projects are scheduled for completion in the next two years.\n\nMr Chia said that apart from executing the projects safely and well, Rotary's \"other focus is to stay competitive in times of rising cost\" including labour and other operating costs. For instance, it will make greater use of its Batam fabrication workshop so as to reduce its manpower requirements in Singapore, and has also invested in supply chain logistics to transport the materials here.\n\nRotary said that it remained \"cautiously optimistic\" about its prospects amid the global economic uncertainties, underpinned by its strong order book that stands at $847 million currently, with 60 per cent of this attributed to Singapore projects.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue was down 9 per cent at $587.8 million, due to lower car sales in Singapore and Malaysia as well as lower recognition of China property sales. No dividend was declared.\n\n\"The recent announcement of the refinement of the categorisation to the COE system, the introduction of the tiered system of Additional Registration Fee and the revisions to the quantum and tenure of car loans may have a dampening effect on the Singapore market as consumers adjust to these new changes,\" WBL said yesterday.\n\nWBL had reported increased car sales in its third quarter, though margins were already affected. In the fourth quarter, sales dropped 11.6 per cent to $230.2 million, while net attributable profit dived 84.9 per cent to $1.8 million. Lower car sales in Singapore and lower margins were exacerbated by foreign exchange losses and a reversal of tax overprovision for prior years, the company said.\n\nWBL's other main segment, technology, reported a 2 per cent dip in revenue to $281 million. Its net attributable losses widened to $11.7 million, from $0.9 million a year ago. This was partly due to an inventory write-down for its Nasdaq-listed subsidiary Multi-Fineline Electronix, mitigated by stronger results from its flexible printed circuits unit MFS Technology.\n\nMeanwhile, WBL's property segment reported an 85.6 per cent drop in quarterly revenue to $6 million and an 82.7 per cent drop in net attributable profit to $0.9 million. This was due to lower recognition of sales for its Chengdu Orchard Villa development project and an absence of gains from the disposal of a China property investment holding company last year.\n\nIts engineering, manufacturing and distribution division reported a 27.2 per cent quarterly revenue rise to $61.8 million and a 22.5 per cent net attributable profit increase to $4.9 million. This was due to higher contributions from system integrator O'Connor's and from its liquefied petroleum gas unit.\n\nOn the whole, operational loss was $6.6 million, but exceptional gains of $15.2 million, mostly from the divestment of Californian tech company Amlogic Inc, led to the positive $8.6 million profit for the quarter.\n\nFor the full-year, revenues were down 2.6 per cent to $2.4 billion. WBL recorded a full-year loss of $11.2 million, compared to a $75.3 million profit a year ago.\n\nWBL shares are currently suspended pending delisting following its takeover by UE earlier this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Economy class passengers can carry two bags of up to 23kg each.\n\nThe airline said that the adjustment was a result of feedback from customers and aimed at maintaining the strength of its overall value proposition.\n\nNews of the revised allowance limit, which kicks in before the year-end holidays, was well received by customers, judging from comments on the airline's Facebook page.\n\nSpeaking to BT at the sidelines of yesterday's briefing, executive vicepresident (commercial) Mak Swee Wah said the higher baggage allowances were unlikely to have a significant impact on fuel costs.\n\nThe move to increase baggage allowance is perceived as an effort to distinguish itself from rival carriers, amid stiffening competition. In February, Malaysia Airlines introduced an additional 10kg of checked-in baggage allowance for all classes and cut excess baggage fees as well.\n\nSIA has unveiled other changes this year, including the enhancement of its KrisFlyer programme, new designs for its SilverKris Lounges in Singapore and overseas as well as an overhaul of its cabin products for selected aircraft.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It recognises the complexity but it is not going to be without risks. It would be naive to think that this is going to be a risk-less process.\"\n\nChina is still coping with the excesses of the previous stimulus package that was introduced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. The Chinese leaders will also have to deal with the interdependence between the reforms that they want to undertake.\n\n\"It's not possible to have financial sector reform without state-owned enterprise reforms,\" Mr Tharman said. \"It's not possible to have successful urbanisation without reform to the household registration system progressively.\n\n\"Each reform carries risks - economic, social, sometimes political - and the interdependence of reforms does not neutralise those risks. It sometimes compounds them.\"\n\nStill, Mr Tharman said that countries naturally want to be a part of China's transformation because the country is the \"major source of economic growth\" in the world today.\n\nMr Lin, who is now a professor at Peking University, later told the audience that he predicted that China would grow by an average of 8 per cent a year for the next 20 years. As for 2014, he forecasts that GDP growth would reach 7.5-8 per cent at the very least.\n\nMr Tharman noted that China would have to overcome several challenges in coming years. For one, it could no longer rely on its labour market as an engine of growth for the economy, given that the number of young people entering the workforce is already starting to decline.\n\nWhere China can do well, however, is in improving its productivity levels. With a much more diverse and larger economy compared to Japan and South Korea, Mr Tharman said, China's many provinces such as Sichuan had yet to realise its potential in raising productivity.\n\nThere is also much scope for China in terms of urbanisation as more people move to the cities, while the growing connectivity between regions will also help boost demand through greater investment, he said.\n\nSMU organised yesterday's forum as part of its efforts to strengthen and deepen its own engagement with China.

For its fourth edition next January, it has reduced the number of galleries - from 130 this year to just 100 next year. But in their place, there will be eight country or region-based platforms created by top curators around the region.\n\nThe eight platforms are India, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Central Asia and South-east Asia. Possibly controversial is the decision to subsume Singapore - which for the past three Art Stage editions had its own platform - into the South-east Asia platform, comprising also Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines and Thailand.\n\nArguably, the creation of platforms - especially the Central Asia and Australia ones - will offer a window into these regions' art, which hitherto were either missing or lost in the cornucopia of art on display.\n\nBut it remains to be seen how well the local art community will take to the absence of an exclusive Singapore platform, which were previously supported by the National Arts Council.\n\nA significant 20 per cent, or 2,000 square metres, of the fair's space will now be devoted to these platforms. And their curators include the Who's Who of the art world, such as Mori Museum chief curator Mami Kataoka for the Japan platform, esteemed Chinese curator Huang Du for the China platform, and India's first biennale's artistic director, Bose Krishnamachari, for the India platform.\n\nThe South-east Asia platform, the largest of the eight platforms, will be curated by a team of \"country advisers\" including the legendary art historian Jim Supangkat for the Indonesia segment and top academic Patrick Flores for the Philippines segment.\n\nOddly, for the Singapore segment, Art Stage organisers have decided to curate the works with the help of a few unnamed informal advisers instead of one curator.\n\nBut the final choice of the local artists to be showcased in the Singapore segment - namely Chun Kaifeng, Jane Lee, Sarah Choo and Jolene Lai - is not likely to broker argument. Chun and Lee are well-regarded for their practices, while Choo and Lai are among the most promising young artists on the local landscape.\n\nAt a press conference, fair director Lorenzo Rudolf says: \"An art fair must take the responsibility to inform its collectors, to put art in context, to give a deeper perspective into certain artists, to create a better understanding of each other's art, to inspire curiosity.\n\n\"People usually buy what they know. The Indonesians buy Indonesian art, for example. They're not looking left and right.\"\n\nArt Stage hopes to expand its collectors' horizons through the curated platforms.\n\nMr Rudolf also cites an observation that has been made by many art specialists, that is, the art world has become increasingly divided between commercial art that's fit to be sold in galleries, and non-commercial art that often finds favour in biennales because of its challenging nature.\n\nThe commercial versus non-commercial binary also exists in other art forms such as cinema and literature. But the staggering success of visual arts in the last decade - with high auction prices making headlines - has made the divide more pronounced.\n\nMr Rudolf says: \"Instead of commercial versus non-commercial, we want to focus on what's good art.\"\n\nThe new creation of country platforms and the appointment of curators also avoids the problems that Art Stage faced in its last edition over its controversial Indonesian Pavilion.\n\nBack then, Art Stage had chosen to devote a 1,000 sq m space focusing solely on Indonesian artists. Because many of the Indonesian artists have no gallery representation, Art Stage broke with normal art fair conventions by acting as the artists' agent and claiming a commission for their sales - thereby putting it in direct competition with the galleries that it rents booth spaces to.\n\nAsked how the Indonesian Pavilion did in terms of sales, Mr Rudolf demurs: \"We hardly covered costs . . . we didn't make any profit . . .\"\n\nHopefully, the new platforms will bring about a different outcome. If anything, the presence of strong curators for the platforms almost guarantees a better show.\n\nhelmi@sph.com.sg\n\nArt Stage will be held from Jan 16 to Jan 19 at the Marina Bay Sands Expo and Convention Centre\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Older and more experienced applicants must earn even higher salaries commensurate with their work experience in order to get an EP.\n\nThe minimum monthly salary for the other two EP tiers - P2 and P1 - remains unchanged at $4,500 and $8,000, respectively.\n\nMr Dhinakaran, managing director of Jay Gee Melwani Group, also wanted to know if MOM had received any complaints from multinationals - especially those from the three industries that Mr Tan had earlier cited - regarding the tight labour market in Singapore.\n\nMr Tan said his ministry was in constant dialogue with the various chambers of commerce in Singapore, and both foreign and local employers have expressed their concerns.\n\nWhile Mr Tan said his ministry was \"very mindful\" of their worries about not being able to find enough skilled professionals, he stressed that the government was taking a calibrated approach on the matter.\n\n\"The overall message is consistent. We do need to tighten and we do need to move on to much more productivity-led growth as well as a more manpower-lean approach,\" said the minister.\n\nHe added that the competitiveness that Singapore offered to investors extended beyond having a diverse and open labour market.\n\n\"There are many pluses going our way - rule of law, transparency, flexibility, infrastructure. All these go into consideration of any company operating here,\" said Mr Tan.\n\n\"Obviously, having a diverse and open workforce is beneficial, and it does eventually benefit Singaporeans as well.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All the offences took place over an eight-month period from May 2012 to December 2012.\n\nMarina Bay Sands (MBS) bore the brunt as it was made to pay $337,500 in fines for two breaches, such as failing to prevent locals who did not have a valid entry levy from entering or remaining in the casino.\n\nAs for Resorts World Sentosa (RWS), it must fork out $190,000 for three separate offences. The casino was guilty of, among other things, failing to prevent five minors from entering or remaining in the casino, and admitting people on the government's casino exclusion list.\n\n\"CRA takes a serious view of these lapses as the social safeguard measures have been put in place to protect the vulnerable from the harms of casino gambling,\" CRA said in a statement, adding that it would continue to be vigilant and take firm action against regulatory breaches.\n\nEarlier this year, CRA imposed two separate rounds of financial penalties on the casinos. In January, MBS and RWS were fined a total of $230,000 for various offences that took place from November 2011 to April 2012. In February this year, MBS was ordered to pay $475,000 for three separate breaches, including failing to ensure continuous recording of casino surveillance footage.\n\nCRA did, however, note yesterday that both casinos have continued to put in place a range of measures over the past three years to enhance their compliance with social safeguard measures. These include conducting more thorough checks at the casino entrances before allowing people in, and investing more resources to detect Singapore citizens and permanent residents who have stayed on in the casino even after their entry levies have expired.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Two-bedroom units (from 807 sq ft) are priced upwards of $1,983 psf.\n\nSales are expected to start tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile, a price cut may have aided Singapore Land's (SingLand's) Alex Residences condominium, which will be launching preview sales today - three days ahead of its planned Saturday main public launch - after 550 cheques that have been verified by the developer were received for the 150 units being released in the first phase of sales.\n\nMichael Ng, group general manager of UIC, SingLand's parent company, said that balloting for units will start today based on the cheques it has received over the two preview weekends.\n\nPublic sales will start from Thursday onwards.\n\nSingLand had earlier said that units at the 99-year leasehold development near Redhill MRT, which has a total of 429 units, will launch at an average $1,650 psf.\n\nThis is cheaper than next-door neighbour Echelon, where units were sold for an average $1,795 psf, according to data from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). Echelon was launched last December.\n\nMr Ng said that units launched in phase two are likely to be slightly higher, \"in excess of $1,700 psf\".\n\nPhase one's average price of $1,650 psf means that about 95 per cent of the 150 units released will cost below $2 million.\n\nThe development has one to three-bedroom apartments.\n\nSaid Mr Ng: \"Alex Residences appears to be quite well received. This could be due to the attractiveness of the location, with Tanglin/Jervois just across the road, the convenience of being located near Redhill MRT and the nearby amenities.\"\n\nThe property is a few \"minutes drive from Tiong Bahru, VivoCity, Orchard Road, MBS, CBD and Sentosa\", according to a fact sheet on the development.\n\nUnder the first phase, the smallest unit at Alex Residences, at 474 sq ft, will cost $760,000, while prices for two-bedroom apartments (657 and 678 sq ft) start at just over $1 million.\n\nThree-bedders (at least 883 sq ft) will cost upwards of $1.3 million.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This marked the final leg of the group's four-phase departure from Millenia Tower and the next-door Centennial Tower that began in 2011.\n\nPrior to that, Citi had occupied a total of about 440,000 sq ft in the two buildings, which are part of the Millenia Singapore development owned by Pontiac Land Group.\n\nIn 2011, Citibank began its move to Asia Square Tower 1.\n\nAmong those who have leased the 143,000 sq ft at Millenia Tower that Citi is giving up are four tenants who have each leased a floor of 17,000 sq ft - PayPal, Barry Callebaut, Bank of New York Mellon and Dymon Asia Capital.\n\nPayPal has been operating from its new premises on Millenia Tower's 14th floor since the second quarter of this year.\n\nThis represents an expansion of business for the group, which continues to have a presence in Suntec City.\n\nIn September, Dymon Asia Capital, a Singapore-headquartered investment management company, moved into the fourth level of Millenia Tower from Suntec City.\n\nBarry Callebaut Cocoa Asia Pacific Pte Ltd is another new tenant.\n\nIt is expected to move in later this month to the 12th floor, where it will set up its regional headquarters, which is being relocated from Malaysia.\n\nThe Zurich-based group is the world's leading manufacturer of high-quality chocolate and cocoa products.\n\nBank of New York Mellon, which now occupies three floors (Levels 2, 3 and 4) of Millenia Tower, will occupy the seventh floor as well from next month.\n\nThe rest of the space Citi vacated in the building this year has been leased to tenants involved in the financial and commodities businesses as well as a designer eyewear tenant from Italy believed to be Luxottica, whose brands include Ray-Ban and Oakley.\n\nPontiac Land said tenants that have inked leases for the 143,000 sq ft ex-Citi space in Millenia Tower have agreed to pay monthly rents ranging from the high-$8s to $10-plus per square foot.\n\nLast year, BT reported that Pontiac Land took just nine months to fill back all the 129,000 sq ft in the next door Centennial Tower vacated by Citi in November 2011.\n\nPontiac leased the space to existing tenants such as Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and McKinsey while clinching a few new names as well.\n\nAll eyes now are on the 55,000 sq ft that Allianz vacated earlier this month on Centennial Tower's Levels 3, 7, 8 and 9 though its lease runs until July 2015.\n\nAgents are busy finding replacement tenants who can sign up fresh leases with Pontiac Land even before the July 2015 expiry of Allianz' lease.\n\nThe German financial services provider has moved to Asia Square Tower 2.\n\nPontiac Land is asking for $13 psf a month, for smaller units below 3,000 sq ft at Centennial Tower, although lower psf rents can be negotiated for bigger spaces.\n\nAccording to Pontiac Land spokeswoman, tenants have been drawn to the two office towers by several factors, including ample carpark space with a total 1,500 parking lots for the Millenia Singapore development, which includes the two office towers, two hotels and Millenia Walk mall.\n\nIn addition, Millenia Tower boasts a concierge facility provided by Conrad Centennial Hotel.\n\n\"Our tenants also enjoy the prestige of being located in a mixed development with museum-quality art pieces,\" added the spokeswoman.\n\nCBRE executive director (office services) Moray Armstrong reckons that after stagnating at $9.55 psf for the first three quarters of this year, the firm's average monthly rental value for Grade A office space will end the year 2 per cent higher than the $9.58 psf at end-2012.\n\nCBRE's Grade A basket covers the best-quality buildings in Raffles Place, Marina Bay and Marina Centre.\n\nFor next year, he predicts a 5 to 7 per cent increase supported by continuation of the \"reasonably strong demand for office space\" seen this year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was due to higher gross profit margins, which saw cost of goods falling 12 per cent to $82.8 million. The result was a 9 per cent rise in gross profit to $39.2 million.\n\nThe lower revenue was attributed mainly to lower revenues from the Americas and the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region. However, net margins in these regions improved substantially on the back of the lower level of zero-margin revenue in the Middle East and the higher level of more profitable offshore activity in the Americas.\n\nCSE Global subsidiary Power Diesel contributed profit after tax of $0.5 million in the quarter; its newly acquired S3 ID Group, in which it has a 60 per cent effective ownership, was in a break-even position for the group in the quarter after accounting for transaction costs and non-controlling interests.\n\nBasic earnings per share was 2.21 cents in the quarter, up from 2.09 cents in the year-ago period.\n\nNew orders received for the quarter were $115.3 million, a decrease of 9.3 per cent from the third quarter of 2012. Outstanding orders at the end of this year's third quarter stood at $365.4 million.\n\nThe group generated operating cash inflow of $18.5 million in the third quarter, up from S$4.3 million in the 2012 quarter.\n\nNet gearing of the group was 7.1 per cent at the end of the quarter, compared to 6.2 per cent a year ago. The rise in net gearing in the current quarter came partly from the acquisition of S3 ID Group during the period.\n\nFor the nine months ended Sept 30, the group recorded an 18 per cent fall to $36.5 million in profit attributable to equity-holders, from $44.5 million in the year-ago period which had the benefit of a $10.3 million disposal gain.

It's still largely a property play right now, and it has to move towards a better kind of economic integration to benefit both sides better,\" said Dr Nungsari, who is now managing director of Prokhas, a special purpose vehicle wholly owned by the Minister of Finance Inc in Malaysia.\n\n\"But the cooperation and familiarity that has been created in Iskandar actually augurs well for opportunities everywhere else - certainly in the northern areas, in Penang, in Kuantan. Of course it also depends on the sort of industries that Singapore firms are looking for,\" he added.\n\nApart from Iskandar in Johor, Malaysia has carved out four other economic corridors with investment and business incentives. These are the Northern Corridor Economic Region, the East Coast Economic Region, the Sabah Development Corridor, and the Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy.\n\nAs power and economic heft continues to shift towards North Asia, Dr Nungsari believes deeper collaboration between Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia needs to be seen as a political and economic imperative, and not merely a nice-to-have prospect.\n\n\"The future of this immediate region will have to be developed along the Malacca straits ... Then we will have a decent chance to be the location for production to feed demand that's going to come from up north,\" said Dr Nungsari, who was previously an executive director at sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional.\n\nHe noted that the Greater Mekong Subregion - comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, and China - could become a potential competitor in this respect.\n\nAlthough Dr Nungsari acknowledged that a surplus economy like Singapore should funnel resources towards the ascending region of North Asia, he said that Singapore must think of its immediate neighbours as well.\n\n\"With such growth and size come responsibilities, because your behaviour and non-behaviour actually affects other things. I think given Singapore's advanced standing in development, it should integrate better (with its neighbours) on the non-economic side of things first, which would then lead to better economic integration later.\n\n\"As opposed to always being characterised as the place where the brain drain goes to, things should be the other way around. Singapore can share the brains and be an exporter of talent to the region - it's a possible way of building some bridges,\" said Dr Nungsari.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This amounts to about $88.4 million, and represents a dividend payout ratio of about 35 per cent. The date of the dividend payout will be announced at a later date.\n\nOxley's strong performance was largely driven by revenue recognition, based on the completion of construction method, from its 728-unit industrial development, Oxley Bizhub. Revenue was also recognised, using the percentage of completion method, from progress made in the construction of 10 mixed-residential projects.\n\nOxley has since started looking overseas for its next phase of growth.\n\nIts latest acquisition, which marks its first foray into London and also its most ambitious, is the acquisition of three freehold and three leasehold adjacent parcels of land in London's Royal Docks area.\n\nThe Royal Wharf development site, which was purchased at \u00a3200 million (S$397.4 million), yields an effective gross area of about 363,000 square metres.\n\nOxley has said that it intends to develop the parcels, which stretch about 500 metres facing the River Thames, into more than 3,400 homes, along with a mix of commercial, retail, leisure and educational facilities.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a ramp-up in overseas acquisitions over the quarter. In July, Oxley unveiled separate acquisitions of three plots of land in Cambodia. Taking into account a joint venture to develop another plot, this brings the total number of pipeline projects in Cambodia to four.\n\nIn China, Oxley entered an agreement to acquire a 10 per cent stake in GD Capital, which will ultimately hold the land use rights for two plots of land of 102,506 sqm and 80,599 sqm respectively, in Xuancheng Economic and Technical Development Zone, Anhui Province. Under the deal, Oxley will also be able to participate, with up to 30 per cent interest, in the development of five other land parcels in the same economic zone.\n\nThe company has a further five projects in Malaysia spread across Selangor, Johor Bahru, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. It marked its first overseas acquisition on May 29, when it bought a Malaysia-incorporated company that clinched the rights for a mixed development site in Kuala Lumpur. This brings its total pipeline of overseas projects to 12.\n\nWhile it will continue to seek out local opportunities, Oxley said that it will be adopting a prudent approach towards its local land acquisition strategy for financial year 2014. This is in light of the property cooling measures introduced, which have continued to soften overall demand in the local residential market.\n\nOxley intends to develop its investment properties at Stevens Road and Tampines Industrial Crescent. It will closely monitor the Singapore market for an opportune time to launch its three remaining pipeline residential projects at Oxley Rise, Ang Mo Kio Street 66 and Joo Chiat Road, it added.\n\nAs at Sept 30, total shareholder's equity stood at $524.8 million, compared with $288.5 million as at June 30. Net asset value per share was 16.6 cents, versus 8.1 cents a year ago, and earnings per share were 8.51 cents, versus 0.25 cents a year ago.\n\nThe counter closed two cents lower at 43.5 cents, before it released its results.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will push vacancy rates up, especially since population growth is slowing.\n\nMs Chew estimated that vacancy rates could surge to more than 10 per cent in 2015 and 2016 amid curbs on foreign demand, given that the secondary market has weakened following the government's multiple rounds of macro-prudential measures to cool the property market.\n\nOn the demand side, overall home ownership levels have risen to 90 per cent from the 10-year low of 87 per cent at the end of 2010. This suggests that pent-up demand for housing to live in has already been met, Mr Kit added.\n\nBoth economists noted that the risks of rapidly rising household debt in Singapore are ameliorated by the fact that households are not just asset-rich but also cash-rich, but Mr Kit noted that property has accounted for almost 80 per cent of the growth in household net worth since 2006. \"It follows that a fall in property prices in the next few years would also erode household net worth significantly,\" said Mr Kit.\n\nAlso, the distribution of debts and assets may be important: Recent figures from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the Credit Bureau show that rising debt burdens among those in their 30s to 50s and debt levels rising past the peak income age of 50 may signal that individuals are borrowing on their assets. If such loans are being used for investment properties, that could amplify the downward pressure on prices, said Mr Kit.\n\nOne participant pointed out that MAS has said that it is prepared to unwind some of the measures introduced when the property market cools, although others, such as the total debt servicing ratio, are longer-term ones to ensure prudent lending.\n\nBut others said that reversing such demand measures, while necessary, may be insufficient. One participant said: \"Once a condo is built, the supply is there. It's not clear to me that investor demand will come back; immigration policies are being tightened.\n\nAnother said: \"I'm not sure how much the government can do to support the market. It's already reached a bubble situation. I'm not sure how much can be unwound.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The ship was released after its cargo was transferred to another tanker.\n\nThe attacks follow three similar ship hijackings and gasoil thefts in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\"Given previous incidents occurred in clusters, this could be the start of a trend,\" said Mark Pearce, director of marketing for international risk consultant Drum Cussac.\n\nA security source with knowledge of previous attacks said it was unclear whether one or several gangs were responsible for the attacks. \"It has to be the work of a syndicate,\" said the source, citing the level of pre-planning and sophistication that went into the attacks.\n\nThe armed gangs could either have links to the crew onboard the hijacking target or inside knowledge about the ship and cargo, according to the Singapore-headquartered Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP).\n\nThese intelligence-led hijackings have involved \"the seizure of tug boats and barges for resale on the black market and the seizure of tankers so that their cargo, often marine gasoil, can be transferred and sold on the black market\", Mr Pearce said.\n\nTom Fulford-Smith, marine divisional director of international insurance at broker Cooper Gay (Hong Kong), said insurance premiums could rise if there were more attacks.\n\n\"If insurers see one or two (incidents), they are going to wonder if it's going to happen again,\" said Mr Fulford-Smith, whose views echoed those of other brokers including Marco Daini, director of marine cargo at Cambiaso Risso Asia.\n\nThe tanker hijacked on Nov 7 was the 3,254 deadweight tonne GPT-21 operated by Singapore firm Global Unique Petroleum, according to anti-piracy sources and ship tracking data.\n\nOne ship broker estimated the gasoil cargo was worth more than US$2.7 million if the Panama-flagged ship was fully loaded and all cargo stolen.\n\nPrevious tanker hijackings and cargo thefts have involved gangs gaining access to information on routings, what the vessel was carrying, origin and destination and possible locations where the oil transfer could be carried out, ReCAAP said.\n\nReCAAP had given details about the latest incident to Interpol because it involved cross-border crime. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The companies have applied to set up an entertainment complex in Tokyo's Odaiba area, according to the website of the country's cabinet secretariat.\n\nThey have teamed up for a possible casino resort, Reuters reported on Nov 8.

As a whole, we are still very confident of our business especially in tower crane rentals.\n\n\"This is also an opportunity to look at our internal processes and improve our business model.\"\n\nTat Hong's revenue slide was across its main crane rental and distribution segments, as well as its general equipment rental segment, mainly due to subdued mining and infrastructure activities in Australia as well as lower excavator sales in Indonesia caused by weak commodity prices.\n\nA bright spot was Tat Hong's tower crane rental segment, which recorded a 20 per cent rise in quarterly revenue to $22.6 million. The company said this was due to healthy demand for tower cranes from power generation, infrastructure and large commercial building projects in China.\n\nThe company said its results were also due to $5.2 million of mostly unrealised foreign exchange losses from Singapore dollar-denominated intercompany loans and payables for its Indonesian operations. The quarter's results were also up against record profits a year ago.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange effects, net operating profit improved 43 per cent quarter on quarter, management said.\n\nTat Hong, the largest listed crane supplier here, had surprised the market a few months ago with poor first-quarter results, causing a share price plunge. Said Mr Ng: \"People asked why we didn't let the market know earlier. But events caught us by surprise, everything came at the same time.\"\n\nFor the half year, revenue was down 16 per cent at $360.8 million while net profit fell 52 per cent to $16.5 million. Tat Hong declared an interim dividend of one cent a share, down from 1.5 cents a year ago.\n\nThe counter closed at 91.5 cents, down a cent.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

They might seek out Gennady Perepada.\n\n\"Believe me, it's absolutely normal people,\" Mr Perepada said of his clientele, in Russian-accented English. \"Absolutely nice and classy.\"\n\nBut what is normal about paying several thousand dollars per square foot for an apartment you might visit once or twice a year?\n\nAnd if someone's budget is that outsized, just imagine what his expectations are for the services his broker will render.\n\nMr Perepada - who prefers the term international real estate consultant - makes it his job not just to find his clients apartments but also to bend New York to their will, so that every wish is granted and every door is opened.\n\nLimousine doors and boutique doors and nightclub doors of course, but why stop there? \"New hip? No problem,\" Mr Perepada said. \"Wife needs plastic surgery? No problem.\"\n\nHe is just getting started. \"Deliver baby? I know all the doctors. Russian speak. Rabbi, mullah. Lenox Hill, your own floor - OK, after Beyonc\u00e9 that's hard,\" he conceded. But a private suite is, of course, no problem.\n\nClients like the ones that Mr Perepada serves were once rare in the upper echelons of the city's real estate. The most expensive buildings were filled with blue-blood Americans, and as for wealthy foreigners, they put their money in securities or Swiss banks.\n\nBut today, foreign capital is a crucial force in the luxury market.\n\nMr Perepada's clients are not after the addresses on Park or Fifth Avenue that previous generations coveted. For one thing, those buildings require a degree of financial disclosure that few Russian plutocrats would ever consider.\n\nInstead, they gravitate to condominiums that are new or still under construction. Many of those buildings actively seek out foreign investors. Some even send representatives to Moscow, among other destinations, to reach potential buyers where they live or play.\n\nEdward Mermelstein, a lawyer who represents investors abroad (including many of Mr Perepada's clients), has advised developers on how to reach their audience in exclusive Moscow lounges and bars.\n\n\"Their attention is typically very short,\" he said. \"If you catch them at the right moment by basically sitting looking at a floor plan, whether it's One57 or 432 Park - typically everyone knows each other in those rooms. They'll sit down for a cup of tea or coffee, and in those few moments you'll get enough attention to get a follow-up meeting.\"\n\nMr Perepada does not represent the oligarchs who grab headlines with their nine-figure purchases. His clients are not quite billionaires, he says, just \"regular millionaires\".\n\nHe knows what they like: high ceilings, at least 3,000 square feet, full service, great views and, most of all, ease of transaction. Their reverence for Central Park has attracted them to One57, the new tower on West 57th Street, though no keys have yet changed hands.\n\nBut he has also broadened their interest to buildings like 75 Wall Street and 60 Riverside Boulevard.\n\nHis iPhone is loaded with images of panoramic penthouse vistas, gracious interiors and Google Map street shots. By 4.30 am, he and the phone are typically in high gear, as he uses Skype and WhatsApp and FaceTime back and forth across time zones, in Ukrainian, Russian, Uzbek, Kazakh or even \"a bissel Yiddish\".\n\nWhen he immigrated from Ukraine in 1990, Mr Perepada took whatever job he could get. He worked at a flea market; he made deliveries; he drove a taxi. Along the way, he helped much of his family immigrate and settle in Brooklyn, where he still lives.\n\nTen years ago, he made his way into real estate, selling ordinary apartments. He liked the work but not the size of the commissions, so he set his sights higher.\n\nHe found the ultrarich to be surprisingly pleasant company. \"How they say in English, communicate?\" he asked. \"I know psychology. I love philosophy. I can talk to them about anything.\"\n\nHe makes himself useful by overseeing not only their real estate purchases, but also all of the secondary needs such purchases generate, like further construction, decorating, furniture and even clothes to hang in the closets. In the process, he becomes an expert in his clients' taste. What is their favourite type of bed linen? Their preferred silverware? Do they want Venetian stucco on the wall? No, wait, paint instead? OK, now change it to wallpaper? No problem.\n\nWhen they visit, he tries to anticipate their desires - not just making them a reservation at their favourite restaurant, but also remembering that they prefer the four-top by the window.\n\nHe collects a commission on apartment sales, split with the seller's broker. As for the deluxe concierge services that go along with them, he declines to say how, or whether, he charges. Discussing financial transactions between friends is uncouth.\n\n\"This is absolutely - I tell you, absolutely normal people,\" he said. \"Someone tells you different, they're lying.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The country accounts for 3 per cent of the world's almond production.\n\n\"Though we will no longer own the land, trees or the farming infrastructure, we continue to retain the production economics of the entire almond harvest from these orchards,\" said Olam.\n\nEarlier in the year, Olam had also conducted a sale and leaseback transaction of 1,940 ha of almond orchards in California, resulting in a one-time capital gain of $18.1 million after tax.\n\nThese are part of Olam's efforts to optimise its balance sheet, among other measures, in a bid to have positive free cash flow from the 2014 financial years onwards - a plan brought forward by a year after its strategic review following the attack by Muddy Waters last year.\n\nOlam shares closed trading unchanged at $1.47 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The police have charged a man with allegedly hacking the Ang Mo Kio Town Council website and rounded up another five suspects for attacking the websites belonging to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) and Istana.\n\nFor his alleged defacement of the town council's website, James Raj s/o Arokiasamy, 35, was charged under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act yesterday. A balding and skinny man whose birthday falls on National Day, James appeared in the Subordinate Court yesterday to hear the charge against him.\n\nHe is accused of defacing the town council website with an image of the Guy Fawkes mask and a banner of text referring to himself as \"The Messiah\". The Guy Fawkes mask is a symbol associated with hacktivist group Anonymous.\n\nJames, a Singaporean, is also believed to have been involved in the hacking of the websites belonging to The Straits Times Blog, People's Action Party Community Foundation and City Harvest Church co-founder Sun Ho.\n\nIf convicted as a first-time offender, James faces a fine of up to $10,000 or a prison term of up to three years, or both.\n\nHe also faces three drug charges for offences allegedly committed on May 25, 2011.\n\nYesterday, James's lawyer, M Ravi, told reporters: \"I can't confirm . . . whether (James) really is the Messiah or if he's linked to Anonymous at this stage.\"\n\nA day after the town council's website was hacked on Oct 28, a video featuring a Guy Fawkes mask-wearing man surfaced on YouTube, threatening the government with \"aggressive cyber intrusion\". James allegedly tampered with the website on the same date from an apartment in Kuala Lumpur where he had been hiding out, on the run from outstanding drug-related offences in Singapore.\n\nJames, who was arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Nov 4 with the help of the Malaysian police, claimed yesterday that he was assaulted during the arrest, sustained a concussion and denied medical attention for hours.\n\nFollowing a request by the prosecution yesterday, the court decided that James will be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for psychiatric evaluation. During the evaluation, he will not be permitted access to third parties, including the police or legal counsel.\n\nThe court's decision followed a disagreement about the state of the accused's mental health. The prosecution said that James had claimed to be suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - for which he was taking Ritalin - borderline personality disorder, suicidal tendencies and depression.\n\nJames said, however, that his account of his medical history had been \"taken out of context\" by the investigating officer, and that while he had suffered from ADHD, he had listed the other conditions as examples of what could happen if the disorder were not treated.\n\nIn response, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Tang Shangjun told the court that James was now \"changing his tune to say that he's mentally well at present\". \"He should be assessed by a medical professional,\" the DPP added.\n\nMr Ravi also told the court yesterday that he had been unable to gain access to James, despite the latter having been remanded for more than 48 hours.\n\nIn response, the prosecution cited case law in which individuals could be held for longer than that without access to counsel. Mr Ravi told reporters that he is considering filing an application with the High Court to challenge and clarify the current position on access to legal counsel.\n\nJames's next court date has been set for Nov 26.\n\nSeparately, five other Singaporean men aged 17 to 45 were identified by police as suspects in the cyberattacks on the PMO and Istana websites, which are not believed to be related to one another or to the hacking of the town council website. The police said yesterday that the five men are assisting them with investigations.\n\nApart from the website hackings, five other men, ranging from the ages of 21 to 26, were charged with vandalism of various properties, including the pavement outside Sunshine Plaza, yesterday.\n\nThe group allegedly spray-painted these structures with slogans linked to the Anonymous group. This bout of vandalism is also believed to be unrelated to the cyberattacks.\n\nA statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs yesterday warned that acts that disrupt information communications and technology systems have \"serious security, economic and social consequences for Singapore and Singaporeans\".\n\nIt added: \"We hope that the community will take a strong stand against such anti-social and criminal acts . . . We should not allow the actions of a few to affect our sense of safety and security in Singapore.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was offset by a difference in hedge rates between actual and forecast for the period.\n\nCRT has a policy to hedge at least 80 per cent of the expected cash flow distributions in the forecast period up to June 30, 2015.\n\nIn the meantime, gross revenue for the period met expectations, at 1,998 million yen, 0.4 per cent above forecast. Net property income was 1,269 million yen, or 3.1 per cent higher than forecast.\n\nThis was largely due to property management repair and other property expenses having positive variances, offset by the negative variance of increased utility expenses. Overall, property expenses for the period were below forecast by 4 per cent.\n\nLooking ahead, Jim Chang, chief executive officer and executive director of Croesus Retail Asset Management, the trustee-manager of CRT, said the trust will continue to focus on strengthening its portfolio.\n\nSpecifically, the trust will actively pursue acquisition opportunities, even as competition for acquiring real estate assets in Japan has increased in recent months.\n\nCRT financed its acquisition with a five-year Japanese yen debt maturing in 2018. To hedge its interest rate exposure, CRT has entered into five-year interest rate swaps.\n\nThe trust's distribution policy is to distribute all of its distributable income until June 30, 2015, and at least 90 per cent of its distributable income after.\n\nThe first distribution is for the period from the listing date to Dec 31, and will be paid on or before March 31, 2014.\n\nCRT listed on May 10; the forecast figures are extracted from the prospectus and pro-rated to 144 days.\n\nIts counter ended one cent higher at 87.5 Singapore cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But you can never be sure.\n\n\"And therefore some measures when you do it, then you have to calibrate the quantum. But . . . so far, so good . . . As you can see, I'm now more relaxed, my hair has even turned black,\" he added, drawing laughter from the House.\n\nHe also said he shared Mr De Souza's wish to \"try and achieve a sustainable, perhaps even boring, property market\".\n\n\"But for a small Singapore market that is plugged into the global system, you know that there are many factors which are quite completely outside, beyond our control.\"\n\nMr Khaw also cited data to show that the cooling measures have had their intended effect of dampening foreign demand and reducing speculation. Since 2011, foreign buying in Singapore's private housing market has shrunk, both in proportion and in absolute numbers.\n\nThe proportion of purchases by foreigners (who are not Singapore permanent residents) has fallen from 17 per cent in 2011 to 7 per cent in the third quarter of this year. Over the same period, the number of purchases by such foreigners has also declined from about 1,400 per quarter to 330 in Q3 this year.\n\nMr Khaw also gave figures on subsales, which are often seen as a gauge of the level of speculative activity in the property market. Subsales as a proportion of all private housing transactions dropped from 7.6 per cent in 2011 to 4.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2013. In absolute numbers, subsale transactions have fallen from about 670 per quarter in 2011 to 181 in Q3 2013.\n\nHighlighting policies reflecting the priority to support home ownership for Singaporeans, Mr Khaw said: \"Only citizens are allowed to buy new HDB flats and provided grants to purchase resale HDB flats.\n\n\"Almost all landed housing can only be purchased by Singaporeans. The private condominium market allows foreigner buying and the cooling measures have moderated their impact. The resultant trend is encouraging but we continue to closely monitor the market and we will not hesitate to act further when necessary.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was largely due to Yancoal, which had reported a loss of A$749.4 million (S$873.8 million) for the six months ended June, due to a weakened Australian dollar against the greenback and impairment of mining tenements. Noble owns 13 per cent of the Australia-listed coal producer. It recorded US$822,000 in share of profits from associates last year.\n\nStripping out the losses from associates, Noble's \"core\" net profit is US$113 million, the highest since the third quarter of 2010, it said.\n\nIts agriculture segment - which has been in the red for the first two quarters - is \"showing signs of recovery\".\n\nThe division turned in an operating income of US$14 million, down 80 per cent from a year ago.\n\nIts Brazilian sugar mills are seeing improved efficiencies as they ramp up volumes, said its CEO, Yusuf Alireza.\n\nNoble's grains and oilseeds business, which had previously suffered from logistics issues in Brazil, also rebounded as the firm re-aligned some of its origination flows.\n\nNoble has completed its new crushing plants in Ukraine, Brazil and South Africa. The first is already operational, while the latter two are going through a \"pre-startup review\", it said.\n\nIn its energy segment, which includes coal, oil, gas and power, operating income rose 55 per cent to US$339.4 million, despite a drop in tonnage.\n\nNoble's metals, minerals and ores (MMO) segment, meanwhile, saw a 22 per cent decline in operating income to US$20.7 million, in spite of a small rise in revenue.\n\nIts initiatives to deepen and broaden its business capabilities are gaining momentum, said Mr Alireza.\n\nThe group in September won a tight contest to replace Glencore as the buyer of zinc in Europe from Nyrstar, the world's largest producer of the metal.\n\nIt is also investing US$500 million in a new mining venture X2 Resources, set up by former Xstrata chief Mick Davis. These mark its efforts to expand its MMO business beyond Noble's core products of aluminium and iron ore.\n\n\"Our relationship with (X2 Resources) would be both as investor but also as supply chain manager for their assets,\" said Mr Alireza in a conference call, adding that Noble expects returns from this investment to meet or exceed Noble's target of 20-plus per cent.\n\nNoble's shares gained 1.5 cent to close at $1.08 yesterday, before the announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Loomis, Sayles & Co says there are attractive returns in fixed income\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nEMERGING equities are generally out of favour at the moment, but Mark Mobius, executive chairman of the Templeton Emerging Markets Group, is optimistic that the current underperformance is temporary. Elsewhere, Loomis, Sayles & Co portfolio manager Elaine Stokes says there are opportunities for \"nice, positive returns'' in fixed income even in an environment of gradually rising interest rates.\n\nIn the year-to-date, emerging market equities have lost 5.9 per cent based on the MSCI index, compared to a 26 per cent rise in the S&P 500 and a 19 per cent gain in the MSCI World index. Most strategists continue to tell investors to underweight emerging equities in favour of developed market equities.\n\nMr Mobius says the Templeton emerging markets group continues to see inflows, and argues that the macroeconomic fundamentals of emerging countries remain stronger than those of developed markets.\n\n\"What I see going forward is a very active and positive equity market globally. A lot of people fail to recognise that in the last two years, the US has been on a very strong bull run... That affects markets around the world and the emerging markets will get their fair share. We're quite optimistic.\"\n\nHe says that in the last 12 years, there were only two when EMs had underperformed - in 2011 and 2007. \"Emerging markets' average economic growth is 4.4 per cent compared to 1 per cent in developed markets. Debt to GDP levels are going down, not up. Foreign reserves are going up and greater than developed markets.\"\n\nEM valuations have generally risen, he says. Dividend yields stand at 2 to 3 per cent, and at about 4 per cent in frontier markets.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch's fund management survey in October found that investors and asset allocators indicate that they see value in the region, but the signals are not all positive. A net 38 per cent of global respondents say emerging equities were the most undervalued. In contrast, a net 63 per cent point to the US as the most overvalued region.\n\nBut views on China worsened, and asset allocators further reduced their exposure to commodities, which are a proxy for emerging market sentiment.\n\nMr Mobius says he is concerned that investors - both institutional and retail - equate risk with volatility, which raises fear.\n\n\"The unfortunate factor in our business is that in their effort to explain performance, consultants to big institutions have defined risk as volatility... If you have more volatility the risk number increases and people shy away, which is not what they should do. They should buy at low points in this volatility.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Loomis, Sayle and Co portfolio manager Elaine Stokes argues that fixed income returns can actually be attractive despite a slow-growth environment. \"Growth is strong enough that we might raise rates, but not so strong that we'd raise them a lot. That environment is actually good for bonds, where if you hold on to the bonds and get the yield, and have some spread compression - because we do have growth, and there are winners - you can still get nice, positive returns.\"\n\nLoomis, Sayles & Co manages about US$189 billion in assets, invested in equities and bonds. It is an affiliate of Natixis Global Asset Management, which manages a total of about US$838 billion. Ms Stokes was a speaker last week at a Natixis symposium on durable portfolio construction.\n\nThe sweet spot for fixed income returns, she says, is in the BBB to B space. But outperformance will need careful research. \"We need to be a lot more selective, patient and disciplined in picking credits... the BBB to B space is where we think you can get the yield you need in a rising rate environment for solid, positive returns.\"\n\nRising rates, she says, are not necessarily bad for fixed income as long as the rise is gradual. This year, 10-year Treasuries have already risen from about 1.6 per cent earlier this year to around 2.75 per cent, even as the market speculates on when QE (quantitative easing) tapering will occur.\n\n\"The bad scenario is when rates spike because you have nowhere to hide. But if rates go up gradually and we have growth, which is usually the reason why rates rise, you can also have spread compression.''\n\nTen-year Treasuries could rise to 3 or 3.5 per cent next year. \"To counter that you need spread compression. Could we get 50 basis points in compression in the bonds we're buying in the BBB to B space if we have growth? Absolutely.\n\n\"So you can still make your yield. It's when rates spike and the Federal Reserve finds itself behind the game, running to catch up and raising rates very fast - that's bad for fixed income.''\n\nShe expects that economic data may not be supportive of aggressive tapering or rising rates. This is because improvements in productivity pose headwinds in terms of unemployment. The latter is a key indicator of the Fed's course of action.\n\nShe believes it is too early at the moment to get heavily into emerging market sovereigns. The emerging markets, she says, are grappling with having to \"reset\" their economies as China restructures to focus on domestic consumption rather than exports. Until recently, most EM countries have thrived on supplying parts and materials to China for export.\n\n\"EM countries need to figure out what to do...

He thought nothing of the food and drink and shower and business facilities on tap - until he struck out on his own in 1992 and was compelled to fly economy for the sake of his pocketbook.\n\nIt was then that the Johor-born Malaysian, now 56, began thinking about it seriously. He said: \"It was frustrating for businessmen like me in economy. There was no place from where we could send faxes or to take a shower or to rest. I used to have to steal electricity to charge my computer.\"\n\nHis \"eureka\" moment was tied to a simple truth - that everyone, even economy class passengers, needed an oasis in airports and would be willing to pay for the privilege.\n\nAnd so Plaza Premium Lounge Management (PPL) was born. The firm, incorporated in Hong Kong where Mr Song lives, is a pioneer in the concept of the airport-based, premium service lounge for airline passengers - regardless of airline or class of travel.\n\nIt clearly plugged an area of need: in its 15-year history, PPL has grown into a HK$1 billion (S$161 million) enterprise with a network of 110 lounges in 29 countries. It has offices from Mumbai to Melbourne and from London to Langkawi; it hires more than 2,000 people worldwide and serves more than four million passengers a year.\n\nA clutch of imitators have appeared, but PPL remains the dominant player in retail aviation - it is the first choice in new airport terminals. Heathrow, for example, recently tapped him to run a lounge in its new terminal building.\n\nThe firm has grown exponentially in the last five years, aided by corporate cost cutting after the global financial crisis - resulting in fewer business class flights - and the advent of the Asian budget traveller.\n\nMr Song does not intend to slow down his expansion anytime soon. With more than 700 international airports around the world, he believes he has uncovered only the tip of the iceberg. He is planning for 50 more outlets by 2015.\n\nHe wasn't always in such a \"sunrise\" business. By the time he was 33, he was a senior vice-president with Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong and not seeing much of a way up that corporate ladder.\n\nIn 1992, he struck out on his own, creating instant offices by renting out vacant office spaces, furnishing them and then leasing them out as office spaces in move-in condition.\n\nIt was a good business. Over the next five years, he set up 14 such offices throughout South-east Asia, but once he hit upon the idea of running premium lounges in airports, he sold off this business.\n\nHe said that on hindsight, the business model for airport lounges seemed like a no-brainer. \"Eighty-five per cent of all passengers fly economy, but no one was looking after them. Waiting around, especially in a hub airport, takes a toll on mind and body.\"\n\nIt was 1997 and two new airports - the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok - were opening within weeks of each other. He submitted his plans for both and they were accepted, he said. \"But it was expensive, they insisted on quality. I used all my life savings - the lounge in KLIA cost RM2 million (S$777,000), and the one for the Hong Kong airport, RM4-5 million.\"\n\nWith money invested, he went through nail-biting tension. In nine months, the lounges began turning around. With its success at the two airports, PPL's business became self-generating. Airport managements, seeing the value-added service he was capable of delivering, came a-knocking. Then, airlines began engaging PPL to manage their lounges.\n\nMr Song also got into setting up transit hotels, where passengers are offered small, clean rooms where they can take a shower and rest between flights.\n\nBut ultimately, he said, the business has simply been demand-driven. \"More than half the world's middle class who fly are from China and they have money. That's why we've grown so fast. In the first 10 years, we had 50 outlets. Over the next five, we simply doubled the number.\"\n\nAsked whether he would consider listing his company, he replied: \"I don't need to. Money isn't everything anymore. This - I enjoy it, it's become a process of self-actualisation. I am Malaysian but I am now all over the world.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Cost increases this quarter were across the board in sales and marketing, general and administrative, and research and development.\n\nThe company is taking action \"immediately\" such that the expense proportion can be expected to come down for the rest of the year, Dr Wang said in an analyst conference call yesterday evening.\n\nQuarterly revenue was up 4 per cent at US$83 million. This was due to product revenue going up 10 per cent to US$72.2 million, driven by sales in the company's main heart stent products.\n\nA newly acquired cardiac diagnostic business, Spectrum Dynamics, also brought in US$2.4 million of revenue for the quarter.\n\nLicensing and royalties revenue, however, fell 25 per cent to US$10.8 million - a decline management said was moderating.\n\nDBS analyst Alfie Yeo said earnings are likely to be soft going forward, with sales for the company's main product, heart stents, facing lower selling prices. \"Spectrum Dynamics looks to have good potential for growth but its contribution is still small,\" he added.\n\nFor the half year, revenue was down 4 per cent at US$159.7 million, while net profit was down 62 per cent at US$23.4 million.

After a two-year pause in fare adjustments, commuters will have to get used to higher fares. Moreover, it was revealed in Parliament that the projected fare increase next year may be bigger than usual for full-fare paying commuters. This is in part to make up for the stagnant fares in the last two years, as well as due to enhanced benefits for tertiary students and pre-schoolers, among other groups.\n\nFortunately for full-fare paying commuters, the fee hike next year is likely to be capped at the average of this year's wage rise. The remainder of this will be rolled over to 2015. This cap is aimed at making the fare increase manageable for full-fare paying consumers and not eat into their real incomes.\n\nPublic transport operators are also joining the social bandwagon; it was revealed that they would donate part of the revenue raised from the proposed fare hikes to a fund that would be used to enhance travel vouchers for the poor. While this is admirable, more emphasis should be placed in improving the take-up of these vouchers as opposed to expanding the pool. Only about half of the 200,000 transport vouchers were taken up in 2011.\n\nMore notable is the government's acceptance of the recommendation made last week by the Fare Review Mechanism Committee, that it would introduce two new fare concessions - for low-income workers and commuters with disabilities - and that it would fund these concessions.\n\nThe most notable announcement, however, was the government's acknowledgement that it would be funding these new concessions through its tax revenue. This is the first time that the government would dip into tax revenues to subsidise transport fares. It may signal a reconsideration of how tax revenue may be utilised in the future - to achieve social goals through targeted subsidies, as opposed to the traditional spending on infrastructure and economic plans.\n\nThe use of subsidies is normal practice in many countries, particularly in Western advanced economies, but Singapore has traditionally used them very sparingly - and should continue to do so. However, public transport fits the bill as an area where subsidies, if limited and properly targeted, can help achieve significant social benefits that exceed their cost.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The consortium will then lease the space back to Time Warner Inc.\n\nA source close to the deal said that GIC will be forking out US$400 million, which will give it a \"substantial stake\" of the Grade A office space Time Warner Inc is selling.\n\nThe consortium is said to have fought off offers from interested parties, including a sovereign wealth fund.\n\nEarlier this year, Time Warner was said to be close to selling the space for US$1.3 billion to a group called Related Companies, a privately owned real estate firm headquartered in New York City and the lead developer of the Time Warner Center.\n\nTime Warner was then supposed to have leased the space back for five years, and then to move to a 2.4 million sq ft tower along the Hudson River called the Hudson Yards, which is being developed by Related, said media reports.\n\nThe Hudson Yards is a joint venture between the New York City Department of City Planning and Metropolitan Transportation Authority to encourage business development on Manhattan's far west side.\n\nThe New York Times said in July that Time Warner's brokers, Douglas Harmon and Amy Spies of Eastdil Secured, had lined up a second buyer for its current space in case the acquisition by Related fell through.\n\nGIC declined to comment on the deal, but a source said the location and expectations of an above-average net yield were the lures behind this acquisition.\n\nThe source said: \"It is one of the best office buildings in New York City in terms of the quality of the asset, the amenities and the view. I mean, Central Park is gorgeous.\"\n\nThe source added that the property now housed a group of \"top-notch tenants, so this makes it a very compelling opportunity for GIC\".\n\nThe Time Warner Center, completed in 2004, has a pair of towers bridged by a multi-storey atrium that is home to upscale retail shops such as Armani, Hugo Boss and Thomas Pink; it also houses the three-Michelin starred restaurant Per Se and Japanese restaurant Masa, which is considered one of the world's most expensive.\n\nThe towers have a total floor area of 2.8 million sq ft, housing offices, the Mandarin Oriental New York hotel and residential condominium units. The apartments there are known to be home to an international crowd, including Asia's and Russia's wealthiest families. A unit on the 54th floor was recently listed for US$50 million, or US$13,900 psf.\n\nIf successful, this deal for GIC would follow on the heels of GIC Real Estate's acquisition of a 47-storey, 974,251 sq ft international Grade A office tower in Jakarta's Central Business District for an undisclosed sum.\n\nAn earlier report had put the Jakarta deal at around US$350 million.\n\nThe building is part of a mixed-use project by Greenland Rajawali Utama, which is majority-controlled by the Rajawali Group and its property subsidiary.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is a very potent trend that may affect the industry in the medium to long run and the group is hopeful that the government will study this carefully,\" said CDL's executive chairman Kwek Leng Beng.\n\nHe also touched on private housing unit oversupply concerns and highlighted that the property cooling measures are beginning to bite.\n\nThe group has remained more conservative in tendering for land this year. Instead, it has has been focusing on developing its overseas growth engines.\n\nA segmental breakdown of profit before income tax (including share of after-tax profit of associates and jointly controlled entities) showed that profit from property development rose to $88.9 million in Q3 2013 from $76.5 million in Q3 2012.\n\nHowever, pre-tax profit from hotel operations fell to $49.3 million from $55.7 million.\n\nProfit from rental properties at $32.2 million was less than half the $71.2 million in the year-earlier quarter. The decrease was due to lower gains booked on the disposal of non-core investment properties; in Q3 2013, gains were recognised on the sale of only one strata floor in GB Building while in the year-earlier quarter, profit was recognised on disposal of several strata units in Citimac Industrial Complex, Elite Industrial Building II, GB Building and Pantech Business Hub.\n\nGroup revenue dipped 1.2 per cent year on year to $822.7 million in Q3 2013.\n\nEarnings per share fell to 13.3 cents in Q3 2013 from 14.8 cents in Q3 2012. Net asset value per share rose to $8.36 as at end-September 2013 from $8.03 as at end-December 2012. The counter closed one cent higher at $10.08 yesterday. CDL released its results after trading hours.\n\nFor the first nine months of 2013, revenue fell 3.2 per cent year on year to $2.4 billion, though net profit rose 7.7 per cent to $462 million. Pre-tax profit from property development fell to $241.8 million for the first nine months from $273.7 million previously. Notwithstanding the good take-up rate for residential sales launched by the group this year, it was unable to recognise profits as construction of these projects has yet to begin or reach recognition stage. Examples include Echelon, Bartley Ridge, D'Nest and Jewel @ Buangkok.\n\nThere was also no profit recognition for three executive condominium (EC) projects, two of which are fully sold (The Rainforest and Blossom Residences) and one substantially sold (Lush Acres), until completion of construction, in accordance with prevailing accounting treatment. However, nine-month pre-tax profits from rental properties nearly doubled to $252 million from $135.1 million. Profit from hotel operations slipped to $130.3 million from $166.5 million.\n\nIn London, subject to planning approval, the group intends to develop a luxury residential project on a prime, multi-storey car park site at 28 Pavillion Road in Knightsbridge that it bought in September. Located in close proximity to Harrods, the freehold site cost the group \u00a380 million (S$159 million).\n\n\"Though buying land in a rising market in London remains challenging, the group is actively pursuing a few other projects for strategic acquisitions. It is confident that it will be able to secure a few more sites in due course,\" CDL said.\n\nIn China, assuming favourable market conditions, sales will begin next year at Eling Residences in Chongqing and the residential component of Hong Leong City Center in Jinji Lake in Suzhou. Sales in the residential component of the Huang Huayuan project, also in Chongqing, will probably start in 2015.\n\nAt home, the group will monitor the market and not rush into the launch of South Beach Residences. The project remains on track to complete in 2015.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But soon, the process may be as simple as logging on to a website. In an effort to change the way the notoriously secretive industry finds investors, several startups are pitching online matchmaking services to the world's biggest private equity players. The task is daunting. Ever since the industry found its footing in the 1980s, private equity firms have relied on placement agents - essentially, middlemen - to find investors and raise billions of dollars for buyout funds, collecting large fees. The placement agents have become a powerful force, controlling access to the top funds.\n\nStartup companies are eager to capture a share of the business by connecting investors directly to funds. The efforts come soon after a rule change that took effect in September, when the Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed an 80-year-old ban on advertising by private funds.\n\nNow hedge funds and venture capital and private equity funds can let the public know they are looking for money, though they are still allowed to accept money only from those who are financially suited for such alternative investments.\n\nThese sectors have been a bit slow in taking advantage of the new rule, which stems from the Jump-Start Our Business Startups Act, or the JOBS Act. One small firm in New York, FF Venture Capital, announced in October that it was raising a fund, seeking US$50 million, but it was the only such firm to do so.\n\n\"No fund manager is going to want to put something on the Goodyear Blimp or billboards,\" said Jeff Berman, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance. \"They are looking for highly sophisticated investors who value discretion - and people who have the wherewithal to honour the commitments they make.\"\n\nMany of the matchmaking services are so new that potential client firms have not had a chance to see how effective they are. Several of the entrepreneurs in the matchmaking game are working with traditional placement agents, rather than in direct competition with them.\n\nOne of these startups, iCapital Network, which is planning to release a private test version to certain clients this month, has backing from some top placement agents, including Eaton Partners and a group at Credit Suisse. For a subscription of US$12,000 to US$100,000 a year, private equity firms will be able to list confidential information about their funds on the platform - including marketing documents and performance data - for prospective investors to browse.\n\nThe Credit Suisse group, which has helped raise more than US$400 billion for clients since its founding in 1994, has a 30 per cent stake in iCapital, said Dan Vene, the firm's chief executive.\n\n\"We can't replicate the 70 people working the phones for you,\" said Mr Vene, who formerly worked at Eaton Partners and the investment firm Fir Tree Partners. \"But what we can do is come up with innovative ways to tell your story.\"\n\nAnd with the rapid growth of private equity, there could be plenty of opportunities. As of January, 1,949 private equity funds globally were seeking capital from investors, compared with 1,845 the previous year, according to data from Preqin, a financial information provider.\n\nAs these services grow, they could bring potential new clients to private equity, said Michael Harrell, co-chairman of the private equity group at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton.\n\n\"These online platforms could reach out and pool all kinds of individual investors to invest in private equity funds that historically wouldn't have bothered with large numbers of small investors,\" Mr Harrell said.\n\nThe sites say they vet investors to make sure they are \"accredited\", by the SEC's definition, to remove a potential chore for the private equity firms. But even if individual investors meet the definition of accredited - with a net worth of more than US$1 million or annual income above US$200,000 - private equity still might not be appropriate for them, said J Robert Brown Jr, a professor at the University of Denver's law school.\n\n\"They use dollar amounts as a substitute for sophistication,\" said Prof Brown, who serves as secretary of the SEC's investor advisory committee, a group created under the Dodd-Frank overhaul. \"There will be firms out there that are less than reputable that use this as a way of sweeping in funds from people that are not particularly sophisticated.\"\n\nCompanies that serve the private equity industry see online matchmaking as lucrative. Even Preqin, based in London, sees potential in the sector. It has signed up more than 100 fund managers and more than 3,000 institutional investors for a platform that started in a test version this month, charging the managers a subscription fee but providing complementary access to investors, according to Tim Friedman, who oversees the firm's US operations.\n\nAnother service, Palico, with offices in London, Paris and New York, has been operational since May 2012, with about 1,300 members. Big sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, including the California Public Employees' Retirement System, use the platform to find private equity opportunities they might otherwise have overlooked.\n\nThe trick for firms in the budding sector may be to distinguish themselves from placement agents without alienating them. Though iCapital works closely with placement agents, it is also planning a placement agent service of its own - for smaller investors, Mr Vene said. Those investors would be too small to fall under the purview of a large placement agent, he said.\n\n\"This doesn't cannibalize our core business. I think it can be additive,\" said John Robertshaw, co-head of the private fund group at Credit Suisse, which is invested in iCapital. \"It's going to create, we think, significantly more efficiencies.\"\n\nPalico, too, emphasises that it offers a different service. \"At the end of the day,\" said Antoine Dr\u00e9an, the company's founder, \"Palico is more like a dating service.\" - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Operating expenses rose 16 per cent or $0.95 million but administrative expenses fell 20 per cent or $0.62 million.\n\nDepreciation expense had fallen as certain machinery, equipment and marine lifestock were fully depreciated. A stronger yuan against the Sing dollar also boosted results.\n\nThe company is also involved in the bidding of a project, which it did not name, paying $21.2 million in a deposit. This boosted other current assets to $21.8 million.\n\nThe deposit payment, an investing outflow, cancelled out net operating cashflow of $20.7 million for the period. Cash and equivalents at end-September thus stood at $101.1 million, almost unchanged from a quarter ago. This translates to 12 cents a share. The company has no debt.\n\nFor the nine months to Sept 30, revenue was up 32 per cent at $58.2 million, and net profit was up 72 per cent at $28.5 million.\n\nQuarterly earnings per share was 1.81 cents, and 3.38 cents for the nine months ended Sep 30.\n\nStraco closed at 43.5 cents yesterday, up 3.5 cents or 8.8 per cent, before the results were out.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/would-could-should-fn-default", "site_title": "Would, could, should F&N default?", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWould, could, should F&N default?\n\nPublished\n\nTue, Nov 12, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFRASER and Neave's (F&N) alleged threats of voluntary default will come into focus this week as the company meets shareholders and bondholders to discuss its plans to list its property arm.\n\nBondholders are up in arms over what they feel is a deeply unfair attack on their rights, while minority shareholders wonder what all of this actually means for the business.\n\nWhat those stakeholders have to do, however, is to look beyond the moralising and focus on more fundamental questions: What will it cost F&N to default, and what will F&N gain if it does so?\n\nAnd F&N on its part can afford to be more transparent.\n\nF&N shareholders meet today to vote on the planned splitting of the business into the Frasers Centrepoint (FCL) property unit and F&N, which will retain the beverage and publishing businesses. Given that Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi now controls north of 90 per cent of the company following his successful takeover of the company earlier in the year, approval for the split is already assured. But a number of minority shareholders have told The Business Times that they still have important questions about the split.\n\nAt the top of the list is the ongoing negotiations with bondholders. Simply splitting F&N's businesses will trigger a technical default on about $808.25 million of the company's outstanding bond issues, so F&N is offering bondholders a deal in exchange for the required waivers and the right to buy back the bonds.\n\nThe problem is that what F&N is offering holders of its 6 per cent and 5.5 per cent bonds is below market value - about 103 per cent of par offered compared with 109 per cent of par on the market - so bondholders of those notes are understandably unhappy with the offer.\n\nBut what has really gotten the pitchforks out is that F&N has allegedly told bondholders that if they do not accept the deal, the company will go ahead with the FCL listing anyway and trigger a default, in which case bondholders will only receive par, which is an even worse deal.\n\nThe reason why F&N's alleged stance is unusual and particularly hard to swallow for noteholders is that F&N is still solvent. A number of news reports this week said that some noteholders have raised the issue with regulators.\n\nBondholders and minority shareholders want to know whether F&N is really prepared to strategically default. Equity holders, in particular, also want to know what a strategic default will mean for the company, because while bondholders only have to deal with the default itself, shareholders have to deal with the aftermath as well.\n\nMinority shareholders at today's extraordinary general meeting therefore need to find answers from management. What will a strategic default mean for F&N, especially with regard to the company's other obligations? Will there be accelerations to contend with? Existing deals rendered invalid?\n\nOn the flip side, what will separating the property and beverage businesses mean for F&N? With F&N's ownership of Myanmar Brewery now at the centre of a separate dispute, does that change the dynamics of the business?\n\nSome of those questions have been asked, but F&N has largely kept mum about the details. Even taking into account tactical reasons for limited disclosures, minority shareholders deserve better transparency to help them understand what is truly at stake, and whether they want to stay in. The point of the questions is to try and figure out whether listing FCL despite a strategic default is worth the costs for F&N.\n\nAnd costs there will be. The reason why strategic defaults are so rarely used is because they are often not worth the trouble.\n\nSome of the costs are more immediate, in the form of cross defaults and other accelerated obligations. Strategic defaults can also have longer-term implications, putting off future creditors and making capital more difficult to access.\n\nA study by scholars at the London Business School in 2007 found that credit spreads tend to be wider - by as much as 20 basis points in extreme cases - for borrowers when the threat of a strategic default is higher. This is something to bear in mind especially when FCL, being a property developer, will probably have to continue to tap capital markets in the future.\n\nBondholders and shareholders should resist the temptation to cast the issue in ethical or moral terms, because defaulting is fundamentally a critical loss-limiting tool.\n\nAnd strategic defaults are just that - strategic calculations of cost versus benefits. Trying to moralise the debate also tends to blur the bigger picture. Would a strategic default hurt bondholders? Perhaps, but perhaps doing so leads to the best outcome for equity holders. Whose interests come first?\n\nStrategic defaults are also not an invention of F&N. During and after the global financial crisis, the United States witnessed a wave of strategic defaults by homeowners as home values tumbled to a point where it no longer made sense to keep paying mortgages. More recently, commodity traders, such as Noble Group and Olam International, struggled with cotton growers and traders who chose to default because cotton prices had fallen to the point where it did not make sense to meet obligations.\n\nIn all of those cases, strategic defaulters calculated that the benefits of default justified its high price. Stakeholders of F&N this week have to solve that equation.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We will continue our efforts to expand our yield-accretive asset base, and look to enhance our existing income-generating portfolio through both acquisitions within India's growing healthcare market and additions of beds and facilities.\"\n\nRHT said it continued to maintain a positive outlook on the largely defensive healthcare sector in India. Long-term prospects for the sector remain promising because of a confluence of factors.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Other Blackstone funds own a company hauling fuel between US ports.\n\nThe nation's highest oil and gas production in more than three decades is enticing investors to ships hauling processed fuels because the US bans most crude exports. Demand for the carriers is accelerating at a time when most of the maritime industry is slumping.\n\nMr Fredriksen, the richest shipping investor, is building his biggest-ever fleet. Mr Ross, founder of WL Ross & Co, took control of an LPG carrier in October 2012, about a year after investing in product tankers.\n\n\"They have all seen that shipping has been dragged through the mud,\" said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo, whose recommendations returned 24 per cent in the past year. \"What's going on in US energy makes companies that can export fuels, gas and even chemicals among the industry's more attractive investments.\"\n\nThe boom in US energy production is lowering feedstock prices for refineries, allowing them to ramp up exports of petroleum products to destinations including China, Brazil, Venezuela and Nigeria.\n\n\"The sudden boom in US product exports has been very attractive to investors who have a lot of cash to invest and are looking for assets that will give them returns,\" said Nikhil Jain, an analyst at Drewry Shipping Consultants in New Delhi. \"This is a market that is able to offer much better prospects compared to other markets in shipping.\"\n\nWhile US fuel cargo exports are accelerating, ship owners also need Europe's economy to return to growth. The continent accounts for about 31 per cent of all seaborne oil-product imports and the 20.8 million tonnes of LPG shipments that it would buy this year equate to about 47 per cent of all cargoes.\n\nThe economy of the 17-nation euro area contracted for seven consecutive quarters through September, official data and the mean of 29 economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg showed before third-quarter figures due on Nov 14.\n\nBlackstone is a shareholder of Hafnia Tankers, a Hellerup, Denmark-based shipowner that sold equity in a private placement last month. Other investors include Barclays Natural Resources and Tufton Oceanic, a hedge fund group and private equity firm.\n\nThe largest crude carriers earned US$8,558 a day. Running costs for the ships, including crew and repairs, came to US$10,350 last year, according to Moore Stephens, a UK accountant that tracks industry expenses. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

We will do Singapore proud and we will also keep our shareholders happy,\" he said.\n\nOCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien added that the bank's other sporting commitments such as the annual OCBC Cycle Singapore and the Great Eastern Women's Run would continue as planned.\n\nAs expected, the naming rights to the National Stadium were not included as part of the package in line with the desire to preserve its identity as a Singapore icon.\n\nThe government also revealed yesterday for the first time that the Singapore Indoor Stadium, too, would not be named after a commercial entity for the same reasons.\n\nActing Culture, Community and Youth Minister Lawrence Wong, who was present at the signing ceremony, let on that either stadium could possibly be named after a prominent personality in future in order to commemorate him or her.\n\nThe practice of naming sports facilities is new in Singapore, although many major markets around the world, such as the United States, have been doing so for years.\n\nIn July this year, the Texas-based telecommunications firm AT&T reportedly agreed to pay as much as US$19 million per year to rename the Dallas Cowboys football team's stadium as the AT&T Stadium.\n\nLast year, Emirates Airlines extended its partnership with Arsenal that ensured the English Premier League club's home will be known as the Emirates Stadium all the way until 2028.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will then be up to local government officials to enact the new policy guidelines.\n\nThe statement declared that \"decisive results\" will be achieved by 2020.\n\nExpectations were high for the Plenum, which comes at a time when China is struggling with debt, low productivity, overcapacity and slower growth. After 30 years of double-digit growth, the country is under domestic pressure to shift to a more sustainable model with consumption playing a bigger role.\n\nFor the past year the new President, Xi Jinping, and his Premier, Li Keqiang, have been adamant about the need to reform. This implies dismantling the country's huge state monopolies, granting rights to its millions of migrant workers uprooted from their original home, pushing ahead with the reform of land ownership and letting the market play its role.\n\nThese measures should unleash savings, increase productivity and give bigger spending power to the country's millions of farmers and migrant workers, many of them left out of three decades of growth.\n\nThird plenums have traditionally been used to launch major economic reforms. It was during such a meeting that Deng Xiaoping set China on its \"opening up and reform\" policy. Ahead of the meeting, senior officials including Xi Jinping had said the scope of reform would be unprecedented.\n\nAnalysts will not be looking for big announcements from the plenum, but more for a change of vocabulary and a general reform agenda that will point to the party's commitment to change.\n\nIn previous policy statements, the Communist Party had often described markets as playing a \"basic\" role in allocating resources. In contrast, yesterday's statement pointed to a \"decisive\" role.\n\nMost analysts expect reform policies to first focus on a greater role of markets in the financial sector, including the convertibility of the exchange rate and liberalisation of interest rates and a change in governance of public finances, before the government tackles the sensitive issues of state-owned enterprises and land rights.\n\nThe party said in the statement that while it would encourage private enterprise, the dominance of the \"public sector\" in the economy would be maintained.

Delta is seeking a yield of 6.9 per cent, compared with 7.5 per cent for its bank loans, she said. That would narrow the gap with South Africa's second-biggest real estate company, Redefine Properties Ltd, which sold 425 million rand of similar-maturity notes at 6.5 per cent in March.\n\nOffice demand from state-owned companies including utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd and Transnet SOC Ltd, the ports and rail operator, will help Delta grow faster than South Africa's gross domestic product, forecast to expand 2.1 per cent this year, Ms Corbett said. Government leases extending until at least 2018 accounted for 64 per cent of revenue for the six months ended August, she said.\n\n\"The 6.9 per cent is achievable,\" Geoff Noble, a portfolio manager at Grindrod Asset Management, who plans to buy Delta bonds, said in an e-mailed response to questions on Nov 6. \"Delta does have a long lease-expiry profile underpinned by government leases, which should assist them in achieving their target rate.\"\n\nDelta had utilised 91 per cent of 2.18 billion rand in existing bank facilities and commercial paper at the end of August, according to an Oct 29 earnings statement. A 180 million rand loan with Nedbank Group Ltd maturing in 2017 carries a fixed rate of 7.55 per cent, the company said.\n\nOut of 271,447 square metres of gross lettable area that Delta owns and manages in South Africa, 55 per cent is leased as office space to the government, the company said in the earnings statement. The average rent paid by the state was 72 per cent higher than by retail clients.\n\nThe company's growth prospects remain on track amid curbs in state spending because the government still needs office space, according to Ms Corbett. The company's fully-black ownership allows it more government opportunities than some competitors because of South Africa's black economic empowerment polices, she said.\n\nThe rand has declined 18 per cent against the US dollar this year, making it the worst performer among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on benchmark government bonds due December 2026 rose five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.31 per cent.\n\nWhile Delta is betting on growth led by long-term government state leases, Redefine is reducing exposure in the area as it restructures its property portfolio. The Johannesburg-based company plans to spin off its 2.2 billion rand government tenant unit into a separate listing in February, according to a statement to reporters on Oct 31.\n\nDelta had assets valued at 4.8 billion rand at the end of August, compared with the 24 billion rand property portfolio value of Redefine. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

There was also a share of loss of associated and joint venture companies of $260,000, against a share of profit of $1.06 million a year ago.\n\nWithout these items, net profit fall would have been smaller, at 3 per cent, amid higher selling & distribution and general & administrative expenses.\n\nThe revenue rise for the quarter was driven by a 13 per cent rise in food ingredient sales from $40.97 million to $46.1 million, due mainly to higher sales in the Indonesian market.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) for the period fell to 3.36 cents from 4.05 cents a year ago.\n\n\"Super Group's revenue for the three-month period was flat and not up to expectations, given that the market was expecting some growth,\" said DBS Group research analyst Alfie Yeo.\n\nHe noted that higher operating expenses and foreign currency fluctuations could have impacted its operating performance.\n\nThe group's nine-month net profit attributable to equity-holders rose 34 per cent to $77.3 million while revenue climbed 11 per cent to $403.7 million.

If it doesn't, it will give Alitalia and the government the possibility to find an international partner,\" he said in Milan on the sidelines of a motorcycle trade show.\n\nThe comment betrayed tensions over the negotiations between the airlines.\n\nAir France-KLM, which holds a 25 per cent stake in the Italian airline, is being urged to join shareholders in injecting more funds as part of a 300 million euro (S$502 million) recapitalisation plan.\n\nThe Franco-Dutch airline reportedly responded a week ago by telling Mr Lupi it could do so - but only if Alitalia axed 5,000 jobs, ousted its board of directors and came up with a debt restructuring plan.\n\nHowever, Air France-KLM has previously denied making any conditions over job losses.\n\nThe restructuring conditions have made Alitalia and the Italian government bristle.\n\nMr Lupi pushed back on Sunday by saying that, if Air France-KLM \"decides to dilute to 6 per cent\" its stake by not taking part in the recapitalisation, \"I think Alitalia, as a private company, will be forced to find other partners\".\n\nThe Italian airline is handicapped, however, by 1.2 billion euros in debt and Italy's determination to keep it a flag-carrier.\n\nAlitalia was already bailed out by taxpayers five years ago in a controversial operation that handed a consortium of private Italian companies a majority stake, part of which was later sold to Air France-KLM.\n\nThe still-struggling Italian airline is again flirting with bankruptcy, prompting the hasty recapitalisation plan. Italian energy group ENI has threatened to ground its fleet of planes by stopping fuel supplies because of unpaid debts.\n\nAlitalia says Italian banks are lined up to lend it 200 million euros. And the state-owned Italian postal service has been tapped to contribute up to 75 million euros, triggering rivals' allegations of illegal protectionism. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

According to data from Dealogic, about 68 per cent, or US$3.27 billion, of the US$4.84 billion raised by the 25 listings on SGX so far this year were accounted for by Reits and business trusts.\n\nThis amount is more than twice the last peak in deal value in 2010, when three Reits and business trusts raised US$1.51 billion.\n\nFor now, Reits and business trusts will continue to feature strongly in the pipeline of upcoming IPOs, according to those that BT spoke to.\n\n\"I see a continuing trend of Reits and business trusts in Singapore,\" said Max Loh, EY Asean and Singapore managing partner. \"Reits and business trusts have always had an advantage in terms of transparent rules, and corporates are increasingly looking to monetise their assets.\"\n\nFollowing the rally in stock markets after the deferment of QE tapering in the US surprised many, a window in the IPO market has opened.\n\n\"The postponement of QE tapering has created a window of opportunity for companies to tap liquidity in the market,\" said OCBC head of corporate finance Tay Toh Sin. \"Investor sentiment, while still cautious, has veered towards being more positive, and this is more apparent in Asian markets which have shown greater stability.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve's QE tapering is now widely expected to take place after March next year instead, giving confidence to many that the current window for IPOs will remain open until then.\n\nThe window is likely to be exploited not just by Reits and business trusts. Market players say the Singapore IPO market remains healthy, although things may slow towards the year-end.\n\nAlready, a few more companies have come to the market.\n\nFigtree Holdings, which designs and builds commercial and industrial facilities, raised $12 million in a fully placed share sale. It made its trading on Catalist yesterday. Offshore oil and gas service provider Pacific Radiance, which hopes to raise net proceeds of $150.6 million, will make its debut tomorrow.\n\nFraser and Neave's (F&N) property arm, Frasers Centrepoint Ltd (FCL), will also be listing by way of introduction, meaning that neither F&N nor FCL will receive cash proceeds. No date has been set yet, though it is expected to take place in either November or December.\n\nInvestors can also expect more companies in the oil and gas and offshore marine sectors to come onto the market, said DBS managing director and head of capital markets in Singapore, Tan Jeh Wuan.\n\n\"A number of these IPOs have decent offering sizes in excess of $200 million,\" he said.\n\nStill, with only one more month to go before the market quietens down for the holiday season, investors craning their necks for more IPOs might have to wait till next year.\n\n\"We remain positive on the outlook for Singapore's IPO market into 2014,\" said Ashok Pandit, Deutsche Bank head of equity capital market in Asia.\n\n\"For the remainder of this year, however, if the deal's not in the market, it's too late now to get the transaction done.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the consumer, they will still have to choose between one of the two networks, so the service that the consumer buys will still not be diversified,\" said Dr Yaacob.\n\nThe minister also said that IDA would implement a new audit framework for mobile operators by the second half of next year.\n\nThe scope of the audit would cover the network design, technical processes, business continuity planning and infrastructure and facilities to support the mobile network.\n\nBased on IDA's findings into the cause of the SingTel fire, the government will review if further policy measures are needed, Dr Yaacob added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This would suggest The Arcade's owners stand to pocket around $800 million.\n\nProperty group City Developments owns nearly 47,500 sq ft of space in the building, according to its annual report. This translates to slightly more than 30 per cent of the building's total strata area of about 157,300 sq ft and 30-plus per cent of share value, making it the biggest owner.\n\nBT understands that owners controlling at least 80 per cent of share value and strata area in the property have consented to The Arcade's collective sale, but verification of one or two signatures is pending. Once this is settled, a tender for the collective sale can be launched.\n\nThe Arcade is on a site with land tenure of 999 years starting April 1826, but some owners have only 99-year leasehold interest (starting October 1979) on their units. CDL, which holds the reversionary interest on the 99-year leasehold title of such units, has agreed to sign off for The Arcade to be sold on 999-year tenure for the 99-year units whose owners agree to the collective sale.\n\nCompleted 32 years ago, The Arcade has significant redevelopment potential. Its existing gross floor area is said to reflect a plot ratio of about 8.0 - significantly lower than the maximum 13.86 allowed for the site under Master Plan 2008, inclusive of bonus plot ratio for the site's proximity to Raffles Place MRT Station. The site is zoned for commercial use.\n\nWhile The Arcade is a rare 999 year-leasehold commercial site in the Raffles Place financial district available for sale, one drawback is the site's small area and narrow configuration.\n\nHowever, if Singapore Land, the owner of Clifford Centre next door, were to buy The Arcade, it could potentially amalgamate the two sites to form a more substantial site for redevelopment.\n\nColliers International is understood to be the marketing agent for The Arcade's collective sale.\n\nThe Arcade's collective sale may also draw potential investors who may not be looking at immediate redevelopment of the property. There is potential to trade the existing strata retail units, which are mostly tiny and can hence fetch high prices of several thousand dollars per square foot.\n\nThe first three levels of the 20-storey building house retail units and offices start from the fifth level. The Arcade has 51 basement car park lots.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This included a $37 million gain on disposal of investments that mainly arose from utilities' gain on its 20 per cent equity interest sold through the IPO of Sembcorp Salalah Power and Water Company in 3QFY13; and almost $80 million primarily due to utilities' fair-value gain on re-measurement of its remaining 40 per cent equity interest in Salalah after the IPO.\n\nMarine's net profit for the quarter was also higher, rising 12 per cent to $78.6 million. This was mainly due to higher operating profit and foreign exchange gain, partially offset by lower contribution from associates and joint ventures.\n\nFor the first nine months of the year, net profit grew 8.8 per cent to $596.7 million from $548.6 million for the same period in 2012. The group's turnover for the January-September 2013 period increased 6.1 per cent to $7.8 billion from $7.4 billion last year.\n\nSembcorp's main profit contributors for these nine months continued to be its utilities and marine businesses, which contributed 59 per cent and 35 per cent of group net profit respectively.\n\nSembcorp's share price closed at $5.32 yesterday, up three cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Angolans and Brazilians collected nine visas each since the programme began in October last year, she said.\n\nSouthern European nations including Cyprus, Greece and Spain introduced plans to trade residence visas for investment after their economies and real estate markets were hit hardest by the financial crisis.\n\nWealthy Chinese have been buying homes from Vancouver to London in the last several years as their domestic market faces government measures to cool prices.\n\nPortugal's programme has a minimum price of 500,000 euros (S$836,000), the same as in Spain. Greece and Cyprus offer fast-track permits for purchases of at least 250,000 euros and 300,000 euros, respectively.\n\nNon-European nationals who transfer one million euros or more in capital or create at least 10 jobs in Portugal can also qualify for the visas, according to the programme's website.\n\nPortugal may issue as many as 400 visas this year, the Foreign Ministry estimated. The resident permit programme has resulted in 198 million euros of investment since it started. There are no plans to limit the number of permits investors can get next year, Ms Seabra said.\n\nThe Portuguese visa programme has provided a \"decisive stimulus to the real estate market's recovery\", she said.\n\nPortugal's real estate market is showing signs of a turnaround after having the worst year in decades last year, Cushman & Wakefield Inc said on Sept 19.\n\nSpending on commercial real estate rose to 161 million euros in the six months through June from about 47 million euros a year earlier, according to the New York- based property broker.

There's just one catch. The government requires a 50 per cent down payment.\n\nThat's \"really putting us off\", said Mr Chiu, 45, who owns an information technology consulting company. \"I run a business so cash flow is important. It's frustrating because this is non-negotiable, though I have perfect credit history.\"\n\nPrices of high-end apartments, defined as those larger than 1,000 square feet or costing at least HK$10 million, have gained less than the broader market since the second half of 2012 as buyers in Mr Chiu's price bracket have been hardest hit after the government raised minimum down payments six times over less than three years as part of curbs to make homes more affordable.\n\nThe slowing price growth in high-end apartments is the first sign that efforts to temper rampant speculation that has fuelled a surging housing market are working even as it stings luxury developers and potential homebuyers.\n\nBroker Cushman & Wakefield Inc forecasts that prices of homes valued at more than HK$10 million will fall about 3 per cent in the fourth quarter, extending a 3 per cent drop so far this year, while those selling for less will be little changed.\n\n\"The luxury segment has taken the first and the most direct hit,\" said Buggle Lau, chief analyst at Midland Holdings Ltd, Hong Kong's biggest realtor by branch numbers. \"The measures were aimed at driving the speculators away and they have certainly achieved that, but many people wanting to buy for their own use are also affected.\"\n\nAn influx of wealthy buyers from mainland China, mortgage rates close to record lows and a financial-services sector that has thrived thanks to fundraising by Chinese companies helped fuel a 250 per cent increase in luxury-home prices from 2003 to the beginning of 2012, outpacing the 150 per cent gain in mass-market homes, according to statistics compiled by Savills plc. The London-based broker defines luxury homes as those with at least 1,000 square feet (93 square metres) or value of at least HK$15 million.\n\nHong Kong home prices are the world's highest in a Savills survey of 10 cities, including London, New York and Tokyo. The value of luxury properties will drop as much as 5 per cent in the second half after a 3.2 per cent decline in the first three months of the year, according to Savills. Prices in the mass market will see no change after increasing 1.7 per cent in the first six months, the broker said.\n\nSun Hung Kai Properties Ltd, a developer of luxury residential projects, plans to build more, smaller apartments because of a change in buyers' appetites, Victor Lui, the company's deputy managing director, said in September. The company, one of Hong Kong's two-biggest developers by market value, reported lower profit from sales for the year ended in June.\n\nThere were about 86,000 luxury homes - or units of at least 100 square metres - in Hong Kong at the end of last year, according to statistics from the government. That represents about 7.7 per cent of private homes in the city. About 24 per cent of the 10,149 new homes completed by developers last year were larger than 100 square metres, government statistics show.\n\nThe gap between the top end of the market and the cheaper bracket narrowed last year as the government's mortgage tightening started to impact the luxury segment. Prices of mass-market homes rose 20 per cent last year, almost double that of luxury homes, according to Savills.\n\nPrices of luxury homes began to decline after the government in October 2012 slapped a 15 per cent tax on all non-resident buyers as it sought to stem the inflow of Chinese capital into the property market.\n\n\"For a while, Chinese buyers were the main driver for luxury homes,\" said Thomas Lam, Hong Kong-based research director at broker Knight Frank LLP. \"When you raise buying costs for them, of course it takes away a large part of the demand.\"\n\nMainland Chinese buyers accounted for an estimated 8 per cent of private home sales in the city, a former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, in the third quarter of this year, down from a record 25 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Centaline Property Agency Ltd.\n\nSince October 2010, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the city's de-facto central bank, has raised the minimum down payment required for home purchases over HK$10 million to as much as 60 per cent from 30 per cent, and to 50 per cent for those from HK$7 million to HK$10 million. The most recent round took place in February.\n\nThat month, the government doubled stamp-duty taxes for all properties over HK$2 million, with new tax rates ranging from 1.5 per cent for properties valued below HK$2 million, to 8.5 per cent for those priced above HK$21.7 million.\n\n\"The extra stamp duties and mortgage rules are like progressive taxes,\" said Vincent Cheung, Hong Kong-based national director of valuation at Cushman & Wakefield.\n\n\"The higher the property value, the higher the tax rates and the tighter the mortgage rules. Of course this would impact luxury properties the most.\"\n\nHong Kong's government won't cut back property curbs until there's a \"steady supply\" of new housing, Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said in June.\n\nThere were 607 sales of homes worth over HK$12 million in the third quarter, according to statistics compiled by Centaline. The number is the lowest since the first quarter of 2009, according to the Hong Kong-based realtor.\n\n\"The curbs have frozen transactions,\" said Knight Frank's Mr Lam. \"The drop in prices we're seeing is actually taken from a very small sample. I'd be very cautious about calling this a down market for now.\"\n\nThe average mortgage rate in Hong Kong was about 2.17 per cent in September, compared with about 3 per cent at the end of 2008, according to mReferral Mortgage Services.\n\nMr Chiu, the business owner, who now rents an 800-square-foot apartment in the middle-class Tsim Sha Tsui district on the Kowloon peninsula, wants to move to Mid-Levels because his daughter attends a high school in the area of high-rises halfway between the Central business district and Victoria Peak.\n\nA 1,000-square-foot unit in Mid-Levels would cost about HK$15.9 million on average, according to data from Midland.\n\nAs legacies of Hong Kong's colonial past, the city's most expensive residential areas, including The Peak and Island South, are on Hong Kong Island, one of the city's three main regions and home to its financial district, government headquarters and residences of senior government officials.\n\nOn a hillside below The Peak, where global banks and companies such as HSBC Holdings plc house their top executives, Swire Properties Ltd last year sold a unit in a Frank Gehry-designed building for HK$455 million, a record for Hong Kong.\n\nIsland South, where sea-front mansions stretch along the coastline, is home to many of the city's billionaires, including Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest man, and New World Development Co's former chairman Cheng Yu-tung.\n\nPrices in the established luxury areas, such as The Peak and Mid-Levels, are facing less pressure compared with \"the newer luxury districts\", said Antonio Wu, head of investment at brokers Colliers International, referring to areas in Kowloon and further north of the city.\n\n\"The old money is there and they usually have stronger holding power. If you cross the harbour, you'll see more drastic price cuts because you have more supply and more speculators.\"\n\nOne such area is Kowloon West, where apartment projects adorned with extravagant club houses and Olympic-size swimming pools were built over the past decade as the city's tallest building, International Commerce Centre, went up and lured investment banks, including Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG, away from Central.\n\nThe ICC, completed in 2010, sits atop Kowloon Station, which helps connect the city's international airport to the Central business district. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Never before have investors in the US$530 billion market for Danish mortgage bonds faced government intervention in securities funding existing loans, according to the Danish Mortgage Bankers' Federation.\n\nThe government in Copenhagen now needs to convince European regulators the new maturity profile satisfies stable funding rules intended to protect against market freezes. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA), which deems funding shorter than 12 months as unstable for commercial banks, says that the EU should accept the new mortgage bonds.\n\nDenmark is waiting for a response from Brussels as lawmakers, led by Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager, say they're willing to do whatever it takes to save the world's biggest mortgage market per capita.\n\n\"The Danish FSA's position in the future EU development of the Net Stable Funding Ratio is that the new one-year mortgage bonds should be considered as stable funding,\" Kristian Vie Madsen, the FSA's deputy director general, said on Friday.\n\nStandard & Poor's, which warned in July that a failure to reduce issuance of one-year bonds could lead to downgrades, said that it is looking at the proposal. Moody's Investors Service, which has also criticised Denmark's short-term mortgage bonds for introducing refinancing risks, is analysing the proposal, it said last week. Investors still need time to decide what the changes mean, according to Pacific Investment Management Co.\n\n\"We are evaluating this development,\" said Kristion Mierau, senior vice-president for portfolio management at the Munich office of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund.\n\nWithout European approval, banks in Denmark will have to slash sales of mortgages with rates that are reset annually. The one-year bonds make up about 40 per cent of the market, comprising the single biggest category of mortgages.\n\nThe FSA may still limit use of the extended maturity one-year bonds when it introduces new guidelines for mortgage bond issuance, recommended earlier this year by a government-appointed committee examining the roots of Denmark's financial crisis. Mr Madsen at the FSA said that the Copenhagen-based agency will unveil its recommendations in the first half of next year.\n\n\"We fear there will be a run on one-year bonds, and that's why we're emphasising that it's still important to have a focus\" on the volume, said Karsten Beltoft, head of the Mortgage Bankers' Federation. The greater the volume of one-year bonds, the more likely it is that the maturity option would have to be exercised, he said.\n\nThough banks had tried to wean borrowers off one-year funding, households resisted those efforts after rates in AAA- rated Denmark sank to record lows. That helped cushion the blow to homeowners of a 20 per cent slump in property prices since their 2007 peak.\n\nYields on one-year mortgage bonds may be as low as 0.55 per cent in auctions this month to refinance loans with a Jan 1 interest reset date, according to Christian Heinig, chief economist at Realkredit Danmark A/S.\n\n\"The FSA will fight for the new one-year constructions as being compliant,\" said Soeren Holm, chief financial officer for Copenhagen-based Nykredit Realkredit A/S, Europe's largest issuer of covered bonds backed by home loans.\n\n\"This really eliminates the refinancing risk and reduces the interest rate risk for the customer,\" Mr Holm said. \"We expected it to be at a reasonable price, five to 10 basis points.\"\n\nEuropean banks are required to ensure by January 2016 they have diverse, stable funding for long-term obligations, according to rules approved by the European parliament earlier this year. A binding minimum standard will be set in 2018.\n\nBusiness Minister Henrik Sass Larsen said last week that the government was forced to push through its proposal, which still needs to be approved by parliament, after industry measures to comply with stable funding rules proved inadequate.\n\n\"The problem was that these various proposals didn't remove the risk altogether, and that's what the government now seeks to do,\" Mr Larsen said.\n\nUnder the proposed legislation, an auction failure or interest rate increase of more than five percentage points would trigger conversion of one-year, three-year and five-year mortgage bonds, including index-linked notes, into callable, fixed-rate bonds with a maturity matching the underlying loans. That can be as long as 30 years, minus the maturity of the original loan. Yields would be set at the coupon plus five percentage points.\n\n\"It will always be our job to make sure mortgage finance remains as we know it,\" Ms Vestager told reporters last week.\n\nThe battle for the bonds won't be the first for Denmark, whose mortgage market is more than three times the size of its government debt market. Ms Vestager said in February that the government will \"do whatever it takes to guard it\" after regulators suggested the securities didn't qualify as highly liquid assets. The government ended up winning that fight and now expects the bonds' top liquidity status to be confirmed by the end of the year.\n\n\"Both the Danish government and the members of parliament and the authorities have been very successful and very keen on fighting the battle for the mortgage system,\" Ane Arnth Jensen, head of the Association of Danish Mortgage Banks, said.\n\n\"I hope that we will win this battle as well.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

About 90 per cent of that was crude.\n\nA fishing vessel was the only ship to be hijacked in the Strait of Malacca in all of last year, according to the IMB's website.\n\nTwo Kuala Lumpur-based officials from the organisation were not available for comment when contacted by phone and e-mail yesterday.\n\nThe incident follows the hijacking of an oil-products tanker off Malaysia's Pulau Aur in the South China Sea on Oct 10, about 67 miles northeast of Singapore. Pirates stole the ship's cargo before abandoning it on Oct 15, the IMB's website shows.\n\nThe Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia reported that a vessel called the Danai 4, carrying marine gasoil from Singapore to Vietnam, lost contact with its owners in the area on Oct 10, according to an alert on its website.\n\nThere have been 206 reported incidents of piracy worldwide this year, including 11 hijackings, data from the IMB showed.

Yet it is ironical that in a serious overcapacity situation, some are holding up the potential cost savings from a fleet of new mega container ships that NOL is adding to its fleet as the answer to its earnings woes.\n\nNOL's group CEO Ng Yat Chung described Q3 as \"one of its weakest peak seasons\" the group has seen \"in recent years\". It reported a 60 per cent fall in Q3 net profit to US$20 million on the back of lower freight rates and volume. While the group saw a turnaround to a nine-month net profit of US$61 million (from a loss of US$321 million previously), most of that came from the sale of its flagship NOL Building that netted a gain of US$200 million. NOL also said it expected volatile freight rates and overcapacity to continue.\n\nNot surprisingly, seven out of 10 analysts had to cut their FY 2013 full-year earnings forecasts for NOL following the results, and most maintained their \"sell\" or \"underperform\" rating on the company.\n\nBut a fair amount of optimism remained. Macquarie Equities Research for one reiterated its \"outperform\" rating and said \"despite a weaker rate environment, NOL's underlying operating performance had continued to improve due to lower bunker consumption and other cost-saving programmes\".\n\nAlso positive were the likes of JP Morgan and UOB Kay Hian. And the general consensus, even amid the \"sell\" and \"hold\" calls, was that while the shipping group will make an estimated net loss of US$113 million this year, it would see a turnaround to a net profit of US$136 million in FY 2014 and an even more optimistic US$361 million in FY 2015.\n\nA lot of this optimism has to do with big ships.\n\nAs part of its fleet renewal programme, NOL has seen some 14 new and larger vessels delivered this year, with six in the 14,000-TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) category, six in the 9,000-TEU category and two in the 8,100-TEU category. These have replaced seven older and smaller ships, which were sold or scrapped, while another four charter ships were returned.\n\nWith their bigger capacity, the ultra-large container vessels are expected to reduce operating costs per container and help improve market share. This is sorely needed given that average revenue per container unit remains on the decline.\n\n\"We see further cost-savings for 2014 when an additional 10 ultra-large vessels are due to be delivered,\" Macquarie said in a report on Oct 30.\n\nNOL's first 14,000-TEU ship, APL Temasek, was delivered on March 25 this year, following 10 new 10,000-TEU ships which joined the fleet between 2011 and 2012. By the end of next year, the shipping group will have a total of 10 14,000 TEU ships. The mega ships form part of NOL's US$4 billion fleet renewal programme to improve the group's slot costs, as older less-efficient ships are sold or returned to charter owners.\n\nThe big ships do bring some benefits. With its newer, larger and more fuel-efficient ships, NOL has managed cost of sales per TEU down by 7 per cent year on year, while bunker consumption has dropped 15 per cent. Another positive is that five out of the 10 14,000-TEU vessels to be delivered between 2013 and 2014 have already been chartered out to Japan's Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL).\n\nHowever, there is a flip side which investors should not ignore.\n\nOne implication is insurance costs. While big ships are touted as being more environmentally friendly due to their fuel efficiency, the sheer size of these vessels may make them more unwieldy and dangerous in extremely bad weather. The dramatic sinking on June 17 this year of the container ship MOL Comfort at a youthful eight years (the 8,110-TEU container vessel was built in 2005) topped the news and pictures of the ship breaking into two and being swallowed by waves would probably still send chills down any marine insurer's spine. MOL has since pulled out MOL Comfort's sister ships from the same route to strengthen their hulls and ship structures.\n\nBut the most serious issue is excess capacity. The likes of sea-freight forwarder Kuehne & Nagel have criticised the move to mega ships as aggravating the overcapacity that is crippling the sector.\n\nNew orders for mega containerships are being placed at a fast clip, with an estimated 100 newbuilding contracts for container ships of over 8,000 TEUs placed this year alone. Most of these orders have been placed at Chinese and South Korean shipyards, which are offering relatively low prices to fill empty slots. New energy-saving designs, such as the 18,000-TEU ships using liquid natural gas as fuel offered by South Korean yards, have also attracted big shipping groups such as APM-Maersk.\n\nNOL unit APL has outstanding new orders of some 83,200 TEUs, or 13 per cent of its current fleet. This pales in comparison with top-ranked players such as APM-Maersk, whose new orders totalling 292,320 TEUs form 11 per cent of its existing fleet, with Mediterranean Shipping Company's new orders of a hefty 457,029 TEUs forming 19.3 per cent of its fleet. CMA group's new orders account for 13 per cent of its current fleet, while at Taiwan's Evergreen Line, new orders for big ships make up 31 per cent of its existing fleet.\n\nThe consequences are worrying. As the shipping groups continue to out-order and out-build each other, an industry recovery looks more remote, and the unwillingness of major liners to hold back new orders, let alone cut capacity by scrapping and idling ships to address falling rates, could mean even more pain ahead.\n\nUltimately, what this suggests is that NOL's expected turnaround may be weighed down by the very ships which are expected to give it a lift.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Inflation is close to its Q1 highs once again, while pressures on demand and cash flow are up again, ending a full year of improvement.\n\n\"Late payment symptoms, usually more of a problem elsewhere in the world, have reached Singapore. Meanwhile, growth capital has also become less accessible, after supply peaked in early 2013.\n\n\"This is not a trend unique to Singapore but one quite common to the wider region. Neighbouring Malaysia has also seen confidence drop off and businesses are seeing a number of challenges, while a deepening credit crunch in China could have implications for Asia Pacific in general.\"\n\nNegatively tinged perceptions of the broader economy hovered at the same levels of the preceding quarter; 55 per cent of finance professionals surveyed here believe the economy is deteriorating or stagnating, while 35 per cent believe it is improving or about to do so.\n\n\"That perception has not changed significantly since the second quarter of 2013,\" said Leong Soo Yee, head of ACCA Singapore.\n\nDespite the challenging environment, business capacity building continued to recover for a third quarter in a row, having bottomed out in late 2012.\n\n\"This trend, however, may be driven by new restrictions placed on foreign labour and the need for new hires. If that is the case, the boost to overall business capacity may be small and short-lived,\" ACCA and IMA said in their report.\n\nOn a global level, GECS showed the best economic sentiment since the survey began in 2009, marking the first time that the number of optimists have outnumbered the pessimists.\n\nHowever, Q3's good news was \"disproportionately weighted towards Europe\", as the continent showed improved perceptions of a broader economic recovery.\n\nFieldwork for the Q3 instalment of GECS was carried out between Aug 15 and Sept 4, and drew 2,021 responses from ACCA and IMA members around the world, including 154 from chief financial officers.\n\nThe survey was sent out to 7,000 finance professionals in Singapore; 44 of these responded.\n\nSaid the report: \"Fieldwork was concluded before the US government shutdown of October 2013 could become a significant concern.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The increase was due to higher sales volume for both manufactured steel products and vanadium products.\n\nGross profit, however, fell by $1.2 million to $2.6 million, as gross profits margins slipped to 4.6 per cent in Q3 2013, from 11.7 per cent the year before.\n\nIt posted a net loss of 6.45 cents per share for the third quarter, compared to the 0.45 cent loss per share recorded last year.\n\nIn its statement, the group said that it had on Oct 30 issued a profit warning to its shareholders that the level of steelmaking overcapacity remains, while the steel industry is destocking and steel prices are falling. Given that the overall outlook for the industry remains weak, the group told shareholders that it had expected its third-quarter results to be weaker than that reported in the previous quarter, as a result of lower operating margins and additional assets impairment.\n\nThe six-month average steel price for this year has fallen by as much as 21.5 per cent compared to the 12-month average price for 2011, and by 7.3 per cent when compared to last year, the company said.\n\nThe weak market conditions in the steelmaking industry resulted in Sapphire reducing factory capacity plans for various business segments by 30 to 55 per cent, which led to lower utilisation rates and longer investment recovery for the company's plant and equipment. It therefore decided to rationalise its assets and recorded an impairment charge of $57.7 million for the quarter.\n\nSapphire shares closed 0.1 cent down at 10.4 cents on Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investment in exploration and production may rise to US$750 billion next year as companies seek to add reserves and expand output, the IFP Energies Nouvelles policy group said last month.\n\nVard, based in Alesund, Norway, won contracts worth 11.9 billion kroner (S$2.4 billion) in the first nine months, 45 per cent more than a year earlier. That boosted its total orderbook to 19.6 billion kroner with deliveries stretching into 2017. In 2007, the company had received orders worth 15.5 billion kroner.\n\nShares of Vard were unchanged at S$0.845 in Singapore on Nov 8. The stock has declined 35 per cent this year, compared with a 0.3 per cent gain in the benchmark Straits Times Index.\n\nThe company's third-quarter net income slumped 67 per cent from a year earlier because of increased costs at its two yards in Brazil. Sales dropped to 2.37 billion kroner in the period.\n\nThe Brazilian yards lost money because the quality of some of the work done by their suppliers fell short of expectations and caused production delays, Mr Dilling said in the Nov 8 interview.\n\n\"We are now scaling back the degree at which we use other parties to supply major sections of a ship. At one time, we had an ambition to grow on the back of such supplier relationships. That assumption didn't go through.\"\n\nThe yards in Brazil are expected to become profitable as early as the second half of 2014 as they reach a \"higher level of utilisation\", he said.\n\nThe facilities have an orderbook worth six billion kroner to build 14 vessels, including eight liquefied petroleum gas carriers and two pipe lay support vessels.\n\nThe company changed its name to Vard from STX OSV Holdings this year after Fincantieri SpA bought it from South Korea's debt-ridden STX Group for 455 million euros (S$761 million). - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In restaurant-speak, that's a euphemism for cheapskate but I beg to differ. I like to think of myself as the conduit for a fascinating, real-life study on human behaviour that's played out every day between 12 and 2pm at any restaurant in Singapore that you care to pick. That is, the psychological game between the set-luncher and the chef: where the former tries to get as much as he can for as little money as possible, while the latter conspires to give as little as he can without bursting the former's bubble or his profit margin.\n\nWhen you've had your fair share of $25 bento sets with sliced watermelon for dessert, or $28 salad and pasta combos with a smidgen of cake to end, it should pretty much dawn on you to give up and shell out for a la carte if you want a real meal.\n\nA three-course set lunch for under $30 is a tough challenge in these inflationary times - but when you're genetically hardwired to seek out a good deal, restaurants can't help but comply or lose out to the competition.\n\nOn the flip-side, there are restaurants that offer the kind of set lunch value that makes you wonder what kind of financial wizardry the chef is cooking up to make money from what he offers, as is the case at the newly re-opened La Strada.\n\nEconomies of scale derived from being part of the Les Amis group may well have helped chef Joon Kian Pow deliver quantity and quality at this cosy Italian trattoria that takes over from the defunct Annam restaurant. Or his experience in the kitchens of both Les Amis and Au Jardin have come in handy when infusing humble ingredients with fine-dining flair.\n\nEither way, La Strada's $28 set lunches hold their own appeal, especially with generous starters such as sauteed mushrooms and spinach topped with a soft cooked egg and shavings of Spanish ham, or squid pieces simply pan-fried with olives and finished with lemon. While a pasta main course of penne in tomato sauce is ordinary, it gets a luxe topping of good-sized grilled tiger prawns.\n\nAlternatively, opt for a juicy roasted half chicken with roasted potatoes and cherry tomatoes. To end off, the wedges of chocolate flourless cake or pine nut tart with scoops of ice cream are baked with pride and in generous servings too.\n\nThat doesn't mean you bypass the rest of the menu, because it's worth exploring the plethora of trattoria-style a la carte items. Tender char-grilled octopus chunks and potatoes do full justice to its Spanish origins, while crabmeat sauteed in white wine is swirled around homemade pasta that's a gold standard for mee pok with its perfect \"rubber band\" chewiness.\n\nCheck out, too, the blackboard specials such as a melt-in-the-mouth char-grilled fresh porcini mushroom ($20) covered with Spanish ham (but sadly the season is over). A creamy butternut squash risotto ($26) with grilled tiger prawns doesn't quite hit the spot with its porridgy-texture and fresh but bland prawns, while burnt edges on skinny baby back ribs ($26) mar the otherwise mellow barbecue sauce that doesn't overwhelm you like the artificial smoke and ketchup pervasiveness of Tony Roma et al.\n\nFall back instead on the salt-baked Italian seabass ($75) - it may seem pricey at first glance until you realise that it serves two, not to mention that it's imported chilled and is fresh enough to get away with just a light dressing of olive oil to enhance the fine-textured flesh.\n\nWhile it's got its pricing strategy right, La Strada needs to flesh out the trattoria concept better if it wants to break the perception that Italian restaurants can only be authentic with an Italian in the kitchen. As with the octopus and potato starter and salt-baked fish, there are flashes of rusticity, but there's a tendency to vacillate between that and the precision-oriented discipline of an upscale kitchen. It'll take a while to switch brains, but with a young and committed team, we're pretty sure that this \"little street\" is worth exploring anew.\n\njaime@sph.com.sg\n\nRating:\n\n7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The governor said, based on their estimate, 10,000 died,\" Mr Soria said. \"The devastation is so big.\"\n\nWitnesses and officials described chaotic scenes in Leyte's capital, Tacloban, a coastal city of 220,000 about 580 km south-east of Manila, with hundreds of bodies piled on the sides of roads and pinned under wrecked houses.\n\nThe city and nearby villages as far as one kilometre from shore were flooded by the storm surge, leaving floating bodies and roads choked with debris from fallen trees, tangled power lines and flattened homes. TV footage showed children clinging to rooftops for their lives.\n\n\"From a helicopter, you can see the extent of devastation. From the shore and moving a kilometre inland, there are no structures standing. It was like a tsunami,\" said Interior Secretary Manuel Roxas, who had been in Tacloban since before the typhoon struck the city.\n\nMila Ward, an Australian citizen and Filipino by birth who was in Leyte on vacation visiting her family, said she saw hundreds of bodies on the streets.\n\n\"They were covered with blankets, plastic. There were children and women,\" she said.\n\nLooters rampaged through several stores in Tacloban, witnesses said, taking whatever they could find as rescuers'efforts to deliver food and water were hampered by severed roads and communications.\n\n\"They are taking everything, even appliances like TV sets. These will be traded later on for food,\" said Tecson John Lim, the Tacloban city administrator.\n\n\"We don't have enough manpower. We have 2,000 employees but only about 100 are reporting for work. Everyone is attending to their families.\"\n\nMr Lim said city officials had so far only collected 300-400 bodies, but believed the death toll in the city alone could be 10,000.\n\nInternational aid agencies said relief efforts in the Philippines are stretched thin after a 7.2 magnitude quake in central Bohol province last month and displacement caused by a conflict with Muslim rebels in southern Zamboanga province.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it was airlifting 40 tonnes of high energy biscuits, enough to feed 120,000 people for a day, as well as emergency supplies and telecommunications equipment.\n\nTacloban city airport was all but destroyed as seawaters swept through the city, shattering the glass of the airport tower, levelling the terminal and overturning nearby vehicles.\n\nA Reuters reporter saw five bodies inside a chapel near the airport, placed on pews.\n\nAirport manager Efren Nagrama, 47, said water levels rose up to four metres.\n\n\"It was like a tsunami. We escaped through the windows and I held on to a pole for about an hour as rain, seawater and wind swept through the airport,\" he said. \"Some of my staff survived by clinging to trees. I prayed hard all throughout until the water subsided.\"\n\nPope Francis yesterday asked Catholics to provide \"concrete help\" to the hundreds of thousands of people made homeless by the typhoon. More than 60,000 people joined the Pope in his own prayer for the victims during his traditional Sunday mass in St Peter's Square, a day after he had tweeted his solidarity with the Catholic Asian nation.\n\n\"Sadly, there are many, many victims and the damage is huge,\" the Pope said, speaking from a third-floor window of the papal palace. \"Let's try to provide concrete help.\"\n\nMeanwhile, six people were killed and dozens wounded during heavy winds and storms in central Vietnam as Haiyan approached the coast, state media reported, even though it had weakened substantially since hitting the Philippines with winds gusts of up to 275 kph.\n\nVietnam authorities have moved 883,000 people in 11 central provinces to safe zones, according to the government's website.\n\nDespite weakening, the storm is likely to cause heavy rains, flooding, strong winds and mudslides as it makes its way north in the South China Sea. - Reuters, AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

For instance, diesel prices went up by about 90 per cent, while national average wages have gone up by about 30 per cent over the same period.\"\n\nBut some groups still need help, hence the two new concession schemes - one for people with disabilities and the other for low-income workers - which the government will fund, and enhancements to existing concession schemes, which will be borne by commuters. This, according to the minister, is because the FRMC wanted to maintain a \"balance\".\n\nThe exact amount of discounts for the disabled and low-income workers has not been decided yet but the intention is to \"ensure that the discounts given will more than offset any fare increase in the next fare exercise\".\n\nAbout half a million Singaporeans will be eligible for these two new schemes, raising the number of commuters who currently enjoy various fare concessions from 1.2 million to about 1.7 million.\n\nAs for feedback that the issue of service quality was missing from the FRMC report, and that fare increases should be suspended until service levels improve, Mr Lui said that the committee decided that the issue of service level is best addressed separately outside of the fare formula, where the government can regulate and work with the operators to improve service levels.\n\nBut that does not mean service levels are not being raised or that PTOs are getting off lightly. He pointed to efforts to improve the availability and quality of public transport, such as the 20 per cent addition of 800 buses, the extra 100 trains over the next three years and the doubling of the rail network to 360 km over the next 20 years.\n\nOperating Performance Standards are also being raised, with higher penalties and a stricter regulatory framework.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

With better information on hand, customers can proactively manage their financial processes and avoid unnecessary penalties for late payments, for example, said Anita Loh, Singapore head of product management for Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions.\n\nCitibank also recognises the need to give senior executives the ability to have a quick overview of the company's financials and reports, as well as the ability to authorise decisions such as fund transfers, while on the move. These are the reasons why it created CitiDirect BE Mobile, which is available on all major smartphone platforms such as iOS, Android and BlackBerry, she said.\n\nThis is also why the mobile app does not come with analytics capabilities - as executives tend not to need that function, she explained.\n\nThe tablet application, similarly, will cater to C-suite executives to make prompt, critical business decisions based on information delivered in easily digestible dashboards and visualisations. It is still in development, however, and will only be available early next year.\n\nMs Loh said that the entire CitiDirect BE platform - Web portal, mobile, tablet and analytics - will first be unveiled in Singapore to local customers, before gradually being introduced to other markets worldwide. Individual components, such as CitiDirect BE Mobile for example, are already available in other markets.\n\nIn terms of the IT investments made, Ms Loh said that the company spent \"tens of millions of dollars per year\" to revamp the existing tech backend. This was for the infrastructure, man hours spent on development and the procurment of licences from partnering tech vendors.\n\nThe existing infrastructure was not \"dumped\", but the new tech introduced was \"wrapped around\" to expand capabilities such as mobile access and real-time analytics, she added.\n\nGiven the extensive investments made for the online banking platform, Ms Loh said that Citibank will eventually charge for the new services introduced. The analytics function, for example, will be free for the first six months to early adopters before charges are levied.\n\nHowever, she could not share the pricing range. It will depend on the individual customer's needs, she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was largely due to lower contribution from its Waterview condominium project, which is fully sold and is now in the later stage of construction.\n\nNoting the effects of past rounds of property cooling measures and the latest curbs on loans announced by Monetary Authority of Singapore in June, Sim Lian said it expects the operating conditions for the private residential property market to become increasingly challenging.\n\n\"The group remains committed to seeking strategic investment opportunities for its continued growth and is focused on building a stable base of recurring income to smoothen its fluctuating development profits,\" it added. It expects to remain profitable in FY2014.\n\nFor Q1, Sim Lian's property development division contributed $107.1 million to group revenue, a 30 per cent fall from last year. Its construction arm contributed $36.8 million, a 22 per cent rise from a year ago. The firm said the higher revenue contribution was due mainly to an increase in percentage of work done compared with last year.\n\nSim Lian's shares fell 1.7 per cent yesterday to close at 86 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Southwest also is in discussions with the Justice Department about adding slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport, one person said.\n\nHaving a market for the slots would clear a possible hurdle as AMR Corp's American, US Airways and the Justice Department explore resolving the antitrust lawsuit filed on Aug 13 to block the merger. A post-merger American would have an unacceptably high 69 per cent of Reagan National flights, the US says.\n\nFor Southwest and JetBlue, the Justice Department's insistence on AMR-US Airways asset sales as a condition to approve a merger creates an opportunity to expand at Reagan National, the only one of Washington's three major airports with federal flight limits.\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder said on Nov 4 that divestitures would be required at crucial airports across the US as part of \"any resolution in this case\". If settlement talks don't succeed, the US is prepared to go to trial on Nov 25, he said.\n\nGina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether the department is in discussions with Southwest and JetBlue about slot divestitures.\n\nAmerican declined to comment, said Michael Trevino, a spokesman. Ed Stewart, a spokesman for Tempe, Arizona-based US Airways at Fleishman Hillard Inc, Southwest's Beth Harbin and Jenny Dervin at JetBlue also said that they had no comment.\n\nA merger between American, the third-largest US airline, and No 5 US Airways would create the world's biggest carrier by traffic. Dallas-based Southwest is the largest discount airline and is now in the fourth spot in the US industry, while New York-based JetBlue is in sixth place.\n\nThe Southwest-JetBlue discussions with regulators build on the interest in Reagan National slots expressed publicly by the carriers in the months since Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR and US Airways announced plans to merge on Feb 14.\n\nSouthwest chief executive officer Gary Kelly said on an Oct 24 conference call that he was \"absolutely\" interested in more Reagan National access and \"more slots at LaGuardia as well\". \"I'm reasonably confident that there will be slots that become available and then I am assuming that there will be an opportunity to bid,\" Mr Kelly said. \"So if there is that opportunity, we'll certainly take advantage of the bidding\".\n\nJetBlue wrote to US Senator Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, in March to demand that \"a significant number\" of slots be divested at Reagan National. CEO Dave Barger said in September that American should have to cede the equivalent of all its current flights there, which would leave the merged airline with the 55 per cent market share held by US Airways. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

In the first phase, AVA and BCA will relocate to Jem in 2014,\" said an MND spokesman.\n\n\"MND HQ would move in due course, taking into account the market conditions and the pace of developments to relocate other ministries to Jurong Lake District. This will create eventually a strategic cluster of associated ministries at Jurong Lake District.\"\n\nIn 2010, the government said that, besides MND, AVA and BCA, there were also plans for the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources to move to Jurong East.\n\nThe following year, MND revealed that it had inked a 30-year lease for the office tower of Lend Lease's mixed development next to the Jurong East MRT Station, where it, along with BCA and AVA, would move to.\n\nNow, the ministry is seeking to appoint a panel of leasing agents to sublet around 70,000 sq ft comprising three of the 11 levels of office space in Jem, BT understands. The asking monthly rent is said to be around $6.50 per square foot (psf).\n\nMND's spokesman said: \"The Jurong Lake District is one of the key regional growth areas identified by the Singapore government. To help catalyse the development of this new growth region, MND signed a 30-year lease at Jem with the developer, Lend Lease, in 2011. MND also worked to help Lend Lease to design an award-winning green office building.\n\n\"Flexibility was provided for in the lease arrangement so that MND can better manage the stages and timing of its use of the office spaces. This included sub-leasing to other interested tenants.\"\n\nFollowing AVA and BCA's move to Jurong, the vacated space at Maxwell Road will be made available to interested tenants for their short-term lease.\n\nJem's retail component opened in June this year. The buzz quotient around Jurong East MRT Station is set to increase next month, when CapitaLand group opens the mall at its Westgate project. Located next to Jem, Westgate also has an office tower, which is slated for completion late next year.\n\nTalk in the market is that leasing efforts for the 20-storey Westgate Tower, comprising 320,000 sq ft net lettable area of offices, have been put on hold.\n\nCapitaLand is said to have initially planned to find a bulk buyer for an enbloc sale of a huge chunk, if not all, of the office space at a target price of around $2,200 psf. However, it is now open to selling strata units, probably on a whole-floor basis, suggest sources. \"A price of $2,200 psf is more likely to be achieved on a strata basis rather than for en-bloc basis,\" said a seasoned investment sales agent.\n\nIn the past six months, office units at Paya Lebar Square were sold at prices ranging from $1,732 psf (for a 484-sq ft space on the eighth floor) to $2,427 psf (for a 506 sq ft unit on the 13th floor), based on caveats data. \"Paya Lebar is closer to the city, compared with Jurong East. But Jurong East is much more advanced in terms of shaping up as a regional centre than Paya Lebar,\" said the agent.\n\nLast month, 10,097 sq ft on the 41st level of Suntec Tower Three was transacted at $3,000 psf. The building is on a site with balance lease term of about 75 years.\n\n\"Those who buy office units in the Jurong East location may be in businesses that don't require them to travel in and out of the city. For instance, an office in Jurong East may be complementary to their industrial activity in the western part of Singapore,\" said the agent.\n\nFrom an investment angle, buying a strata office in Jurong East may also appeal to those who want to invest in the Jurong regional centre story without being affected by the cooling measures that have been slapped on the residential and industrial property sectors, say market watchers.\n\nAnother source of office supply in the Jurong East locale will emanate from Sim Lian's project on Venture Avenue. In September, Sim Lian bagged the Urban Redevelopment Authority's provisional permission to develop about 625,500 sq ft gross floor area of offices and 69,500 sq ft of retail space on its site. Word on the street is that Sim Lian is looking to strata-title the office component for sale, with a launch expected in the first half next year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/incoming/wongpartnership-ties-malaysian-firm", "site_title": "WongPartnership ties up with Malaysian firm", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWongPartnership ties up with Malaysian firm\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Nov 11, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[SINGAPORE] Big Four local law firm WongPartnership (WongP) has tied up with Malaysian boutique corporate law practice Foong & Partners (FoongP), building on a decades-long informal working relationship to capitalise on business opportunities across the Causeway.\n\nThe firms have termed the tie-up a \"strategic alliance\", which will see them working almost exclusively with each other on deals as far as their geographical and professional expertise allows. This means that if WongP has a client who wishes to invest in Malaysia, FoongP will be the firm it uses for that portion of the deal and vice versa.\n\n\"This tie-up was driven mostly by the fact that a lot of the work we do today (corporate transactions in Singapore) tends to have a Malaysian component - whether it be an IPO (initial public offering), M&A (mergers and acquisitions) or private equity (PE) deal - because the target may have a business in Malaysia, or the clients may be interested in looking at something in Malaysia, and so on,\" WongP's joint managing partner, Ng Wai King, told The Business Times in an exclusive interview.\n\nMr Ng said that WongP has been collaborating with Malaysian lawyers on such transactions, including the Temasek Holdings and Khazanah Nasional Berhad joint development in Singapore, the IHH Healthcare Berhad IPO and the Khazanah/Fortis competing takeover offer for Parkway Holdings.\n\n\"We find that the need to work and collaborate with strong Malaysian lawyers has become more important now than ever before. Finding the right Malaysian lawyer with the right expertise is very important.\n\n\"We have worked alongside FoongP on a number of transactions, including Tune Ins Holdings Bhd's recent initial public offering, and we found a shared ethos of delivering unstinting high-quality service to our clients,\" Mr Ng said.\n\nFoong Chee Meng, managing partner of FoongP, which focuses on high-end corporate commercial, capital markets and corporate finance work, added: \"There are a lot of Malaysian clients who are expanding, looking to invest not just in Singapore, but in the UK and Australia, and they're very aggressive in their expansion. I find that, in most cases, I've had to help them and also refer foreign law firms to them. I've gone through quite a number of foreign law firms as well and I've always enjoyed working with WongP. It makes sense to work a lot closer than before, to have a formal association, whereby we give each other the attention, the priority and the preference.\n\n\"Instead of just saying to a client, 'Look, I think that law firm is good', I can now say, with a lot of confidence and assurance, that they will get the best service (with WongP). And, if there are any issues, I can just pick up the phone, and so can Wai King; we can call each other and resolve any issues.\"\n\nFoongP's Malaysian clients can also tap WongP's expertise in China, the Middle East and the rest of Asean, where the firm has offices.\n\nBoth partners said that deals in this part of the world are increasingly cross-Asean transactions - suggesting that law firms are best served by having the expertise, or access to expertise, in these markets.\n\nThe main focus for them at this point, however, will be Malaysia.\n\nSaid Mr Ng: \"Our PE clients would love to do more in Singapore, but Singapore as an economy is more mature - and so, high-profile PE buyout deals are getting harder to do here.\n\n\"When the PE clients start looking in the region outside Singapore, they find that Malaysia has a better set of regulations and a better regulatory framework compared to some other countries in the region. The certainty of execution and familiarity of regulations make it easier for PE clients to consider the opportunities in Malaysia.\"\n\nMr Foong added: \"I see a lot of business opportunities and funding issues, which I see Singapore and PE funds fitting wonderfully into; there are still a lot of opportunities in Malaysia that are perhaps not known to a lot of people in Singapore or anywhere else.\n\n\"In terms of funding, in Malaysia, it seems to be concentrated in the hands of a few big banks. Clearly, there's a lot of space for mezzanine funding or even PE funding to come into play. It's just a case of putting the two parties together, making sure that each other's interests are taken care of and all the risks are mitigated. And I don't see anyone doing that at the moment, probably because everyone's busy in their own backyard.\"\n\nAs to why WongP chose to go with a boutique practice rather than a full-service firm, Mr Ng said that the decision depended on the firm knowing and trusting the people it worked with.\n\n\"There was a consensus among the partnership that this is the right thing to do. (It's important to) make sure you can trust that the work gets done by the right people, that the clients are happy with the product, and that the lawyers themselves are the people you want to work with,\" he said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will soon be time for fund managers to begin \"window dressing\" end-of-year statements by loading up on this year's winners, and for workers to allocate retirement investments for 2014.\n\n\"The closer we get to December, the louder history sings 'Tis the season not to see declines',\" said Sam Stovall, strategist for Standard & Poor's Capital IQ, in a note to clients. \"So, while history says a correction is due, it doesn't say whether it will be on time. As a result, investors will likely get to enjoy their holiday festivities before fretting over the post-New Year fireworks.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Labour Department reported that US employers added 204,000 workers to payrolls in October - far more than the 120,000 economists had forecast.\n\nThe stronger data may have increased the odds of a December \"taper\" from the Federal Reserve. For now, however, the positive implications for a consumer-based economy at peak shopping season trump the likelihood of a reduction in stimulus, which everyone knew was coming within six months anyway.\n\nMarket psychology is also coming into play. Investors are finally shaking off the stock aversion that entered the collective psyche during the portfolio-bruising days of the 2008 financial crisis. For four years, even as economic and earnings reports generally exceeded expectations, steady bond mutual funds drew more money than rising equity funds in the last five years.\n\nThis year, stocks have come back with a bang.\n\nAccording to research firm TrimTabs, investors have added US$277 billion to stock mutual and exchange-traded funds so far this year, the most since 2000. That's largely because rate cutting and quantitative easing by central banks around the world have shrunk bond yields to meagre levels, leaving workers and pension funds little choice but to buy stocks for retirement funds.\n\nThe monetary stimulus kept coming last week when the European Central Bank unexpectedly cut rates, citing growth jitters in the European Union.\n\nThe stock gains kept coming, too. Even a big dip on Thursday did not scare investors away for long. The Standard & Poor's 500 is now up nearly 25 per cent so far in 2013, on pace for its largest annual gain since the 31 per cent advance in 1997 - one of the best years in the more-than-50-year history of the broad gauge.\n\nThere was another echo of the Dotcom boom last week. Twitter Inc's stockmarket debut was one of the strongest of any major company since the financial crisis.\n\nThe micro-blogging service sold roughly US$2.1 billion worth of stock in its initial public offering, and then saw its price almost double on its first day of trading. That was in stark contrast to rival Facebook, which saw its value drop on its debut.\n\nOnce again, the bull market is taking on a life of its own as television and Internet news outlets buzz with reports of tech investors striking gold and indices breaking record after record. Even after the rush into stock funds, many investors and fund managers have less of their portfolios in stocks than they had during the last bull market.\n\n\"The problem for most people is not that they own too much, it's that they're under-invested right now,\" said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade. In market psychology, people can \"panic buy\" when they cannot bear to miss out on a rally any longer, just as they \"panic sell\" when they cannot stand to lose any more money.\n\nNor is technology the only sector driving the gains. Last week, two of the strongest groups were bank stocks and commodity stocks.\n\nBoth groups had fallen out of favour during the autumn, as the outlook darkened for the housing market and international demand for raw materials. Now, traders are betting the strong jobs report heralds a new up-shift in US economic growth, a bounty for the economically sensitive areas.\n\nSurveys of industrial production this week will reveal whether that bet is warranted.\n\nEconomic and corporate-earnings growth in the third quarter was relatively modest. The US Commerce Department reported a 2.8 per cent GDP increase.\n\nProfits grew by an aggregate of 4.5per cent for the vast majority of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, according to Barclays Wealth & Investment Management.\n\nThis week, several Fed speakers, including Mr Bernanke, may drop hints on the outlook for QE in light of the slightly stronger economic data of late. Barring departure from their usually cryptic script, the central bankers are unlikely to dampen the new enthusiasm for stocks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Those voices on the board can be good for it,\" she said.\n\nShe sits on the boards of insurance giant AXA and Asian Civilisations Museum, among others.\n\nIn order to strengthen board effectiveness and truly drive business value, advisers should be prepared to speak up when they disagree on the board's course of action, and to push for changes, said Richard Emerton, managing partner of the board and chief executive of Services at Korn/Ferry.\n\n\"It's also important for the advice to be received in the right way by the board,\" he added.\n\nThe SIAS conference panel also weighed in on the search for suitable boardroom candidates.\n\nSingTel chairman Simon Israel said a board should first establish the needs of the organisation, and then go about defining the profile of an ideal candidate for the position.\n\n\"It's important to cast as wide a net as possible. Relying on internal networks is insufficient in such a situation,\" he said.\n\nThe entire board should then collectively determine whether the new candidate is the right \"fit' with the needs of the board and organisation, while recognising the challenges around diversity.\n\nFellow panellist Fiona Shand of law firm Shand & Associates said Australia still had a long battle to fight against \"unconscious bias\", despite having a relatively high standard of corporate governance practice.\n\n\"There's still a fear factor - of the unknown, the untested and the untried,\" she said. \"There's a fear that different means bad.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Boeing has said that barring a \"yes\" vote on the contract, it would be looking at other potential locations.\n\nIndustry observers say Washington faces competition from states including South Carolina, where Boeing assembles some of its 787 Dreamliners, as well as Texas and Utah.\n\nJapan, whose heavy industry builds wings for the Dreamliner, is seen as a contender to build the wings for the 777X, the longest wings designed for a Boeing jetliner.\n\nThe tax measure passed the Washington state Senate by a vote of 42-2 last Saturday. The US$9 billion measure would extend aerospace tax breaks set to expire in 2024 through 2040 and enact incentives for building airplane factories on the condition that Boeing sites its 777X wing fabrication and final assembly in Washington state.\n\n\"Our vote isn't near as important as theirs,\" Democratic state Senator Brian Hatfield said of the union vote.\n\n\"It's a big deal,\" he added. \"It is your job and your family and your pension, but it also has lots to do with the future of the state.\"\n\nHours after the Senate action, the state House passed the measure by a vote of 75-11.\n\nLawmakers also passed a measure last Saturday to streamline permitting for the airplane maker and to commit more state funds to aerospace worker training programmes.\n\nBoeing's latest jet - the 777X, a successor to its most profitable long-haul aircraft - would secure tens of thousands of jobs in the Seattle area, which is competing with non-unionised workers in the US South, where wages are lower. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Hong Kong is moving in this direction, which raises the ante in terms of competition as a domicile for funds.\n\nPwC expects to release a White Paper on a proposed Singapore investment fund framework in December.\n\nJustin Ong, PwC Singapore asset management leader, said the current legal structures available for investment funds - such as the unit trust, limited partnership or private company - all have limitations for fund management firms.\n\nAt the moment many firms choose to domicile their structures in the Cayman Islands, for instance, though actual fund management activities may be conducted in Singapore.\n\n\"We're talking about creating another framework, a new infrastructure to cater to the industry to provide more flexibility,\" he said.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Ong said: \"To compete or even be on par with global investment centres, such as Luxembourg, Dublin and Cayman Islands, Singapore must be able to offer a variety of investment fund platforms beyond the current structures - such as open-ended companies, segregated portfolio companies and even segregated sub-funds.\"\n\nIn the executive summary of the White Paper, which it released yesterday, it proposed a framework of investment fund laws that marry the legislation that governs legal entities (partnerships, companies and trusts) with the necessary laws that govern the business of fund investments.\n\nIt is hoped that a new framework would spur more fund managers to set up operations in Singapore. Said PwC in the summary paper: \"In the bigger picture, the inevitable evolution of asset management and servicing ecosystem around such a change would contribute significantly to the economy in terms of higher employment, enhanced productivity and growth in fund flows through new product ranges created and managed in Singapore, among others.\"\n\nPwC conducted a survey in July and August this year to gather industry feedback. The consensus, it said, is that a new investment fund law \"would be deemed appropriate and would actually be required to gain more share of the global fund market\".\n\nAn example of what is needed is a variable capital structure to enable investors to enter and exit the investment vehicle \"without the current corporatised vehicle pitfall\".\n\nThere is also the need for flexibility in choosing the appropriate reporting framework to cater to the international investment community, investor and investment strategy confidentiality, as well as the ability to access tax treaty benefits.\n\nIn the current funds framework, unit trusts do not allow access to the privileges under double tax treaties. A corporate vehicle also comes with restrictive components which make it investor-unfriendly.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This is creating a \"nightmare\" situation for CIOs (chief information officers) in terms of securing corporate data on endpoints and networks, and tracking employees' usage of these resources.\n\nThis situation is expected to hit mainstream consciousness by 2015, says Jack Zubarev, president and general manager of cross platform business at virtualisation software vendor, Parallels.\n\nMany organisations will have a combination of Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Phone, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android stacks, if not all of them, to support on their infrastructure, he noted.\n\nTo capitalise on this situation, Parallels is looking to beef up its offerings, particularly in terms of enterprise-friendly features to allow for seamless portability of data across multiple platforms.\n\nAlready, it has launched its Parallels Access for iPad - in August this year - to address the increasing use of tablets within the enterprise space. The software modifies existing Windows and Mac applications, which generally rely on mouse and keyboard for use, to make them more user-friendly on a touch interface.\n\nSo, users of Windows Office, for example, would be able to access and edit their documents on an iPad as they would on their desktops and laptops, Mr Zubarev said. One way to do this is to incorporate predictive touch for the scroll bar on the margins, so that people with slightly larger fingers will not be left exasperated by having to aim at a precise point on the thin margin to scroll up and down the document.\n\nThat said, he acknowledged that this version of Parallels Access for iPad is targeted towards \"prosumers\", or consumers who buy the software to use for work-related activities, and is not suitable for corporate use yet. He did say the company is working on producing an enterprise version of the software for the coming year, but declined to mention a release date.\n\nHe also said that the current version allows users to access their apps via its cloud network, but that this is not ideal for many enterprises that would prefer access to be over internal networks. Therefore, Parallels is currently developing the enterprise version to run apps off private clouds.\n\nThe other enterprise concerns that it hopes to address include making sure its product integrates well with internal security tools and policies, and plays well with existing mobile device management (MDM) products.\n\nIt is also looking to go beyond Apple's iOS to other mobile OSes, but Mr Zubarev declined to identify what other platforms Parallels is looking to branch out to and when these variants will be available.\n\nHe did stress that Parallels' cross platform business is not keen on replacing MDM vendors or entering the security space. Rather, he is looking to position this business unit to be known for \"seamless, good experience for users to move from one platform to another\", and not just from Windows to Mac, and vice versa.\n\n\"We are trying to make enterprise adoption easier by creating a super good experience for end users; by doing so, they can become advocates (for Parallels) within their organisations,\" he said.\n\nThe enterprise mobility market for Asia-Pacific is booming right now, and research firm IDC in March forecast that the market, excluding Japan, will reach US$6.9 billion by the end of the year. This figure represents an annual growth rate of 29 per cent, the study stated.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It currently employs some 30 data scientists worldwide, six of whom are based in the Asia-Pacific region, with three of them in Singapore.\n\nApart from the private sector, the company is also applying Big Data analytics to public-sector use in the Asia-Pacific.\n\nIt has collaborated with tax departments on fraud detection, and is working with a city council to enhance traffic control management. Using data collected from various sources, Pivotal detected which underground inductive loops - used for detecting vehicles - had broken down and has since made it possible for the council to do predictive maintenance.\n\nWith data analytics, the council also knows which buses are deviating from their prescribed routes. In addition, it is able to improve scenario planning with models that work out the time needed to traverse each road in different conditions. Very importantly, more people in the organisation can now easily visualise on Google Earth what is happening across the city, a view that used to be limited to those in the traffic control room.\n\nIn order to help organisations that are keen to harness Big Data but have neither the infrastructure nor knowhow, Pivotal recently launched an innovation centre in Singapore to get them started.\n\nPivotal also helps companies to build up their own data science expertise. In India, it worked with a conglomerate to hire and train data scientists, and built models for the customer who is now able to harness Big Data on his own.\n\nSo what are the attributes organisations should look for when hiring a data scientist?\n\nGreg Whalen, Pivotal's chief data scientist for Asia Pacific and Japan who oversees its data science practice across all industries in the region, looks for someone who has technical background and experience in Big Data and analytics in at least one or two verticals.\n\n\"Otherwise, he will look for software development expertise, as many software developers who have worked on Big Data have also worked on machine learning.\"\n\nMachine learning is an area of computer science for studying and designing algorithms (formulae or sets of steps) that learn over time from data. One example is spam-filtering where a single model cannot be used by everyone as spam to one person may not be so to another. With machine learning, a data scientist can look at how each person labels data and, based on that, create a personalised model on what spam means to the user.\n\nIf such a candidate cannot be found, Mr Whalen will look for someone with a good grasp of statistics. \"Sometimes we have to do some training and correct the gaps there, but we find that it is much easier to correct someone who already has a technical background,\" he said.\n\nAs for whether a data scientist needs to be a PhD holder, Mr Whalen does not think that it is necessary. \"Many data scientists have a PhD because there has not been a strong emphasis on teaching statistical machine learning as an entry point to a job over the last 10 years. It is an important part of the skillset required and, typically, the people who have exposure to that have a PhD. But that is going to change and we would not set that expectation for the future,\" he explained. Not all members of Pivotal's data science team have such a qualification.\n\nMr Whalen emphasised that it is just as important for data scientists to have the drive to help businesses transform their product lines. At the same time, there must be a willingness to understand how different kinds of businesses and how things work in general.\n\nBut having a data scientist alone is not effective.\n\n\"It's a team sport. We work in a collaborative model with several roles when we execute a data science project - there are data scientists, data engineers and also people with project management, IT and business analysis skills,\" said Mr Whalen.\n\nA data engineer designs, builds and manages the infrastructure for processing and analysing big data.\n\nApart from finding people with the right skillsets, organisations have to be careful not to confuse data science with business intelligence, said Steve Illingworth, Pivotal's chief technology officer for Asia Pacific and Japan.\n\n\"Data science provides forward-looking insights. It is about forecasts and predictions, whereas business intelligence looks at the past. Being able to do prediction and prevention is way more valuable to any organisation.\n\n\"A problem with business intelligence (BI) is that you start with an assumption and you go looking for the data that proves you right. Data science does not do that; it lets the data give the insights. You write an algorithm and the data can tell you something. The hard thing about data science is figuring out the questions to ask. That's just as important as the answers. But figuring out what you want to know - that's business value,\" Mr Illingworth added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/declouts-vision-cloud", "site_title": "DeClout's vision in the cloud", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDeClout's vision in the cloud\n\nCEO Vesmond Wong is taking steps for the firm to become the leader in vertical domain clouds, starting with gaming, reports LEE MEIXIAN\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT has not been the smoothest first year for DeClout as a listed company since its initial public offering (IPO), what with a languishing stock price and its bottomline in the red.\n\nStill, group CEO of the next-generation technology service provider Vesmond Wong tells The Business Times that the company is continuing to make steady calculated strides towards its vision - to be the leader in creating vertical domain clouds (VDCs) in Asia.\n\nVDCs, a term the company coined, are platforms that use cloud computing technology to serve specific industries or market niches, allowing various stakeholders within these communities to interact, collaborate, even transact.\n\nMr Wong cites professional social network LinkedIn as one good example of a VDC. Its domain, human resources, is integrated with IT to make it a social ecosystem of professional profiles. LinkedIn is then monetised through its hiring services offered to companies and the account upgrade option for users.\n\nThis is as opposed to horizontal clouds, which are generic offerings from big guns in the likes of Google, Amazon and IBM to the broader horizontal marketplace.\n\nDeClout has picked gaming as its first domain to develop. It plans to build a portal where gamers can access a variety of online games, interact with other gamers, and pay using a common virtual currency across South-east Asia.\n\nThis is coming together slowly. The cloud infrastructure is up, with more than 20 game publishers hosting 50-odd games on it in four countries. But the unified payment infrastructure and gamers' community portal will only go live either at the end of this year or early next.\n\nThe VDC segment's very gradual progress shows in DeClout's latest half-year results, where it contributed only 4 per cent, or $1.1 million, to the company's revenue. The segment's gross profit of $332,000 makes up just 6 per cent of total gross profit of $5.3 million.\n\nAfter expenses, however, DeClout incurred net losses of $2.2 million at the group level, versus profits of $272,000 a year ago. Its shares have more than halved from its IPO price of 25 cents to 12.2 cents on Friday's close.\n\nMr Wong says he is concerned. \"Share price is a function of our deliverables, which we have yet to deliver, be it in terms of numbers or the execution of our plans.\"\n\nHe adds: \"As a CEO, I'm supposed to bring value to all the shareholders. But I'd say the share price is not really reflective of our business right now, and it is my job to explain clearly to the community how they should value us in totality.\"\n\nWhat's hardest is having to balance between pushing the VDC strategy and the company's financial health.\n\nMr Wong says: \"I cannot over-invest and create a dent on the company's performance, but neither can I be neglecting it because this is our mid-to-long term strategy.\"\n\nVDCs are but one end of the spectrum of DeClout's business, he says. On the opposite end of the spectrum is its IT asset recovery segment, also its bread-and-butter business, parked under its unit Asvida.\n\nMr Wong terms Asvida a \"reverse logistics\" company. If traditional \"forward\" logistics firms collect parts, assemble them, and sell the finished products, then Asvida's business of collecting traded-in second-hand products to either trade the parts, or re-use them for maintenance or to build another system according to a customer's required configurations, is exactly the reverse.\n\nThis is especially useful for disaster recovery - ensuring that critical business functions such as banking and telecommunication systems stay accessible when disruptive events occur - since this does not require the newest and latest equipment. A refurbished set could as well do the trick.\n\nIt is very profitable business, with low costs and high gross profit margins of nearly 30 per cent, says Mr Wong. The only drawback is that it is often viewed as an unglamorous \"grey business\". That is why DeClout hopes to professionalise this segment by mounting a global expansion plan and escaping the constraints of the small Singapore market.\n\nIt started in April this year with the acquisition of a stake in US-based Procurri, a company also in the business of refurbishing used equipment for re-deployment or resale. This move is already bearing fruit: three months of Procurri's operations have contributed $5 million, or 18 per cent, to the group's revenue of $27.6 million in the first half. DeClout has given itself until the first quarter of next year to complete similar acquisitions in Europe and China.\n\nThere are two other units under DeClout's IT infrastructure division: Beaqon, which provides telecommunications and network infrastructure services; and Acclivis, which provides IT solutions to clients.\n\nBeaqon was the nasty surprise in DeClout's half-year results after its next-generation nationwide broadband network projects reported lower revenue and profit on rising foreign worker wages, as well as lower margins from its new 4G mobile infrastructure rollout projects due to the higher hardware cost component involved.\n\nBeaqon is also trying to move its value chain towards building its own multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) communication lines in South-east Asia. This is a kind of high-speed network that directs data across geographies from data centre to data centre and will be able to help support its VDCs too.\n\n\"Cloud computing is about performance of the communication lines. People don't want a lag-time when they send emails. This is not a public line that we're using; it is a dedicated line that we will own. The assurance of speed will be within our control. It doesn't loop one big round as it might on a public line. Here, it's direct point to point,\" says Mr Wong.\n\nAs for Acclivis, it manages customers' IT systems round the clock against threats, on or off the cloud, and recovers their operations in times of disaster. The latter function is also critical for the ecosystem of clouds because users expect them to be up 24/7, Mr Wong says.\n\nAcclivis is currently leasing and managing \"100 over\" datacentre space for customers and itself. Meanwhile, it is also transforming to become a cloud operator. In July this year, it became Microsoft's first Asian partner to offer hosted productivity cloud solution to Microsoft's customers.\n\n\"What this means is: Microsoft has this Office 365 product hosted on a public domain, which many governmental and financial customers cannot go onto due to the lack of data integrity on public clouds.\n\n\"Now Microsoft has realised it's missing out on a big chunk of this business, so it has invited us to become a partner to host a private cloud environment in Singapore, and it will refer all its customers in the government and financial sector to us.\"\n\nIn the end, everything DeClout does comes down to this - to build a solid base for its VDC business to come onboard.\n\nBut for analysts, seeing is believing. Until something materialises, it is hard to convince the market. AmFraser's Valerie Chan has said that DeClout's gaming VDC \"remains a wildcard\" and will take a while to achieve economies of scale and profitability, with expected small losses for the next two years.\n\nStill, Mr Wong is undeterred, determined even to reward shareholders who believe in the company's vision.\n\n\"To be able to reward these shareholders would be the day we consider ourselves successful. But we are a very high-growth company, so it is difficult for us to pay dividends because we are taking a lot of cashflow back to reinvest in the business.\"\n\nThere is another way to reward shareholders, however, he says.\n\n\"What we are hoping to achieve is, in any of the mature lines of businesses that we have developed, once we are able to unlock value from them, then I think that will be the time that we can reward and thank our shareholders.\"\n\nThis column is an expanded version of CEO Speaks, where views are curated from a wider range of corporate leaders to better capture all that's going on in the business world\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Speaking at the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, she described Abenomics as \"nothingnomics\" and as the \"delusion of a backward-looking mind\".\n\nGrowing doubts are meanwhile being voiced about the likelihood of the so-called \"third arrow\" of Abenomics, involving fundamental structural reforms to Japan's economy, hitting its target at any time in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Tokyo stock market and the yen have become range-bound by this uncertainty and the report by Mr Sheard - a former head of economic research at Nomura Securities in Tokyo - could further puncture market expectations.\n\nLike the IMF and others, Mr Sheard gives credit to the Bank of Japan for its bold, growth-supporting monetary policies in recent months, and to the Abe government's fiscal stimulus of Japan's economy. But they raise doubts over whether more fundamental structural reforms can be achieved.\n\nThe S&P chief economist argues that Mr Abe's growth strategy for the Japanese economy is \"more a case of business as usual\" than something truly game-changing.\n\nHe calls for more radical, and politically difficult, solutions, such as raising Japan's retirement age further, encouraging immigration and steps to foster the birth of more children.\n\nGiven Japan's shrinking population and workforce, \"unless radical action is taken to raise the fertility rate and embrace immigration, the target to lift real GDP growth (to 2 per cent) looks like pie in the sky\", says Mr Sheard, touching upon a sensitive nerve in Japan - the issue of encouraging immigration in the way that other ageing societies have done.\n\nGrowth can come only from increasing labour inputs, capital accumulation, and productivity, Mr Sheard maintains. \"To raise its potential real growth rate, Japan needs to address one or more - preferably all - of these three. There is nowhere else that growth can come from.\"\n\nThe Bank of Japan estimates Japan's potential annual growth rate currently at 0.5 per cent. But Mr Sheard argues that \"given the demographic outlook, and assuming there is not a miraculous burst of growth-enhancing innovation, Japan's potential growth is set to decline steadily over the foreseeable future\".\n\nAccording to population projections published by Japan's National Institute of Population and Social Security in January last year, \"Japan is expected to enter a long period of population decline\".\n\n\"A relatively easy way to reverse the decline in the workforce is for society to collectively agree to extend the working life of the average citizen. One way to do this would be to start to index the retirement age to life expectancy,\" Mr Sheard suggests.\n\n\"Extending the retirement age has a doubly positive effect on productivity and fiscal burdens, because not only does it increase the productive capacity of society, it decreases the period of 'dependency' of the aged on the rest of society (or on their own savings).\"\n\nThe biggest driver of the adverse demographics in Japan, however, is the very low fertility rate.\n\nThe replacement fertility rate in Japan - that is, the birth rate that should keep the population stable, neither falling nor rising - is estimated to be 2.07 (births per woman) but the ratio is currently only 1.4.\n\n\"Increasing the female participation rate also has merit, but, if the aim is to promote growth by reversing the decline in labour inputs to the economy, increasing the female participation rate could be counterproductive if it were associated with a decline in the fertility rate,\" said the report.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In 2012, none of the information security professionals surveyed reported to senior executives. In 2013, this jumped to 35 per cent,\" he said.\n\nKen Allan, EY global information security leader, added: \"Cyber-crime is the greatest threat for organisations' survival today. While budget allocations towards security innovation are inching their way up, enabling organisations to channel more resources towards innovating solutions that can protect them against the great unknown - the future - many information security professionals continue to feel that their budgets are insufficient to address mounting cyber risks.\"\n\nGerry Chng, EY's Asean information security leader, added that with all the recent news on cyber-attacks, information leakages, new regulations and emerging technologies, organisations need to start doing more by rethinking how they are dealing with the challenges.\n\nThe survey notes that, despite half of the respondents planning to increase their budget by 5 per cent or more over the next 12 months, 65 per cent cite an insufficient budget as their No 1 challenge to operating at the levels the business expects; and, among organisations with revenues of US$10 million or less, this figure rises to 71 per cent.\n\nOf the budgets planned for the next 12 months, 14 per cent are earmarked for security innovation and emerging technologies.\n\nAs current technologies become further entrenched in an organisation's network and culture, organisations need to be aware of how employees use the devices, both in the workplace and in their personal lives.\n\nThis is especially true when it comes to social media, which respondents identified as an area where they continue to feel unsure of their capability to address risks.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He was speaking of Africa, but economists say the same is true of India and others in Asia.\n\nThe US$10 billion that the ADB will lend to India over the next five years pales in comparison to the massive infrastructure financing needs of the subcontinent. But there are also massive domestic savings available to finance infrastructure if these can be tapped, says Mr Hasan.\n\n\"India's insurance and pension funds have a considerable amount of long-term money they need to invest, (but) the regulatory framework under which they work (means that) they can only invest in bonds floated by infrastructure or other projects that are AA-rated,\" Mr Hasan said.\n\n\"They cannot go below AA and that creates a problem because a number of corporate infrastructure groups are able to float bonds and, if credit agencies rate these below AA, this pool of (institutional investment) funds is not available to finance infrastructure.\n\n\"What we have been seeing in India is that commercial banks have freely been lending in a big way to infrastructure and they really can't do more because they have met their group exposure and sector limits.\"\n\nTo overcome this, the ADB and India's Infrastructure Financing Corporation (IFCL) have introduced partial credit guarantees. If a private sector group issues a bond to fund a project which is rated below AA, the ADB and IFCL offer a guarantee up to the point where the project bond qualifies for the AA rating.\n\n\"The moment we do that, insurance and pension funds can move in,\" Mr Hasan said. These scheme was introduced fairly recently and \"we are pushing further on this . . . instead of taking money and putting it directly into, say, into a road project, it is put aside to cover the credit risk\".\n\nIndia does not take concessional loans from the ADB's Asian Development Fund (ADF) for financing its huge infrastructure needs - a concession which allows even poorer (and smaller) member countries of the ADB to benefit from limited concessional funds available.\n\nProject loans to India come from the ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources, where interest rates are based on a margin over the bank's own borrowing costs. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is also a big lender to India, though, again at near-commercial rates.\n\nInfrastructure provision, especially in poorer Indian states, is essential to help close income gaps and reduce poverty, as well as to support overall Indian economic growth, said Juan Miranda, director general of the ADB South Asia Department in a statement.\n\n\"The north-east, for example, is a land-bridge for India to reach fast-growing and lucrative Asean markets,\" he said. \"This will be matched by work in economic corridor development, particularly in southeast India, which provides access to cost-effective shipping routes.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

What do you expect to be the top challenge facing your company, and how would you tackle it?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nLow Lee Yong\n\nCEO & Founder\n\nMHC Medical Network\n\nIN a tight labour market, everyone is talking about retaining and getting their hands on a limited talent pool. SMEs face the greatest challenge, compared with large corporations whose perceived prestige and deeper pockets often attract the \"top talents\".\n\nBut \"talent\" is over-rated. You can pay to hire top talents, but if they lack integrity they will bring your business down. Pay alone also cannot keep talent. The staff needs to feel challenged and involved at work; they need space for free play and for making mistakes as they grow with the business.\n\nThis is where SMEs can have an edge over large firms where conformity is expected and failure seldom an option. What businesses really need are passionate staff who have integrity, faithfulness and EQ to work together as a team. These are the true talents businesses should strive to groom and retain, regardless of their academic qualifications.\n\nLionel Lim\n\nPresident, Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nCA Technologies\n\nSINGAPORE is likely to be a bright spark in the region going by recent economic indicators, and we will have a clearer picture later this quarter. Considering the global economic environment, and the opportunities and growth forecasts for this region, I am cautiously optimistic. Our challenge for 2014 is to deliver greater sales velocity for ourselves and for our customers in this increasingly cloud-connected market.\n\nTechnology offers many answers here, not just to power a company and ensure it can serve customers well, but also to engender significant improvements in productivity and efficiency. Technology solutions that turn Capex into Opex (operating expenditures), eliminate internal inefficiencies and bring products and services more quickly to market are key to how businesses can remain buoyant in the year ahead. 2014 will be a year of leveraging more deeply on our investments and identifying new ways to innovate.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nWE look forward to a vibrant and positive 2014. The search for the best talent is a priority for many companies and certainly companies will have to think of innovative and creative ways to attract such people. Dynamic talent mobility is key to sustaining a healthy and vibrant economy and Singapore has one of the best and strongest economies in the region and beyond.\n\nOne of our key priorities would be to continually attract the best talent available and provide the best jobs available.\n\nCK Lee\n\nCountry Director Singapore\n\nKroll Ontrack\n\nWE foresee a growing market for enterprise data recovery as Singapore strengthens its position as the regional IT hub for major tech and cloud services companies. That is why we have doubled the capacity of our Singapore data recovery cleanroom space for the second time in two years to deal with increases in the amount of data recovered, and offer more capabilities for enterprises and government services.\n\nOur major challenge is to attract qualified staff, and changes in storage and device use mean that we need to continually upgrade the skill set of our data recovery engineers. The training process takes many years, so to manage this, we continue to refresh our facilities. This helps to ensure that we continue to offer a positive work environment and continued professional education, as well as establish strong alliances with other tech providers to stay in the forefront.\n\nMark Micallef\n\nArea Vice President, Asean\n\nCitrix Systems\n\nWE look forward to a positive 2014 in view of numerous growth opportunities in the region. However, like other businesses here, intense competition to recruit the right talent will be one of our most pressing challenges. We believe that digitally savvy solutions, such as desktop virtualisation, coupled with a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy, can help address this by offering employees a mobile workstyle that will be attractive to the new generation of workers.\n\nA virtual desktop infrastructure gives them the flexibility to work at any time, from any place, and using any device, whether it is their work laptop, personal tablet or home desktop. It will simultaneously eliminate geographical, time and device restrictions, giving businesses the work productivity improvements and cost-savings they need to stay competitive.\n\nFred Schellert\n\nVice-President Asia-Pacific\n\nFNT Solutions Singapore\n\nRECENT macroeconomic data on Singapore inject confidence for an upbeat 2014. While businesses are pursuing growth, we also find that organisations appear to be giving cursory attention to maintaining a robust IT infrastructure, resulting in growing failures of critical telecommunications and banking services to the public.\n\nLooking into 2014, our challenge is to get large organisations to adopt integrated software solutions that document, track, analyse and plan the entire IT network, in addition to aiding in quick recovery.\n\nWhile one would assume that this is a given, recent system failures show otherwise. We would like businesses to better appreciate and understand how to implement IT in a strategic manner, so as to have the necessary information to overcome any crisis and restore services quickly. As an innovative technology player, FNT Solution sees itself playing a pivotal role in supporting organisations to achieve higher resilience, reliability and recoverability.\n\nNick Foley\n\nPresident - South-east Asia & Pacific\n\nLandor\n\nSPENDING time growing a brand's emotional connectivity is a business's best defence during a flat-line economy. Solid branding will have customers seeking to experience the service or product since lists of features and benefits alone are no longer enough as distinctives.\n\nIn this slow economic climate, it is vital to capture the heart first in order to have your competitor lost in the crowd. Take for example, the newly opened Krispy Kreme Doughnuts at Tangs: customers are emotionally invested enough to want to pay a premium and wait in a considerable queue for a bite of the snack.\n\nAs brand consultants, we need to discover new ways for our clients to capture the attention of their potential customers, and make sure that their customers develop positive connecting impressions of the brand. This will in turn help ensure continued buying.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive, ABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and\n\nCEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nWITH Singapore continuing to be a top wealth, financial services and trading hub, ABN AMRO will continue to leverage our long-standing presence in this region to realise our strong growth ambitions. The outlook for our private banking and merchant banking (energy, commodities and transportation) as well as clearing businesses remains positive.\n\nOur private banking clients are international, highly educated and investment-savvy, who expect high levels of personalised service and access to exclusive products. The key challenge we have is to continually raise the bar in providing holistic solutions tailored to our clients' investment objectives, asset preferences and risk appetites.\n\nOn the merchant banking front, the challenge is to stay nimble and support our clients with relevant solutions and advice in the ever-changing macro environment while attracting and retaining a pool of specialist talent in the industry. The pace of regulatory changes is, of course, an additional challenge that all banks have to reckon with. Finally, we want to become an \"easier\" bank to work with for all our clients, which means simplifying our processes - something that is never easy.\n\nHari Krishnan\n\nManaging Director\n\nLinkedIn Asia Pacific & Japan\n\nGOING into 2014, the lingering economic uncertainties globally present interesting opportunities for both market leaders and challengers. Businesses that invest in two areas - talent to drive their growth and solutions exploiting new technologies to differentiate their products and services and target them to relevant individuals - will be steps ahead of their competitors.\n\nLinkedIn is in a high growth mode. Having the right talent to drive our vision of creating economic opportunities for all professionals will be a game changer for us. We know very well that 80 per cent of professionals are not active job seekers, and hence traditional recruitment methods will be insufficient.\n\nInstead, we will continue to build a strong talent pipeline by investing in a compelling employer brand and leveraging this to engage this group on platforms like LinkedIn. Facilitating internal career mobility is just as critical, as our ambitious employees are constantly looking to take on more.\n\nTan Hak Leh\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAIA Singapore\n\nA TIGHT labour market will be a key issue for businesses and Singapore as a knowledge-based economy must continue efforts to boost productivity levels and maintain our competitive edge. This is why we believe in the importance of hiring and retaining talent, keeping them motivated and looking out for their wellbeing.\n\nIn fact, our 2013 AIA Healthy Living Index Survey found that Singaporeans are increasingly exposed to major health risks including stress, insufficient sleep, lack of physical activity and poor diet. Nine in 10 Singaporeans also feel that their employers have an obligation to help them lead healthier lives.\n\nAccordingly, AIA Singapore introduced all our employees to AIA Vitality, a wellness programme which incentivises and rewards them for leading healthier lives. This programme complements existing staff benefits and insurance packages, responding to the feedback received from Singaporeans. The environment we operate in is continually evolving and AIA Singapore, as The Real Life Company, is constantly seeking ways to introduce innovations to benefit individuals, families and companies alike.\n\nMichael Cornwell\n\nVice-President, Asia-Pacific & Japan\n\nPure Storage\n\nTHE year ahead offers tremendous business opportunities. Asia is a major contributor to Pure's global growth largely because Singapore has quickly become a thought leader as many multinational and financial services companies have relocated their IT leadership and technology decision makers to Singapore. It's clear from our early interactions with customers in Singapore that they are not only making the storage decision for Asia but for the rest of the world.\n\nOne challenge of scaling a global business like Pure is entering emerging markets in the right way. One approach we have seen early success with begins by hiring the best talent in the region to start and grow the business in the local market. It is then important to identify partners and customers that the company intends to have long-term relationships with, and heavily invest in support resources to deliver true enterprise service in that region.\n\nLothar Herrmann\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nSiemens Pte Ltd\n\nCONSIDERING the performance we have turned in for our Financial Year 2013, I'm confident that the business climate ahead will remain positive. The Singapore economy has proven to be resilient in the last few years despite global economic uncertainties. Singapore has also forged ahead with major infrastructure projects, such as the Downtown Line, new public housing and new public hospitals. These ongoing projects, and many other public as well as private investments, will ensure the vibrancy of the Singapore economy.\n\nLooking ahead, Singapore, like many other advanced economies, will face challenges in ensuring the resilience in its urban infrastructure, efficient energy generation and consumption, as well as moving the important manufacturing sector to the next level of technology to remain one step ahead. Siemens will ensure that we remain relevant through our technologies and partner Singapore through this development.\n\nBrad Gray\n\nRegional Director, South-east Asia\n\nPolycom\n\nTODAY'S world is becoming increasingly inter-connected, with businesses functioning on a global scale as they explore new markets and opportunities. The rise of geographically dispersed teams warrants the necessary tools and resources to defy distance barriers and enable human collaboration at all times.\n\nSingapore's investments in developing an advanced communications infrastructure have greatly eased the challenge of cross-country collaborations, leaving the country well-positioned to be as successful as, if not more than, neighbours such as Korea, Australia and New Zealand, all known for applying innovative technology in areas such as telehealth and distance learning. Coupled with rising business momentum, this bodes well for Singapore's business climate.\n\nHowever, many companies may not have harnessed the benefits of technologies such as video collaboration beyond group meetings, while others are unable to eliminate the traditional mindset that physical presence in the office is required as proof of work.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Polycom believes in educating companies on how video collaboration helps in talent management, thereby containing labour costs by creating ease of access to remote experts that are costly to reach otherwise, and meets the cultural need for face-to-face interaction while raising productivity and enabling them to stay competitive in today's globalised economy.\n\nCraig Tegel\n\nRegional President\n\nAdobe Japan and Asia-Pacific\n\nTHE economy has been on an upward trend and on the business front, we have seen great success this year, with the launch of Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud, helping our customers to develop, monitor and measure campaigns through an increasingly integrated creative and marketing workflow.\n\nThat said, we also understand the challenges our customers are dealing with in a fast-changing business environment, and a top priority for us in 2014 is to work with them to facilitate their business transformations.\n\nWe work to continually engage our customers, and equip them with the most up-to-date tools to help meet the needs of their own customers, which are also always evolving due to the emergence of new channels and touch points.\n\n2014 is going to be an exciting year, with many growth opportunities especially in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific region. Regardless of how the industry changes, our focus will always be on our customers, helping them change the world through digital experiences.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nECONOMIC growth for next year is expected to be fairly healthy. I foresee that the demand for manpower will intensify, exacerbated by the spate of curbs to moderate the inflow of foreign workers. Businesses should brace themselves for a tighter labour market as Singaporean and permanent resident workers continue to be a hot commodity, resulting in increased labour costs.\n\nFortunately, this situation works to our advantage as our core business is in supplying talent to the market, and the labour shortage should translate to increased demand for our recruitment services.\n\nThat said, our company may also face the same challenges in finding and recruiting good talent to grow our organisation. As recruitment specialists, we will deploy the talent acquisition strategies that we have honed over the years, to find and hire the right talent for PrimeStaff, as we plan to continue expanding our business in 2014.\n\nLee Fook Chiew\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nInstitute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (ISCA)\n\nBASED on a recent ISCA survey, our respondents who are mainly finance professionals, have indicated a more positive economic growth outlook for Singapore in the coming year.\n\nWhile there is some cheer, our members have also expressed concern over the impact of manpower challenges and rising business costs on their organisations' competitiveness. The manpower challenges include difficulty in hiring and attracting talent, exacerbated by the further tightening of foreign labour. Rental hikes have increased the business cost of organisations, particularly SMEs.\n\nAs such, while organisations make preparations to tap business opportunities elsewhere, they will have to address manpower challenges and manage their rising business costs at the same time. Investing in training can help increase an organisation's attractiveness in attracting and retaining talent.\n\nTo tackle rising business costs, an organisation's finance function can play an important role in managing costs while embracing opportunities. Among other measures, this can be achieved through optimisation of the organisation's capital structure and effective cash management, which will minimise cost of capital.\n\nToby Fowlston\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nRobert Walters (Singapore) Ltd\n\nIN our field of specialist recruitment, we are currently seeing a strong demand for quality Singaporean talent from companies and this will continue into 2014. In this tight labour market, we face the challenge of generating more local talent for our clients.\n\nIn our efforts to do so, Robert Walters Singapore has also reached out to overseas Singaporean talent either via those registered in our global offices or through government bodies. Our clients are benefiting from partnering with an international recruitment firm in order to attract returning Singaporeans to their organisations.\n\nGood talent is not always listed on job boards nor are they always actively looking for new jobs. Recruitment firms with good head-hunting skills have the ability to locate and work with this passive candidate pool.\n\nRichard Hong\n\nCEO\n\nT\u00dcV S\u00dcD PSB (Asean)\n\nOUR business is about providing testing, certification, auditing and inspection services to businesses so our performance in Singapore and Asean is closely tied to the health and wealth of the regional economy.The Asean economy grew 6 per cent in 2012. And with our leaders' commitment to unify the Asean economies by 2015, we have no doubt our business in Asean will grow.\n\nBut we still face immediate challenges. This includes fragmented Asean markets and limited pro-business policies in some areas. Skilled talent recruitment and retention continues to be a problem. To strive ahead, T\u00dcV S\u00dcD will be aligning existing businesses and seeking beneficial mergers and acquisitions. Developing new markets and services will be our key priorities to achieve sustainable growth.\n\nNicholas McGrath\n\nCEO\n\nAIMS AMP Capital Industrial Reit\n\nWE are cautiously optimistic for the year ahead. Growth in Singapore's domestic economy is expected to continue to be moderate and the Singapore industrial property market remained steady in the September 2013 quarter, with stable rents and marginal growth in capital values.\n\nHowever, we need to manage uncertainty about the possibility of the US Federal Reserve tapering its quantitative easing policy in the near future. While there is some stability in the financial markets, there continues to be fears of rising interest rates, which will ultimately affect the funding costs of vehicles such as Reits.\n\nAA Reit is well positioned to manage these challenges. Our strong capital structure and ongoing focus on unlocking value within our portfolio through select developments and intensive asset management and potential acquisitions means we are well placed to continue delivering stable returns to unitholders in the year ahead.\n\nJohn Keung\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nBuilding and Construction Authority\n\nSINGAPORE'S built environment sector has always been a backbone of the economy, contributing to a strong infrastructure that is key in making Singapore a distinctive global city. The sector will be kept continually busy with the construction of homes, roads and MRT lines, hospitals, and so on, to meet public demand for many more years to come. Spending on construction in 2014 will remain strong, ranging between $22-$30 billion.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we will need to tackle two main challenges - improving construction productivity and future-proofing our built environment to make existing buildings green and user-friendly. We have been working closely with the industry to help them improve productivity through the adoption of labour-saving construction methods and technologies, and will be refining our schemes in the year ahead to help smaller firms embark on their productivity journeys.\n\nThere's also a need to look at future-proofing our built environment, to mitigate the potential risks presented by climate change and tackle the challenges posed by an ageing population. To this end, BCA will be ramping up engagement efforts with industry firms to improve the designs and work processes for the construction of new buildings and improvement to existing buildings to make them more energy efficient and user-friendly for all.\n\nPeter Hill\n\nManaging Director\n\nSimCorp Asia\n\nMUCH has been said about the growth of Asia and its booming economy, particularly in the development of Asia as a financial services hub. This presents numerous opportunities for businesses related to financial services.\n\nA key priority for financial institutions in the year ahead will be dealing with new and revised regulatory and compliance requirements, especially if they are still operating on legacy systems that were not built to accommodate these changes. SimCorp is poised to enable and equip investment managers with the technology and state-of-the-art systems needed to tackle these obstacles.\n\nLarge financial institutions that have been on old legacy systems for a long time may, understandably, be reluctant to go through what they deem a difficult process of overhauling their current IT infrastructures.\n\nSimCorp's advantage therefore lies in its ability to aid firms, regardless of size, with a simple and seamless solution that takes into account the most important aspects of an investment manager's job - being able to access critical information in real time. As regulatory reforms sweep across the US and Europe, and now Asia, it will be imperative for financial institutions to look at investing in new systems to cope with the latest market developments to stay in the game.\n\nAmmar Hindi\n\nManaging Director for Asia-Pacific\n\nSourcefire, now a part of Cisco\n\nWHILE we cannot predict what the future will hold in 2014, we believe our biggest challenge will continue to be an adversary of our customers - advanced malware and targeted attacks. Businesses increasingly rely on new technologies to enhance productivity, save costs and speed deployment. These new innovations can create the potential for new threats and attack vectors. This represents a daunting challenge for companies and those responsible for defending the infrastructure. It is why security is now a boardroom discussion.\n\nRecent official announcements of a $130 million plan to support cybersecurity research may drive additional security investment, invigorate the industry and create a tighter talent pool.\n\nSome of the security technologies that will continue to shape the IT landscape include those that offer greater visibility to make informed decisions and control to accelerate threat detection and response. Many security solutions in place today are no longer sufficient to combat the rapidly evolving threats. Given the new levels of sophisticated attacks, it is clear that the foundation of any security solution requires a threat-centric approach that addresses the threat - before, during and after an attack.\n\nClement Goh\n\nManaging Director\n\nEquinix South Asia\n\nIN 2014, we expect to see the continued rise of Singapore as a key technology hub for South-east Asia and the wider Asia-Pacific region, with new digital content and cloud providers looking to move their operations here. We are seeing a shift in the approach by many organisations as we enter this new era of the digital industrial economy.\n\nAs local companies across Asia increasingly look to expand in multiple markets, the demand for a central hub from where they can easily access other markets will also increase. With Singapore's robust technology infrastructure and its high demand for connectivity, the industry will inevitably experience a strong demand for data centres and with it a demand for a skilled workforce.\n\nDue to the specialised nature of the job of data centre operators, the shortage of skilled talent is likely to be one of our key challenges moving into 2014. To overcome this, Equinix relies significantly on our global presence of close to 100 data centres for cross border knowledge transfers, to enable global collaboration and the sharing of valuable skills and expertise across markets.\n\nJoe Poon\n\nPresident\n\nXchanging, South-east Asia\n\nSINGAPORE is rapidly gaining international recognition for its status as a business hub, and is enroute to establishing a particularly strong footing in the global market for financial services, real estate and commodities trading.\n\nSupported by strong governance and regulatory measures, advanced infrastructural facilities and an open economy, Singapore is right in the heart of global business activity and has been on the receiving end of a rising inflow of foreign investments. This bodes well for the local business climate, yet also raises the organisational challenge of finding and honing the right talent to support further advancements in these key areas of growth.\n\nPeople are key to organisational success, and it is essential for organisations to invest in recruiting, training and maintaining talent so as to remain competitive in such dynamic times. Similarly, Xchanging faces the challenge of seeking the right talent in support of greater growth. As such, Xchanging continually invests significant time and effort in seeking the best, training them to their utmost potential, and providing opportunities for employees to flourish and grow along with the industry.\n\nRaed S Haddad\n\nManaging Director, Asia-Pacific\n\nESI International\n\nWE are hopeful that the global economy will strengthen its recovery in 2014 to produce an overall positive impact on business momentum in the region. At home, business sentiment continues to be bullish and moderate growth can be expected as we see organisations investing more in employee training with aims to raise productivity and competitiveness for the long haul.\n\nTalent shortages can threaten an organisation's ability to compete. The long-term solution to addressing the talent crunch issue and creating a sustainable workforce requires employers across all sectors to develop a strong culture of talent development by re-examining the ways existing employees are engaged and motivated. With adequate training, new sources of talent, such as the silver generation, can also be tapped to sharpen competitive advantage and improve business performance.\n\nJessie Quek\n\nCountry General Manager\n\nLenovo Singapore\n\nIN line with official forecasts, we expect the Singapore economy to continue to expand steadily in 2014 and are optimistic about our prospects. Even though we are already the world's No 1 PC maker, our biggest challenge in the coming year - one which we are geared up for - would be to grow our market share in the \"PC Plus\" space which consists of tablets and smartphones as well. We will do this through product innovation.\n\nIn 2013, we launched products in various form factors and created new product categories like the Lenovo Horizon table PC, as well as multi-mode laptops and tablets. There's more to come in 2014, as we continue to prioritise product innovation. Our products will help Lenovo stay relevant in a fast-changing marketplace and industry as we address the varying needs of consumers and match their evolving lifestyles.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nTHE business climate will most likely remain the same with no major surprises. Under this premise, the top challenge will still be high business costs. We are always doing our best to manage this problem; one way is to increase the productivity of staff, which is in line with the government's advice. In fact, my company has often sent staff for training and implemented attractive incentives. Of course, these costs are carefully budgeted. We always monitor the company's expenditures and seek to achieve maximum returns on our spending.\n\nWhile thriftiness is necessary, the most effective way to meet the challenge, in the long run, is to increase our income by expanding overseas. This is especially the case since the market in Singapore is too saturated with increasing competition. With these measures in place, there should be no surprises next year.\n\nArvind Agarwalla\n\nCEO\n\nFACT Software International Pte Ltd\n\nWITH economic recovery gathering momentum in the United States and the eurozone, I am confident that Singapore's economy will maintain an upward traction. Despite slowing growth in China and India, we have bright spots in countries such as Myanmar, Vietnam and Mongolia.\n\nSimilar to many other SMEs in Singapore, the key challenge facing FACT is how to attract and retain the right talent to drive business growth, especially in the face of tightening foreign talent regulations.\n\nFACT Software offers a highly competitive and aggressive remuneration to counter seemingly attractive salaries and perks often associated with large organisations. In the software industry, it is vital that employees are provided regular training and up-skilling opportunities to stay ahead of the game. Besides this we encourage the team members to choose their path and pace of growth within the company with new challenges and additional responsibilities.\n\nAs an SME that helps companies improve their productivity through technology adoption, we are constantly looking at ways to boost our own productivity, such as equipping our staff with the best IT hardware and software available to ensure improved efficiency in our workplace.\n\nTom Zack\n\nPresident South-east Asia\n\nEMC\n\nTHE initial outlook indicates a positive 2014 for businesses in Singapore and in the region. However, cost pressures remain and customers would be looking at doing more with less, which sets up a platform for adoption of next-gen technology. We also expect customers to relook their business model. At EMC, we see this as an indication of the ability to do better in the areas of productivity, mobility and better resource management.\n\nOver the years, EMC has made it a priority to move from strength to strength enabling our customers and partners to benefit from the investments in innovations that accelerate the journey to the cloud alongside helping organisations store, manage, protect & analyse information in a more agile, trusted and cost-efficient way.\n\nWe see IT Transformation, Big Data and Security as the stumbling blocks as well as the biggest opportunities. These will continue to be our top priorities in 2014 as we work towards empowering employees with technology that enables mobility, productivity and a better work-life balance in a collaborative and safe environment.\n\nWe also see ourselves leveraging the benefits of big data analytics through economic insights that can help our customers and partners grow. Innovation continues to remain a core of our strategic focus in 2014, and EMC will continue investing heavily in R&D as part of our global growth strategy.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head, Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nWITH the slow but gradual recovery of the United States economy and continued growth in China and India, I believe the business climate in Singapore will be largely positive in the year ahead. Companies will be looking to expand operations and grow service offerings. In a tight labour market, this means some challenges on the hiring front, especially for companies in niche sectors, where demand for talent often outstrips supply.\n\nOur company, Fircroft, a UK-based leading provider of engineering professionals for some of the world's largest technical industries, opened our Asia-Pacific office in Singapore last month. With energy demands in Asia increasing, companies in the energy and resources sectors in the region are stepping up their recruitment of specialists who have the requisite skills. In trying to fill the gap for these companies, our key challenge is identifying talented candidates and offering them incentives to encourage them to join the companies. A bigger challenge is to encourage young talent to remain working in the industry. To do this, companies will need to innovate and implement processes that will improve their talent retention.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group\n\nI BELIEVE the economy will grow modestly in the next year. Europe and the US will be slow off the blocks and is likely to cause the Asian economies to putter along in the low single-digit climb. Top challenges in 2014 will include human resource acquisition and recovery of the Western economies.\n\nHuman capital in Singapore is still one of the most pressing concerns of business leaders. Talent search will continue to be extremely challenging. Optimal deployment of staff, utilisation of talent and retention requires concerted strategy. The labour market is expected to remain tight and companies will be forced to accelerate outsourcing activities and keep only key functions inhouse.\n\nIn order to combat this situation, Ademco is exploring using non-traditional search methods, including social media platforms. We are also taking advantage of the increased desire of companies to outsource and absorb clients' spare headcount. The European Union and the US does not show promise of surprising us with a strong turnaround. Inevitably, Asian economies will feel the currents. Foreign direct investment in these regions seems likely to remain lukewarm.\n\nAs a significant percentage of Ademco's business is derived from American and European clients, this is certainly likely to affect us. Hence, over the course of the last two to three quarters, we have been retweaking our client mix not just in Singapore but in all regional offices.\n\nGeorge Chang\n\nVP, South-east Asia & Hong Kong\n\nFortinet\n\nWE are cautiously optimistic about the business climate in 2014. While uncertainty exists in the macro economy, our industry - IT security - is projected to grow rapidly, as organisations fight increasingly sophisticated threats and incorporate IT security into their overall risk management strategy. Enterprises have no choice but to invest in IT security to protect themselves and their customers if they want to keep and grow their business.\n\nIn our industry and others, opportunities in Singapore still exist. Business leaders just need to look harder and respond better to customer needs. Fortinet, for example, surveyed the market recently and found opportunities in application security, as the Web becomes an increasingly important conduit for companies to do business. We will be focusing on this area in the new year.\n\nMore generally, firms should leverage technology to reduce their reliance on manpower. In cases where it does not make financial sense to own the technologies inhouse, they should consider managed services providers. Lastly, Singapore firms should explore developing markets in the region, such as Indo-China, to diversify risk and take advantage of opportunities there.\n\nGurpreet Dhillon\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nReligare Health Trust\n\nWE are upbeat about the outlook for Religare Health Trust, as well as the wider healthcare sector in which we operate. There have been recent challenges in our current operating environment in India with regard to its macro economy and currency movements. Further, money supply and interest rate tightening is also likely to have an impact on the Singaporean Trusts space.\n\nHowever, our business model is based on solid fundamentals and an industry that continues to grow despite ongoing volatility in the economy. Foreign exchange risk remains a concern for our investors, but we mitigate this risk through a firm policy of foreign currency hedging. This policy has helped us to ensure we meet our projections and deliver on our promises to unitholders. We are excited about 2014 as we continue benefit from the next stage of growth within the healthcare sector.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman\n\nHTwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nIN my view, the local business climate will be steady in the next 12 months. Though industry competition is a real challenge, competitors in the same field will have to be creative in ensuring their services have an edge over others. Hiring and retaining staff is a challenge in the current tight labour market. Some benefits like adopting family-friendly policies within the company have proven to be an effective and productive approach. Employment of skilled foreign talent is another option to address the manpower crunch but this is limited due to regulatory constraints.\n\nAs part of our business expansion strategy, we will tap on the growing economies of our neighbouring countries and in China to set up outlets there while maintaining a steady business activity locally. We will continue with our efforts to ensure professionalism and good standards of service provision through ongoing staff training, research and development and upgrading programmes and tapping on various schemes to enhance productivity and innovation within the organisation.\n\nLam Kok Wah\n\nRegional Sales Director, Asia\n\nVeeam Software\n\nVEEAM has seen tremendous expansion in the virtualisation market, particularly in Singapore and the Asia-Pacific region. With a reputation as a thriving hub for business activities to live up to, Singapore cannot afford to miss a beat. Despite advances in infrastructure robustness, many businesses still face database, hardware and software downtime. As a result, businesses suffer a grave loss in revenue and need to double the hard work in getting back on track.\n\nAs companies look to move businesses into the cloud, protecting the privacy of information, fast and effective backup and recovery of data to reduce downtime will be of paramount importance. Developing innovative technologies and constantly improving solutions that are easy to use and hassle-free to upgrade are some of Veeam's core strengths. Providing multi-tiered data protection capabilities to address the evolving virtualisation market will be a cornerstone of Veeam's business and continued success.\n\nTerry Smagh\n\nVice-President South East North Asia\n\nQlikView\n\nOUR main objective in 2014 will be to sustain the growth momentum which we achieved in 2013. Part of ensuring that success is to continue to hire bright analytics specialists who will help drive the company forward.\n\nWhile we are excited at the prospect of a steady economy in 2014 and continue to ride on the exponential growth of the Big Data industry, we are cautious of the manpower crunch. The current growth is not supported with enough professionals and the manpower crunch will not just be a problem that affects us but many other companies that also rely on interpreting chunks of data to formulate business decisions.\n\nTo make sure we stay ahead of the pack, we launched the QlikView Academic Programme in July 2012. The programme aims to allow institutions to use QlikView in their curriculum and hopefully creating new opportunities that use analytics to help tackle complex business and societal challenges. This was our way of giving back to the industry and to ensure a steady pool of professionals entering the industry to help ease the manpower crunch. Beyond that, we look forward to another spectacular year in 2014.\n\nAng Swee Meng, Allen\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAldon Technologies Services Pte Ltd\n\nTHE current positive performance of electronic manufacturing should cascade into 2014 and the momentum of the external trade performance will be sustained to Q1 2014. Beyond that, our prospects for 2014 will depend largely on the sustainability of recovery in the US and EU and the successful soft landing of the Chinese economy.\n\nDomestically, the challenges are enormous. The labour crunch, rising pressure on wages and rents will bite deeply. We have been making adjustments to our human resource, operations practices and productivity improvement. The process had been painful; however we have no option but to continue the effort into next year.\n\nWe expect the semiconductor industry to perform at a similar pace as 2013, driven mainly by increased demand for tablets and mobile smart devices. In addition, our improvement projects may kick off next year. As such we are cautiously optimistic that our business volume will be at least similar or slightly better than this year.\n\nCharlie Foo\n\nAPAC Vice-President\n\nBrocade\n\nIT spending across Asia-Pacific will remain strong in 2014 as enterprises and the public sector look set to transform their businesses and critical infrastructure developments for the digital economy. We are bullish that technology will continue to serve as a critical business driver into the new year to create a strong competitive edge for enterprises in areas of new customer acquisition, cost optimisation and financial performance.\n\nTalent shortage is an ongoing challenge for the IT industry. At Brocade, we take pride in investing and constantly empowering our employees with new technical and business skills. Innovation is also our hallmark whereby employees are encouraged and rewarded to contribute fresh ideas to make a difference.\n\nWong Heng Chew\n\nPresident\n\nFujitsu Singapore\n\nRECENT analyst reports have forecast growth in IT spending among Asia-Pacific businesses, especially cloud computing, where growth rates are expected to outpace IT spending growth. Within this opportunity, lies the challenge of increased competition which requires finesse in maintaining a competitive edge and ensuring continued evolvement with customers.\n\nBased on customers' feedback, Fujitsu learnt that CIOs prioritise faster innovation, better governance and control as key factors when implementing a new IT solution in their organisations. Fujitsu addresses these priorities and delivers based on three key philosophies - Collaboration, Innovation and Localisation.\n\nClose collaboration with customers enables Fujitsu to understand problems from the customers' perspective and facilitate the development of innovative solutions that meet business objectives. Our global network and standard portfolio of solutions means organisations can benefit from the economies of scale regardless of their size or region. Leveraging our intimacy with local market conditions and needs, we are equipped to understand, innovate and deliver customised solutions.\n\nHerbert Vongpusanachai\n\nManaging Director\n\nDHL Express (Singapore)\n\nECONOMISTS predict that global economic growth is likely to pick up towards the end of 2013 and into 2014, driven by industrial countries. In line with these forecasts, we believe the outlook for the logistics sector remains stable in 2014.\n\nThe logistics industry will remain competitive. In order to maintain our leadership position, DHL will continue to innovate and enhance our strengths in networks coverage, service quality and product offerings. In 2013, for example, we started to offer the complete range of DHL Medical Express services in Singapore to address the need among life sciences companies for reliable transportation of sensitive goods and to strengthen our leadership position in setting the highest industry standards.\n\nIn 2014, we will continue to invest in our people, operations and technology. The training and development of employees, as well as improvement of our systems and expansion of our global footprint, are important pillars for our success.\n\nDeepak Mathur\n\nSenior Vice-President, Commercial\n\nSES Asia-Pacific and the Middle East\n\nTHE announcement earlier this year that Singapore would begin to strengthen its capabilities in satellite technology and manufacturing was extremely interesting for us. We believe that the development of a complete ecosystem - which includes service companies, satellite operators such as ourselves, satellite insurance and finance - is a vital step in the development of a comprehensive space policy framework, and could pay significant long-term dividends for Singapore.\n\nWhile we do not operate in the manufacturing segment but focus on designing and operating our global fleet of 54 geostationary satellites, we believe that Singapore's leadership in this area will benefit the region.\n\nOur biggest challenge next year will be to keep pace with the demand for satellite capacity in Asia. Along with other emerging markets such as Latin America and Africa, we expect Asia to continue to experience strong growth next year.\n\nThis will be driven by the increasing affluence of young, urban populations in emerging economies such as Vietnam and Myanmar, coupled with the continued demand for access to quality programming enabled by satellite television in mature markets such as India and Indonesia.\n\nMaritime and aeronautical satellite communication applications will also be a focus, as airlines and ship operators begin to leverage the growing desire to stay connected.\n\nStevan Hoyle\n\nPresident for Asia and Africa\n\nVodafone Global Enterprise (VGE)\n\nTHIS has been an exciting year in the development of our enterprise business globally. Asia and Africa continue to be key growth markets as the region develops and more global MNCs, our target customers, continue to invest in these markets, given the expanding opportunities.\n\nOur key challenge in the region is to transform our business from a primarily mobile-focused one towards one that is able to offer our customers an integrated communications service ranging from mobile and fixed connectivity to cloud-based services and M2M solutions. Our customers need to identify and adopt innovative ways to meet constantly changing market demands, and Vodafone can help by addressing their strategic priorities while transforming their business and differentiating them in the market.\n\nJoshua Yim\n\nCEO\n\nAchieve Group\n\nTAKING a macro view of major economic trends, it is quite certain that the United States Federal Government's Quantitative Easing (QE) programme will end by next year, following the postponement of the decision to taper it.\n\nWith regards to China, the world's second largest economy, I believe that China will successfully avert a hard landing under the leadership of Xi Jinping, and forge ahead with growth of 7 per cent and above. This will spell good news for the rest of Asia.\n\nBased on the various economic indicators, Japan seems to be progressing well with its Abenomics programme, and the countries in the European Union are also showing improved numbers. The only countries to watch now are Spain, Italy and Greece.\n\nWith the major economies on the right track for recovery, the global prospects appear much brighter.\n\nHowever, the question that people are most concerned with is when the bubble will burst, and how the global ecosystem will be affected, once the US federal government decides to stop printing money. But in the short-term, I believe 2014 will be a brighter year compared with 2013.\n\nAs for Singapore, we are a very open economy that is susceptible to the economic waves of the major markets. That said, the outlook is good, with the unemployment rate hovering at around 2 per cent. Being in the recruitment business, this signals good business prospects for us, as we provide professional talent acquisition services to help other companies grow. There will be opportunities for growth for us, as companies expanding in the Asia-Pacific region will need our services.\n\nThe top challenge that most companies will face is in the area of human resources. The expected economic growth, coupled with the tightened employment laws, will prompt businesses to expand their workforce but it will be harder to find local and permanent resident talent.\n\nOur business is in hiring the right people for our clients so I foresee that my top challenge will be to find the right talent for our customers. The Achieve Group holds a very prominent position in human resource circles as we have been in the market for so many years. I believe our strong branding and strong database of candidates will enable us to help our customers find the right people. We intend to pump more resources into marketing next year, to build a bigger presence within the employment market and capture more candidates to meet our customers' needs.\n\nPascal Lambert\n\nChief Country Officer, Singapore and Head of South-east Asia\n\nSociete Generale CIB\n\nFOR Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking, we are optimistic of our business performance in Asia, particularly for South-east Asia, in the coming year. Our group's financial strength is strong but we continue to adopt a cautious investment mode, taking into consideration important factors such as regulatory and compliance risks. While we are confident of the business outlook, we remain conscious of the fragility of the global economy and the rate of its recovery, in particular, the impact of a possible Fed tapering on some of the markets in Asia.\n\nWe expect volatile market conditions, with risks of further depreciation of certain emerging markets currencies and challenges on the credit markets. Important political milestones in some of the countries in the region next year do add to this uncertainty.\n\nFinally, global structural reforms such as the Dodd-Frank Act and European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) are transforming how businesses operate.\n\nApart from the macro aspect, we have to factor in challenges that are present at a local level, such as Singapore's population dilemma, immigration policy, increasing cost of living, all of which will affect international firms like ours. However, Singapore remains one of the top financial centres in the world and one of the best countries to run a business.\n\nSociete Generale is a strong global franchise with leading expertise in a number of core areas including commodity trade finance, project finance, investment products and corporate derivatives. In the coming year, we expect to continue growing our business and increasing our market share, by focusing on retaining key talents, being innovative and developing more new products to meet the different needs of our diverse client base.\n\nDavid Low\n\nCEO\n\nFuturistic Store Fixtures Pte Ltd\n\nTHE three major continents collectively show positive directives - the US demonstrating healthy growth momentum, Europe inching out of the doldrums and China with her promising new leadership reflected in recent higher PMI. General sentiments are reasonably bullish. Global movements have a direct impact on Futuristic Store Fixtures as we work closely with international retail industries with global deliveries.\n\nWe are expecting slow but steady growth in the next 12 months, with the global outlook faring better post-crisis. The retail store fixtures trade is a specialised industry with a limited ready pool of talent. Coupled with increasingly more players in the market, creating stiffer competition, the labour shortage becomes intensified. And the aggression in securing businesses is evident in cut-throat price cutting measures which are not sustainable in the long run.\n\nWe continue to innovate our business operations and solutions to enhance our competitive edge. Flexibility and value integration are key to customising packages that demonstrate our core competencies to complement the retailing environment, and stay ahead of the competition. We ensure constant reviews of recruitment and retention policies to reinforce our talent strengths and keep turnover to a minimum. Good HR practices are critical in our industry.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nWITH the recovery of the US and European economies gaining strength, Singapore and Asia should have a slightly more bullish economy as compared to 2013. The unemployment in Singapore will still probably be low. Hence, talent management and retention remain the No 1 challenge for my company.\n\nIn order to retain our good employees, continual engagement and development for them is very important. I will provide more resources in training and improving the productivity of the organisation. Therefore, I strive to build a platform that provides equal opportunities to high performing staff to achieve their career goals. In a service industry like ours, manpower costs constitute a high percentage of the total expenses. With a tight labour market in Singapore, manpower costs have certainly shot up over the last three years. Managing the spending to protect the bottom line becomes key for us. I plan to do this by creatively packaging the total remuneration of employees in line with individual and company performance.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPLAN-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nI WAS one of four participants in the American Express Business Momentum Media Roundtable, organised by American Express in conjunction with the announcement of the poll results. I agree with the generally cautiously optimistic outlook of the CFOs. Their optimism in the current lacklustre global economic environment is a positive sign, as generally CFOs are conservative.\n\nHong Kong CFOs were generally more upbeat than their Singapore counterparts. This is primarily because of China as their hinterland. Indonesia can be Singapore's hinterland but more will have to be done to exploit this in the year ahead and beyond. However, this will depend to a large extent on government-to-government cooperation and relations.\n\nThe CFOs' top concerns of industry competition, currency volatility, labour costs, as well as the need to improve or develop new products and services are valid. It is not unexpected that currency volatility was cited, given that it was a poll of CFOs. I think Singapore companies will have to be more strategic in managing their businesses. As there will always be industry competition, cost challenges and the need to introduce new products and services, businesses should not just do more of the same. Companies should subscribe to the philosophy of not allowing themselves to be shackled by the past and the present, but to believe that everything is possible for the future, so as to survive in both good and not so good times.\n\nThirumalai Chandroo\n\nChairman/CEO\n\nModern Montessori International Group\n\nWE are optimistic about business prospects for 2014. Singapore is often considered as a gateway to successful business ventures and developments. We use this to our advantage to sustain, expand and grow our business. The education sector is constantly evolving in Singapore; this creates inroads for healthy competition.\n\nA top challenge faced by all stakeholders in the pre-school sector - educators, providers, and policy-makers - is how can we attract a quality workforce of early childhood educators. And how we can create sustainable change within the sector for the benefit of teachers and early childhood providers, given new ideations in our economy. With each brand new year the plausible solution seems to be to review, re-group and re-focus our efforts to meet the changing dynamics of the economy and the needs of our consumers.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nLABOUR is a scarce resource in Singapore and one which we have to manage with certain sensitivities. With fewer labour inputs partly due to official control of supply, growth is expected to be mild and tepid at best. The business climate will remain only optimistically cautious. The exuberant party is over. The prior years of quantitative easing of labour supply is over.\n\nOur demographic profiles with an ageing trend will not support growth and our vibrancy. Singapore will not have any demographic dividends on our own merits - without import of talents and labour. The government is slowing the growth of foreigners while advocating productive use of human resources, indigenous or foreign. Apart from this challenge, the manpower ministry is also adding pressure by making sure Singaporean workers benefit from its recommended Fair Employment Practices. These compliances add to the woes of employers.\n\nEmployers must learn to cope with less manpower and to manage that factor of production for the short to medium term as the government is unlikely to make any policy U-turn. Personally, I think this is our growing up pains and employers have to learn to produce more with less.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\nJobsDB Singapore & Malaysia\n\nThe optimistic economic outlook for Singapore and the wider region tallies with jobsDB's own survey findings that more companies will be hiring in the final quarter of 2013, and into 2014. With this optimistic outlook, the market will be candidate-short - unemployment rates in Singapore sit at a low 1.8% and the Ministry of Manpower is becoming stricter in issuing foreign work passes. At jobsDB, improving job matching and therefore delivering relevant candidates to employers, and relevant opportunities to job seekers, is our top priority. In the coming year, we will introduce innovations around the changing habits of the job seeker, improving our ability to match the right jobs to the right candidates. A focus on mobile platforms is crucial, as is engaging the jobseeker at every stage of the job-seeking journey. We are also focused on reducing the time - and therefore cost - required to attract the right candidates via our employer branding offering.\n\nSaw Ken Wye\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nCrimsonLogic Pte Ltd\n\nWe are optimistic about 2014. Our early investment in markets such as Africa, Middle East and Latin America is paying off and we expect our overseas revenue to exceed local revenues by next year. The portfolio of local and overseas business helps mitigate short-term risks and uncertainties. Against the backdrop of continuously intense global competition, winning people is the key success factor to winning customers. The biggest challenge would be the need to attract and retain talent and be employer of choice in this tight labour market. We will need to create a carefully-crafted people strategy that nurtures and inspires people, a culture that enriches and resonates with people, and a leadership team that cares about and values people.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Closed on Sun\n\nSOMETHING old, something new. That seems to be the premise of Truffle Gourmet - a new Italian eatery that still bears a strong resemblance to its previous incarnation as Spanish tapas bar La Cicala, from its high tables right down to its Japanese chef.\n\nWhile a new identity is understandable, naming itself after the most expensive mushroom in the world could pose more challenges than it needs in this difficult market. First, Truffle Gourmet sounds more like a fancy deli than a full-service restaurant. Yes, it's got an interesting display counter full of truffle-related products but don't forget that the people who patronise Club Street are, well, clubbers, not the let's-go-home-for-a-nice-homemade-truffle-pasta sort. You want that crowd - go to PasarBella.\n\nSecond, the name puts unnecessary restrictions on the menu. Are diners all that flush with cash to eat truffles every day, when it's really best enjoyed as a seasonal delicacy? And if you don't want to charge truffle prices, how do you keep them down?\n\nSuffice it to say that Truffle Gourmet makes a valiant attempt, but it's given itself too little room to manoeuvre. To its credit, it's a pleasant enough joint, with warm woods and an open kitchen where pastas are tossed on the stove while freshly made focaccia dough is popped into the oven. There's also an attempt to keep prices realistic, with $28 set lunches and a la carte items hovering in the $20 to $50 range.\n\nWhether such a strategy will work remains to be seen. Right now, the set lunch is a mixed bag that includes a decent creamy pea soup served in a tiny hollow moulded into a large plate, followed by a so-so mixed antipasto platter in which a little scoop of chicken liver mousse outshines its lacklustre companions of frittata, caponata and cold rice salad.\n\nIts house special pasta carbonara is decent - slippery-smooth homemade noodles tossed in the requisite egg yolk and bacon dressing. Some attempt is made to gussy up the dessert of Italian chocolate cake and custardy tart on a carpet of torched meringue but the sweets make little impression.\n\nStill, we enjoy the grilled iberico pork chop ($56) - juicy meat with nicely charred edges and a Marsala-laced sauce, sitting on top of potatoes and showered with truffle crumbs rather than actual shavings.\n\nThe seafood pasta ($32), meanwhile, manages to capture some of the briny goodness of scallop, clams and bottarga granules, topped with truffle caviar - not the sturgeon variety but rather lookalike black pearls flavoured with truffle. But the highly recommended Uovo Fritto ($30) doesn't light our fire with its bland, lightly crumbed soft-cooked egg sitting in a creamy sauce sprinkled again with truffle dust.\n\nSome fine-tuning of concept may well do Truffle Gourmet some good, and the first course of action could be to offer the chef a free platform rather than creating arbitrary barriers around him. There's some potential here, but like the fungus in question, it's going to need some digging to find it.\n\nRating:\n\n6.5\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

VMware provides cloud and virtualisation software and services and is a subsidiary of EMC Corporation.\n\nQuoting IDC statistics, VMware's Asean vice-president and general manager, Jon Robertson, said that a massive 82 per cent of x86 servers here have not yet been virtualised. \"We still have a lot of work to do,\" he said.\n\nIn contrast, 80 per cent of Australia's servers are virtualised, he said, adding that this was, however, quite an anomaly, with the global average falling below the 50 per cent mark.\n\nGartner's trackings also tally with these figures: in late-2012, the tech analyst firm said the proportion of virtualised servers worldwide was 14.3 per cent, and forecast this would reach 21.3 per cent in 2016.\n\nPaul Strong, VMware's chief technology officer, said that legacy applications tend to stand in the way of virtualisation.\n\nMany older software suites require their own physical, non-virtual servers, and don't play well with changes in the architecture. \"When you buy an app, you buy into legacy and you have to carry it for many years,\" he said.\n\nBut now, companies are moving business processes over from in-house data centres to third-party clouds, courted by the cost savings of offloading the maintenance to a provider. This is helping enterprises to shed their reliance on their legacy apps, he said.\n\nCompanies are also pushing to the cloud because of additional complexity brought on by mobile devices, which require more flexibility on the back end to cater to different access methods such as the Web, or an app or mobile browser.\n\n\"This idea of self-service, instantly provisioned resources that IT departments can buy on the Web - we've never had that before,\" said Mr Strong.\n\nFred Giron, principal analyst with Forrester Research, said that Singapore has the Asia-Pacific's second-highest rate of cloud adoption, at 51 per cent. Australia was top in the region, at 54 per cent, and Singapore was followed by Taiwan at 44 per cent.\n\nIn emerging markets in Asia, India and Indonesia are tied at 42 per cent cloud adoption, and China stands at 33 per cent, he said.\n\nHong Kong stood out as a mature market with far less warmth for the cloud. Around 51 per cent of its businesses have no plans to adopt the cloud, and only 29 per cent were on cloud services, said Mr Giron, though he could not provide an explanation for this phenomenon.\n\nAccording to the latest VMware-commissioned cloud study, Forrester found that 65 per cent of Asia-Pacific businesses felt that the cloud and on-tap services online would help their businesses compete more effectively. A further 30 per cent even said that the cloud was a top priority for them.\n\nBeyond tapping on third-party clouds, IT managers are also keen to arm their data centres with virtualisation technology so that they can function as cloud service providers to their organisations.\n\nThe idea is for in-house data centres to be able to provide the sort of one-click subscription service that third-party services do, and end-users have become accustomed to.\n\nOn the consumer level, this is seen in examples such as Dropbox, where you can sign up and instantly be assigned storage space with the service.\n\nMr Giron said 62 per cent of businesses surveyed wanted to be able to provide capacity on demand this way, but that the IT managers felt that, in order to make this happen, there needed to be a deeper change in the way the IT environment is architected.\n\nThe study further revealed that only 55 per cent of respondents had the means to manage virtualised workloads in their organisations.\n\nFor many companies with legacy apps, IT departments have to juggle different control points over different workloads and applications.\n\nBeing able to control their different workloads from one point is often considered the holy grail, and Forrester found that just 15 per cent in Asia-Pacific have achieved this level of integration.\n\nMr Strong said that companies should be cautious about ditching their in-house silos for cloud services that will lock them in. He pointed at Amazon's EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) service, which features a number of proprietary technologies, saying: \"By the time you're fully in their cloud, you're also locked into their stack, and into their data centres.\"\n\nIt serves VMware's interests to put down a service like EC2, which would potentially take away customers keen to adopt a hybrid set-up based on VMware's technologies, but other vendors have raised similar arguments against Amazon.\n\nThe OpenStack foundation, which is made up of vendors like VMware, IBM, HP, Rackspace and Red Hat, was established in 2010, with the aim of having a set of open source technologies for clouds.\n\nThere are some overlapping compatibilities between OpenStack and Amazon's platform, but they don't entirely sync up.\n\nStill, Amazon is one of the world's most popular public clouds, and plenty of services run on it. When Amazon's cloud went down in August, popular services like Vine, Instagram, Flipboard and Airbnb went down too.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The seven-year-old fund now has US$2 billion in assets and has returned an average 25.5 per cent per year since launching, investors familiar with the numbers said.\n\nMr Hintze, who earned an MBA from Harvard and was classmates with JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon and hedge fund manager Seth Klarman, says that post-financial crisis regulation, which he calls the \"Great Dislocation\", is creating new opportunities for investors like him because banks are no longer as powerful in some sectors.\n\nThe Volcker rule that is part of the Wall Street reforms, for example, prevents banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments, and Basel III is meant to strengthen bank capital requirements. To comply, banks have been cutting their holdings of corporate bonds since 2008 with US primary dealers now owning only about one fifth of what they held five years ago, Mr Hintze said.\n\nWith banks selling securities rated B and BB, he said there are more buying options for fund managers.\n\nIn the light of CQS's eye-popping returns last year and this year's strong performance, which has topped most credit-oriented funds' roughly 6 per cent gain this year, Mr Hintze and his team are among a small handful of funds that pension fund managers and other institutional investors are eager to meet.\n\nMany of the industry's best-performing funds, including Daniel Loeb's Third Point and Mr Klarman's Baupost Group, are no longer taking new money. In fact, both men have told their investors that they would be sending some money back.\n\nBut CQS's portfolios still have room to grow. Mr Hintze said that for as long as he sees more good investment opportunities, there is room for carefully calibrated inflows. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nCompanies & Markets\n\nNTT DC Reit rises 3% above IPO price in debut as SGX\u2019s largest Reit listing in 10 years\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:21 PM\n\nChina\u2019s rare-earth metal exports spike to highest since 2009\n\nJul 14, 2025 02:13 PM\n\nMalaysia tightens export controls on US-origin AI chips amid tariff talks with Washington\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:43 AM\n\nJane Street deposits US$567 million so it can resume India trading\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:48 PM\n\nBank of Japan is said likely to consider raising inflation forecast\n\nJul 14, 2025 01:27 PM\n\nCenturion confirms accommodation Reit listing with S$1.8 billion portfolio value\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:02 AM\n\nLG Electronics shares jump on report of AI chip gear development\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:27 AM\n\nChina banks stoke controversy with loans to boost pensions\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:09 AM", "images": []}

Offshore marine services company Posh Semco, controlled by Malaysia's richest man Robert Kuok, is also planning a listing in the city-state, sources said previously.\n\nMore than half of Pacific Radiance's fleet of 133 vessels are owned and operated by its affiliates in markets with cabotage rules, such as Indonesia. In Indonesia, laws requiring offshore vessels to be Indonesian-owned have limited supply and have driven up the cost of chartering such vessels.\n\n\"Indonesia is a big opportunity for companies that are able to set up operations with local partners and have the capability to raise the funds to invest in the fleet,\" Pang Yoke Min, executive chairman of Pacific Radiance, told reporters on Thursday.\n\nChartering rates are at least 20 per cent higher in Indonesia than other markets, Mr Pang said.\n\nThe proposed Logindo IPO follows in the footsteps of PT Pelayaran Nasional Bina Buana Raya Tbk (BBR), part of Singapore-listed Marco Polo Marine Ltd. BBR made its debut on the Indonesia Stock Exchange in January.\n\nSingapore-listed ASL Marine Holdings Ltd also said recently that it plans to list its Indonesia affiliate PT Capital Nusantara Indonesia in Jakarta.\n\nThe listing will give Logindo a chance to raise funds to expand rapidly as competitors race to build up capacity in Indonesia.\n\nIn 2008, the Indonesian government introduced cabotage laws that required vessels to be owned by Indonesian companies and fly Indonesian flags. It allowed exemptions three years later to vessels in the oil and gas sector due to a shortage of such vessels.\n\nExemptions for speciality ships commonly used in offshore oil and gas fields, including AHTS (anchor handling tug supply) vessels, PSVs (platform support vessels), and DSVs (diving support vessels), expired at the end of last year. Exemptions for other types of vessels are to be phased out in the next two years.\n\nLogindo, in which Pacific Radiance owns a 49 per cent stake, has a fleet of 58 offshore support vessels. It will join a growing number of listed offshore oilfield service providers in Indonesia, including PT Wintermar Offshore Marine Tbk, whose share price has gone up over 34 per cent so far this year.\n\nPacific Radiance said it expects Logindo to be listed by the end of the year but did not disclose the size of the offering. Sources with knowledge of the plan have said the size of the IPO would be around US$40 million-US$60 million, but they declined to be identified because the details of the proposal are confidential.\n\nOffshore exploration and spending in Indonesia is expected to more than double in the next three years to US$6.3 billion, outpacing the 60 per cent increase globally, according to energy consultancy Douglas-Westwood.

The new port will be able to handle bigger ships than Tilbury and is two-thirds closer to half London than Hutchison Whampoa Ltd's Port of Felixstowe.\n\nThe dock complex is designed to win clients by combining a harbour terminal with an onsite distribution centre, luring wholesalers and retailers away from older sites.\n\nIts berths are big enough to take ships the size of AP Moeller-Maersk's 165,000-tonne Triple-E class, of which five are due this year, with 138 metre-high cranes able to span 25-container wide decks.\n\nThe MOL Caledon, which can carry about 4,500 20-foot boxes, operates as part of the South Africa Europe Container Service or SAECS, run by an alliance of Mitsui OSK Lines Ltd of Japan, Germany's DAL Deutsche Afrika-Linien GmbH and Maersk, the world's top container shipper, together with the Copenhagen-based company's Belgium-based Safmarine Container Lines NV.\n\nSAECS, which serves the South African cities of Durban, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town, switched its UK stop to London Gateway from the rival port of Tilbury, operated by Arcus Infrastructure Partners LLP's Forth Ports Ltd.\n\nThe service goes on to call at Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and Bremerhaven, Germany.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

The aim, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, is to find ways to improve the career and academic progression prospects of graduates, and to better match the strengths and interests of students to a hands-on-type of education.\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the ITE's newly relocated headquarters and the co-located ITE College Central campus in Ang Mo Kio yesterday, Mr Lee said the upcoming review would also look to strengthen the role of the polytechnics and ITE in research, innovation and enterprise. The committee will be led by Senior Minister of State for Education and Law Indranee Rajah and will involve industry leaders, education institution chiefs and various government agencies.\n\nEven as Singapore's ITE and polytechnic system has proven successful over the years, the challenge now is to continue creating opportunities for the younger generation for a \"very different\" future.\n\n\"The economy will be more sophisticated and diversified. Growth will come from productivity improvements and new products and services, some not yet dreamt of or invented,\" Mr Lee told some 1,400 guests that included Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and Education Minister Heng Swee Keat. \"Good jobs will be there, and will require a wide range of skills and expertise. Many existing jobs will be completely transformed by technology, and some jobs will disappear entirely.\"\n\nThus, he said, Singapore would need to make some important shifts to equip the young to seize these opportunities when they arise. There needs to be a greater focus on applied learning, where classroom learning is integrated with real-life applications at work, and where students are encouraged to creatively apply concepts to practical problems. Even after they have entered the workforce, Mr Lee added, they ought to progressively upgrade their skills throughout their careers.\n\nHe also said that while the government was opening more doors for people to earn a diploma, degree or post-graduate degree, they should not succumb to a \"paper chase\". Instead, they should make sure that their qualifications are relevant to the industry as this would improve their job prospects after graduation.\n\nAfter the opening ceremony, Mr Lee went on a guided tour of ITE College Central's facilities, including the interior of an actual-size Boeing 737 aircraft parked on the campus. The $500 million ITE College Central, which started operations in January this year, can accommodate up to 10,400 students. It is ITE's third and final regional campus, after College East in Simei and College West in Choa Chu Kang.\n\nITE director and CEO Bruce Poh said the strong link between education and development in Singapore has kept public investment in education a central priority. \"(This has) made education policies highly pragmatic, and led to the development of a world-class vocational and technical education system, an area in which many countries struggle.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The central bank's US$85 billion in monthly security purchases has bolstered stocks in emerging markets by weakening the dollar and keeping US bond yields low.\n\n\"Some people said that if the government can't get their act together, at least the Fed is going to keep money extremely easy,\" Jeff Papp, a senior analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc, which oversees US$700 million in assets, said in a telephone interview from Lisle, Illinois. Investors believe \"it's almost impossible to quantify how much the Fed has helped emerging-market corporates\", he said.\n\nThe US central bank will delay the first reduction in its bond purchases until March, according to the median estimate of 40 economists surveyed Oct 17-18. The government shutdown furloughed as many as 800,000 federal workers and disrupted publication of economic reports that the Fed relies on to determine whether the expansion is strong enough to handle less monetary stimulus.\n\nInvestors this year are mostly buying structured notes that amplify the returns of the emerging-markets ETF using leverage, Bloomberg data shows. Other securities pay a coupon as long as the fund doesn't fall below a certain threshold.\n\nThe ETF, which holds stock of companies such as the world's largest smartphone maker, Samsung Electronics Co, and Russia's biggest gas producer, Gazprom OAO, climbed 15 per cent through Wednesday to US$42.01 from its 2013 low on June 24.\n\nSales of the ETF-tied notes fell 18 per cent this year to US$383.8 million through October, Bloomberg data shows. Investors bought US$364.6 million of the securities in 14 offerings in October 2011, the biggest sales month in about four years.

By Cheah Ui-Hoon\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSURGERY should be the last resort for those faced with a deteriorating health condition, especially if exercise and other natural methods can help. BT Living looks at how pilates, yoga and therapeutic essential oils can improve some common ailments.\n\nThe condition:\n\nPelvic Organ Prolapse (POP). POP isn't commonly heard of, but it often affects one out of 10 women by the age of 80. Deborah Wong, a general physician who now runs Breathe Pilates which specialises in clinical pilates, notes how it's one of the more common operations conducted at KK Women's and Children's Hospital. POP happens when the muscles and ligaments supporting a woman's pelvic organs weaken. The pelvic organs can then slip out of place. POP can worsen over time, and you may need surgery to fix it. There are different types of POP, but they tend to be triggered off by childbirth or menopause, which causes weakening of tissues.\n\nThe exercise:\n\nThere is a fine equilibrium keeping our pelvic organs in place, a balance between the contraction of our pelvic floor and the increased abdominal pressure from the organs in our abdominal cavity, says Dr Wong. In mild cases, pelvic floor exercises help to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. The fundamentals of pilates lie in developing core strength. \"The pelvic floor muscles, along with the deep muscles of the back and abdomen, form the group of muscles we work when we focus on developing core strength,\" explains Dr Wong.\n\nThe condition:\n\nLow back pain and sciatica from slipped discs. The sciatic nerve is the longest nerve in your body and it runs from the back of your pelvis, through your buttocks, and all the way down both legs, ending at your feet. When something compresses or irritates the sciatic nerve, it can cause a pain that radiates out from your lower back and travels down your leg to your calf. Sciatic pain can range from mild to very painful. A slipped disc is the most common identified cause of sciatica, but in some cases there is no obvious cause. In very rare cases, surgery may be needed to control the symptoms.\n\nThe exercise:\n\nLynn Yeo, who runs Space and Light Yoga, specialises in therapeutic yoga for low back pain and sciatica. \"I have helped many clients heal and maintain a pain-free status,\" says Dr Yeo. \"Yoga can really support the healing of many injuries, if taught properly with functional anatomy knowledge and proper biomechanical alignment.\"\n\nYoga also aids in neck strengthening for cervical spondylosis, rotator cuff injuries of the shoulders, knee ligament damage, hip issues, etc. \"Almost everything can be helped, and probably more specifically one-on-one classes in with therapeutic focus. Then once people know what to do, what is safe, they can join classes. Obviously it's always important how you do it, not only what you do, so the teacher must be skilled, and properly trained as well.\"\n\nThe condition:\n\nArthritic joint pain and Sinusitis. Osteoarthritis involves the breakdown of the cartilage between two joints. Rheumatoid Arthritis is caused by swelling and inflammation of the synovial membrane, the lining of the joint. Sinusitis is inflammation (swelling) of the lining of the sinuses, caused by a viral or bacterial infection.\n\nThe treatment:\n\nTherapeutic-grade essential oils are now even being prescribed to treat cancer, with documented results, says Tan Kai Hiang, who started One Drop to promote Young Living Oils in Singapore. For sinus, she has seen chronic cases which don't show improvement even after surgery. But with the application of therapeutic-grade oils, have been able to have their sinuses cleared. Recommended theraupeutic oils for sinus congestion include Young Living Oil's Breathe Again which is a blend of four Eucalyptus plants and peppermint, Copaiba etc.\n\nCopaiba from Brazil has the most published research on its anti-inflammatory effects. Ms Tan says the oils can be used on the chest, back, cheekbones, side of nose regularly for daily support. As for arthritic pain, the three oils she recommends include Young Living's Deep Relief blend, Copaiba and Frankincense, which is used to treat almost every illness. \"These natural anti-inflammatory essential oils, coupled with cartilage builders (glucosamine/chondroitine) and a change in diet are powerful natural cures for arthritis,\" she explains.\n\nuihoon@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE saying \"out with the old and in with the new\" is not one that applies to the Lee family who believe in the sentimental value of all their personal possessions. Over the years, Lawrence and Melanie Lee have amassed a huge collection of well-loved knick knacks that take pride of place in their Yio Chu Kang home. The couple's bedroom, for one, is filled with everything from wedding and family photos to four pieces of cross-stitch which Mrs Lee did back in the 1990s.\n\nIn their daughter Leshane's room is a framed pair of children's slippers. \"It was her first pair of slippers when she was 18 months old. I kept it because I was surprised that she could grip them at such a young age,\" says Mrs Lee, who reveals that she also keeps her children's crafts and uniforms over the years. Leshane is now 11, while her son, Leshon is 17.\n\nOver on a console in the dining room is a toy tanker, which has seen better days. \"That was from my husband's childhood days,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\nHer collection of Garfield figurines, also from her childhood, are also on display, never mind that she hasn't played with them in years, and her two kids have no interest in them either.\n\nClearly the Lees, who have known each other since 1987, are a sentimental couple. They still have their love letters, which Leshon once brought out to read to his friends, but that no longer happens. \"Since then, I've kept the letters under lock and key,\" quips a blushing Mrs Lee.\n\n\"We treasure old things more. Often, it is the newer stuff that we throw out.\"\n\nThe collecting bug has bitten everyone in the family. For the record, Mrs Lee has a soft spot for cups and mugs, and fine bone china. \"I love coffee and tea, and will buy them when overseas too. I like a variety of them, especially tea, not just for the pretty containers but also for the tea itself. I can fill half a suitcase of them.\"\n\nMr Lee collects cars, both luxury and small scale ones, while Leshon is an avid collector of stamps, old currency notes and coins. Leshane collects soft toys, \"every country we visit, she has to come back with one\", says her mum.\n\nYet, despite the many things that the family has around the home, their semi-detached home has no clutter.\n\nAs the owners of building company Builders Hub, they know exactly all the tricks of home design and storage. They've built many private homes, so when it came to their own, it had to meet an important criteria - \"we want something that is easy to maintain\", says Mrs Lee.\n\nHer husband did most of the design. The layout of their home - the second one they've built themselves - is simple. A lap pool runs along the length of the home, which the children as well as the family's three dogs actively use.\n\nBesides the living and dining areas on the ground floor, there is a guest room for either of the couple's parents to use when they come over. Instead of a concrete wall to separate the dry and wet kitchens, Mr Lee opted for a glass wall, so that he could still have his preferred open-concept kitchen.\n\nAn airwell in the home helps bring in natural light and improves ventilation. Besides an outdoor terrace on the second floor, there is also a roof terrace, which the family uses as a dining space on special occasions. \"We celebrated the Mid Autumn Festival up on the roof,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\nThe bedrooms are all on the second floor, and what makes them unusual are the automatic doors. Mr Lee had them installed for convenience.\n\nThe couple's spacious bedroom comes with its own sitting area, which incidentally is the family's favourite spot. \"Sometimes we even have dinner here, and this is the only place where we can watch cable TV,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\nNature lover Leshon is a volunteer with the National Parks Board, and even has two bird nests hanging in his bedroom to prove it. He loves taking photographs of birds, and some of his photos are on display around the home.\n\nHis parents are very supportive of his hobby, buying a professional camera for him, and even going on bird photography trips. \"We are going to Bhutan, so Leshon can photograph birds. He has planned the entire trip,\" says his proud mum.\n\nSister Leshane is into art, as seen from her artworks which hang in her bedroom.\n\nWith his years of experience as a builder, Mr Lee says building this home is no different from building a client's. \"The only difference would be the time taken to plan and design is quicker, since I am both the client and builder,\" says Mr Lee.\n\nThe family moved in two months ago, and have no plans to move out yet. But if they do, it is no surprise which items they will pack first. \"Definitely all our old stuff. We always take them with us,\" says Mrs Lee.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By David Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nFOR baby boomers, a visit to Penang is like finding the home we left years ago. While modernisation and gentrification has altered the townscape quite a lot, certain pockets of Penang still transport the visitor back powerfully to the Singapore of the '60s and '70s. Sights, smells, sounds, and especially tastes, still evoke what can only be described by the clich\u00e9, \"the good ole days\".\n\nThe younger visitor, meanwhile, will find a town on the upswing, thanks to its new status as a Unesco (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage site. Hip hostels and cafes line the historic lanes of Georgetown, and specially commissioned street art adorn weathered walls and peep out from unexpected corners. But the most telling impression both young and older visitors will take away is the stupendous street food which literally carpets Penang.\n\nPenang and Singapore share similar flavours - unsurprising given some of our common origins in Malay, Hokkien, Hainanese and Indian food. However, differences exist, some more obvious than others, because of geographical and historical circumstances. As a case in point, look at Singapore's and Penang's idea of laksa.\n\nThat said, for anyone who has ever lamented the declining standards of Singapore street food, a trip to Penang is an antidote. Dress comfortably for sure; ideally in tees and Bermudas as it's hot, and the best food is invariably found in non-air-conditioned coffee shops, side lanes and outdoor spaces.\n\nMeat porridge and fried kway teow\n\nJalan Kuala Kangsar Street Market\n\nGeorgetown\n\nIt may sound touristy, but to local and visiting foodies alike, the street market at Jalan Kuala Kangsar is not to be missed. The food stalls co-exist with market vendors on both sides of a thronging and narrow lane. Nearly all of Penang's signature dishes are here; but two stalls in particular stand out: the pork porridge, and Penang fried kway teow, located at the entrance to the market street, next to Campbell Street.\n\nForget about decorum: make a choice, shout your orders to the stall-owner, and grab a seat nearby. Your porridge will arrive in about 20 minutes, steaming and delicately smooth in texture. What's unfamiliar - at least to us Singaporeans - is the shredded char siew on top, which, surprisingly, goes very well with the porridge.\n\nThe hawkers use itinerant pushcarts, and adjacent to the porridge stall across the lane stands the Penang fried kway teow. Although not on the usual litany of foodie favourites, this stall unfailingly serves up a heaving plate of cockle-filled kway teow perfumed with intense wok hei.\n\nPenang assam laksa\n\nFarlim Shell Station Laksa Caf\u00e9\n\nMedan Angsana 4, Bandar Baru Air Itam\n\n11500 Penang\n\nTel +6016 459 7179\n\nOnce located on the roadside next to a Shell petrol station in Farlim district, this laksa pushcart attracted droves. Following complaints, it was forced into a nearby coffeeshop, where it is still named after its original \"address\".\n\nUnlike most commercial stalls where canned sardine is used as the stock base, this one uses fresh fish and spices for broth. There's the right balance of sweet and sour coming from the blend of assam peel, shallots, garlic, and lemongrass. What stands out from this spicy thick stock is the Penang prawn paste and ikan kembong. Freshly cooked ikan kembong is deboned and strewn generously over the noodles; and those who want more fish can just ask for it.\n\nAnother must-try is the fried spring roll. Eat it the local style, dipped into the laksa broth - another novelty for a Singaporean.\n\nCurry rice\n\nTong Sun Coffee Shop\n\nJalan Perak, Jelutong\n\nPenang 11600\n\nFamiliar to locals in the Jelutong area, this family-run stall opens every night at 10.30 pm. It is a swift and efficient operation. Early arrivals will find the whole coffee shop looking deserted half an hour before opening. Then suddenly a flurry of activity erupts, and a six-man team sets up the stall and brings out more than 30 trays of freshly cooked food from the back of the shop - all within 30 minutes.\n\nThe food is predominantly Teochew, with a variety of spicy curry dishes to choose from. The taste is home cooked and simple; however every curry dish has its own distinct taste, unlike in Singapore, where it sometimes seems like a \"one-curry-fits-all\" situation exists. The only downside is trying to stop yourself from over-ordering.\n\nFried oyster omelette\n\nGan's Crispy Fried Oysters\n\nLam Ah Coffee Shop\n\n194 Lebuh Chulia\n\nGeorgetown\n\nAmusingly, this rundown coffeeshop was listed in Penang food guides for the beef noodle stall it housed. But it is the fried oyster omelette that is driving the crowds here. The stall-owner, Mr Gan, gained popularity when he operated for more than 10 years from an old coffee shop at New World Park. He moved due to high rents some two years ago.\n\nMr Gan serves two versions of fried oysters: the Thai style which is more dry and crispy, and the more popular starchy and wet style - which is also the version that Singaporeans are more familiar with. Go for the Thai version, as the crispy edges of the omelette will blow you away when dipped in the special chili sauce.\n\nLor bak\n\nKheng Pin Caf\u00e9\n\n80 Penang Road\n\nGeorgetown\n\nNo visit to Penang would be complete without a visit to the lor bak stall at this caf\u00e9. Lou Joo Chon has sold lor bak for more than 40 years. He offers quite a selection but the must-try items are the prawn fritters, tau kwa, and fish roll. Also a must is the five-spice meat roll, simply known as lor bak. Instead of minced pork, Mr Lou seasons strips of pork with a specially concocted five-spice powder and wraps it in bean curd skin.\n\nHe then fries the rolls in a moderate heat that cooks the meat without burning the beancurd skin. Another of his unique offerings is the dipping sauce similar to our lor mee gravy. This is a derivation of the Hokkien-style dipping sauce, where heavy stock is used as the base and potato starch is added as a thickening agent. Incidentally, Penang lor mee shares the same stock with lor bak, except meat bones are added to the lor mee stock.\n\nThe popular Mr Lou makes an appearance at the annual Penang Food Festival in York Hotel. But nothing beats eating at his stall, enveloped in the atmosphere of Penang.\n\nDay to night selections\n\nPasar Bukit Mertajam\n\nJalan Bunga Raya\n\n14000 Bandar Bukit Mertajam\n\nButterworth\n\nA visit to Pasar Bukit Mertajam would remind one of eating on a movie set. Located just outside a 120-year-old Chinese temple, the dining space is a courtyard flanked by temples and stalls serving a variety of food from morning till night.\n\nIn the day, the dishes to aim for are wonton noodles, Mee Jawa, Hokkien mee and rojak. Look out for a unique dish known as \"cup rice\", where rice is steamed individually in an aluminium bowl. Upon order, the rice would be topped with morsels of meat and braising gravy - the deliciously soggy mess perked up with pickled chilli.\n\nAt night, the selection from the zi char stall reminds one of unpretentious home cooked food. The ambience is of Singapore streets in the '60s, where tables and chairs were placed randomly in any available space. The food and \"feel\" of this place has made it one of the more popular spots for friends and visitors to gather.\n\nCurry fish head\n\nSri Siam\n\n32, Medan Kurau 2\n\nChai Leng Park, 13700 Perai\n\nButterworth\n\nA visit to Sri Siam makes the hassle of crossing to Butterworth worthwhile. Sri Siam is a name synonymous with street-style curry dishes in Penang - ask any Penangite and he will direct you to this place instantly. Be prepared to queue and elbow for a table during lunch though, because Sri Siam's curry fish head is famous.\n\nUnlike the Singapore version, the curry fish head here is light as it uses coconut milk. However, the taste of onion and mint come through strongly in the gravy. Apart from the curry fish head, the array of dishes available would satisfy even the most seasoned foodie. It is an eclectic mix of Chinese and Malay-influenced dishes, but stick to the spicy items and you won't go wrong. Sri Siam's food bears the strong influence of nearby Thailand, so the spices used slant towards sourness, and there is a generous use of fresh herbs.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue at its infocomm division, however, fell 9.7 per cent to $28 million.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit was up 26.4 per cent at $19.6 million, mainly because of $7.1 million in negative goodwill from the acquisition of equity interest in an associate.\n\nExcluding the negative goodwill, profit before tax for the nine-month period was $2.6 million lower, at $16.3 million.\n\nTurnover for the same period was flat at $133.8 million.\n\nEarnings per share for the quarter and nine-month period stood at 0.91 cent and 5.42 cents, respectively, against 1.57 cents and 4.29 cents a year earlier.\n\nThe counter closed 1.5 cents higher at 76 cents yesterday, before the release of its earnings.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was on the back of income available for distribution missing its forecast of $26.1 million by 7.4 per cent, at $24.2 million.\n\n\"Q3 2013 continued to be a challenging quarter as the hotels were affected by industry-wide price competition. The hospitality sector also felt the impact of a stronger Singapore dollar, which resulted in fewer bookings from some key tourist markets, as well as subdued business travel spending,\" said Gerald Lee, chief executive officer of the Reit's manager.\n\nSpecifically, the hotels missed its average revenue per available room forecast by 8.9 per cent, at $167.1, as a result of a lower-than-expected average daily rate (ADR), which was 10.6 per cent below forecast.\n\nOn the serviced residences end, revenue per available unit was $229.5, 2.6 per cent below forecast, as ADR was 2.9 per cent lower than expected, due to promotional rates to attract longer stays.\n\nThat being said, retail and office spaces enjoyed high occupancies and stable rentals, which mitigated the impact of the weaker-than expected hotel performance, noted Mr Lee.\n\nRental revenue from the commercial space in the hotels and serviced residences came in at $5 million, 3.4 per cent above forecast.\n\nGross revenue and net property income for the quarter were 9.4 per cent below forecast, at $31.5 million and $28.5 million, respectively.\n\nWhile the challenging operating environment is expected to last through Q4, it should improve in 2014, with the staging of the biennial Singapore Airshow and the Food and Hotel Asia exhibition, said the manager.\n\nIn the meantime, it intends to upgrade about 10 per cent of the hotel rooms and serviced residence units in the portfolio in the next 12 months. In addition, it is repositioning the recently acquired Rendezvous Grand Hotel Singapore (RGHS) and Rendezvous Gallery to an art-inspired hotel. For the first two months since the acquisition, RGHS has performed in line with expectations, it added.\n\nExcluding the advanced distribution paid out on Sept 11 - this was made in connection with the acquisition of the Rendezvous property - a distribution of 0.94 cents will be paid on Dec 18.\n\nThe counter ended trading yesterday down half a cent, at 89.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/curry-favour", "site_title": "Curry favour", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nCurry favour\n\nIndian cuisine is shaking off its traditional image and moving upward and on-trend with a crop of new openings that include a molecular-inspired restaurant by India's Gordon Ramsay. Debbie Yong charts the new direction of Indian fine dining in Singapore\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nWITH Jamaican jerk chicken to Japanese omakase fuelling the Singaporean appetite for global cuisine, it's no wonder that Indian cuisine has fallen off the radar despite its longstanding niche in the local dining scene.\n\nBut that could be set to change as Indian fine dining restaurants go on a modernist spree, ready to regain the spotlight by shedding the image of the cuisine as an antiquated, calorie and curry-laden affair.\n\nOne such new entrant is Pind Balluchi, a swish 70-seat modern Indian bar and grill that opened in Clarke Quay four months ago. The first overseas outpost for the 24-outlet casual Punjabi restaurant chain from India is an intentionally upmarket affair aimed at Indian and international diners alike.\n\nFresh herbs feature liberally on their menu of food and drinks, be it in a tangy prawn masala with fresh cut chillies to cocktails oomphed up with springs of basil or tarragon.\n\nAt three-month-old Earl of Hindh in Sentosa Cove, whiskey connoisseurs and fans of traditional Indian food can now pair their two loves in a chic seaside restaurant that sits easily within a row of Western eateries.\n\nEven industry stalwarts have geared up for change. Rang Mahal, one of the first restaurants here to showcase North Indian cuisine when it opened in the now-defunct Oberoi Imperial hotel in River Valley Road in the 1970s, underwent a complete overhaul earlier this year and now showcases more understated interiors and a subtler use of spices. It also launched sister restaurant, Table by Rang Mahal in Seah Street shortly after, a health-oriented eatery showcasing Indian food alongside international fare such as salads and pastas, and a range of fruit juices.\n\nAfter being in operation for 28 years, Tandoor restaurant at the Holiday Inn City Centre also underwent a $1.5 million facelift to replace its brooding, 16th century decor with a more minimalist, glass and mirror-accented rendition.\n\nTo further ramp up the Indian fine dining scene, one of India's most recognised chefs, Abijit Saha, will open in the first quarter of next year, Saha. The progressive Indian restaurant will take over the second floor space currently used as Russian restaurant Buyan's private dining room. The 36-seater space will apply modernist cooking techniques such as spherification, cryogenic and sous-vide cooking to traditional Indian ingredients and recipes.\n\n\"The richness of Indian cuisine comes from the diversity of cooking styles from each region in the country, and the influences we've absorbed from the various nationalities that have previously occupied the country, from the Persians to the Greeks to the British,\" says Saha, who owns two restaurants, Caperberry and Fava in Bangalore and is often lauded as the \"Gordon Ramsay of India\". \"I want to capture this in my restaurant but give it a modernist approach so it can reach out to an international audience too.\"\n\nModern creations will take up 60 per cent of the menu and feature in the tasting menu, while the rest will be classic dishes to appease traditionalists. \"A curry will still look like a curry, but it won't be a restaurant where you can find 100 types of curries.\"\n\nIt's not just in Singapore where things are heating up for Indian food. Saha, who is an annual speaker at the World of Flavours conference organised by the Culinary Institute of America says he's observed a growing interest among global gourmands in Indian cooking in recent years.\n\n\"With our advancements in other industries such as IT, India has raised its profile as a brand tremendously. People are realising we're not just a rustic country full of history, but a melting pot of diverse cultures, and of modernism and heritage.\"\n\nPind Balluchi's head chef Nishesh Mani Tripathi credits the celebrity TV chef phenomenon that has gripped India in the past decade for helping to raise a new breed of young Indian chefs - himself included - looking to bring their own ideas to the table. \"You can eat a kebab in Old Delhi or in a modern, 5-star restaurant, and there are only so many ways of serving curry in a bowl. Young Indian chefs have to work harder to come up with something novel,\" he says.\n\nMuch of the innovation so far has been driven by changing demands from increasingly health-conscious diners, say most chefs. \"While diners were earlier happy to leave choices in the hands of chefs, they now set more parameters within which they would like their food prepared,\" observes Punjab Grill's Singapore director, Chiranjeev Singh. As such, the restaurant has crafted speciality vegan, gluten-free and nut-free menus.\n\nChanging tastes\n\nIt will feature a wider spread of curries with lighter flavours. Pind Balluchi is working on a weekday set lunch menu to entice corporate diners who previously shunned the cuisine for being time-consuming and food coma-inducing. It will feature a wider spread of curries in small servings and with lighter flavours. Variants of their popular kebabs can also be found in bite-sized portions in their bar snacks menu.\n\nAt Earl of Hindh, spices and kebab meats are blended from scratch in-house rather than obtained ready-made from suppliers, and olive oil and mustard oil are used as healthier substitutes in cooking.\n\nAnd while the Indian fine dining scene here has been largely dominated by Northern Indian restaurants with their more subtle spices and saffron and nut-dominated recipes, diners these days are also looking to have regional flavours, such as the coconut-based curries from southern India or the mustard-tinged fare of the eastern states, observes Song of India's corporate executive chef, Manjunath Mural.\n\nMore foreign ingredients have slipped onto menus to play to well-travelled tastebuds as well. \"Broccoli, for example, was not grown in India before, but in the last 10 years, India has become the second largest broccoli producing country in the world,\" says Pind Balluchi's chef Tripathi.\n\nTruffle oil naan and Roquefort kulcha pad up the bread basket at Rang Mahal, along with quinoa and goji berries; Song of India lists cod fish, salmon, crabs and portobello mushrooms on their menu, and Punjab Grill has a popular tandoor-cooked foie gras and betel leaf shots.\n\nAlcohol-pairing, too, is a growing aspect for Indian fine dining, say chefs and restaurant owners. Earl of Hindh caters to whiskey-swilling connoisseurs with their range of close to 20 single malt whiskeys from Scotland and India, while Rang Mahal's overhaul plugged in a brand new alfresco area for a pre- or post-prandial drink.\n\n\"Indians have been traditionally fond of their hard liquor, but the younger generation doesn't want to have a plain Scotch, they want something lighter and more fun that can go with their meal\", observes chef Tripathi. Hence cocktails designed to cut out the spice, such as sweet passionfruit mojitos to basil and tarragon-tinged concoctions.\n\nAnd looks, it turns out, matters just as much. Gone are the days when the more dark wood, ethnic antiques and heavy upholstery used meant a posher restaurant. Minimalism and light colours are the new norm, while an antique Indian vase here or a window motif there keeps the link to one's roots.\n\nAnd its effect is tangible. Jagdeep Thakral, general manager of the Holiday Inn Orchard City Centre says Tandoor now gets more Westerners and local Chinese as patrons since its makeover in September: \"Before the makeover, the traditional d\u00e9cor was a little overpowering for non-Indians.\"\n\nAdds chef Tripathi: \"People don't just want food these days, they want it in a nice ambience, where they can show off to their friends that they have brought them to a nice place - and this segment is only going to grow.\"\n\ndebyong@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This set off a wave of selling in other penny counters such as Sky One and Tritech Group.\n\nSIAS has reviewed Asiasons, Blumont and LionGold with technology company Handshakes, and discovered a recent instance when a share price run-up came before the announcement of a sizeable acquisition, Mr Gerald said. A listed company is required to seek shareholders' approval when a deal it plans to undertake is proportionately large for its size. In this instance, the preceding share-price run sufficiently affected the way certain ratios were calculated. Hence, such shareholders' approval was not required.\n\nMr Gerald said it's timely for the regulators to review instances where unusual price movements affect ratios that determine the need for shareholder approvals.\n\n\"We want to avoid situations where unusual price movements inadvertently deprive shareholders of a say in significant matters,\" he said.\n\nListed companies should also be required to state clearly whether they had been queried recently in disclosures when they announce acquisitions and disposals to shareholders, Mr Gerald added.\n\nThe SIAS Investors' Choice Awards held last night is an annual event to celebrate displays of excellence in areas of shareholder communication and corporate governance. Corporate winners this year include DBS Group, Yongnam Holdings, SingTel, Fraser and Neave, Sembcorp Marine, Cordlife Group, InnoTek and Ascendas Reit. CapitaLand scooped the Golden Circle Award - the highest accolade - for consistently practising good corporate governance, Mr Gerald said.\n\nThe awards are part of the fourth Corporate Governance Week organised by SIAS that's taking place next week.\n\nGuest-of-honour Grace Fu, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, yesterday urged the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to consider requiring companies to adopt and disclose their diversity policy in their annual reports.\n\nWhile the revised Singapore's Code of Corporate Governance, which requires corporate boards to provide for diversity - including that of gender diversity - is \"a step in the right direction\", Ms Fu said: \"I believe we can do better.\"\n\nIn response to her comments, the MAS said it has already established a diversity task force to study how to encourage greater diversity, including gender diversity, in the boardroom and C-suite.\n\n\"The task force is currently conducting a survey on gender diversity on boards and in senior management, and is expected to produce a report with its recommendations some time in 2014.\n\n\"Along with other relevant agencies, MAS will study the recommendations and consider how best to implement them,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The figures were down from the previous week's 17 firms, 30 trades and $5.5 million. Buyers outnumbered sellers with seven companies that posted nine purchases worth $3.3 million versus one firm with four disposals worth $1.57 million.\n\nBesides directors, buyback activity fell for the second straight week with three companies that recorded six repurchases worth $258,000 - against the previous week's four firms, five trades and $463,000.\n\nWith the sharp drop in director activity last week, the bulk of the significant trades were by institutions with purchases in Forterra Trust and Yongnam Holdings and sales in Hutchison Port Trust, Global Logistic Properties and Boustead Singapore. There were some key director trades with purchases in Aspial Corporation and First Reit.\n\nForterra Trust\n\nPacific Alliance Asia Opportunity Fund LP picked up where it left off in real estate investment trust Forterra Trust in April with a purchase-related filing on Oct 31 of 150,000 units at $2.15 each. The trade increased its direct holdings to 33.013 million units or 13.01 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 10 per cent drop in the unit price since August from $2.38. Although the group resumed buying this month following the fall in the unit price, the trade was made at higher than its previous purchase prices based on the 5.269 million units that it acquired from April 24 to 30 in the open market at an average of $1.97 each and the initial filing on April 23 of 25.8 million units via an off-market trade at $1.92 each, which raised its interest to 10.5 per cent. Overall, Pacific Alliance's stake is up by 24 per cent since that initial filing in April. The recent purchase by Pacific Alliance was surprising as Forterra Trust announced on Oct 29 a third quarter after-tax loss of $5.133 million versus a profit of $9.038 million in the same period last year. The unit trust closed at $2.17 on Friday.\n\nYongnam Holdings\n\nDelta Lloyd Asset Management NV acquired more shares in structural steelworks, civil and mechanical engineering services provider Yongnam Holdings with a purchase-related filing on Oct 3 of 1.2 million shares at 24.1 cents each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 115.089 million shares or 9.08 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 22 per cent drop in the share price since September from 31 cents. The counter is also sharply down since June from 38 cents. The group previously reported a purchase-related filing on March 13 of 500,000 shares at 27.5 cents each and a purchase-related filing on Feb 19 of 1.8 million shares at 29 cents each. Prior to the notices this year, the shareholder reported a purchase-related filing on Dec 14, 2012, of 800,000 shares at 24 cents each and an initial filing on April 20, 2012, of 14.765 million shares at 25 cents each, which raised its interest to 5.72 per cent. Overall, Delta Lloyd's stake is up by 59 per cent since that initial filing in April 2012. The counter closed at 24.5 cents on Friday.\n\nHutchison Port Holdings Trust\n\nThe Capital Group Companies unloaded more units of container port investor, developer and operator Hutchison Port Holdings Trust at a lower price with a disposal-related filing on Nov 4 of 4.465 million units at 73 cents each. The trades lowered its deemed stake to 606.828 million units or 6.97 per cent of the issued capital. The sales were made on the back of the 15 per cent drop in the unit price since April from US 86 cents. The group previously sold 89.91 million units from March 7 to 13 at around 80 cents each and made a disposal-related filing in September 2012 of 35.5 million units (the filing in September 2012 stated that the disposals were made from Aug 29, 2011, to Sept 18, 2012; the unit trust during that period traded in the range of 53-75 US cents). Overall, the Capital Group's stake is down by 33 per cent since the last week of August 2011. Prior to those sales, the group acquired a net 78.2 million units from May to August 2011 at estimated prices of 92-60 US cents each. The Capital Group became a substantial shareholder in March 2011 after it acquired an initial 826.460 million units or 9.49 per cent in the IPO at US$1.01 each. The unit trust closed at 72 US cents on Friday.\n\nGlobal Logistic Properties\n\nLone Pine Capital LLC unloaded more shares of logistics facilities provider Global Logistic Properties at a higher price with a disposal-related filing on Nov 5 of 6.7 million shares at $3.08 each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 424.319 million shares or 8.92 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 22 per cent rise in the share price since March from $2.52. The group previously reported a disposal-related filing on Jan 28 of 5.168 million shares at $2.71 each. Overall, Lone Pine Capital's stake is down by 10 per cent since January. Prior to the sales this year, the group acquired 236.47 million shares from Nov 10, 2010, to Dec 16, 2011, at estimated prices $2.24 to $1.645 each and an initial filing on Nov 9, 2010, of 3.03 million shares at $2.24 each, which raised its interest to 5.07 per cent. The stock closed at $3.00 on Friday.\n\nBoustead Singapore\n\nChartered Asset Management Pte Ltd recorded a rare sale in engineering services and geo-spatial technology services provider Boustead Singapore with a disposal-related filing on Nov 7 of 196,000 shares at $1.46 each. The trade reduced its deemed holdings to 46.139 million shares or 8.96 per cent of the issued capital. The filing was made on the back of the 13 per cent rebound in the share price since August from $1.29. The counter is also sharply up since May 2012 from 85 cents. The group previously acquired a net 32.76 million shares from December 2005 to December 2011 at estimated prices of $0.93 to $1.53 each and an initial filing in November 2005 of 452,000 shares at $0.92 each, which raised its interest to 5.1 per cent. The stock closed at $1.435 on Friday.\n\nAspial Corporation\n\nCEO and managing director Koh Wee Seng picked up where he left off in jewellery manufacturer and retailer and residential property developer Aspial Corporation in August with 6.52 million shares purchased on Nov 7 at 42 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings to 291.009 million shares or 16.73 per cent of the issued capital. He also has deemed interest of 1.023 billion shares or 58.83 per cent. The acquisition was made after the company announced on Nov 6 a 36 per cent gain in third quarter profit to $24.0 million. Earnings in the first nine months rose by 73 per cent to $73.8 million. He previously acquired 13.08 million shares from Aug 14 to 20 at an average of 44.2 cents each, nearly 12 million shares from May 9 to July 1 at an average of 42.1 cents each, and 7.6 million shares from Feb 26 to March 28 at an average of 43.1 cents each. Prior to his trades this year, the CEO acquired 1.55 million shares from Nov 16 to Dec 4, 2012 at 42 cents each and 1.56 million shares from Aug 8 to 21, 2012, at an average of 37.8 cents each. The counter closed at 41 cents on Friday.\n\nFirst Reit\n\nIndependent director Wong Gang recorded his first on-market trade in real estate investment firm First Reit since his appointment in June 2012 with an initial 30,000 units (direct) purchased on Nov 8 at $1.09 each. The acquisition was made on the back of the 25 per cent drop in the unit price since April from $1.45. Despite the fall in the unit price, the counter is still up since November 2008 from 27.6 cents. Also positive this quarter is CEO Tan Keh Poo with 80,000 units purchased from Oct 4 to 7 at $1.08 each, which boosted his deemed stake to 7.277 million units or 1.03 per cent.

He previously acquired a net 901,000 units from July 29 to Sept 6 at $1.22 to $1.01 each, 1.93 million units from Jan 30 to July 11 at $1.07 to $1.42 each or an average of $1.27 each and 1.39 million units (direct and deemed) from November to December 2012 at an average of $1.00 each.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/startups-tech/technology/free-apps-come-price-watch-out-madware", "site_title": "Free apps come at a price - watch out for madware", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nFree apps come at a price - watch out for madware\n\nSymantec highlights that apps can even send out text message ads to friends, reports VICTORIA HO\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 10, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGET ready for \"madware\", a term that Symantec has coined for overly-aggressive ads on your Android. The digital security firm has released a new White Paper that details a trend in smartphone apps, in which apps pull ads from a supplier's stock of advertisers.\n\nThis is usually used in free apps, where it's common for app makers to choose to monetise via ads, in the hopes of attracting more downloads by making the app free. Symantec estimates that about 55 per cent of all apps in the Google Play store are supported by ad libraries.\n\nTypically, these will display mobile ad banners either on the top or bottom of the screen, or as a momentary splash screen, but more aggressive ads can push notifications into the user's dropdown bars, leave ads in their photo galleries or even change their ringtones. Some are also able to modify browser bookmarks and send out text message ads to friends.\n\nSymantec said that, so far, about 65 ad libraries are in use, globally - and it classifies 60 per cent of these as aggressive. It said that apps using aggressive libraries have been increasing over the past three years, and the proportion of apps in the Google Play store using these hit a high of 23 per cent in the first half of 2013.\n\nMomentum has been picking up, as well. According to Kevin Haley, Symantec's director of its response unit, 2012 already saw a 210 per cent increase in madware over the course of the year.\n\nThe company seems to have zeroed-in on Android devices because of the degree of control that apps can have within the Android OS. iPhone apps, on the other hand, tend to be more fenced in in terms of security controls, and the OS keeps many of the core phone's functions out of the reach of third-party apps. This can help rein in the reach of damage that nuisance apps can cause.\n\nJust as madware has been creeping up, malware on Android phones has been skyrocketing, in tandem with the popularity of these devices.\n\nSymantec said the number of known malware families increased by 69 per cent between June 2012 and June 2013, growing from 121 threat families to 204. The volume of known malware samples, excluding madware, hit 273,000 in June 2013, representing a four-fold increase over the previous year.\n\nThe overall spread of malware is fairly consistent across most of the app categories, but photography and entertainment apps had the highest number of offenders over the past three years.\n\nSymantec added that photography apps and games downloaded from third-party stores - that is, stores not run by Google - have particularly high occurrences of nefarious apps. While the volume of malware in Google Play-listed photography apps just crossed 0.5 per cent, this was 1.5 per cent in third-party stores. Third-party games had an even bigger 2.3 per cent chance of malware. The report's author, Bartlomiej Uscilowski, said: \"Although malware slips into Google Play, most malware is hosted on third-party app stores.\"\n\nAndroid's growing rate of malware is set against the stratospheric growth of devices sold based on Google's OS. Google senior vice-president and head of Android, Sundar Pichai, said in September that one billion Android devices have been activated, and that these are happening at a rate of 1.5 million devices per day. The company's chief of security for Android, Adrian Ludwig, said in October that stories of Android's security woes are largely overblown, and that just 0.001 per cent of apps downloaded to Android devices are infected in any way.\n\nThe Google Play store has over a million apps now, and the Apple App Store has some 750,000 apps.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So will tai-tais dropping off their kids at enrichment classes here.\n\nOff the beaten track, the upcoming Bentley sport utility vehicle's (SUV) high performance and off-road capabilities will also appeal to sporty types such as the Middle Easterners who love dune-ing in the desert, or others just traversing less-developed roads in their home countries, be it Russia or China.\n\nBentley is clearly targeting its coming SUV - expected to be launched by 2016 - at a truly global market.\n\nWhile the SUV will take the luxury marque into uncharted territory, beyond its established two and four-door coupe and convertible range, \"it will still be a Bentley\", assures Sangyup Lee, the group's head of Exterior Design.\n\nAsked if his appointment to the British marque by Volkswagen Group (VW) just 10 months ago was its way to inject new ideas and a fresh mind to the SUV project, he said \"yes, the SUV is a new segment for Bentley and, yes, freshness of design is important, but at the same time it still has to be a Bentley and the challenge is to make it timeless and classic\".\n\n\"It has to be recognised even with one's eyes closed. When you sit in it you can tell that it is a Bentley just by smell, touch and sense (of luxe wood and leather), and also by the precision of its sheet metal. If we lose that, then it's not a Bentley,\" he stressed.\n\n\"That is my biggest challenge,\" says Mr Lee - who designed the iconic 2010 Camaro during his time at General Motors, before he crossed over three years ago to VW, which owns Bentley.\n\n\"Bentley has a strong DNA, and I will have to take the SUV's design to the next level, but still respecting the brand's heritage. To do that, maturity in design is very important . . . it's not just styling to change the design. I have to soak myself into the history and DNA of the brand, otherwise I cannot design it.\"\n\nWhile there is already a concept model of the Bentley SUV, the final design is still under wraps (with the design studio at Crewe totally off-limits to visitors), although Mr Lee lets on that he expects to sign off on this soon.\n\nMarket feedback from customers played a part in its design, just as for other Bentley models.\n\n\"There is for instance already a lot of players in the mid-size, C-class SUV segment like the Porsche Cayenne, the BMW X-5 and the VW Touareg. But there is no true, big D-segment luxury SUV, with the closest being the Range Rover, but the latter's DNA is different . . . its design language says it's powerful in a rugged way, not necessarily sophisticated way.\" Beyond the SUV, and asked whether future Bentleys will look different from those today, Mr Lee says: \"Yes and no, because the brand DNA has to be there. But there are always big discussions going on as to whether the marque should add more vehicles to its portfolio.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Six-month revenue from continuing operations rose 1.7 per cent to HK$1.24 billion. Earnings per share for the first half rose to 20.1 HK cents, from 8.1 HK cents, the latter after accounting for loss per share of 10.6 HK cents from discontinued operations.\n\nProfitability improved; its gross profit margin for the first half of the year rose 1.1 percentage points to 13.1 per cent, thanks to a change in product sales mix. No dividend was declared for the six-month period.\n\nGoing forward, costs and wage pressures in China will continue to affect business, but the group expects to still achieve profitability growth for its fiscal year. \"We are looking at ways to further increase both our capacity and productivity in a prudent manner, in tandem with our customers' market outlook,\" said chairman and managing director Ricky Tse.\n\nSo far this fiscal year, the group has increased its production capacity and co-developed a semi-auto assembly line to support the seasonal increase in demand from customers. The group said it will continue to drive contributions from new customers, expand its product portfolio especially in the industrial and commercial electronics segment, and improve its fundamentals, including design and development capabilities, production efficiencies and inventory management.\n\nYesterday, its counter added two cents to end at 23.5 cents after its results were announced.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It was larger than Kellogg Company or The Hershey Company. At the same time, its co-founders were able to put an official price tag on their corporeal selves.\n\nLess than 10 frenzied hours of trading later, co-founder Evan Williams, with the lion's share of 12 per cent, became US$1.1 billion richer. The other co-founder, Jack Dorsey, walked around feeling US$443 million taller, and Twitter CEO Dick Costolo had to find room for another US$145 million worth of change.\n\nThese remain paper gains for the next 180 days - the lock-in period for the executive team and early shareholders - but after that, they will have access to a market willing to pay good money for a firm that lost US$133.8 million for the first nine months of 2013.\n\nGranted, this might no longer be the case six months down the road but on Thursday, the gods smiled upon Twitter. As the shadow of technical glitches during Facebook's IPO hung over Twitter's debut, bankers working on the deal collectively exhaled when the first few hours of trading went smoothly.\n\n\"Phew!\" was all Anthony Noto, the Goldman Sachs banker who led the IPO, could manage at 10.53 am, as the stock surged past US$46.\n\nWhile the market opened only at 9.30 am, New York City time, on the West Coast, Chris Sacca - one of Twitter's largest investors - spent the early hours of the morning wide awake.\n\n\"Trying to convince my two-year-old daughter the SEC quiet period remains in effect and applies directly to her. Especially at 4.29 am,\" he had Tweeted that morning.\n\nFor anyone estimated to have a stake worth US$1 billion in Twitter, slumber would understandably have been hard to come by on the day of the IPO. This fact was not lost on his Twitter circle. Within minutes, someone replied: \"Congratulations on the IPO. This must be a very exciting day for you, plus it pays for your two-year-old's college.\"\n\nOther Silicon Valley players took some time to indulge in a little schadenfreude on Thursday. Matt Haughey, the creator of community blog Metafilter, tweeted just around lunchtime: \"Twitter's market cap could exceed Yahoo's by the end of the day. The same Yahoo whose $12 million offer for Twitter was declined in 2007.\"\n\nMr Haughey was a smidgen too optimistic, however. Yahoo! had a market cap of US$34.2 billion at the end of Thursday.\n\nTwitter also flexed its street cred beyond the fanboys of Silicon Valley, with Star Trek star Patrick Stewart ringing the opening bell at the stock exchange for Twitter's big day. \"I guess I represent the poster boy for Twitter,\" he said yesterday. Stewart, who goes by the username 'sirpatstew', has posted only 332 Tweets but has a following numbering more than 700,000.\n\nAs the counter wended its way towards a triumphant US$44.90 close, former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger - who has almost three million followers - called Twitter \"proof of the CA dream\" in a Tweet.\n\nOther pundits and observers, however, maintained some distance from the giddy euphoria that permeated the Twitterverse. Ali Veshi, the host of Al Jazeera America, posted a slackjawed selfie, with the Tweet: \"My expression when I saw #twitter started trading at $45.10\".\n\nThose who made out as the largest bandits, however, maintained radio silence on Twitter. One of Twitter's early backers, financier Suhail Rizvi, is so reclusive that he has someone on his payroll whose job is to scrub the Internet of any trace of personal information. His firm, Rizvi Traverse Management, reportedly owned 17.9 per cent of Twitter worth US$3.82 billion at last count, but no hashtag-riddled celebration on Twitter was forthcoming on Thursday.\n\nTwitter co-founder Evan Williams, the centre of attention with his 12 per cent stake, was either too busy or too modest to tweet about being US$1.1 billion richer on IPO day.\n\nThe day before that, though, Mr Williams tweeted about being in New York City for \"@twitter business\". The glow from prospective billionaire-dom was evident - he capped off his tweet with \"#iloveyouguys\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The fall stemmed mainly from property developments as construction of various projects (including Double Bay Residences and Waterbank at Dakota in Singapore) was completed in 2012 or early 2013.\n\nRevenue from all other segments recorded improvements. The increase was due mainly to revenue from Parkroyal on Pickering and Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road in Singapore, which opened in the first and second quarter of 2013 respectively, along with higher revenue from Parkroyal Darling Harbour and Parkroyal Yangon.\n\nCommenting on its Q3 performance, the group said the share of profit of associated companies, excluding fair value gains of associated companies' investment properties, fell 11 per cent to $23.8 million - following the completion of the Terrene project in Bukit Timah in January.\n\nBut the group booked a $4.8 million share of profit from joint-venture companies in Q3 this year (mainly contributed by the Archipelago project in the Bedok Reservoir area), compared with a nearly $1.5 million loss a year earlier.\n\nGross profit margin improved to 50 per cent in Q3 from 43 per cent the previous year, mainly due to lower revenue from property development, which has a higher cost margin.\n\nEarnings per share rose to 12.14 cents from 11.43 cents in Q3 2012. Net asset value per share stood at $8.51 as at end-September 2013, up from $7.98 as at end-December 2012.\n\nThe group said its gearing ratio edged up to 0.31 as at Sept 30, 2013, from 0.28 as at end-December 2012. This was primarily due to additional borrowings for the acquisition of shares in Pan Pacific Hotels Group held by non-controlling shareholders in Q3 2013 and the land parcel at Sengkang West Way.\n\nThe group said that as at end-October, 330 units have been sold at the recently launched 445-unit Thomson Three condo in Upper Thomson Road.\n\nLooking ahead, UOL said the introduction of the Total Debt Servicing Ratio framework in June will further moderate demand for residential properties.\n\nOn a more positive note, rentals of office space are expected to maintain modest growth. The retail leasing market, which grew by 0.4 per cent in third quarter 2013, is expected to be stable.\n\n\"The performance of the group's hotels in Singapore is expected to be affected by the increasing supply of hotel rooms and slower visitor growth. Uncertainties in the global economic environment will continue to affect the hotel industry in the Asia Pacific region,\" UOL said.\n\nIn the first nine months of this year, net profit rose 74 per cent year on year to $596.6 million. This was helped by fair value gains and other gains amounting to $402.6 million, up from $90.2 million in the year-ago period. Revenue, however, slipped 7 per cent to $813.9 million.\n\nThe counter closed 14 cents lower at $6.36 yesterday, before the results were released.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Early-bird acceptances tendered by yesterday's close would have received an additional $625 per $250,000 of notes, while acceptances tendered from today to Nov 12 will receive $375 per $250,000 of notes held.\n\nBT understands that F&N was still tallying the first round of early-bird acceptances as at late last night.\n\nBondholders of F&N's higher-coupon bonds - about $200 million of 6 per cent notes due 2019 and about $108 million of 5.5 per cent notes due 2016 - have expressed outrage at F&N's offer because the offer is considerably lower than market value. The 6 per cent notes, for example, are trading in the region of 109 per cent of par on the market. If F&N calls back those bonds under its offer terms, bondholders would get only about 103 and change.\n\n\"Of course, bondholders don't think that's fair and economic compensation for them to give you the call option,\" said one fund manager.\n\nBut what apparently rattled most was the apparent signal that F&N sent during negotiations, that it would be willing to push ahead with the FCL listing and enter technical default if the necessary waivers were not obtained.\n\n\"If you don't consent, I will go ahead, trigger a default, and if I default, I can pay you back par plus interest, which is worse than what I'm offering\" was how the fund manager characterised F&N's negotiating tactic.\n\nIn other words, F&N could potentially choose to default rather than negotiate, a move that would set a precedent not just in Singapore, but around the world.\n\nAsked about its stance, a spokesman for F&N would only say: \"If consent is not obtained for a series of notes, we will consider our next course of action and make an announcement at the appropriate time.\"\n\nA default in such circumstances would go against the spirit of the contract. \"When bondholders lend . . . they don't expect you to default if you can pay,\" the fund manager said, adding it's not what investors expect from a listed company.\n\nBut some observers thought that the threat of a voluntary default could be more bark than bite.\n\n\"It strikes me as pretty reckless if you were to do it,\" said Andrew Carey, a partner at Hogan Lovells who specialises in debt capital markets.\n\nMr Carey explained that while on the surface, a voluntary default seemed like a logical alternative for a company in F&N's shoes, in reality the costs would be much higher.\n\nFor example, triggering a default in the bonds could set off defaults on other obligations that F&N might have. The high cost of a voluntary default is why it is so rarely, if ever, seen.\n\n\"I have had it discussed as an academic exercise, I've never seen it in practice. It sounds like an endgame for a company in some sort of desperate space or maybe it's just a game of chicken,\" Mr Carey said.\n\nHarry Elias head of corporate and financial services Claudia Teo also pointed out that choosing default would exact a cost on future capital raising.\n\n\"Is it usual? Definitely not, because you talk about investor relations, and you want to maintain your relations, especially if you want to go to those investors again.\"\n\nBut Ms Teo said that if F&N were to choose technical default, it would suggest that the company felt that the value of listing FCL was more than the risk of angering bondholders. \"They must have come to the conclusion that (they) can accept this risk.\"\n\nAnother lawyer, who declined to be named, also said that this was a high-stakes game with many opposing interests. What might be unattractive for bondholders could be a good deal for equity holders. \"They're playing hardball, But if it leads to savings on their part, the shareholders will thank them.\"\n\nFollowing a takeover by Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi at the start of this year, F&N said in August that it plans to split its property business from the rest of its businesses.\n\nFCL has received eligibility to list by way of introduction on Singapore Exchange, and F&N shareholders will meet on Nov 13 to vote on the split. A bondholder meeting will take place a day later.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

These were detected within 15 minutes of their occurrence - the first one late on Thursday night and the second one 20 minutes past midnight yesterday.\n\nWithin an hour of discovering the attacks late on Thursday night, the search function on the affected subpages was disabled.\n\nBT understands that a patch addressing this particular vulnerability for the embedded Google Search bar had existed, but it had not been applied by the time of the attacks. The patch is currently being applied across government websites.\n\n\"Both the PMO and Istana main websites are still functioning, and restoration of the compromised subpages are under way,\" the IDA said yesterday.\n\nThe attack was designed in such a way that a user looking for website content through the embedded search bar would have been brought to a page of search results, some of which would have contained Web links to a page hosted elsewhere.\n\nThis page would have resembled the PMO or Istana website with additional images to create the impression of defacement, the IDA said. One of the images had been the Guy Fawkes mask, used by the Anonymous group, a hacking collective.\n\nYesterday, security software firm Trend Micro echoed the IDA's stance on the matter, saying, \"The attack was not a result of a hacking attack, but an exploitation of vulnerability within the website.\"\n\n\"The exploited URL was broadcast across various social networking sites including Twitter, Facebook and more, implying that the PMO website has been defaced. With the exploited link referencing to PMO website's official URL (www.pmo.gov.sg), when clicked on, unsuspecting visitors and consumers were tricked into thinking that the exploited link was a real defaced-PMO website,\" Trend Micro said yesterday.\n\nLast week, individuals claiming to be part of Anonymous urged Singaporeans to mount a protest on Nov 5, which was Guy Fawkes' Day. While the date had passed without apparent incident, the IDA revealed yesterday that there had been \"unusually high Internet traffic\" to many government websites throughout Nov 5.\n\n\"This was indicative of attempts to scan for vulnerabilities or potential (distributed denial-of-service) attempts,\" it said.\n\nThe attacks on both websites are being investigated by the IDA and the police.\n\n\"We will continue to strengthen all government websites. This includes the checking and fixing of vulnerabilities and software patching. While this is in progress, visitors to government websites may experience intermittent problems with access,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Which is why he's eschewing opportunities to expand the indie musicfest globally so that the event can remain a boutique one.\n\nAfter all, that's how the festival began. It started literally in an alleyway (or laneway, as the Australians call it) - a narrow 4m wide and 100m long space at the back of a bar in Melbourne in 2004, before expanding to a proper festival in other Australian cities from 2006.\n\nThere's been no looking back since; by 2010, New Zealand was added as a stop and Singapore followed suit a year later. Two months ago, Laneway, as the festival has become affectionately known, made its debut on American soil in Detroit.\n\nBut Rogers insists the growth is an organic one and he is well aware of the danger of the festival becoming too big for its own good. Staying small and manageable is one of the reasons Laneway has remained successful in the music festival circuit Down Under, while bigger and more established ones struggle or get canned due to the stiff competition and poor ticket sales in the overheated market.\n\n\"Our approach is a little different from the way a bigger festival is being programmed,\" says Rogers. \"I sort of pride myself on having a balanced line-up of acts with a realistic break-even rather than going in and putting the whole project under stress if we can't hit the numbers.\"\n\nUnlike most festivals, Laneway doesn't rely on just one big name to push ticket sales but instead is programmed around a body of acts. Through the years, critics have lauded the festival for being forward-thinking and cutting-edge because of its knack for spotting indie music's next big thing.\n\n\"Part of my job is projection,\" explains Rogers, who's in-charge of programming Laneway. \"I'm doing that between May and August which is about six to eight months before the festival happens and I pick out acts that I think by that time will be hot and ready to pop.\"\n\nHe adds that he does it by tracking bands that he's already a fan of as well as the industry buzz around them. \"A lot of times you rely on your intuition and taste,\" Rogers reveals.\n\nA festival's reputation also goes a long way; for Laneway, it's led to acts asking to be on the bill, like one of next year's bands, Haim. A friend of the American all-sisters trio approached Rogers out of the blue while at a bar in Austin earlier this year and the latter, who's a fan, immediately said yes.\n\nHaim also fits nicely into next year's \"riot-grrrl\" line-up that features a handful of bands with female members in it. They include English all-girl post-punk quartet Savages, Scottish synth-pop trio Chvrches and Australian indie darlings The Jezabels.\n\nAccording to Rogers, the Singapore leg of Laneway has shown unstoppable growth over the last three editions with attendance numbers growing about 30 per cent year-on-year. Four thousand tickets for 2014's show has already been sold since they went on sale last month - that number is the total attendance for 2011 when Laneway was first staged at Fort Canning.\n\nSince this year, the festival has also moved to its new home at Gardens by the Bay to accommodate the growing crowd. It's expecting 10,000 to 12,000 people next year and a third stage has been added to the festival because of the expanded line-up.\n\nRogers projects if things continue the way they are going, Singapore will eventually become the biggest stop for Laneway in the next three to five years. \"We'll hit 18,000 to 20,000 which is still a good number to manage a boutique event and give people a personal experience,\" he says.\n\nAnd with around 30 per cent of punters from the region coming to Singapore each year for Laneway, Rogers' aim is to turn Singapore into a destination venue for the festival. Referring to two world-famous music festivals which are known for attracting an international crowd, Rogers quips, \"I want people to think of Laneway Singapore as Coachella or Primavera; but we don't want to force anything. The focus will always be on the music.\"\n\nSt Jerome's Laneway Festival 2014 takes place at The Meadows, Gardens by the Bay, on Jan 25, 2014.

At the same time, as an island nation with limited space, Singapore has faced the challenge of constructing new, large developments without displacing existing uses, and of developing in a sustainable way, setting new benchmarks for sustainable design and construction.\"\n\nSingapore buildings on display include Marina Bay Sands, Changi Airport Terminal 3, Marina Bay Financial Centre and the National University of Singapore's University Town master plan.\n\nThe Marina Bay Sands project, featured under the fun category, was chosen because the development leverages culture and recreation to improve development opportunities, expand tourism and to shape local cultural identity.\n\n\"Ideas we have been exploring, about making high density more liveable, creating a three-dimensional matrix of open spaces, and stacking different uses, are now ripe for realisation. Theory is now practice in Asia - the urbanism of the future,\" said Moshe Safdie, architect of Marina Bay Sands.\n\nOther projects in Asia that were categorised as fun include the reconstructed Shanghai Bund, designed by architectural firm NBBJ, and the Foster +Partners designed Kai Tak Cruise Terminal in Hong Kong.\n\n\"What many cities in Asia have done over the past 20 years is borrow ideas from the West and transform them to a whole new level. With the exhibition, we are trying to show how some of the ideas should be brought back to the West - completing the circle of exchange and learning,\" explained Bruce Fisher, director at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and who was also one of the architects behind the Marina Bay Financial Centre.\n\nHe added that while Singapore's development process is very different from New York's, specific concepts and lessons were still transferable.\n\n\"For example, Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority has implemented specific mandates to do with zoning that transform architecture. While our government is very different, we can definitely do more to incentivise developers.\"\n\nAlthough most architects and designers are aware of the need for an exchange across countries, Jill Lerner, president of AIA New York (2013) explained that there are many others who remain ignorant on the importance for such a process.\n\n\"Many Americans will ask why we should look to Asian cities, when they come here to learn from us. But the point of the exhibition is to broaden our perspectives and to understand the urban challenges and potential design solutions in a different way. It is smart to learn from the best ideas to help keep New York City globally competitive.\"\n\nWhile the exhibition offered audiences a fresh perspective of Asian cities and how both the East and West are more connected on a global scale, it also emphasised the hyper-connectedness of cities within Asia.\n\nChangi Airport Teminal 3, known globally for its elegant design, was featured alongside several other transportation hubs in the region due to the high level of connectivity and flexibility it offers to visitors.\n\nIn addition to being connected, dense and fun, Singapore's architecture was also showcased as being green and environmentally friendly.\n\n\"By building on the tropical environment, Singapore has ensured that publicly accessible green space is a cornerstone of the city,\" explained Robert C Whitlock, principal at Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates.\n\nThrough the examples of the Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (CREATE) and NUS's University Town Masterplan, designed by Perkins +Will and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) respectively, the exhibition highlighted how these developments incorporate green practices at both the design and institutional level.\n\n\"Singapore is a country with a true vision of the future where architecture and urban design have a major role . . . (and) public and private interests are profoundly balanced by the government. Consumers are highly educated in terms of quality of design and construction. They are not only interested in their own spaces but also in the overall architecture and urban context,\" commented Daniel Libeskind whose firm designed the Reflections at Keppel Bay project.\n\nExplaining the purpose behind the exhibition, Mr Solomon said: \"It was my goal to introduce audiences to the work of international teams in Singapore as well as other cities in Asia. Though very different from one another, and different from New York, these cities face many of the same challenges and are developing, through the involvement of global architectural practices, innovative responses that are relevant worldwide.\"\n\nGiven that cities in the West are in the process of reconstructing and redeveloping public spaces, the exhibition comes at a timely moment to provide both architects and the public with real-life examples of what to expect as they move forward.\n\n\"There are so many cities in the world that are hamstrung by development choices made in the last mid-century and I think the example that Singapore is creating shows that these sorts of changes can provide a huge benefit. As is clearly understood in Singapore, the growth of the city and its inhabitants is a strategic undertaking in a global environment,\" commented Mr Whitlock.\n\nThe Practical Utopias exhibition is on display till Jan 14 at the Center for Architecture in New York City.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ever since MBS first opened its doors in 2010, almost all of the contracts at the $8 billion property have been awarded to Singapore-based companies.\n\nIt's all part of an ongoing commitment to benefit local firms, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), said an MBS spokesman in response to queries from The Business Times.\n\nThree years ago, MBS awarded 70 per cent, or $285.8 million, of its total procurement contracts to companies based here. Last year, that figure shot up to 93 per cent, or $389 million worth of contracts, of which a little over half ($197 million) went to local SMEs.\n\n\"(MBS) is committed to benefit Singapore and we will continue to ensure that the community and local enterprises benefit most from our presence in Singapore,\" said the spokesman.\n\nLocal companies, too, could expect to see an increase in their business volume, given MBS's scale and the fact that it serves thousands of guests each day, she said. One such company that has reaped the benefits so far is ZeroSpot, which provides a one-stop shop for all of MBS's laundry services including staff uniforms, towels and hotel guest laundry.\n\nEarly in its partnership with the IR, ZeroSpot's management chose to invest $18 million on new equipment and to set up a new plant in Tuas, mainly to cater to MBS's needs. Besides the Tuas plant, ZeroSpot operates a satellite laundry service at MBS meant for fast and urgent turnarounds for guest laundry. The company also had to hire 80 extra workers to meet the demand from the IR.\n\nSecuring a lucrative MBS contract also proved to be a jackpot for Sing See Soon Floral & Landscape, which started working with MBS in July 2009, months before the IR had even opened to the public. The company supplies flowers to MBS for its wedding and Mice (meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions) events, and the IR is now Sing See Soon's biggest customer.\n\nSealing the MBS deal led to the company investing in a computerised system to process orders, having previously relied on traditional methods, such as face-to-face meetings, over-the-phone orders and accepting only cash in payment.\n\nThe MBS spokesman said: \"As a long-term business in Singapore, we want to reach out and work with as many local companies as possible to help them grow along with our development in this country.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Osborne to announce decision on Dec 4", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nWill UK tax foreign-owned property sales? Osborne to announce decision on Dec 4\n\nHe refuses to confirm talk of capital gains tax\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 7, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[LONDON] A UK Treasury minister signalled that foreigners who own British homes will find out next month whether the government will slap an unprecedented tax on property sales.\n\n\"You'll have to wait for the Autumn Statement\" on Dec 4, when Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne presents new economic forecasts, Financial Secretary to the Treasury Sajid Javid said in an interview, when asked whether the government is planning a capital gains tax on foreign investors selling property in the UK.\n\nMr Osborne is considering such a levy to curb rising house prices in London and the south-east of England, Sky News television reported last week, without saying where it got the information. Overseas demand is adding to pressure on a market experiencing a shortage of supply. Rightmove plc said on Oct 21 that values in the capital rose more than 10 per cent last month.\n\nPrices for luxury homes have soared in recent years as the debt crisis in the euro region and uprisings across North Africa made London property a haven for international investors.\n\nValues of prime London residences have risen more than 60 per cent from their low in 2009, with non-UK residents accounting for 25 per cent of all purchases in central London in the 12 months through September, according to broker Knight Frank.\n\nMr Osborne is under pressure to address the risk of a housing bubble in the UK after the International Monetary Fund and ministers including Business Secretary Vince Cable criticised his programme to support home ownership. Help to Buy allows people to purchase a property costing as much as \u00a3600,000 (S$1.2 million) with a down payment of as little as 5 per cent.\n\nA tax on foreign-owned property \"is definitely a political move, as polls in the past suggest this would garner huge support\", said Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics and a former Treasury official. The price increases seen in some parts of London mean \"some buyers may be viewing this as a market that's overheating\".\n\nThe British Property Federation said imposing such a tax may damage economic growth because penalising people who want to invest in Britain may slow the number of homes being built.\n\nMr Osborne raised a homebuying tax to 7 per cent from 5 per cent for properties priced above \u00a32 million in March 2012. He refused to comment when asked in a BBC interview last week whether he was considering a new sales tax on foreign homeowners.\n\n\"I'm not going to comment on specific tax affairs - it's not a leak that comes from anyone near me,\" he said. \"The only reason I don't want to deny it is because I don't want to then get into a whole list of other things you are going to ask me about.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Revenue slipped 37 per cent to US$13.6 million.\n\nProduction in the quarter fell from 3,363 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to 1,979 boepd. This was compounded by lower average realised gas prices of US$6.01 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), down from US$6.28 per mcf in the previous quarter.\n\nThe fall in production was mainly due to unplanned disruptions in its B8/32 and B9A oil and gas fields in Thailand, while bad weather conditions slowed repairs and maintenance, the firm said.\n\nIts Kambuna gas-condensate field in Indonesia also ended production in July as expected.\n\nTyphoons in offshore northern Vietnam affected KrisEnergy's drilling activity in the Cua Lo-1 exploration well in Block 105 as well. Drilling has taken longer than the expected 42 days due to the bad weather, it said. \"We're making good progress, but we're also facing frustrations, mainly from mother nature,\" said KrisEnergy CEO Keith Cameron in a results briefing. \"While this is frustrating, we recognise all operators must take necessary safety precautions.\"\n\nWhile typhoon activity in the region is still ongoing, the firm does not expect its Q4 results to be affected because of the recent installation of a new production platform in the B8/32 field in Thailand that has brought production back to usual levels.\n\nIn addition, gas production at the onshore Bangora field in Bangladesh - in which KrisEnergy will hold a 30 per cent working interest through the acquisition of Tullow Bangladesh Limited - increased from 85 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) to 110 mmcfd after the completion of workovers at two development wells.\n\nThe acquisition \"continues to proceed through the government channels for approval\", Kris Energy said.\n\nThe group is also looking to add to its portfolio, and has bids in place for \"more than a dozen\" blocks, said director of business development Richard Lorentz.\n\nThe counter ended half a cent lower at $1.265 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Apart from making more money or climbing the career ladder, finding extra pockets of free time is the major obsession of professionals caught up in the dizzying cycle of work, children, elderly parent care, and chores. But where there's a need, there's a business opportunity, hence a slew of services have sprouted up to help cash-rich but time-poor urbanites get more bang out of their precious 24 hours a day.\n\nWhile major supermarkets already offer online shopping services, independent online grocers have sprouted up to save their customers the hassle of waiting in line. Redmart, for example, is one such site that has seen business grow since they started two years ago. It is helmed by Roger Egan and Vikram Rupani who started it two years ago, and who \"had both lived in New York and frequently used online grocery services,\" says Todd Kurie, RedMart's vice-president for marketing. \"They were surprised to see that online grocery shopping was not yet popular here, especially given how busy professionals are.\"\n\nSome 85 per cent of their clients are between the ages of 25 and 45, and 70 per cent are married with children. \"Using these figures, we believe that at least 60 per cent of our customers fall into the 'busy executive' category,\" says Mr Kurie.\n\nHe adds that RedMart works for busy folks who \"would rather spend time and effort on their work, family, or hobby, than to spend it shopping for groceries\". Its customer base is now \"in the tens of thousands and we have repeat customers, with the average customer ordering $130 worth of goods every three weeks.\"\n\nAnother one cashing in on this market is Christopher Tan, managing director of Reservation Commerce, a consumer web company that provides reservation services. Earlier this year, the company launched tabadoctor.com, a website that allows consumers to make instant appointments with medical specialists, ask health related questions of a panel of doctors, and get access to health articles.\n\nSince it started in January, over 500 doctors have signed up with the website, and the site gets 50,000 page views monthly. Last month, the company launched a second similar portal called tabasalon.com, where consumers can make instant appointments with over 100 salons that offer beauty services from hair to nail and bodycare, including popular ones such as Shunji Matsuo and Toni & Guy. \"Tabadoctor.com has been so successful, we decided to expand our services,\" says Mr Tan. To make it ever more hassle free for consumers, a single password is all that is needed to access both portals.\n\nMr Tan has plans to include more services in his portfolio. \"We want to make the lives of consumers easier, and there are still plenty of areas to cover.\"\n\nAnd as more like-minded entrepreneurs catch on, the business of saving time may well have an unlimited upside. BT Lifestyle looks at some of them.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nSuper Body Super Brain\n\nSO you walk into a room and suddenly forget why you are there. You're always misplacing your smartphone, have trouble staying alert and have problems concentrating. Chalk it up to a lack of sleep, stress or old age, but popping gingko nuts and coffee is not the long-term solution.\n\nExercise has been proven to slow down the degeneration of the brain, but who has the time or inclination to spare even half an hour at the gym?\n\nEnter James Tang, director of Brainy Moves, who says that you just need 10 minutes of exercise each day to build up your brain function, and keep fit at the same time. He practises the Super Body Super Brain programme: \"A quick and effective programme that is suited for the busy working crowd, who will find themselves performing better at work.\"\n\nA former PE teacher, Mr Tang is the Asian representative for Super Body Super Brain, the mind-body exercise programme that incorporates fitness with neuroscience which was started by New York-based fitness trainer Michael Gonzalez-Wallace.\n\nWhen he was still a PE teacher, Mr Tang noticed that many of his students lacked focus, mental resilience and multitasking abilities. \"These are all examples of brain inefficiency,\" he says. His study of research papers and articles on the Internet eventually led him to Super Body Super Brain. In August, he flew to New York to meet Mr Gonzalez-Wallace and trained under him. Super Body Super Brain is a series of low-impact exercises comprising complex moves, fun activities and sensory training to enhance the body and brain.\n\n\"I was sceptical as to whether this exercise programme would work, but it piqued my interest,\" says Mr Tang. \"It also helped that the exercise programme is endorsed by neuroscientists and medical professionals.\"\n\nMr Tang adds that a 10-minute workout every day is sufficient, although he usually trains clients for an hour. He charges $80 per hour for individual clients, or $35 per hour for groups of five. To make it easier for clients, he travels to the venue of their choice. Little equipment is required, and the programme is suitable for people of all ages.\n\n\"The programme is customisable to suit different levels of psychomotor skills and health conditions,\" says Mr Tang. \"You don't need to be sporty or skilled to participate.\" There are a series of exercises to be done, such as squats on tip-toes together with bicep curls or arm raises. Apart from strengthening the biceps and abdominal muscles, you improve on balance, which trains specific sections of the brain that help improve reading capacity. \"The exercises for each session are always different to keep the mind mentally engaged,\" says Mr Tang. He also does pre- and post-assessments with clients to see if the programme has been effective.\n\nMr Tang says that clients are expected to see an improvement in memory, increased level of alertness and less fatigue, and the ability to multitask better. Since going on the programme, Mr Tang finds himself \"drinking a lot less coffee to stay alert\".\n\nHe is in the midst of building up the business, and also has received enquiries from interested parties. He is working with two secondary schools to start the programme, and hopes to work with companies as well.\n\n\"We will all grow old, but if there are exercises that can slow down the rate of our minds degenerating while getting a fitter body at the same time, why not do them?\" he advises.\n\nWhen it takes just 10 minutes, it's harder to make the excuse that one has no time.\n\nJublia Match\n\nNETWORKING is always the way to go when it comes to making new contacts - the trick is in how to filter the process such that you only meet the kind of people you want?\n\nJublia Match, a web-based application, aims to make networking more efficient. It works like a matchmaking service but instead of a potential life partner, you could be meeting someone ready to do a million-dollar deal.\n\nThe application is the brainchild of three NUS students, Errol Lim, Chinab Chugh and Tan Kuan Yan, who met in Stockholm while completing a one-year internship programme.\n\nAs part of their internship, they attended business and startup conferences in Europe. \"We found that there was a wealth of business opportunities and leads within the network of attending delegates. However there was no way of knowing who the relevant person was that we could talk to,\" says Mr Lim. \"With the limited time you have to network, it is almost impossible to fully secure quality meetings at the event.\"\n\nThe trio worked to create a system that curates the list of delegates based on a person's networking needs, and also schedule speed meetings effortlessly and automatically.\n\nHere's how it works: a networking invitation is sent to delegates of an event. Delegates use Match to view, make and accept meetings from a curated list of delegates that is presented based on the type of people that they would like to network with. They indicate their time availability at the event and submit their choices.\n\nJublia Match then schedules meetings for the different delegates based on their choices and their available time slot. A meeting schedule will be sent to each delegate a day before the event. At the event, delegates turn up at the agreed place and time.\n\nThe company has been receiving positive feedback from delegates who use their service. \"The best compliment is when a delegate tells us, 'I know that someone is keen to meet me, in this way, you did your job well',\" says Mr Lim. Jublia Match is a free application for delegates, while event organisers who use the service pay US$2.19 for each delegate they want to reach out to. The service started in May this year, and since then the company has worked with 13 events of various profiles in cities like Stockholm, London, New York, Kuala Lumpur, Slovenia, and Singapore. To date, they have helped about 4,000 delegates make meaningful connections at events.\n\nThe name Jublia, comes from the Swedish word \"jubla\", meaning jubilant in English. \"We thought how appropriate the word was given since it describes the feeling you get when you make a meaningful match with someone else,\" says Mr Lim. Since the founders are all male, they decided to add a feminine touch to the company name by turning jubla into Jublia.\n\nMr Lim predicts Jublia Match will be a runaway hit with busy folks. \"Jublia Match makes it ridiculously easy for them to capture the networking value at an event. It's a smarter way to network and helps our users get a good return on investment from the time and money spent attending such an event.\"\n\nMothernist\n\nSELF-HELP sites for working women are a dime a dozen, but Mothernist cuts through all the long-winded caring and sharing rhetoric with a goal-oriented approach to improving the emotional well-being of the burnt out modern female.\n\nDespite its name, Mothernist is not just for mothers. \"The name is a combination of mother and modern women, to reach out to those aged 25 to 45,\" says founder Julie Goldstein, a Belgian psychologist who moved to Singapore from London eight months ago.\n\nShe started the site in September, to \"raise awareness around psychological issues in Asia\".\n\nHer focus is on mental health and well-being which are often neglected when caught up in the hustle and bustle of modern living. \"Tiredness, not having a clear sense of purpose, feeling overwhelmed and anxiety attacks are all examples of mental health issues,\" she says.\n\nTargeted at women from 25 to 45, it offers tips and advice on eating well, the importance of taking personal time out, and how to cope with mood swings during pregnancy, among other issues.\n\nBut rather than have endless articles to scroll through, Dr Goldstein puts these tips across in the form of videos, to make it more appealing to time-strapped women.\n\n\"When you watch a video, you're not just listening to what the presenter says. But you observe the body language which is very visual, and which conveys the message more effectively than the written word,\" she says. Each video, sourced from external content providers, is between two and five minutes long.\n\n\"The videos are non-preachy and get the message across quickly,\" she adds. There are articles on the website, but a majority of the information is put across through concise video clips.\n\nAnother handy tool that she has on the website, is a link-up with talktala, an online platform for group therapy, based in the United States.\n\nAt any time of the day, users can go online to talk to a certified therapist. Sharing problems on a therapist-led forum is free, but there is a fee to pay for a personal chat with a therapist.\n\n\"The service is good for people who are not able to take time off or may feel shy about stepping forward to meet a therapist,\" says Dr Goldstein, who also runs an online therapy practice.\n\nShe hopes that in the Asian context where certain social stigmas in relation to mental health prevail, the website will offer another avenue and tool for women to deal with the pressures of a complex multi-tasking lifestyle.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The non-cumulative non-convertible non-voting class N preference shares have a payout of 4.7 per cent.\n\nThe reason for the bank's action is that the new shares will be Basel III compliant and qualify as Tier 1 capital.\n\nDBS said that \"the fact that the existing preference shares no longer fully qualify as Tier I capital of DBS Bank constitutes a preference share change of qualification event\" under the Basel III capital adequacy requirements implemented by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Jan 1, 2013.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, DBS said that it was \"proposing to accept tenders amounting to $800,000,000 in liquidation preference of existing preference shares, or a lower or greater aggregate amount at (its) discretion\".\n\nHolders who wish to participate must do so by 5pm Singapore time on Nov 21, 2013.\n\nThe tender does not apply to the retail tranche issued also in 2010 - an $800 million 4.7 per cent non-cumulative non-convertible non-voting class O preference shares callable in November 2020.\n\n\"We are starting with the institutional tranche - to see market reaction,\" said a bank spokesman.\n\nIf the response is \"overwhelming\", a bigger issue of the new notes could be considered, said Clifford Lee, DBS Bank head of fixed income.\n\nThe 4.7-4.9 per cent payout and shorter tenor of the new preference shares are seen as \"investor friendly\" and attractive relative to a recent perpetual issue by United Overseas Bank (UOB).\n\nIn July, UOB sold $850 million of perpetual notes paying 4.9 per cent that were Basel III compliant. Yesterday, the notes were quoted at $102.35-$102.85, yielding 4.335-4.219 per cent.\n\n\"Instead of a price nearer to 4.2 per cent, they're (DBS) paying 4.7-4.9,\" said a banking source.\n\nStill, some investors sold off the existing DBS preference shares after the announcement, causing prices to fall to $100.51-$101.398 from $102.52 on Wednesday. They could be only looking at the exchange at par, and not the coupon of the new bonds, suggested the source.\n\nSaid Gary Dugan, Coutts chief investment officer for Asia and Middle East: \"Anything (bank perpetuals) above 4 per cent is attractive.\"\n\nInterest rates are likely to remain low for the next 2-3 years and perpetuals still remain very attractive, he added.\n\nUnder MAS Notice 637, effective on Jan 1, 2013, Tier 1 securities have a point of non-viability (PONV) loss-absorbing feature. What this means is that investors or debt-holders will have to face a partial principal writedown or conversion into common equity when the PONV is being triggered by MAS. The PONV is triggered when MAS decides that a bank is no longer viable, or when public-sector support is required.\n\nSeparately, a UOB spokeswoman said that the bank would not comment on future capital management plans, when asked if it might consider similar exchanges for its non-Basel compliant preference shares.\n\nAt OCBC Bank, Ang Suat Ching, its head of funding and capital management, said that \"while our existing preference shares are not Basel III compliant, they will continue to qualify substantially as additional Tier 1 capital over the next few years under MAS's transitional Basel III rules\".\n\n\"Our Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio as at end-September was 14.3 per cent, a level that we are comfortable with. We continuously assess our capital and financial requirements, as well as market conditions, in determining any early redemption or new issuances of capital instruments.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But the recent influx of foreign tycoons here, plus younger buyers, has spiced this up with purchases of two-door Continental coupes and convertibles in bolder \"burned orange, St James red and Silverlake (a bluish-silver)\" finishes.\n\nYounger, below-40 buyers accounted for 15 per cent of the 110 Bentleys sold here in the first nine months of this year, with those aged 40 and above (including middle-aged businessmen) making up the remainder. The luxury marque has seen a steady sales creep - from 49 units sold in 2010, to 60 in 2011 and 93 cars last year.\n\nThe relatively subtle colour schemes preferred here are generally reflective of the South-east Asian market, Robin Peel, Bentley's head of marketing and communications for the Asia-Pacific, told BT.\n\n\"Our Middle Eastern customers are more adventurous,\" he said, preferring bright blues, sunburst oranges and reds and yellows - recounting a Saudi princess who ordered a Mulsanne in bright metallic \"sequin blue\" to match a dress for a special function.\n\nWhile Bentley has also come up with customised colours such as \"dragon red and pearl pink\" for young, rich Chinese female buyers, it however, draws a line at the outrageous, with Mr Peel saying that the company tries to politely steer customers away from such requests.\n\nColour preferences are just one aspect of the bespoke details to which Bentley pays careful attention.\n\nOver and above the precision and zero tolerance on its assembly lines, what becomes evident during a visit to the British marque's plant in Crewe, Cheshire, is its great pride in tradition and craftsmanship, not to mention luxe materials like the best leathers and wood, that go into its cars.\n\nAt its leather stitching section for example, various patterns for the head-rest of seats are on display, with these ranging from subtle variations of the Bentley logo to other options such as a red Chinese dragon, or a green palm tree framed by two khanjars (curved Arab daggers).\n\nAsked whether the shift in spending power from the West to the East has led to changes in customer preferences, Mr Peel's response was: \"While the dollars may have moved, many Chinese customers for example, don't want a made-for-China car per se but one that is Western and global as they think globally. China has a lot of customers who have a bizarre respect for British things, like the royal family.\" And Bentleys too, apparently.\n\nPaul Jones, Bentley's head of product management, and in charge of product planning and strategy, stressed that \"customer feedback will very much influence development of the group's next product - whether a new model or next generation of products\".\n\n\"While our two-door coupes and convertibles were mainly the preserve of Western markets, the big drivers for the coming SUV was for instance its truly global market,\" he said. The off-road technology for the SUV will be drawn from the VW Group, which owns Bentley, which is a great advantage, he added.\n\nMr Jones said that in Bentley's case, \"one of its great strengths is its breadth\", adding: \"For example in 2003, what other brand can, on one hand, win the Le Mans - the most prestigious 24-hour sports car race - and also deliver a limousine to the Queen for her Golden Jubilee, and do both credibly. So Bentley has incredible breadth in luxury and performance.\"\n\nOn the \"green\" front, the group - which kicked off its environmental programme in 2008 - has developed new engines including a high-performance four-litre V-8 which has helped to cut carbon emissions by some 40 per cent. \"Here, we have made great steps forward without much trade-off in performance,\" said Mr Jones.\n\nWill an electric Bentley be next on the cards then?\n\n\"A plug-in hybrid has much to recommend it. It is high-torque, quiet and refined, so we are looking seriously at it,\" he said, adding that Bentley can again access this technology in the VW group, which is already offering a number of \"plug-ins\" including those in the Porsche Panamera.\n\nBut diesel-powered Bentleys are a big no-no, said Mike Sayer, the group's communications manager for product and motorsports, as customers, when surveyed, gave a resounding thumbs down to this as they want only petrol-powered cars.\n\nReviving its heritage, Bentley is about to go racing again soon in the GT-3 series in Europe, and will conduct its first \"test\" race in Abu Dhabi on Dec 13. The marque sees racing as a means to improve the road car technologically, and at the same time, boost car sales.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But first, a little vamping up.\n\nFor their first overseas venture, the people behind Pind Balluchi, a 24-outlet chain of casual eateries from India knew that plainly replicating their existing concept wouldn't cut it in the Singapore context.\n\nSo instead of the rustic Punjab fare they are known for, its 130-seat Singapore outpost in Clarke Quay is an upscale bar and grill that features swish interiors and a range of international cocktails to lure locals, expatriates and tourists alike.\n\nBut the restaurant hasn't totally abandoned its roots. According to head chef Nishesh Mani Tripathi, who has worked at the Leela and Claridges Hotels in India, everything is prepped in strict accordance to age-old methods.\n\nThe pathar lamb kebab ($26) , for instance, is pounded by hand as ancient recipes decree, and dusted with dagadh phool or stone flower - a rare type of algae that is found naturally growing on stone in the Hyderabad region of India. The meat is infused with an earthy aroma as it cooks over a charcoal heated granite stone.\n\nThe galouti kebab ($28) - legend says it was created to appease a toothless Nawab king - is minced 32 times and infused with 136 spices, the same way chefs used to do it in the royal kitchens, chef Tripathi claims. He gleaned the recipe from top Indian chef and fellow Lucknow native, Imtiaz Qureshi whom he had worked with previously. The aromatic, griddle-seared discs of lamb meat have a texture that's a cross between a rillette and a slab of foie gras.\n\nTo veer away from the stereotype of Indian food as heavy curries and butter-laden briyanis, grilled tandoori items take centrestage at Pind Balluchi, and quick lunch sets for the weekday office crowd are in the works. Most items are also currently available in bite-sized portions off Pind Balluchi's bar menu.\n\nIf all goes well, chef Tripathi says the group - owned by parent company F&B Asia, which also owns Harry's Holdings here - hopes to open two to three more outlets of Pind Balluchi in Singapore, with each one varying slightly in concept. Regional expansion will be rolled out once local operations have stabilised.\n\n\"We might do an open kitchen concept where diners can sit counter-side and watch the chef prepare their food, a fusion restaurant or an Indian tapas bar eventually,\" chef Tripathi teases.\n\n\"We'll take care of this place first then see what's next.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue rose 76 per cent to $76.7 million.\n\nRevenue from property development more than doubled to $64.1 million in Q3 2013 from $30 million in Q3 2012. However, revenue from hotel ownership - the group owns Grande Mercure Roxy Hotel in Marine Parade - slipped 7 per cent to $12.2 million amid the highly competitive Singapore hotel market.\n\nProperty investment revenue dipped to around $390,000 in Q3 2013 from about $420,000 in Q3 2012, due mainly to the expiry of lease terms for some shop units in Roxy Square.\n\nShare of profits from associates leapt to $2.7 million from about $700,000, chiefly on the back of profit recognition from jointventure projects Natura@Hillview, Eon Shenton, Haig 162 and Notinghill Suites in the July-September 2013 period.\n\n\"With balanced progress billings of $1.1 billion (more than 16 times the property development revenue recognised in Q3 2013); cash and cash equivalents amounting to $346.8 million as of Sept 30, 2013; and net debt to adjusted net asset value of 0.66 time, the group continues to be well positioned on seizing opportunities, whether in Singapore or overseas markets,\" said Teo Hong Lim, executive chairman and CEO of Roxy-Pacific.\n\nEarlier this year, the group began venturing overseas, acquiring a site in Kuala Lumpur through a joint venture. The site's attributable gross floor area of 328,397 sq ft is more than half of its current landbank of 500,103 sq ft.\n\nEarnings per share increased from 0.69 cent in Q3 2012 to 1.35 cents in Q3 2013. Net asset value per share stood at 23.86 cents at end-September 2013, up from 21.25 cents at end-December 2012. The counter closed unchanged yesterday at 60 cents. Roxy released its results after the stock market closed.\n\nIn the first nine months, the group's net profit rose 36 per cent to $47.4 million from nearly $35 million in the same period last year.

And notwithstanding doomsayers' predictions, don't expect a current account deficit on the country's balance of payments anytime soon.\n\nDespite its acknowledgement that inflation is slowly rising, Bank Negara Malaysia left the overnight policy rate at 3 per cent at its meeting on Thursday. It clearly signalled that governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz was wary of doing anything that could pose a downside risk to growth.\n\n\"Looking ahead, inflation is expected to edge up, driven by domestic cost factors,\" the central bank said in a statement. However, it added that the inflation outlook would be tempered by various factors, including a stable external price environment and moderate domestic demand pressures.\n\nWhy did it not raise rates? The central bank was almost explicit: There were \"uncertainties in the balance of risks surrounding the outlook for domestic growth and inflation\".\n\nMs Zeti clearly knew that growth would continue to be subdued. Others agree with that assessment.\n\n\"We are forecasting third-quarter gross domestic product to remain sluggish, improving slightly to 4.4 per cent from 4.3 in the second quarter,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin in a recent report.\n\nMr Chua's full-year forecast for 2013 is 4.3 per cent, and he expects 2014 to fare better with at least 4.8 per cent. Both forecasts, however, are below government projections.\n\nInflation is rising as a result of an oil price hike in September. Indeed, prices rose 2.6 per cent during the month, driven by increases in transport and food prices.\n\nWhile the full-year inflation number is expected to be around 2 per cent, Mr Chua thinks that 2014 could see inflation topping 3 per cent largely because of an expected fuel price hike later in the year.\n\nMr Chua also thinks that electricity tariffs could be raised next year. These suppositions are based on the fact that Prime Minister Najib Razak had promised to cut subsidies by 15 per cent in his recent budget.\n\nFor these reasons, both Merrill Lynch and Barclays Bank expect interest rates to be hiked by at least 25 basis points next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysia's trade data for September surpassed analysts' expectations. Exports rose 5.6 per cent year on year compared with the street's 5 per cent forecast. Imports grew 2.8 per cent compared to the market's consensus of 5.4 per cent.\n\nAs a result, the trade surplus clocked in at RM8.7 billion (S$3.4 billion), the largest in more than 10 months.\n\nThe improvement in exports stemmed from gains in both mining and manufacturing, with exports to the region and China improving slightly.\n\nThe import drop was mainly because of a decline in capital goods' imports, which fell by 2.3 per cent year on year largely due to an already high base.\n\nThe strengthening trade balance should allay concerns among economists about Malaysia's rapidly shrinking surplus on the current account of its balance of payments. The speed of its decline had raised fears that the country could once again post twin deficits as it did in 1998.\n\nThe currencies of India and Indonesia have been attacked following just such a phenomenon.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

For the longest time in Singapore, the criticism has been that the former hasn't kept up with the latter.\n\nThe newly established Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) at Nanyang Technological University aims to redress that. Housed at Blocks 7, 37, 38 and 43 at Gillman Barracks, the centre will present contemporary art, host a research centre in collaboration with NTU's School of Art, Design & Media, and also host a residency and fellowship programme for artists and cultural producers from all over the globe.\n\n\"The CCA was envisaged as a platform for dialogue between research in the arts and the impact of globalisation on the art world,\" says Professor Ute Meta Bauer, founding director of the CCA at NTU's School of Art, Media and Design.\n\nThe CCA also hopes to serve as a hub for the arts in the South-east Asian region - that connects the local with the wider region and beyond. The CCA is developed as a research centre, supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, with the aim to stimulate cross-disciplinary exchanges.\n\n\"The CCA's main areas of activity will be research, exhibitions and residencies, and its mandate is to engage deeper and to cultivate a culture of research in the field,\" explains Ms Bauer, who was appointed following a global search by NTU.\n\nShe notes how the art world in South-east Asia is ambivalent. \"On the one hand, it is highly professionalised, and on the other, it lacks basic infrastructure depending on what country or region we talk about.\"\n\nMs Bauer most recently served as Dean of the School of Fine Arts with London's Royal College of Art.\n\nPrior to that, she was at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, where she was an associate professor for Visual Art in the School of Architecture and Planning. She was also the founding director of the Programme in Art, Culture, and Technology, as well as director of the MIT Visual Arts Programme.\n\nIn Asia, Ms Bauer was last year's co-director with Hou Hanru of the World Biennial Forum Number 1 - Shifting Gravity, a conference organised by Gwangju Biennale Foundation and the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations in Gwangju, South Korea, with a focus on biennial phenomena in various Asian regions.\n\nHaving worked for over 25 years in the contemporary arts field, Ms Bauer notes that it's always been crucial for her to connect practice and theory, artistic production and its dissemination.\n\n\"This approach will form the core of CCA's activities where intellectual endeavour feeds back into exhibition and public programmes, and vice versa.\" It's also open to exploring lesser known areas such as trans-disciplinary collaborations, while \"architecture and the future of cities, art and society, art and social change, will also be addressed, but through collaborations with various art centres in South-east Asia,\" highlights Ms Bauer.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nGUARD your wallets. With just over a month to go before Christmas, a rash of new boutiques are hanging up the holly as the plaster dries in their swank locations - just in time to catch the all-important festive shopping season.\n\nIf the opening of at least five fashion boutiques this month is any indication, it seems our little red dot has become quite the magnet for ambitious retailers seeking global domination. Swedish high street retailer COS, for one, will be unveiling its first outlet at Ion Orchard next Friday, while other brands like Roger Vivier, Valextra and Kate Spade Saturday have also just opened their first boutiques here recently. American designer Tom Ford will also make his debut at Marina Bay Sands early next year, while French luxury leather brand Goyard will unveil its Takashimaya Shopping Centre boutique later this month.\n\nAnd many shoppers here would be already be familiar with the latest entrants into the retail fray, many of which are established marques in Europe or the US. It is precisely this level of brand awareness by homegrown shoppers, many of whom are frequent travellers or online shoppers, that has attracted fashion companies looking to expand abroad.\n\n\"Singapore is a more established market in the region, yet strategic in the luxury arena with a very dynamic and international clientele that seeks sophisticated and high quality products,\" says Marco Franchini, CEO of Italian leather accessories brand Valextra, which just launched its first Southeast-Asian store at Paragon yesterday.\n\nThe opening of COS, for example, has been highly anticipated by fans of the brand here, who have been getting their retail fix from the nearest outlets in Hong Kong. Known for its minimalist, trend-bucking pieces, the sister brand of Swedish fast fashion behemoth H&M has achieved cult status since its launch in 2007 in London. The brand will be opening its second outlet later in the year in the new Westgate mall in Jurong East.\n\n\"As a city Singapore is considered a premium shopping destination and there appears to be a demand for brands in the market,\" says Marie Honda, overall brand responsible for COS.\n\n\"We hope that the customers in Singapore will like what they find in store and appreciate what we think of as a high fashion aesthetic and great quality garments, offered at a comparably affordable price.\"\n\nWhile budget battles in Washington may have affected spending in the US and Europe is still racked by economic uncertainty, retailers are confident that consumers here will keep cash registers ringing, even if shoppers here are inundated by a deluge of new brands.\n\n\"A market that is competitive is also vibrant, and we believe there is demand for unique product offerings,\" says executive director of the Valiram Group, Mukesh Valiram. The Valiram Group opened lifestyle concept boutique Kate Spade Saturday at Ion Orchard in October, just a month after the US brand launched the first store for this new concept in Los Angeles. A younger, more casual offshoot of parent company Kate Spade New York, the store prides itself on a constant rotation of new offerings, and accompanies an online store to tap on the e-commerce boom.\n\nIn fact, the convenience and vast variety associated with online shopping questions the need for retailers to expand their brick-and-mortar operations in our relatively small market.\n\nAs avid shopper Dr Jade Kua, a specialist in pediatric emergency medicine, says, \"To be honest, most of us are global shoppers and the net-savvy ones can even buy these brands from their armchair, so I don't see this entrance of new stores changing anybody's behaviour as a shopper.\"\n\nFor other shoppers like entrepreneur Jia Min Huang, a bank executive and frequent traveller who bought a Goyard bag last July in Paris, the experience of shopping at a brand's international flagship holds plenty of insider style cachet; not to mention the more attractive price points at the country of origin.\n\n\"The service in Paris was impeccable even though I was interested in just one bag,\" says Ms Huang. \"But I will certainly be interested if the new stores here stock special-edition pieces. Also, it's a plus if I could place an order for a colour that I want that may be out of stock, or make use of a personalisation service, which would not be an option when shopping overseas because my order would not be ready in time for my departure.\"\n\nBeing able to buy products from a brand that is unavailable here also ups its exclusivity factor, given the assumption that it takes a certain knowledge of global fashion trends to gain awareness of such labels.\n\n\"It used to be a novelty when one can only purchase Goyard in Paris, and everyone wanted to get their hands on a Goyard,\" remarks Marie Choo, director of her own public relations and marketing agency. \"With accessibility to such labels here, serious fashionistas will have to up their ante and move on to the next big brand before it gets mainstream.\n\n\"I have gotten my Goyard fix some years back and now I have moved on to Moynat. I have even asked a friend to hand carry a Moynat tote bag for me all the way from Paris, since it is the only city where the brand is.\"\n\nWhen asked, however, if fans who have gotten their brand fix overseas for years may be blase, now that the label is finally available here, Sabine Brunner, brand manager of French shoes and accessories label Roger Vivier, is far from bothered. The fashion house opened its first South-east Asian boutique at Takashimaya Shopping Centre last week.\n\n\"Roger Vivier is not a fashion brand,\" quips Ms Brunner, whose company's products are worn by celebrities like Cate Blanchett and Carla Bruni. \"The new customers will go for a buckle shoe or bag; the fashionistas will go for newer creations such as the comma heel or the Prismick bags. The market for unique luxury accessories like those by Roger Vivier is not saturated. At the end of the day, there are very few brands that can combine elegance, modernity, quality and selective distribution.\"\n\nIndeed, one devotee to the brand has long been anticipating the opening of a store here to boost her collection of Roger Vivier shoes. \"I first heard about Roger Vivier from my mum,\" says Cindy Tay, who owns 10 pairs of Roger Vivier shoes. \"I believe he used to design for Dior and she had a pair of shoes designed by him. And I first got my own pair of Vivier shoes from Bergdorf Goodman some years back. It was a pair of shocking pink sandals with his signature bejewelled covered buckle. I still love wearing them today.\"\n\nWhile it remains to be seen whether these new brands will make it in our competitive retail landscape, one thing's for sure, true shopaholics will have little reason to complain when it comes to the sheer variety of labels available just a cab ride away.\n\n\"I have always liked Tom Ford since his Gucci days and used to only be able to buy from his namesake label when I am overseas, so it is nice to know that it will soon be available in Singapore,\" says Ms Choo. \"It is exciting to see big names coming to Singapore. It simply means the fashion industry is now seeing Singapore as an important market on a global scale.\"\n\nThe hit list\n\nTired of the same old labels? Check out these must-visit stores to amp up your wardrobes - and Christmas wish list.\n\n1 COS\n\n#03-23 Ion Orchard\n\nAn acronym for 'collection of style', COS is the sleeker, more high-fashion offspring of H&M. Load up with on-the-cusp silhouettes and streamlined staples typical of Swedish design aesthetics when the store opens on Nov 15.\n\n2 Roger Vivier\n\n#02-12F Takashimaya Shopping Centre\n\nNew to this shoes and accessories house? Then try on its iconic Pilgrim pumps, the silver-buckled design made famous by Catherine Deneueve in the seminal film Belle de Jour.\n\n3 Goyard\n\nTakashimaya Shopping Centre\n\nWhen its doors swing open later this month, make a beeline for one of the house's luxe trunks. After all, Goyard was founded in 1792 as a maker of boxes and trunks. You could even order a special trunk for storing champagnes, tea or even a bicycle.\n\n4 Kate Spade Saturday\n\n#B1-27 Ion Orchard\n\nLazy shoppers, get savvy and conduct your Christmas shopping in this one store. It's brimming with plenty of small leather goods and other gift options, ranging from jewellery to umbrellas and parkas for a pooch, all covered in the brand's fun colours and prints.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/opinion-features/columns/indonesia-must-head-industrial-unrest", "site_title": "Indonesia must head off industrial unrest", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nIndonesia must head off industrial unrest\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 7, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nABOUT two million workers across Indonesia were to have gone on strike last week to demand the government increase their wages by 50 per cent. It was intended that workers would down tools across 22 provinces and the action would be extended if the government did not respond to their demands. The call for the strike action by the Confederation of Indonesian Workers Union failed to draw millions. Several thousand workers did, however, go on strike. There were some demonstrations on the streets of Jakarta and in neighbouring industrial estates.\n\nThe workers demanded a 3.7 million rupiah (S$410) monthly wage for 2014. The Indonesian Employers Association held that the workers' demand would be tantamount to a 50 per cent wage increase and warned that many foreign investors would relocate if the government accepted such a demand. Besides, the demand would not address the needs of those in the informal sector, where about 40 per cent of Indonesians work. Only seven million out of a population of 240 million are union members. A repeat of last year's 44 per cent wage rise could have jeopardised jobs, although it is true that inflation, which soared following a sharp rise in fuel prices in June, has eroded some of the workers' gains.\n\nAnother concern is that Indonesia's economic growth is slowing. The economy expanded 5.8 per cent in the second quarter - the first time since 2010 that the economy has failed to grow by at least 6 per cent. The country's trade account unexpectedly swung back to a deficit in September. The external deficit is expected to pile further pressure on the ailing rupiah, which plummeted earlier this year as investors fled on fears that the US Federal Reserve was set to \"taper\" its huge stimulus programme.\n\nSince then, the Fed has made it clear that it will continue with its full US$85 billion a month bond-buying programme for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the rupiah has not bounced back and has remained one of Asia's worst-performing currencies. The exchange rate slipped to 11,360 from 11,350 to the US dollar after the trade figures were released. The Indonesian central bank has forecast inflation rising to 9.8 per cent at the end of the year, and raised its benchmark interest rate by 1.5 percentage points in early June to 7.25 per cent to deal with price pressures as well as the weakening rupiah.\n\nIndonesia's Manpower and Transmigration Minister Muhaimin Iskandar has advised workers to consider their companies' ability to increase wages. But that would be difficult for a union to judge. Thus, it may be appropriate for Indonesia to explore the possibility of imposing a compulsory system of mediation and arbitration on both industrial workers and their employers. Industrial unrest serves no one; it will be bad for employers, and probably worse for workers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 8, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOVER the course of his career, Marc Sadler has received numerous letters and photos from strangers in hospital beds, thanking him for saving their lives. It's odd since the Frenchman is not a doctor, but an industrial designer.\n\n\"They thank me for designing the motorcycle back protector that saved their lives,\" he explains. \"I never thought I would be saving lives when I became a designer. That thought is so beautiful, much more than the shape of a lamp or a chair that I designed.\" His life-saving back protector for Dainese, the market leader for motorcycle apparel and accessories, is now in the permanent collection at New York's Museum of Modern Art.\n\nHe was in town recently to show his pieces for Italian lighting brand, Foscarini, such as the Twiggy and Tress lamps. Even though he has added lights and furniture into his repertoire, Sadler, 67, began his career as a sports designer.\n\nHe was in the first batch of industrial design graduates from the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, in Paris in 1968. \"It was such a great course, because it combined both industrial and aesthetics which I love,\" he says. But back then, no one knew about industrial design. \"It was difficult to be a designer then.\"\n\nHowever, it was three years later while recovering from a skiing accident which left him with a fractured right foot that Sadler hit upon his first successful product - a recyclable thermoplastic rubber ski boot that would reduce the risk of accidents by immobilizing the ankle.\n\nSoon, sports brands came calling, such as Adidas, Puma and Nike, which Sadler designed shoes for. His work for Nike included the first water-repellent thermo plastic rubber slipper that is still in production today, 20 years later.\n\nSince then, he has gone on to design for brands including kitchens for Boffi and Ernestomeda, furniture for Cassina, and Meritalia. Along the way, he has also put his mark on household appliances for Moulinex and Krups.\n\nIt seems that nothing is too difficult for him. He said yes to Italian brand Ifi when asked to design a gelato display case, despite never designing one before. The result is Bellevue, a sleek clear top fridge that allows consumers to see the hand-made gelato, but at the same time, keeps out condensation.\n\nAs with most of his other projects, Sadler makes it a point to visit the client's factory and even work alongside the staff.\n\n\"It helps me to better understand the market,\" he says. \"Being on the ground encourages an exchange of ideas, which I then develop or tune.\"\n\nHis role as a designer is to \"answer questions that companies who hire me have\", he says. \"But for consumers, the aim is to design a product that makes their life easier or better.\"\n\nAsk what makes him different from the many other designers, and he says it is his way of combining technology and art in his design. He cites the example of Twiggy, a standing lamp for Foscarini, which resembles a fishing rod with a lampshade at the end. Incidentally, it was while fishing that Sadler got the idea for the lamp.\n\nThe prototype for Twiggy \"had a cost problem. It was too expensive to manufacture, and no one would want to buy it,\" he says. There was also another technical problem - temperature fluctuations throughout the day would distort the curvature of the lamp.\n\n\"We had to work out ways to make sure that the curvature would stabilise, and we finally did it by using a system of counterweights,\" say Sadler. \"This took several years to achieve, and in the process also shaved off one-third of the production cost.\"\n\nBorn in Austria, he has lived and worked in Europe, North America and Asia. \"But I'm a French living in Italy today. When I'm in France, I tend to defend the Italians, as the French don't really understand what's happening in Italy, and vice versa,\" he says.\n\nHe agrees when it is suggested that the Italians are more into industrial design than the French are. \"The French see design as something you put into a company, and they use the designer the same way as they would with a production or warehouse personnel,\" he says. \"This is not my philosophy of design.\"\n\nThe Italians are different. \"Design is seen as a service, and the Italians don't hesitate to want the best designer for the best product. The French are not like this. That's why I have few French customers,\" he quips.\n\nFor Sadler, a successful product is one which may not come with a high price tag, but yet is very popular with consumers. \"Actually, it is more difficult to make an inexpensive product. Some pieces that I design for certain brands are very expensive, but they only sell a handful each year. I do not consider that good.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Bound by their love of food, the group found lacking a place where they could have traditional, fine Indian food and personalised service but in a non-conventional setting.\n\nModern veneers aside, however, flavours are as traditional as they can get at Earl of Hindh, Mr Sethi disclaims.\n\nNew Delhi-born head chef Jaswant Singh Negi is a recent import from India, where he has worked with luxury hotel chains in India such as the Taj, Radisson and Ambassador group of hotels. He most recently helped to open Punjab Grill in New Delhi.\n\nIn keeping with the restaurant's name, the menu is a throwback to the Indian cuisine during the British reign, when Indian maharajas hosted some of the most lavish feasts showcasing exotic dishes, according to Mr Sethi. He elaborates: \"The art of fine Indian cooking has disappeared over the years and one of the aims of Earl of Hindh is to revive the aromas, flavours and art of royal cooking.\"\n\nThe grilled starters - cooked in two openly displayed tandoori ovens - are the restaurant's main highlights. The signature Earl of Hindh Kakori ($44) is a must-try: the melt-in-your-mouth kebab of finely minced lamb is marinated with 26 spices and chargrilled on a skewer along with a sprinkle of saffron, while the murgh malai kabab ($28) has chunks of tandoor-grilled boneless chicken thigh sheathed in creamy cheese sauce.\n\nAlso very tasty is the desi hara kebab ($22), or delightfully fluffy pancakes made of spinach and chan dal and stuffed with cottage cheese before being panfried. From the range of curries, the kadhai paneer ($21) stands out for its blend of cottage cheese cubes, tomatoes, onion and bell pepper, while the maa ki dal makhanwali ($18) is a melange of black lentils, kidney beans and tomato sauce.\n\nLooking for more international flavour? Dishes such as the dariyai tikka ($32) features yoghurt-marinated cubes of salmon chargrilled in the tandoor, or the khumb makai pala ($18) which combines button mushrooms, American corn and spinach in a curry being a refreshing, cosmopolitan lift to the menu.\n\nClassic desserts such as the Jamun-e-Gulab ($16) get a new look too. They come served on a stick rather than in a bowl of rose-scented sugar syrup, because \"usually no one drinks the syrup anyway\" says chef Negi. The Aam Tukda ($17) is a plated popsicle of frozen mango and milk puree.\n\nThe restaurant additionally carries over 18 types of premium single malt whisky, predominantly in single cask, cask strength and non-chill filtered editions and mostly from Scotland, with a handful of labels from leading Indian distillery Amrut being the exception.\n\nOn the blueprint are whisky and Indian food pairing dinners conducted by whisky experts in partnership with alcohol distributor Whisky World Singapore,\n\nAnd though the restaurant is just over three months old, the five partners hint that they are already working on a second concept.

That was because Fan hardly sold his paintings commercially, choosing to donate most of them to charity. So his works rarely come up in art auctions or other art markets. He also had one patron who collected most of his works.\n\n\"Because he came from a wealthy background, he didn't have to sell his works for a living,\" explains Ms Liu. But he was passionate about painting, and taught and mentored a generation of Chinese ink artists in Singapore - many of whom remember him fondly.\n\nMs Liu, 23, decided to hold an exhibition of Fan's works after interviewing a number of Fan's former students. This is her second exhibition after she opened her own gallery, Asia Art Collective, earlier in July.\n\nMs Liu first learnt about the Chinese ink artist as a teacher - of acclaimed artists such as the late Chua Ek Kay and Chen Kezhan. His other well-regarded students include Ling Cher Eng, Lim Kay Hiong, Nai Swee Leng, Tan Oe Pang and Lee Soo Chee.\n\n\"I was curious to learn more about him,\" she shares. \"I always like talking to older Singaporean artists and hearing their stories because of their commitment and dedication to art.\" Ms Liu father is the acclaimed Chinese ink artist Liu Guo, who made Singapore his home in 1996, following an invitation from the Singapore government.\n\n\"Fan's students like Lee Soo Chee, Nai Swee Leng, Lim Kay Hiong expressed gratitude to their teacher, not only for their skills, but also how he inspired them with his simple philosophy of life, and his upright and righteous character,\" shares Ms Liu.\n\nBesides teaching, Fan headed the Hwa Han Art Society when it was formed in the early 1970s. The society held group shows and also solo exhibitions of Fan's works in various venues including the National Museum.\n\nWhen Fan passed on in 1989, the National Museum Art Gallery held a retrospective of his works featuring more than 100 of them. In 1993, Fan's family donated 50 paintings to the National Museum. The last exhibition of works was held by the Singapore Art Museum, in 1998, which also showcased the works of his students.\n\nMs Liu's idea of a solo exhibition on Fan's works now is to allow the public to be exposed again to his paintings and poetry. More than 20 works of different subjects and themes will be shown, loaned mainly from his students.\n\n\"Although Chinese ink paintings could be seen as very traditional, the modern Shanghai \"Xieyi\" style is very well executed in his paintings. There is a fusion of poetry and calligraphy with the painting,\" describes Ms Liu, who had worked in a contemporary Chinese art gallery and a local auction house before setting up her own gallery.\n\nThe composition of Chinese poetry with painting is a talent and practice that's now getting rarer, she points out. Works in this exhibition will range from S$3,800 to S$14,800.\n\nAsia Art Collective's exhibition on Fan Chang Tien will be held from Nov 9-30 at 19 Tanglin Road #03-42, Tanglin Shopping Centre. Call 6733-2155\n\nMentored by Shanghai greats\n\nFan Chang Tien (1907-1987) was born to a wealthy Teochew family in Guangdong. Since young, he was deeply inspired by the literary Chinese tradition and was well-versed in the Chinese schools of philosophy, identifying himself with Confucianism.\n\nFan studied in the Shanghai Xin Hua Art College and then in the Shanghai Changming Academy of Art. He was mentored by the finest artists in Shanghai - Wang Geyi, Wang Yiting, Zhu Wenyun and Pan Tianshou - who were outstanding disciples of the grandmaster of the Shanghai School of Painting, Wu Changshuo.\n\nThe Shanghai School of Painting as inherited by Fan carries an expressive style characterised by powerful yet controlled brushworks and vibrant colours and sharp contrasts - derived from the fusion of Eastern and Western influences of Shanghai society in the 1900s.\n\nWhen Fan moved to Singapore in 1956, he was already an accomplished artist. He had also worked in Hong Kong and Bangkok as an art educator and artist. When he was in Singapore, Fan taught for a short while in Chung Cheng High School and in Whampoa Secondary School.\n\nFrom 1960, Fan began teaching and mentoring groups of students from home.\n\nFan's oeuvre of painting consists of a diverse array of subjects. His favourite subjects are from nature - bamboo and orchids, mountain birds and eagles, the lotus flower and plum blossoms - each symbolising ideologies and philosophies which he identified with. Fan painted in the \"Xieyi\" style, which is essentially a carefree and expressive painting style that conveys meaning.\n\nFan often signed his paintings as \"??\" , or \"the gardener\", and saw his ink and brush as his gardening tools and his paintings, the plants.\n\n- By CHEAH UI-HOON\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This resulted from higher contribution from sales of residences and land development rights (LDRs), as demand for high-quality homes continued to outstrip supply.\n\nThe Myanmar property developer's turnover surge was due mainly to the recognition of $15.1 million in revenue from the sale of LDRs for two buildings in Zone B of Star City, the group's largest residential project, along with an incentive fee of $2.3 million.\n\nEarnings per share were 0.29 cent, against a loss per share of 0.44 cent the previous year.\n\nAdministrative expenses fell $3.23 million to $6.05 million as the previous corresponding quarter included a share-based payment of $5.4 million to the company's CEO.\n\nFor the first half-year to September, Yoma's profit attributable to equity-holders was $4.4 million, reversing from a $2.1 million loss a year ago, on the back of a 68 per cent jump in revenue to $42.4 million.\n\nYoma said sales continued to be strong at Star City. By end-September, 523 out of 528 of the units in its buildings A3 and A4 were sold, amounting to $60.9 million. But OCBC Investment Research analyst Eli Lee noted that this was up only marginally from the 513 units sold as at end-June.\n\nOf the $60.9 million, $7.23 million had been recognised in previous periods and an additional $4.3 million was recognised in Q2 based on a percentage- of-completion revenue recognition.\n\nIts gross profit margin slipped 2.3 percentage points to 44.9 per cent in Q2 due to lower revenue from the sales of higher margin project, Pun Hliang Golf Estate, leading OCBC's Mr Lee to keep his \"hold\" rating on the stock with an unchanged fair value estimate of 84 cents.\n\nNoting the strong take-up rate of Zone B so far, DBS Group Research analyst Tan Ai Teng remarked that it was \"a good quarter with improvement in property sales and construction\".\n\n\"We expect Yoma to sell LDRs of the two remaining blocks (of Zone B) soon. The company would also receive more incentive fees accordingly,\" she said.\n\n\"Furthermore, Yoma has $49 million of unrecognised revenue in Star City to be recognised over the next 15-21 months as construction progresses.\"\n\nShe maintained a \"buy\" on the company's stock at an unchanged target price of $1.02.\n\nYesterday, Yoma lost a cent to end at 77 cents after its results announcement.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He finds inspiration in everyday life, became an artist because it made him happy, and his favourite music is the sound of birds, waves and the wind.\n\nBut despite his down-to-earth nature, the artist has a self-assigned mission - to work towards the preservation of Chinese ink painting as an art form, which he himself has chosen as his go-to style of creating works.\n\nIt's the \"charm and spirit\" that makes this art form worth preserving, says Nan Qi, who is a founding director of the Chinese Painting Association in China.\n\nAt his current solo exhibition at the Art Plural Gallery in Singapore, titled Authority Sex Money, the artist showcases a collection of works that express his views on the subject of contemporary Chinese ink painting.\n\nFor example, one of them titled Fortune Dot shows a man's silhouette against a dotted background. The subject is actually Mao Zedong, which the artist says can be recognised because of the lone dot on the silhouette that is in the same position as the mole on chairman Mao's face.\n\nHis exhibition will showcase 30 of works he created in 2006 and from 2010 till now. All are for sale, at prices from $6,000 to $120,000.\n\nOn the specific subject matter of the exhibition, Nan Qi is reticent. It's because he feels that \"art itself is more important than the ideology\", and the \"essence of art and artistic language\" is more important than the concepts behind them.\n\nHe fondly recalls the first time that he was drawn to painting, back when he served in the People's Liberation Army between 1979 and 1988. It was there that he attended their Fine Arts academy and studied Chinese ink painting.\n\n\"The army life was extremely dull and boring, and most people would spend their leisure time playing cards, smoking or drinking. I saved all my money to learn painting and it gave me fulfilment and a meaning of life,\" he says.\n\n\"Many of my classmates at the Fine Arts Academy are colonels now and my teacher, Professor Liu Dawei, is a general who serves as the president of the China Artists Association. I gave up many opportunities to become a high-ranking officer for the love of art and I never regretted it once.\"\n\nAlthough in the span of his career Nan Qi dabbled in oil and acrylic, he eventually returned to his first love - Chinese ink painting, becoming well-known among his Chinese and international peers as a master of ink dots.\n\nHis hope is that the developing Chinese economy will help further his cause to boost the image of Chinese ink art. \"The art of the Japanese drew unprecedented attention during their economic boom, so I believe that with the fast development of the Chinese economy, and increased understanding of our culture, contemporary Chinese ink art will be appreciated by more international audiences,\" he says.\n\nAuthority Sex Money will run till Nov 23 at the Art Plural Gallery at 38 Armenian Street. Opening hours are from 11am to 7pm daily, closed on Sundays and public holidays. Admission is free. Log on to www.artpluralgallery.com for more information\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But look closer and you'll find something quite macabre about the images - a maimed arm, a broken leg, a missing mouth or a pirate eye-patch.\n\nThese are no ordinary paintings. They were done by Singapore artist Huang Wei, who was a contemporary of the Nanyang artists. His obsession with the Old Masters like Caravaggio and Velazquez, however, set him apart from his peers such as Liu Kang and Georgette Chen, who were more interested in studying the modern French iconoclasts like Matisse and Cezanne.\n\nHuang worked as a studio photographer in the early to mid-1900s. He painted in his spare time, using photographs of children he took and transforming their images on canvas.\n\nBut he did not reproduce them exactly as they appeared in his photos. Instead, he rendered them as partially disfigured and melancholy-looking, to hint at the fact that not all these children survived the war - or that, if they did, suffered injuries. This morbid perspective perhaps explains why he never held a solo exhibition in his lifetime.\n\n'Black paintings'\n\nAlan Oei, director of Sculpture Square and curator of Huang's works, says: \"Most of our Nanyang artists painted in a 'happy' style, using vivid colours and pleasing subjects. Not many painted images that remind us of the war... it's as if the war didn't happen at all.\n\n\"Huang's paintings are important because they convey more pathos than your typical Nanyang painting.\"\n\nIndeed, Oei - who is a painter himself - was inspired by Huang's canvases to create his own set of macabre paintings. Oei took it a step further by \"entombing\" the children: After he painted the images of children based on photos he found from that era, he poured layers of thick resin on the paintings. They obscure the image and leave just traces of the child visible to the viewer. He calls his creations the \"black paintings\".\n\nBut the theatricality of his gesture doesn't stop there. From tonight till next weekend, Oei is showing his dark paintings, together with Huang's works, in a secret shophouse location.\n\nVisitors have to purchase a ticket at\n\nwww.evilempire.asia\n\nto receive the exhibition's exact location as well as a key that will open one object on site.\n\nVisitors are then required to remain in the shophouse for about an hour to look closely at the paintings. A group of actors will appear during the course of the visit to help illuminate various aspects of Huang and Oei's works.\n\nOei says: \"People don't spend enough time looking at a painting. They glance at one quickly and move away to the next one... I wanted to change that by having them here for about 45 minutes to an hour, during which they will be compelled to look more closely at the works.\"\n\nOei is director of Sculpture Square and created the popular series of Open House art tours conducted in ordinary people's homes in Marine Parade and Tiong Bahru. His creative approach to showcasing his works as well as Huang's will likely make the exhibition, titled The End of History, one of the most memorable of the year.\n\nHuang Wei's paintings are priced from $3,200 for a 60cm by 45cm framed canvas, and $12,800 for a 130cm by 150cms framed canvas. Meanwhile, Oei's grim images of entombed children go for $4,500 each. For anyone with an off-centre view of life, these paintings are definitely worth a long and close look.\n\nThe End of History exhibition will be shown at an undisclosed location on Nov 8,9,10, 15,16 and 17. Tickets at $25 are available at\n\nwww.evilempire.asia\n\n. Upon purchasing the ticket, the location will be revealed to you\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, revenue from its land systems business slipped 11 per cent while that of its others category - which includes ST Synthesis and Miltope - was 33 per cent lower.\n\nST Engineering's aerospace sector, which is the biggest contributor to topline, recorded revenue of $510 million for Q3, as higher revenue from the engines division of the component/engine repair and overhaul business group was largely offset by fewer project milestone completions in the engineering and material services business group. The aerospace sector's profit before tax of $80.2 million was 6 per cent lower as a result of the absence of a write-back of allowance for inventory obsolescence recognised in Q3 2012.\n\nEarnings per share were 4.24 cents, down from 4.77 cents.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit was 2.5 per cent lower at $413.3 million, while revenue was 0.8 per cent higher at $4.69 billion.\n\nFor the third quarter, gross profit dipped 3.6 per cent to $347.6 million while operating profit was 5.8 per cent lower at $157.9 million.

At the same time, the government is imposing deep cuts to defence budgets as part of a round of sweeping public spending reductions aimed at slashing the UK's deficit.\n\nThe MOD also announced plans on Wednesday for BAE to build three new offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy.\n\nA total of 940 jobs will be lost in Portsmouth on the southern English coast, with another 835 axed in Filton in the south-west and at facilities in Glasgow and Rosyth in Scotland by 2016.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron described the announcements as \"extremely difficult decisions and our first thought should be with all of those who are affected\". He told Parliament: \"In Portsmouth, yes there will be job reductions but there are many more people involved in ship servicing than shipbuilding, so the workforce will go from 12,000 to 11,000.\"\n\nBAE said it had reached a deal with the government \"to enable the implementation of a restructuring of its UK naval ships business\" resulting in the loss of 1.3 per cent of its global workforce of 88,200 people.\n\n\"Consultation will commence on a total employee reduction of 1,775 that is expected to result from these restructuring proposals,\" it said, adding that the consolidation of its British ships business would \"match future capacity requirements\".\n\nBAE said it had experienced a \"significant\" reduction in workloads following the peak of activity on its current programme to build two aircraft carriers.\n\nIt added: \"The implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain BAE Systems' capability to deliver complex warships for the Royal Navy and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the UK.\"\n\nTrade unions described the cuts as a \"devastating\" blow for the industry.\n\n\"There is no doubt that this is a devastating day for the UK shipbuilding industry,\" said David Hulse, a senior official with the GMB union.\n\nThe newly commissioned MOD ships will meanwhile be built at BAE's shipyards on the Clyde, Scotland and will play a \"key role\" in counterterrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations, the ministry said.\n\n\"This deal will provide the Royal Navy with three brand new maritime patrol vessels with a wide range of capabilities which will support our national interests and those of our overseas territories,\" said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.\n\nBAE, which has been rocked by government cutbacks to military spending worldwide, was also hit last year by the collapse of a proposed mega-merger with European aviation giant EADS. Paris-based EADS recently warned that it will have to apply tough restructuring to its own defence activities. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Canada's Alberta province is expected to follow BC with an issue.\n\nHong Kong has a market in yuan-denominated \"dim sum\" bonds issued by multinational corporations and financial institutions. In May, HSBC was the first to issue an offshore yuan bond in Singapore. Meanwhile, ICBC will be China's first mainland bank to issue an offshore yuan bond in London.\n\nBut BC is \"the first foreign government to do such an issue\", said Mr Courtis, adding that the deal has advantages for all parties involved. It helps with \"internationalising\" the yuan while Canada hopes to gain commercial advantage.\n\nCanada is gearing up to export huge quantities of shale gas - ahead of the US - and China is a strong potential customer, sources told BT. BC Premier Christy Clark was in Beijing for the yuan bond launch and was reportedly \"feted\" there, including by President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"There is vast appetite among official institutions and central banks for RMB paper,\" said Mr Courtis.\n\n\"Such bodies vastly prefer to buy paper issued by other governments rather than corporate paper. As there has not been a non-PRC issuer, this first non-PRC-government issue was swallowed in minutes with approximately two-thirds going to official institutions and central banks.\n\n\"Every day, the renminbi's role in the world is increasing and so central banks everywhere are starting to add RMB to their reserves,\" he added.\n\nThe BC government swapped the proceeds of the yuan issue into Canadian dollars and given current swap rates, \"the all-in costs are cheaper than borrowing even for them - a triple AAA borrower - in Canadian dollars\", Mr Courtis explained.\n\nAt 2.5 billion yuan (S$510.3 million), the BC issue is the largest Chinese offshore (CNH) bond by any foreign issuer to date. The bond was priced to yield 2.25 per cent and has a one-year term. About 60 per cent of the issue was placed in Asia, and 40 per cent in the US and Europe.\n\n\"Many governments and official institutions will want to make the same statement that BC is making,\" Mr Courtis said.\n\n\"Corporations will continue doing CNH issues, when the swap rates are right. Later, they will do issues for funding their PRC operations and for trade finance. But that is not now.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

I don't believe we as an organisation are supporting our customers enough, going backwards and forwards around our network.\n\n\"We've got infrastructure, we've got very good people, we need to make sure the connectivity of the group starts to happen.\"\n\nMr McEwan, the bank's new CEO, has been on the job for a month. He rose from running RBS's retail arm to take over from former CEO Stephen Hester, who had led the bank in the last five years. Mr McEwan was in Singapore as part of a week-long visit to Asia, including Australia and Hong Kong, to see how the bank's operations in the region could be improved.\n\nLast Friday, the UK Treasury said that it would not break up RBS, which was nationalised by the UK government in a 2008 bailout.\n\nInstead, an internal \"bad bank\" would be created to hold an estimated \u00a338 billion (S$75.86 billion) of commercial real estate and troubled loans and to sell them quickly over the next few years to strengthen the bank financially.\n\nRBS will also speed up the sale of its US subsidiary, Citizens Financial Group, and targets an initial public offering next year.\n\nIt is reviewing all ongoing businesses. An update will be provided next February together with the bank's full-year results, Mr McEwan said.\n\nAsked if RBS's private banking business or the small Asian segment within it could also be sold, Mr McEwan gave a firm denial. \"The private bank is running well. It's not one that's up for sale . . . I want to signal very clearly, we want to start growing our businesses as opposed to contracting.\"\n\nRBS's private bank, rebranded as Coutts in 2011, has potential to grow in Asia, Mr McEwan said.\n\n\"There's a lot of wealth and a lot of growth in the Asian marketplace. The brand travels well. It's a very powerful global brand for wealth management. We're meeting the team from Coutts . . . (it's about) how do you connect that business with other businesses that we have.\"\n\nThe bank has 13,000 employees in the Asia-Pacific region, 1,600 in Singapore and about 125,000 worldwide.\n\nAsked what kinds of workforce cuts might be on the way, Mr McEwan said that the mix of employees throughout the organisation would change over time. More people will be in the front-end, customer-facing departments and fewer in the administrative and operational departments.\n\n\"These are the things we are now able to concentrate on given that we're a good, sound organisation again,\" he said. \"For five years, we've been trying to save the organisation. We're now past that.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Ships need to install receiver equipment.\n\nAnalysts say Russia is keen to expand its shipping clout through the Arctic, which aims to cut journey times by weeks.\n\n\"The Northern Sea Route provides access to Russia's own hinterland and the vast amount of minerals and hydro carbon resources,\" said Malte Humpert of Washington-based think tank the Arctic Institute. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

So far, tickets for tomorrow night's show have already been sold out.\n\nInoue's story of Musashi is a twist on a famous Japanese tale of the battle between two rival samurais, Musashi and Kojiro. In the original story, Kojiro was killed by the end of the battle, but in Inoue's rewritten version, Kojiro somehow survives and later attempts to take revenge on Musashi.\n\n\"The main message of this show is to stop the chain reaction of revenge,\" says Mr Ninagawa, in an interview through a Japanese translator. \"[INOUE] wanted to convey to the audience that there still is war and conflict in this world to be resolved... and that war shouldn't be here anymore.\"\n\nAnd to help Inoue's intended message strike a chord with audiences, Mr Ninagawa has chosen to stage it such that the set immerses the audience into the world of the samurais both in visuals and audio.\n\n\"It's the first five minutes after the curtain rises that are the most important. In that time I have to hold the audience's attention,\" he says.\n\n\"I want to bring them out from their everyday lives and into another world, that's why I have a stage with a temple and a large bamboo forest. With the rustling sound of leaves that will put that in a different environment and bring them back to that era.\"\n\nMusashi runs tonight and tomorrow night at 8pm at the Esplanade Theatre.

Party leaders have historically used the occasion to launch new ideas or reforms. In 1978, Deng Xiaoping, then the country's new president, thrust China onto the path of double digit-growth with the \"opening up and reform policy\".\n\nBoth the new president and his Premier Li Keqiang have spent most of the past year defending at home and overseas the urgency and benefits of an overhaul of the economy, the current growth pattern of which is inadequate to address China's long list of imbalances.\n\nThey want to avoid the fate of Japan and get stuck in a dangerous \"middle income trap\". The economy is too leveraged for a developing country - the state still controls all major parts of the economy, credit is misallocated and unproductive, inequalities are growing and social discontent is on the rise. The past model was based on investment spurring growth, and the new one must be pulled by consumption, be more sustainable and socially just.\n\nThis means dismantling state-owned enterprises (SOEs), reforming land rights for farmers and giving them more spending power, granting a social security net for the entire population which will unlock earnings currently stored in the banks and reforming the hukou system and giving millions of migrant workers the same rights as their urban homologues.\n\nA long document will be published at the end of the meeting. It is unlikely China will actually mention precise deadlines or detail its reforms. Deng Xiaoping's reforms announced in 1978 became fully effective only in 1984.\n\n\"The key gauge of success should be whether the leadership presents a coherent and comprehensive plan for economic restructuring that can provide a clear direction to party and government officials over the years ahead. By contrast, a piecemeal approach would signal that the leadership has been unable to agree on a framework for how reform should progress,\" wrote Mark Williams at Capital Economics.\n\n\"In our view, effective reform must address three linked problems: the low share of income that goes to average households, the inefficiency with which capital is allocated, and the state's dominant role across much of the economy,\" he said.\n\nPresident Xi was quoted as saying in October that the government was drawing up a \"master plan\" for not just more reform, but a \"profound revolution\".\n\nHuang Shuhe, vice-chairman of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, has emphasised that SOEs are on the agenda. And Yu Zhengsheng, the No 4 member in the party's supreme Politburo Standing Committee has promised \"unprecedented\" reforms.\n\nLast month, the Development and Research Centre, a research body directly under the State Council, issued an ambitious plan which could well serve as a basis for discussions. The plan since dubbed 3-8-3, referring to its structure, was widely applauded by scholars and economists.\n\nUnder the plan, the key to reform is establishing the right relationship between the government and market. The proposal also included making the yuan an international reserve currency in some markets, setting up funds to invest and manage state assets, adjusting the system of transfer payments for local governments and reducing government stakes in financial institutions.\n\n\"The proposal is a comprehensive reform package, probably the most ambitious top-down economic reform initiative in the history of the People's Republic of China, in our view,\" wrote Dong Tao at Credit Suisse.\n\nHowever, analysts say vested interests among SOEs, local governments and party members will slow if not stall the reform momentum. SOEs have been nurtured by the previous regime disposing of monopolies in key areas of the economy with cheap unlimited financing. Key members of the those companies will be present in the plenum and are close to the president.\n\n\"As the leadership looks to propose market reform initiatives that will effectively undermine special interest groups - including SOEs, corrupt officials, bureaucratic institutions and local governments - it will face strong opposition,\" Cheng Li, professor at the Brookings Institute, told a recent conference.\n\n\"Much of that opposition will come from the SOEs, which have not only been the main source of official corruption, but also the most formidable obstacles to achieving market reforms,\" he added.\n\nAt this stage, analysts don't expect thorny issues such as state monopolies and land reform to be tackled. They think reform will most likely focus on financial and fiscal issues first, including interest rates and convertibility of the yuan.\n\nAmong other challenges will be finding a consensus between the different party factions. Former presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao still have men at all levels of the party, and their views often conflict with a strong economic reform agenda.\n\nAnalysts also caution that finding the right pace of reform is equally important as rushing the process could destabilise growth.\n\n\"For example, scaling back regulations that require the government to approve investment projects could lead to a further surge in lending to inefficient state-owned firms if the implicit government guarantees behind state sector borrowers are not first removed. The right reforms in the wrong order could just make things worse,\" argues Mr Williams of Capital Economics.\n\nPremier Li was quoted this week as saying growth should remain at the 7.5 per cent level. If reform will slow growth in the short term, it is unlikely leaders will decide to take measures which could potentially hinder development.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The agreement will further enhance and deepen trade and investment flows between both sides.\"\n\nIn providing preferential tariff access to Singapore exporters, ASTEP - signed yesterday morning - offers companies here a competitive advantage in a market of 23 million people.\n\nApproximately 97 per cent of Singapore's current exports will qualify for immediate tariff free treatment, while the remaining 3 per cent will qualify at five, 10 or 15 years after ASTEP enters into force.\n\nThe Business Times understands that the exact date of ASTEP's implementation is not yet known.\n\nIt is expected that Singapore-based companies exporting to Taiwan - particularly those in the electronics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, machinery, and processed food products sectors - will stand to benefit from the removal of tariffs.\n\nSingapore is Taiwan's fifth-largest trading partner, with key traded products spanning electronic circuits, electrical machinery and organic chemicals.\n\nThe Republic's investment into Taiwan reached $5.9 billion in 2011 - making Singapore the territory's sixth-largest foreign investor.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, the Ministry of Trade and Industry noted that Singapore is a regional headquarter and \"a key South-east Asia hub\" for many Taiwan companies seizing growth opportunities in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan is Singapore's eighth-largest trading partner. Bilateral trade between both sides rose 8.7 per cent from 2011 to reach $49.7 billion last year.\n\nThe territory is Singapore's sixth-largest source of investments from Asia, with a total foreign direct investment stock of $7.3 billion in 2011. Negotiations on ASTEP commenced in May 2011, and the agreement was signed yesterday in Singapore by the Trade Representative of the Singapore Trade Office in Taipei, Calvin Eu, and the Representative of the Taipei Representative Office in Singapore, Hsieh Fa-dah.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But it demanded that they do so through subsidiaries incorporated in India and said that eligibility would be limited to banks from countries that reciprocate by letting in Indian banks.\n\nThe regulatory framework issued after the close of trading on Wednesday requires that foreign banks invest a hefty minimum of 5 billion rupees (about S$99 million) in equity capital in each subsidiary.\n\nThe new rules also require separate boards for each subsidiary. Two-thirds of the directors must not be executives of the bank, and at least half of the directors must be Indian citizens.\n\nSuch boards will not only require additional expense and organisation for the foreign banks, compared with operating through branches, but will also force the banks to open their books to outside directors, raising the possibility that business secrets would leak.\n\nDespite the conditions, the new regulations are significant in that they allow greater competition in a country with a reputation for being difficult for foreign companies. The shift in direction is all the more notable because India has a history of opposing demands from wealthy countries for more open trade in goods and service, and has even organised campaigns by developing countries against such demands during negotiations at the World Trade Organization and other multilateral platforms.\n\nNew rules for foreign banks have been under discussion here for years. The abrupt release of the latest regulations represents the most recent in a series of moves to increase competition in financial services by Raghuram Rajan, the prominent economist who became the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, on Sept 4.\n\nMr Rajan said in an interview at the bank's headquarters that the net effect of the new rules would be to let foreign banks, including US banks, compete on a nearly equal footing with domestic banks.\n\n\"They will have access, provided they come through the wholly owned subsidiary route and abide by the guidelines,\" he said.\n\n\"There will be a lot more freedom for foreign banks here,\" he said. \"On net, it will be a tremendous opening to them, so I think they should be happy.\"\n\nA paper released by the central bank in late August said the main goal in allowing foreign banks in was to increase competition and efficiency in the local banking sector. The central bank wants to spur Indian banks to adopt more sophisticated financial services and risk management techniques.\n\nBut the push to attract foreign banks that form subsidiaries - and perhaps take over small Indian banks - has drawn criticism in some quarters in India, including the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Industry players also cite difficulties in getting local drivers for the job, even with a pay increase.\n\nUnder SMRT's new scheme, a master bus captain, the highest of seven pay grades, will drive 50-70 per cent of the time. He will have training and mentorship responsibilities, and needs to know 15 routes as well as undergo leadership management training.\n\nSaid Desmond Kuek, president and CEO of SMRT: \"We hope a better-trained, energised and engaged workforce will ultimately create a more reliable and service-oriented bus service that our passengers can enjoy.\"\n\nNational Transport Workers' Union executive secretary Ong Chin Ang said that the new model would transform frontline roles as competent drivers hit a ceiling after just three promotions under the previous career scheme.\n\nHowever, Roger Wong, general manager of Woodlands Transport, which has about 200 drivers, said that costs for private bus operators might increase as a result, with the going wage between $2,400 and $2,800 a month. \"Someone has to pay for it. We just can't increase our prices just like that,\" he said.\n\nOther operators said that it remained unclear if more locals - or indeed their own drivers - would be enticed to join SMRT following the move. This is because of the long hours and mundane conditions of public bus driving. Private bus drivers might have a greater variety of routes and a more flexible schedule. As for pay, drivers can hit $3,000 or $3,500 a month with a lot of overtime, they said.\n\nSaid a school bus operator who is trying to hire Malaysian drivers: \"Raising wages may not help attract more locals. Even if we advertise and pay so high, we may not attract the right people. A lot of people who can work for us have actually reached retirement age and want to go slow.\"\n\nSMRT has more than 2,100 drivers and operates a quarter of the public bus fleet. But its bus operations have been making operating losses for many years in a row now. Last November, 171 SMRT bus drivers from China made headlines when they went on strike over pay and living conditions. Since then, wage costs have increased.\n\nSMRT shares fell a cent to $1.285 yesterday, near a seven-year low. Last week, SMRT reported a 57 per cent plunge in net profit to $14.4 million for its second quarter ended Sept 30, owing to higher staff and depreciation costs.\n\nAnalysts are almost universally bearish about SMRT. According to Bloomberg, the 12-month target price for the stock is $1.10, based on estimates by 11 analysts. \"SMRT is playing catch up. I don't see how their bus operations can do well even with an increase in fares,\" an analyst said, referring to changes to the fare formula recommended by a committee earlier this week.\n\nThe elephant in the room is SBS Transit and its pool of almost 6,000 drivers. SBS already pays experienced local drivers around the $3,500-monthly range, BT understands.\n\nBut when asked about pay comparisons yesterday, Tammy Tan, SBS Transit's senior vice-president of corporate communications, kept mum. \"We have, since May 2012, implemented a career progression model where bus captains showing talent, capability and potential are able to rise in the organisation,\" she said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He has been pressing Boeing publicly for more than two years to move forward with a successor to the 777-300ER that would offer greater capacity. At the last air show two years ago, Mr Clark ordered 50 777-300ERs, and at the previous expo he ordered 70 Airbus A350s.\n\nWhile Emirates is likely to dominate the first days of the show, other carriers are also looking to place orders. Boeing is in talks with Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Cathay Pacific Airways about 777X orders worth as much as US$87 billion including the Emirates requirement, people familiar with the matter said previously.\n\nMr Clark reiterated he would like more A380 superjumbos, beyond the 90 he's ordered so far, though is constrained by limited space at the current Dubai airport.\n\nWhile Boeing's updated 777 is the most keenly awaited wide-body programme of recent years, given the success of the current model, the Chicago-based company is not alone in chasing major orders.\n\nAirbus is marketing its largest A350 variant as an alternative, and the plane - called the A350-1000 - is set to enter service three years before the 777X, which Mr Clark sees debuting in 2020 at the earliest.\n\n\"There are other aeroplanes in the frame,\" Mr Clark said. \"They're improving the Airbus A350-1000.\"\n\nEmirates already has 70 A350s on order, 10 of them the A350-1000 variant.

But there's always room for one more spectacle that we haven't seen - Starlight Express - where the cast of 28 performs the entire show on roller-skates.\n\nThe rock musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber is one of the longest-running musicals at West End in London, about a child's dream where his toy trains come to life at night and race for the title as the \"fastest engine in the world\". The show first started out in West End, in 1984, where it played for over 7,000 performances, and also had a shorter run at Broadway in New York, before going on tour around the world. One of their upcoming stops is at the Marina Bay Sands Grand Theatre here in Singapore next week.\n\n\"It's a universal love story, and audiences all over the world can relate to the themes and characters - the goodies, the baddies, the competition and, of course, the romance,\" says Arlene Philips, a renowned West End choreographer who has worked on Starlight Express since its Broadway days.

Large-scale wind turbines have reached parity with solar or other forms of energy generation in North America. We believe at this point that tidal energy isn't comparable with solar, but in the next 5-10 years, it will be. In deploying any renewable technology, it's not purely the technology, you also need the industries to come in and develop business models for it.\"\n\nThe next step, if the technology proves scalable, he said, is to find commercial partners who will install the turbines and generate electricity to Sentosa, or to consumers in Singapore.\n\nAsked if tidal energy could become a sustainable resource, Prof Mhaisalkar said that while it may not be able to meet 10-20 per cent of Singapore's energy needs, it is possible to generate a reasonable amount of energy from tidal and wind turbines.\n\n\"We are in a unique location to test such technologies in tropical waters, and 'Made in Singapore' renewable energy solutions can be exported to the region, such as Indonesia and the Philippines, where there is more tidal flow, or Malaysia or Thailand. That's where we hope the larger-scale deployments will happen,\" he noted.\n\nDeploying the turbine system was an even bigger challenge than designing it, Prof Mhaisalkar recalled.\n\n\"The ocean is a very intense environment. So we needed to make sure the technology is robust to withstand the forces of nature,\" he said. \"What was challenging was putting the turbine in a tropical environment in Sentosa, where seaweed, fish and other vegetation caused challenges; the currents and the monsoons caused challenges. So we struggled for more than a year to find an ideal way to deploy the turbines.\"\n\nInvestment in such emerging technologies reflected Singapore's commitment to explore renewable energy options, much like how it has developed its expertise in water technologies, said Prof Mhaisalkar. \"Apart from proving that tidal energy is feasible in Singapore, the test bed will allow us to improve our designs for future turbine systems, leading to new avenues of renewable energy.\"\n\nAs part of its CSR initiative, Sentosa Development chief executive Mike Barclay said Sentosa has been opened up as a test-bed for new green initiatives and technologies, particularly those that can be scaled up for wider adoption across Singapore. \"We already have wind and solar energy but we've never tapped tidal energy. I think this one has legs.\"\n\nDiscussions are going on with Sentosa Development about the possibility of deploying larger turbines near the Southern Islands and Pulau Semakau. \"We've done a detailed resource assessment of the area between Sentosa and the Southern Islands, where tidal flows are pretty strong,\" Prof Mhaisalkar said.\n\nOther green experiments in the pipeline include wind turbine and solar power, as well as sustainable transport or driverless vehicles.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

It will sit atop the Stamford Grand North Ryde Hotel, a Stamford Land property.\n\nThe 22,000-square-metre freehold site will house about 650 apartments, shops and commercial offices, including a convenience store, management offices, mini-supermarkets and childcare centres.\n\nAll 379 residential units offered in the Stage 1 launch were snapped up at an average price of A$10,000 per square metre; the remaining 267 units will be released for sale later this year or early next year.\n\nNo revenue will be recognised until the project is completed in 2017.\n\nSeparately, the group, Australasia's largest independent operator of luxury hotels, said that although its net profit for the six months ended September had dipped, its revenue rose 6.4 per cent to $133 million.\n\nThis came largely from a significant increase in expenses to cover its development property sales, which jumped from $4.3 million to $17.3 million.\n\nSeventeen apartments at The Stamford Residences Auckland (TSRA), a commercial unit and an apartment at The Stamford Residences & The Reynell Terrace, were sold during the period. This compares with the sale of six apartments at TSRA a year ago.\n\nThe sales gave a big revenue boost to the property development business, for which revenue jumped from $5.7 million in the six months ended September 2012 to $21.1 million.\n\nThe group's hotel segment, on the other hand, reported a drop of 6.6 per cent in revenue to $103 million, from translation losses from lower exchange rates and lower revenue from its two Adelaide hotels. This was partially offset by the better performance of its Sydney and Melbourne hotels.\n\nOver at the property investment arm, revenue dipped 2.3 per cent to $6.9 million.\n\nIn the trading business, revenue rose 4.8 per cent to $1.9 million on the back of higher contributions from the group's interior decoration business.\n\nLooking ahead, the group said the hotel segment is expected to perform satisfactorily, given the strong demand at its Sydney and Melbourne hotels and signs of recovery in its two Adelaide hotels. Reviews are in progress to rejuvenate the rooms, and food and beverage outlets across the group.\n\nEarnings per share for the period was 1.07 cents, compared with 1.09 cents previously.\n\nStamford Land's counter ended trading down half a cent, at 57.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Her story is far more prosaic - she simply taught herself to cook two decades ago.\n\nBut that didn't stop her from publishing three cookbooks of her family's Peranakan recipes - tangible labours of love that prove her dedication to the craft.\n\n\"My children always said I'm not a cook because I only started cooking about 20 years ago when I opened my restaurant called Ming's Cafe & Pub. I used to rely on maids because I was working,\" says 73-year-old Ms Soon, who used to be the vice-president of public relations at the former Overseas Union Bank (OUB).\n\nJust last month, she released her third cookbook, Grandmothers' Recipes: Sweet and Savoury, which can now be found in all major bookstores alongside its predecessors Grandmothers' Recipes (2006) and More Grandmothers' Recipes (2012).\n\nIt all began when she left the bank in 1990 to start a restaurant, and Ms Soon was gathering recipes from her family members, which she had to tweak to suit the restaurant's menu. And after giving up Ming's Cafe & Pub, she decided it was time to compile and preserve them.\n\n\"I had a Singaporean family, a Malaysian family, plus my mother-in-law's recipes that my children love to eat every Chinese New Year, so I realised I had to preserve them in a cookbook,\" she says. \"I even had to try out every single recipe because none of them had proper measurements.\"\n\nThe cookbooks are a mishmash of Peranakan, Chinese and even western favourites from ayam buah keluak to lasagna, all written in a simple, easy-to-follow format. At her book launch, she kept her guests well-fed with a gourmet spread that showed off her mean cooking skills.\n\nAlthough she still has enough recipes to fill a fourth book, with more exotic local dishes such as chilli crab, black pepper crab and coffee pork ribs, Ms Soon has no plans to publish it any time soon.\n\n\"It's not easy publishing a cookbook yourself, you know. It's very tiring, because I have to do everything myself and I have to sell 1,000 copies per book just to get back my cost.\n\n\"If somebody else does everything for me then maybe I will, but I don't think I want to have to run around and do it anymore,\" she says with a laugh.\n\nWho knows - if enough home cooks find her cookbooks invaluable, they might well persuade her otherwise.\n\nAll three cookbooks can be purchased at major bookstores at $40 each before GST, or directly from the author by emailing ros@grandmothersrecipes.com.sg.

There will also be a greater emphasis on working with companies to elevate the quality and pay of jobs in this sector.\n\n\"Finally, we will develop a strong marine and offshore eco-system, which brings together industry players, such as classification societies, equipment makers and vessel owners,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nMr Lee paid tribute to former Sembcorp Marine president and CEO Tan Kwi Kin for his efforts in lobbying the prime minister on the idea of the new facility, which he was convinced would help boost Singapore's competitiveness. \"The government supported Sembcorp Marine, by reclaiming land at Tuas for the new yard and helping Sembcorp Marine upgrade its capabilities,\" Mr Lee said.\n\nThe 206-hectare new yard facility will be developed over three phases. The 73.3-hectare phase one started operations in August; phase two is expected to begin in the next three to four years.\n\nSembcorp Marine also celebrated its 50th anniversary at a gala dinner yesterday, where the group said it will commit $10 million over five years to an endowment fund for the establishment of Sembcorp Marine Lab @NTU, a new research facility at the Nanyang Technological University.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

This is partly due to the ramping up of activity at the new shipyard in Brazil, but even more to the load situation and activity level in Romania and Norway.\n\nOperating profit for the third quarter was 72 million kroner, down from 301 million kroner in the corresponding period of 2012. The operating margin, representing operating profit to total revenues, was 3 per cent.\n\nOperations at the group's European shipyards are stable, with work load at the Romanian yards gradually reverting to a normal situation. The Norwegian yards saw successful delivery of four vessels during the quarter.\n\nThe load situation at the Vietnam yard has improved as a result of a new project secured during the quarter.\n\nKey shipyard infrastructure for the group's second yard in Brazil, Vard Promar, was completed in the third quarter. The ramp-up of production capacity at the new yard is under way, and the first blocks have been produced.\n\nThe group added that growth in the oil companies' exploration & production (E&P) spending is expected to continue in 2014, fuelling demand for its products, in particular in the North Sea market.\n\nVard shares closed trading yesterday five cents lower at 83 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Previously, it had forecast a low single-digit growth in 2013. Service revenue, however, is slated to be flat, which means that the drop will be driven by lower equipment sales instead.\n\nAt the same time, the outlook for Ebitda margin was lifted for the full year, from 31 per cent to about 32 per cent, yesterday.\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit gained 5.8 per cent to $287.1 million, but revenue slipped 1.2 per cent to $1.75 billion, also because of lower handset sales.\n\nMobile revenue for Q3 gained 1.6 per cent to $308.3 million, driven by a strong enterprise postpaid segment. Average revenue per user (ARPU) for the postpaid market gained $1 year-on-year to $70, as takeup of the new tiered data subscription plans continued to grow.\n\nApart from mobile, the only other segment to record year-on-year revenue growth was fixed network services which was up 3.1 per cent to $92.7 million.\n\nStarHub's pay-TV segment turned in quarterly revenue of $95.5 million - a 3.7 per cent drop as advertising and subscription revenue fell. Even so, the division had reason to cheer, with a net increase in subscribers for the first time after shrinking for six straight quarters. Over the third quarter, it added 1,900 subscribers, bringing the total to 531,000 subscribers.\n\nAccording to StarHub, this growth was partially because it was able to carry the English Premier League matches after its cross-carriage triumph, and also because it cracked down on set-top box piracy by tightening security on its equipment. ARPU, however, was down a dollar year-on-year to $51, because of \"higher competitive discounts\".\n\nIn the broadband segment, fierce price competition from smaller players raged on, with revenue shedding 5 per cent to $59.6 million.\n\nThe group declared an interim dividend of 5 cents per share, the same as in Q3 last year, and will maintain its annual dividend of 20 cents per share for the year.

F&N said that it has engaged lawyers and \"intends to vigorously resist the claim\".\n\nIn a circular dated Oct 28, F&N said: \"Without prejudice to its position that MEHL has no basis to give the notice or make the claim, the company also does not agree with the propriety or process of the valuation or the amount and has communicated that to MEHL.\"\n\nThe spat is the first major dispute between a foreign investor and a Myanmar state-owned enterprise since the country embarked on its road to reform after decades of isolation under military rule. The resource-rich nation has drawn many international investors, including big corporations such as Coca-Cola and Unilever.\n\nMyint Aung, MEHL deputy managing director, is contesting various media reports which suggested that the dispute was a test case for Myanmar's investment laws. The case, he said, is not about the investment laws in Myanmar or how foreign investors are treated in the country.\n\n\"We believe that allowing parties to exercise their contractual rights, including the right to arbitrate a dispute, will strengthen and not weaken foreign investors' confidence in Myanmar,\" he said yesterday. \"The arbitration speaks for our desire to adhere to proper and due process.\"\n\nWhile MEHL did not specify the term in the agreement that it said F&N had defaulted on, BT understands that it is connected to F&N's recent takeover by Thai tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi.\n\nMr Charoen completed his takeover of F&N in February and now holds about 90.3 per cent of F&N shares - 61.7 per cent through privately controlled TCC Assets and 28.6 per cent through listed Thai Beverage Public Co.\n\nThere might have been a clause in the agreement that allows either side to buy out its partner if the ownership of the partners changes.\n\n\"Change-of-control clauses are quite common in joint venture agreements,\" said Lo Kim Seng, a director at Stamford Law.\n\nMyanmar Brewery, which sells the Myanmar Beer and Andaman Gold brands, is the country's biggest beer supplier and its top taxpayer. Its 83 per cent market share in Myanmar makes it the leading brewer in the region's fastest growing beer market, F&N has said.\n\nThe brewery is F&N's only beer asset after the company sold its stake in Asia-Pacific Breweries (APB) last year to Dutch brewer Heineken.\n\n\"If the judgment goes against F&N in any way, it will have an impact on the group's overall profitability with regards to its food and beverage division,\" DMG & Partners analyst Goh Han Peng said.\n\nF&N does not typically specify how much it makes from Myanmar Brewery. In a report during its recent takeover, F&N's independent financial adviser JP Morgan placed net income for the year ended September 2012 at $52 million for the brewery, based on management guidance.\n\nGiven that F&N owns 55 per cent of Myanmar Brewery, this would have contributed about $29 million, or 72 per cent, of F&N's $40 million in net profit from beverages in fiscal 2012.\n\nBased on this, the US$246 million valuation by MEHL works out to around 12 times earnings. \"For this kind of market leader, the market value is probably in the range of 20 times,\" Mr Goh said.\n\nMyanmar Brewery was started in 1995 as a joint venture between APB and the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings. APB transferred its shareholding to F&N in 1997.\n\nAs the unit was incorporated in Myanmar, the agreement between F&N and MEHL will be governed by Myanmar law.

Apart from enhancing existing concession schemes, two new schemes were proposed - one for low income workers and another for people with disabilities - with both to be funded by the government and not the public transport operators (PTOs).\n\nIf accepted and implemented, the concessions could add about half a million new beneficiaries to the current 1.2 million commuters receiving some form of public transport concessions, or about a 40 per cent increase.\n\nAs fare increases are expected, another recommendation is for the PTOs to contribute 20-50 per cent of their fare gains to the Public Transport Fund, which is co-funded by the government. The fund was set up to help needy families.\n\nAnother recommendation is to include energy costs in the computation of a new and more responsive fare formula, since they have become a substantial part of operating costs for PTOs. Under the formula, a fare adjustment is equal to the price index minus a revised productivity extraction, where the price index features the new energy index component in addition to a revised core CPI and an unchanged wage index. If accepted, the new fare formula will be valid from 2013 to 2017.\n\nThe committee also proposed a rollover mechanism to smoothen out significant fare increases over two years.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

FJ Benjamin attributed the lower sales to a slowdown in demand for luxury timepieces in China and reduced tourist spending by mainland Chinese visitors in Hong Kong.\n\nDuring the quarter, the company recorded a fair value loss on investment securities of $0.6 million and a forex loss of $0.8 million (compared with a $0.4 million gain last year), resulting in a non-cash translation swing of $1.2 million.\n\nEarnings per share was 0.07 cent, compared with 0.41 cent a year ago.

Some are even donating property to simply get rid of it,\" he noted.\n\nThe residential housing market is moribund as there are few buyers and banks are plagued with growing numbers of bad loans.\n\n\"Prices have fallen by over 30 per cent these past three years. It's because of the taxes imposed by the (EU-IMF) creditors and the economic uncertainty,\" Mr Paradias said.\n\nAccording to a study by leading Greek union GSEE, 75 per cent of mortgage payments are in arrears.\n\nThis represents a sum of 65 billion euros and mainly involves urban property, mainly in Athens.\n\nThe average debt per homeowner in mortgage trouble is 94,000 euros, GSEE said.\n\nOn the other side, non-performing bank loans have reached 59.6 billion euros according to sector reports, including 30 billion euros regarding business loans and 16.8 billion euros from mortgages.\n\nEconomist Christos Galanos believes few foreign investors will come to Greece given these rates and they will instead wait for the economy to pick up.\n\n\"The government should have taken action when housing prices were soaring before 2009.

Over the following weeks, the fire triggered rounds of investigation, regulatory involvement and a war of words between operators.\n\n\"Our investigations showed that the fire was caused by an employee not following strict maintenance procedures, including the use of an unauthorised blowtorch,\" SingTel said. BT understands that the blowtorch in question had not been approved for use. The telco did not say where the tool came from.\n\nThe employee has since been suspended, pending the independent review by the SingTel board committee of inquiry, which is ongoing.\n\n\"SingTel treats this incident very seriously and has always ensured that its contingency plans and safety measures meet global benchmarks,\" it said yesterday.\n\nSince the fire, the telco has taken steps to prevent a repeat of the incident, it said. It will limit maintenance work that requires the application of heat, introduce better tools and equipment, and reinforce training on safety requirements and operations.\n\n\"We recognise the importance of reliable communication services to customers and Singapore's status as a leading financial and business hub,\" said SingTel group CEO Chua Sock Koong.\n\n\"We apologise unreservedly to all our customers for any inconvenience caused. We are committed to learning from this experience and welcome recommendations from the (committee of inquiry) and independent experts to enhance our operations.\"\n\nThe next round of information from the telco about the fire will come in the form of findings and recommendations from the committee of inquiry, which will be made public.\n\nYesterday, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) responded to SingTel's announcement, saying that it noted the telco's findings, was conducting its own investigation and will make its own findings known in \"due course\".\n\nSingTel's counter closed four cents, or one per cent, higher at $3.80 yesterday, before its preliminary findings for the fire were released.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Keppel's ability to accommodate a tight delivery schedule, as well as its execution track record helped to clinch the contracts, despite aggressive competition from the Chinese shipyards, according to market sources.\n\nThe first rig will be delivered in Q1 2016, and subsequent ones at intervals of four months with the last to be delivered in Q3-2017.\n\nOn top of the five confirmed orders, the first of the five options must be exercised within one year with the remaining four options within consecutive four-month intervals.\n\nWith these new contracts, Keppel's Offshore & Marine division has to-date secured 20 newbuild projects totalling $6.4 billion, all of which were its proprietary design.\n\nTransocean had issued an invitation for the other shipyards to tender, as it looks to expand its fleet of premium jack-up rigs from the current 12.\n\nKeppel's KFELS B class jack-up rigs already form 33 per cent of this fleet and, with the current order plus the options, the KFELS premium jack-up rigs are likely to dominate the fleet.\n\nTransocean's president and CEO, Steven L Newman, said: \"Continuing our growth in the high-specification jack-up business is an important element in our asset strategy.\"\n\nHe said the group as \"very excited about the potential for these rigs, given expectation for continued customer demand for assets of this capability and outstanding operating performance of the four new high-specification jack-ups we have already placed in service\".\n\nThe KFELS Super B Class rigs are designed to operate in 400 feet of water and to drill to 35,000 feet, with a an innovative drilling system to tackle challenging mid-water conditions.\n\nAnalysts say Keppel's big win is an endorsement of Singapore shipyards' leading edge in the premium jack-up rig segment, where the China yards have tried unsuccessfully to make inroads although they had secured contracts for lower specification jack-up rigs.\n\nAccording to Rigzone data, Singapore yards including those of Keppel and Sembcorp Marine have built more than 80 per cent of the high specification global jack-up rig fleet.\n\nKeppel shares closed trading yesterday at $10.93, up nine cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Despite there being good ones, it is the terrible ones that people remember and bring up in conversations. They make for funnier stories, after all.\n\nThe new Mandarin play, Citizen Pig, tells the stories of the absolute worst landlords theatre directors Liu Xiaoyi and Oliver Chong have ever encountered - from the landlord who tried to pack more people in his apartment than was legally allowed, to the landlord who rented out a space that didn't even belong to him.\n\nLiu insists these are true stories. As a new citizen from China, he's lived in the past 10 years in 10 different HDB flats, from Bedok to Geylang to Yishun, and catalogued every type of horror a tenant could experience.

News releases came a distant second for about 70 per cent of the companies, with the least preferred modes being company visits, newsletters and normal mail.\n\n\"Companies need to embrace and learn the most effective strategies in relation to online communication,\" said Irving Low, partner and head of Risk Consulting at KPMG in Singapore. \"If employed correctly, online communications can be an effective risk management tool in responding to market rumours.\"\n\nCompanies, however, still have to learn to be more forthcoming and timely with their announcements. The study showed that only 14 per cent notify the market ahead of time when releasing earnings results, while just 21 per cent issue profit warnings.\n\nThe study also found that messages can be made clearer - with unclear communications sometimes leading to clarifications sought by the market regulator, the Singapore Exchange.\n\nIt also noted that chief financial officers (CFOs) need to help stakeholders distil the facts from the noise and from \"popular opinion\", as well as provide better guidance for investors to make informed investment decisions.\n\nSaid Melvin Yong, Singapore general manager of CPA Australia: \"In an age of 24/7 communications, retail investors are constantly bombarded with information. Their difficulty is separating fact from fiction or market speculation. This is where CFOs, increasingly the face of investor relations, can do their part - communicate clearly and simply and dispense with confusing jargon.\"\n\nCFOs also need to realise that stakeholders want a real conversation with management and that small shareholders have become an even louder voice.\n\nArthur Lang, group CFO of CapitaLand, advises: \"One should not unnecessarily sugar-coat any message but communicate with credibility. Always adopt an open, honest and consistent approach to provide timely and accurate information, and ensure consistency and continuity of communication.\"\n\nThis is where the more traditional methods of communication can play their part. \"Though technology is useful, nothing beats face-to-face engagements,\" said Mr Low.\n\nThe study also found that there is great momentum and practical support for integrated reporting here. A quarter of the annual reports reviewed had a section that focused on other stakeholders and key performance indicators, and about 10 per cent produced a separate sustainability report.\n\n\"Integrated reporting takes a holistic view of corporate reporting and will fundamentally change the way companies communicate with stakeholders,\" said Vincent Chen, head of the Accountancy Sector Research Centre, Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC), which supports the Singapore CFO Institute.\n\nThe findings of this report will be made available and discussed at the CFO Connect Symposium 2013 today organised by the SAC.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Doug (played by Asian-American MTV host Alan Wong) has a gash from riding his bicycle off the school roof, and Kayleen (played by Lasalle graduate Seong Hui Xuan) is doubled over with stomach problems. They quickly bond over their shared fascination with pain - little knowing that it would be the tie that binds them for three decades of gory mishaps to follow.\n\nUnreeling like a cross between Love Me If You Dare, a French film about obsessive lovers who end up destroying each other, and the episodic Hollywood flick, One Day, we follow the pair over the course of eight scenes at five-year intervals.\n\nAt times, the characters border on storybook cliches: accident-prone Doug believes that Kayleen has some sort of mythical healing power over him, while yearning to be the fabled hero that protects her from worldly ills. Kayleen, likewise, is a modern-day feminist conundrum. Outwardly in control but emotionally and physically debilitated inside from a troubled childhood, she's torn between yearning for an emotional buttress in Doug and asserting her independence.\n\nDelivery is not always spot-on. The duo's too-squeaky and cartoonesque portrayal of elementary school children would have grated on one's nerves had it dragged any longer, and though generally affable, Wong's Doug borders on Disney Channel-type slapstick in a couple of scenes. Though, as an upside, the laughs elicited helped to lighten an otherwise morbid theme. He only really sheds his goofy demeanour in the final scene, when he emerges as an emotionally burnt, wheelchair-bound middle-aged man.\n\nSeong, on the other hand, shows more versatility in her transition from schoolgirl to confusion-addled pubescent teen and later, a wiser - if slightly weary - grown woman.\n\nThe script cleverly calls for the actors to change between sets in two corners on-stage, applying their cosmetic bruises and blood-soaked bandages in full view of the audience, perhaps as a way of underscoring the self-inflicted nature of the wounds.\n\nRather than flow according to chronological order, the vignettes jump either 10 years forward or 15 years back each time - the era's radio hits playing in the background as a marker of time. As a result, audiences get the benefit - or more accurately, the heart-wrenching burden - of hindsight in watching the pair slowly weave their web of mutual destruction.\n\nIn an early scene, for instance, we meet adult Doug, blinded in one eye by explosives, before a vignette, two scenes later, reveals how the accident could have been prevented had Kayleen not shunned him at her father's wake just moments before. Ouch.\n\nAs the characters sum it up themselves: \"We can both hardly see. And maybe that's for the best.\"\n\nGruesome Playground Injuries plays at the Esplanade Theatre Studio, weekdays at 8pm, weekends at 3 and 8pm till Sunday, Nov 10.

The yield on the company's five-year US dollar bonds fell 54 basis points since June, to 4.14 per cent on Nov 5.\n\nVanke has teamed up with Keppel Land for the development of 726 flats in east Singapore as foreign Chinese buyers have emerged as the top overseas buyers of residential property in the city-state this year.\n\nMainland builders are accelerating projects abroad as people from the world's most-populous country seek access to education, healthcare and citizenship abroad, said London-based broker Savills plc.\n\n\"Chinese developers have been looking offshore for funding for many years now but there's more impetus to do it now after the government turned the credit taps off,\" said James Macdonald, Shanghai-based head of research at Savills China. \"Being able to turn to overseas bond markets is important to Chinese developers as these markets are not tied to government policy and prices are dictated by the market.\"\n\nRegulators across China have sought to clamp down on property prices, tightening lending requirements and boosting minimum downpayments for additional home purchases in an effort to reduce the risk of a bubble destabilising the financial system.\n\nThe People's Bank of China in June engineered a cash crunch that saw short-term funding rates soar amid efforts to curb loose lending practices that have undermined bank balance sheets.\n\nThe yield on the government's benchmark 10-year bonds added three basis points to 4.22 per cent and has jumped 64 basis points this year. The yuan, which gained 2 per cent so far in 2013, was little changed at 6.0968 per dollar.\n\n\"Overseas markets are attractive as there is less government interference and stronger rule of law, which makes them more transparent and predictable,\" said Mr Macdonald, adding that currency diversification is another driving factor behind investment abroad.\n\nDalian Wanda Group Corp, founded by China's richest man Wang Jianlin, is constructing a luxury hotel and apartment building in England. Its unit, Dalian Wanda Commercial Properties Co, is considering selling a US dollar bond and met investors in London this week, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nChinese and Hong Kong developers have sold close to US$20 billion of debt in dollars this year, making up about 17 per cent of the market in Asia outside Japan. This compares to 11.2 per cent last year.\n\nVanke is targeting foreign markets where Chinese buyers are active, including San Francisco, New York, Boston and Singapore, president Yu Liang said in August.\n\nThe move comes as the authorities in its home town of Shenzhen boosted minimum downpayments for second homes to 70 per cent and reiterated a ban on loans for anyone who owns two or more properties.\n\nBorrowing costs for companies in Singapore dollars reached a four-month low of 3.087 per cent on Oct 30, according to HSBC Holdings plc indexes. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

This works out to about 26,000 yuan per square metre.\n\nTo partly finance the acquisition, CRCT said it has launched an equity fund-raising to issue 45.4 million new units at $1.30 each through a non-renounceable preferential offering to unitholders. This will raise gross proceeds of $59 million. The preferential offering will close next Wednesday.\n\nPart of the funding will come from the remaining proceeds from CRCT's private placement last October and external borrowing.\n\nYesterday, CRCT also brought forward its targeted completion for the acquisition to the end of this year, from the second quarter of 2014 previously.\n\nThese developments follow CMA's successful bid for Grand Canyon Mall for 1.74 billion yuan in July this year. That same month, CRCT had signed a conditional call option agreement with CMA to acquire the mall.\n\nGrand Canyon Mall is a three-year-old mall along the South Third Ring West Road in Beijing's up-and-coming south region. It enjoys an average monthly footfall of more than one million.\n\nLim Beng Chee, CMA's CEO, had earlier said that by offering this mall to CRCT, the former can reserve its balance sheet capacity for other opportunities while growing its assets under management, leasing network and market share.\n\nCRCT is managed by an external manager that is an indirect unit of CMA.\n\nYesterday, CRCT closed a cent lower at $1.38, while CMA ended two cents higher at $2.05.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, the market is still very robust and is still seeing good growth ahead. So we are raising capital to increase our capacity and also to capture our strategic initiatives.\"\n\nThe group was granted a conditional eligibility to list on the SGX mainboard last month.\n\nYesterday, it priced its $154.7 million initial public offering of 171.9 million new shares at 90 cents apiece, of which 5 million shares are designated for the public. The IPO values the company at $653.2 million. Net profit in fiscal 2012 was US$32.2 million.\n\nPacific Radiance said its growth strategy would be to expand its fleet to take advantage of the growing oil and gas business activity in the region.\n\nMok Weng Vai, the managing director of the Offshore Support Services Division, said: \"We are also looking at the strategic thrust and seeking like-minded partners and individuals for mergers and acquisitions.\"\n\nMr Mok, one of Pacific Radiance's co-founders, added that the group was looking at horizontal M&A deals.\n\nGeographically, its area of focus will be South-east Asia, particularly Malaysia and Indonesia. Mr Mok said that although these are restrictive and protective markets, the group has sought out opportunities through partnerships with entities in these two countries to propel its growth there.\n\n\"We are embarking on new territories to enhance our growth in line with our vision and strategic plan, as we have gone into Brazil and are expanding our presence in Australia and Africa as well,\" he added.\n\nThe growth story of Pacific Radiance goes back more than a decade, when Mr Mok left his previous job to start a new venture in providing ship-chartering services to offshore support vessels in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe spotted robust opportunities to grow the business in Malaysia and Indonesia and, not wanting to let these opportunities pass, sought out a like-minded partner in Pang Yoke Min, who previously helmed Jaya Holdings Limited, and with whom he had worked before.\n\nMr Pang, explaining his decision to get involved with this venture, said: \"I had just retired from my last company when I came across this proposal.

But he said he was confident the next carrier would cost US$1.2 billion less, excluding non-recurring engineering costs and inflation.\n\nCongress has imposed an US$11.4 billion cost cap on the ship.\n\n\"We understand where the country is from a budget standpoint. We understand the urgency to drive toward affordability on these ships, as does Newport News,\" said Rear Admiral Moore.\n\nFailure to control costs could jeopardise Navy plans to maintain a fleet of 11 aircraft carriers, massive ships that can respond to a range of threats and situations around the globe.\n\nThe Pentagon is bracing for about US$1 trillion in spending cuts over the decade that began in 2013, unless Congress acts to reverse US$500 billion in cuts required under sequestration, a prospect seen as increasingly unlikely.\n\nThe late US president's daughter, Susan Ford Bales, is scheduled to smash a bottle of American sparkling wine across the Ford's hull on Saturday at a christening ceremony to be attended by hundreds of dignitaries, including former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.\n\nThe ship will replace the USS Enterprise, which was inactivated last year. Rear Admiral Moore said the Ford will be used for 50 years, and the new class would serve through 2110.\n\nThe Ford features a new nuclear power plant, a redesigned island, electromagnetic catapults, new weapons and storage elevators, and an enhanced flight deck.\n\nThe ship will produce 500,000 gallons of fresh water a day, 100,000 more than earlier Nimitz-class carriers, Rear Admiral Moore said. This will allow sailors to take \"Hollywood showers\", keeping water running while they bathe, instead of Spartan \"Navy showers\".\n\nHe also said that about 70 per cent of the Ford would be complete in time for the christening, a far higher percentage than the amount of work that was done when the last of the previous class of aircraft carriers, the Nimitz-class, was christened.\n\nDoing more work before christening would help save money on the Ford and also reduce costs of the next carrier, according to Rear Admiral Moore.\n\nHe said the Ford would be built with 50 million man hours of labour, but the Kennedy would require only around 43-44 million.\n\nThe next ship in the class, the USS Enterprise, would take around 40 million man hours to build, about the same amount of time needed to build the Nimitz-class carriers, despite the far greater complexity of the new ships, Rear Admiral Moore said.\n\n\"We are making significant progress on the Kennedy,\" he told reporters. He said Newport News was building more of the new ship's sub-systems in its shops or on the dock instead of doing all that work on the ship.\n\nHe said the Ford-class ships also had far more automated systems, which would reduce their long-term operating costs.\n\nSuch changes would allow the Navy to staff the ship with 900 to 1,200 fewer people than current levels of around 5,500 to 6,000 people, including air wing personnel, Rear Admiral Moore said.\n\nNewport News estimates the Ford-class ships will cost US$4 billion less to operate over their lifetimes than earlier ships. About 40 per cent of a ship's total lifetime cost is in maintenance, Rear Admiral Moore said. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It is part of a decade-long effort by the US government to hold the healthcare giant - and other pharmaceutical companies - accountable for illegally marketing the drugs as a way to control patients with dementia in nursing homes and children with certain behavioural disabilities, despite the health risks of the drugs.\n\nThe settlement, which requires the approval of a federal judge, will also resolve accusations that the company inappropriately promoted two other drugs - the heart-failure drug Natrecor and Invega, a newer anti-psychotic drug.\n\nMuch of the conduct highlighted in the case, which for Risperdal extends from 1999 through 2005, occurred while Alex Gorsky was vice-president for sales and marketing and later president of the company's pharmaceutical unit, Janssen. Mr Gorsky became chief executive of Johnson & Johnson last year.\n\nIn a news conference on Monday announcing the settlement, Eric Holder, the attorney-general, said the company's practices \"recklessly put at risk the health of some of the most vulnerable members of our society - including young children, the elderly and the disabled.\"\n\nAs part of the settlement, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to plead guilty to criminal misdemeanour, acknowledging that it improperly marketed Risperdal to older adults for unapproved uses.\n\nIt did not admit to wrongdoing for the civil portion of the settlement, which involves claims that the company promoted the drug's use in children and the developmentally disabled, as well as accusations that it paid kickbacks to doctors and pharmacists in exchange for writing more prescriptions.\n\nThe company will pay criminal fines and forfeiture of US$485 million and civil penalties of US$1.72 billion. The civil settlement also resolves similar accusations brought by 45 US states.\n\nJohnson & Johnson said it stood by the safety and efficacy of Risperdal and was trying to put the chapter to rest. But some called into question the extent to which the company could move on, given that Mr Gorsky was now chief executive.\n\n\"Stockholders and patients will pay the price for the fraud,\" said Patrick Burns, co-director of Taxpayers Against Fraud, an advocacy group for corporate whistle-blowers. \"Mr Gorsky, however, gets to keep his job at Johnson & Johnson and all his bonuses.\"\n\nMr Burns has called on federal officials to hold executives more directly accountable in such cases.\n\nJohnson & Johnson officials tried to expand the market for Risperdal to older dementia patients soon after the drug was approved in 1993 to treat symptoms of psychiatric disorders, according to federal court filings. The drug, whose generic name is risperidone, was primarily tested in schizophrenia patients, and the US Federal Drug Administration repeatedly rejected efforts by the company to expand the drug's use to older dementia patients, according to the filings. - NYT\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

It also experienced the strongest surge in wealth - 13 per cent to US$1.18 trillion.\n\nThese figures suggest that Asia \"is driving the tectonic shifts in wealth globally\", said a joint statement by UBS and Wealth-X. The latter researches the ultra-high net worth segment, defined as those with assets of at least US$30 million.\n\nAsia contributed the largest number of new billionaires this year at 18, followed by 11 in North America. Globally, there are some 2,170 billionaires, compared with 2,160 in 2012.\n\nTheir combined wealth grew 5.3 per cent to US$6.5 trillion from US$6.19 trillion last year. Interestingly, their combined wealth this year is enough to fund the US budget deficit until 2024, and is greater than the GDP of every country except the US and China.\n\nBy 2020, UBS and Wealth-X expect the billionaire population to exceed 3,800. This is a projection based on existing \"demi-billionaires\" - that is, those with a current net worth of between US$500 million and US$999 million.\n\nSaid the report: \"When taking into account those not yet worth US$500 million, the increase in the billionaire population is likely to be even higher.\n\n\"For example, many 'technopreneurs' continue to increase their wealth rapidly, and are able to achieve billionaire status in the span of only a few years.\"\n\nChina has the second-largest billionaire population globally, after the US. It has 157 billionaires with a combined net worth of US$384 billion; the US has 515 billionaires with a net worth of just over US$2 trillion.\n\nSingapore has the fifth-largest billionaire population in Asia, and the 18th largest in the world. In terms of the world's cities, it ranks sixth. New York is the top choice among billionaires, with 96 choosing to base their primary businesses there.\n\nAccording to the data, the average billionaire globally is worth US$3 billion. About 35 per cent or US$1.27 billion of this wealth is in private holdings. Another 35 per cent or US$1 billion is in public common stock. Cash accounts for 18 per cent or US$545 billion, and real estate 3 per cent or US$78 billion.\n\nThe report said that the liquidity cushion is higher than it was before the global financial crisis in 2008, \"suggesting that the old mantra of 'cash is king' remains as relevant as ever\".\n\nGlobally, about 60 per cent of billionaires are self-made, while 20 per cent inherited their wealth. In Singapore, 44 per cent are self-made and 15 per cent inherited their wealth. Some 41 per cent inherited wealth and subsequently grew their fortunes.\n\nIn a foreword in the report, Josef Stadler, UBS global head of ultra-high net worth (UHNW), said that the top UHNW segment continues to grow even as the path to economic recovery remains challenging.\n\n\"This makes the billionaire segment interesting to any bank with a strategic UHNW foothold. Yet, billionaire clients have particularly complex demands, and the challenge lies in providing them with the right offering to help them achieve their financial goals.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Constrained housing supply and demand from investors are driving prices higher, overpowering the downdraft from slower economic growth and a rising unemployment rate.\n\n\"It's easy to see how bubble-like conditions could emerge,\" said Saul Eslake, chief Australia economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Melbourne. While prices are climbing, the increase isn't being accompanied by a rapid rise in borrowing or building, he said.\n\nIn Sydney, the nation's most populous city, the average home price surged 13 per cent in the 10 months to Oct 31 to a record A$718,122 according to the RP Data-Rismark home value index.\n\nThat compares with US$806,000 in New York as at Sept 30, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, and \u00a3331,338 (S$662,013) in London, according to the Nationwide Building Society.\n\nAustralians are used to high home prices and debt. Average household debt has hovered near 150 per cent of annual income since 2006, compared with 135 per cent in the US. House prices haven't fallen more than 10 per cent in any one year for more than 40 years, according to Reserve Bank of Australia data.\n\nIn Newtown - a former working-class suburb 5 km from the city centre where Ms Wong bought the property - prices have risen 13 per cent this year, according to researcher Australian Property Monitors.\n\nMore than 81 per cent of homes that went to auction in Sydney during the Nov 2 weekend were sold, even as the number of properties for sale rose to 739, the highest number in three years, according to APM.\n\nThe average home price across Australia's biggest cities was A$605,336 as at Oct 31, after recovering from a decline of 7.4 per cent between October 2010 and May 2012, according to the RP Data-Rismark index. That's a record, but it's about the same level in real terms as at end-2010, based on the statistics bureau's inflation calculator.\n\nInvestors like Ms Wong and self-managed pension funds, along with foreign buyers, are spurring the recovery. The value of loans to investors rose a seasonally adjusted 26 per cent in August from a year earlier, while those to owner-occupiers increased only 9.7 per cent, state data show.\n\nRising sales to investors puts the market in a more precarious position if economic conditions unexpectedly sour, Mr Eslake said.\n\n\"Investors aren't as committed to their properties as owner-occupiers,\" he said. Changes in the outlook for home prices, rising interest rates or unfavourable changes in regulation could lead them to \"dump their properties, putting sharp downward pressure on prices\", he said.\n\nAustralia's tax structure, which allows property investors to claim deductions on investment losses and offset them against other income, encourages investors to buy when they otherwise wouldn't.\n\nAmong investors, self-managed-superannuation funds - pensions managed by individuals rather than large money managers - have been boosting purchases of homes. Investment by SMSFs in residential property has risen 65 per cent since mid-2008 and 10 per cent in the 12 months to June to A$17.5 billion, according to data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which oversees regulation of the small funds. The ATO's June 2013 data is extrapolated from the funds' tax return filings for the year through June 2012.\n\nWhile do-it-yourself pensions borrow on average about 70 per cent of the value of a home, compared with about 90 per cent for regular borrowers, based on Australia & New Zealand Banking Group figures, they could \"potentially exacerbate property price cycles,\" the RBA said in its Financial Stability Review last month.\n\nForeigners accounted for 12.5 per cent of purchases of new homes in the three months to Sept 30, compared with about 5 per cent through most of 2011, according to a survey of more than 300 property professionals by National Australia Bank.\n\nWhile Australia is the world's sixth-largest country by size with a land mass of 7.7 million sq km , about two-thirds of its 22 million people live in its eight state and territory capitals, which occupy less than 0.5 per cent of the total area.\n\n\"This population concentration puts upward pressure on capital city dwelling prices,\" Michael Blythe, chief economist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in an Oct 15 report.\n\nSydney now has 122 suburbs - or one in five - with a median home price above A$1 million, a 31 per cent jump from a year ago, according to researcher APM.\n\nIrina Burgess, 46, has been searching for a home in Sydney's lower north shore district for the past two years without success.\n\n\"A friend sent me a link to try and cheer me up, which was a 10-bedroom chateau in France with 22 acres (8.9 hectares) for less than the price of a two-bedroom apartment in Cremorne,\" a suburb 5 km north of Sydney's centre, she said. \"The prices are bonkers.\"\n\nOf the 20 suburbs with the biggest home-price gains over the past 15 years, half were in Perth - the biggest beneficiary of the nation's mining boom. Oakford, 34 km south of the city centre, has seen prices surge eightfold in the past 15 years to a median of A$852,000, APM said.\n\nIn other parts of the country, gains have been more modest with prices in Canberra rising 3.5 per cent in the year to Oct 31, Brisbane's increasing 3.4 per cent and Adelaide 1.9 per cent, according to RP Data-Rismark data. Hobart and Darwin home prices have fallen 0.7 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively.\n\nThe most recent prices have generated plenty of talk of a housing bubble, with those words appearing in Australian media articles more times in September than at any time since 2003, chief economist Craig James and economist Savanth Sebastian of Commonwealth Bank of Australia's CommSec unit said in a research note.\n\nSimilar concerns have emerged in countries including the UK, where former Financial Services Authority chairman Adair Turner said an economic recovery \"is heavily focused on that favourite old British activity, which is another house price boom.\"\n\nIn Sweden, apartment prices rose 16 per cent in the 12 months to September after more than doubling since 2000, sending household debt to record levels and prompting a warning from the International Monetary Fund that the country needs to take measures to prevent consumer debt and housing costs from spiralling out of control.\n\nIn China, prices jumped by the most this year in October, the 17th consecutive month of increases, and in Canada, policy makers have been tightening rules on mortgages to try and prevent the market from overheating.\n\nHelping drive the pickup in prices in Australia is the central bank's 2.25 percentage points cut to its benchmark rate since November 2011 to a record low 2.5 per cent as it seeks to offset a peak in mining investment. The RBA's rate cuts have pushed the average standard variable home loan rate to 5.95 per cent, the lowest level since September 2009.\n\nEven with mortgage rates at a four-year low, not everyone is participating. First-home buyers accounted for 13.7 per cent of loans in August, the lowest level since April 2004 and compared with a high of 31 per cent in May 2009 when government incentives targeting them were in place.\n\nThe government is keen to see house prices rise in the hope that the construction industry, which is seeing a pickup, will underpin slowing economic growth. Treasurer Joe Hockey said last month that rising prices encourage more development and help ease a shortage of homes. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The looming adoption date begs the questions: Are companies fully prepared for the change? And just how will the new standard affect financial statements and the companies they belong to?\n\nThe Accounting Standards Council (ASC), which issues the standards here, actually held back the implementation of FRS 110 by a year, after receiving feedback that this and other FRSs due to be introduced at the same time were posing a greater challenge to stakeholders than anticipated.\n\nAccounting experts agree that, given the extra preparation time, FRS 110 should not present that much of a challenge to most companies on its own. But they also agree that the increased complexity of the new standard and the greater judgment needed to apply it will present some issues.\n\nSim Hwee Cher, Assurance leader at PwC Singapore, points out: \"For example, in the case of the option to purchase further shares, such as warrants - before FRS 110, the assessment of whether these options lead to consolidation was less complex and focused mainly on whether the option holder has the current power to exercise his option.\n\n\"Under FRS 110, the assessment will be much more complex, involving the consideration of a melting pot of factors including whether and how far the option is in the money, the purpose and design of the option, an assessment of the wider arrangement that led to the acquisition of the option, etc.\"\n\nReinhard Klemmer, partner and head of Accounting Advisory Services at KPMG in Singapore, says the initial adoption of the standard where market practices have not been set will prove difficult. \"For example, does a company with shares of less than 50 per cent control another company when the former is by far the largest shareholder? Such decisions are hard to make without historical precedent.\n\n\"Another requirement of the FRS 110 is to determine the significant activity of a company that may require consolidation - which was not something that the accounting standards required previously. The activity may not be straightforward enough to determine, which makes it hard for the finance function to judge on its own.\"\n\nThere are also operational issues a company will face in applying FRS 110. Shariq Barmaky, Assurance and Advisory partner at Deloitte Singapore, believes one of the biggest challenges will be the need for the parent company or investor to continually assess if it controls an investee when facts and circumstances indicate there are changes to the elements of control defined by the standard. \"We anticipate challenges in executing the assessment continually, particularly where very often the assessment of control is one that requires consideration of other market factors as well as other parties to the investee.\"\n\nMr Sim points out that other operational issues include \"managing stakeholders with regard to the impact on capital ratios, key performance indicators (KPIs), effects on key items such as revenue - due to consolidating additional revenue or vice versa - training finance teams to understand the new approach, implementing internal controls to identify judgmental areas of consolidation, and so on\".\n\nThe adoption of the standard will also be trickier for certain types of companies or entities.\n\nTan Seng Choon, Assurance partner at EY, says: \"Companies that will face significant challenges in adopting FRS 110 would likely be those who invested in special-purpose entities and fund/asset managers who are directing the activities of the fund that they manage, as these are the areas where (the) judgment involved would be significant.\"\n\nMr Barmaky points out that \"Reits (real estate investment trusts) and business trust structures need to exercise judgment in determining if they are principal or agent to the structure\".\n\n\"Among others, the assessment of principal-agent, and whether the rights are substantive or protective in nature, may not be a straightforward assessment,\" he adds.\n\nMr Klemmer believes two distinct categories of companies will face the greatest challenges: large conglomerates with a wide variety of relationships and operations in a number of foreign countries; and smaller companies that may lack the manpower to dedicate their most knowledgeable resources to deal with the adoption issues.\n\nHe adds: \"The other group that may struggle are some of the users of financial instruments, for example, lenders who have financial ratios they monitor; such ratios may significantly change if additional companies are being consolidated into the borrower . . . (Also,) as consolidation has an implication not just on one or a few line items on the financial statements, analysing its impact will require significant effort.\"\n\nStill, despite these, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that FRS 110 was introduced to improve on the current situation. It is meant to deal with the current diversity in practice in applying FRS 27, and with off-balance sheet vehicles, such as the securitisation vehicles that posed such a risk during the global financial crisis.\n\nMr Barmaky says: \"The debate continues as to whether FRS 110 will bring about more or less consolidation but, in essence, the new standard is intended to bring about more appropriate consolidation that better reflects the relationship between a reporting entity and an investee.\"\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Much of the world remains under-insured.\"\n\nOver the next decade, the insurance business in Asia is projected to grow at about 8 per cent a year. By 2020, Asia is likely to account for almost 40 per cent of the global market.\n\nSingapore is already recognised as Asia's leading reinsurance hub, he said. Sixteen of the world's top 25 reinsurers have regional hubs here.\n\n\"The market has built up significant expertise in specialty insurance, namely marine, energy, catastrophe, credit and political risks. For example, Singapore is the second-largest market for structured credit and political risk worldwide after London,\" he said.\n\nMost Asian risks, including entire large reinsurance programmes and speciality risks, can now be fully placed in Singapore. MAS's vision is thus for Singapore's insurance industry to accept not just regional, but global risks by 2020, Mr Menon said.\n\nTo get there, MAS has four strategies, which are to:\n\nMAS will work with existing players to build up their speciality and reinsurance underwriting and broking capabilities and to expand their regional hubs, he said.\n\nIt will also seek to broaden the industry by promoting growth in emerging business lines, such as cyber risks, though efforts in this area might be stymied by a lack of Asian data.\n\nMAS is working with the industry to create a test bed for cyber risks, so that insurers and potential clients can come together to simulate loss events, he said.\n\nOn promoting Asian demand, Mr Menon said that cross-border access has to be improved and increasing the pool of Asian risk data is critical. Asean is working towards a comprehensive insurance liberalisation framework, with 2020 being the target year for substantial liberalisation in the industry.\n\nThe framework is expected to be discussed at the Asean Finance Ministers' Meeting next year.\n\nAs for paucity of data on Asian risks, Singapore is addressing the gap by setting up several research institutions to gather and analyse data in specific areas of risks, said Mr Menon.\n\nFor example, the Institute of Catastrophe Risk Management at the Nanyang Technological University is researching flood and earthquake risk assessment in selected Asian cities.\n\nA thriving hub needs a broker network, which has been growing here, he said. The vibrant broking cluster here has played a central role in facilitating business flows, and plays host to more than 70 insurance brokers. Four of the world's top five brokers have their regional hubs here.\n\nToday, brokers are not just intermediaries, but also high-value service providers that drive innovation and collaboration in the industry, he said.\n\nA good example of this is Aon, which recently established its Analytics and Innovation Center here to provide analytics solutions to the group's business units on a global basis, he added.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

If all goes according to plan, its Jurong Shipyard headquarters, PPL jackup rig building yard, Jurong SML yard in the south-west, Sembawang Shipyard and SMOE shipyard in the north will all come together on a 206 ha site in Tuas South.\n\nThe relative urgency with which it is undertaking this is being driven by three key factors: Firstly, there are economies to be reaped from integrating, modernising, upgrading and re-scaling its existing dispersed - and, in some cases, ageing and overcrowded - facilities.\n\nSecondly, it is raising its dock capacity to meet the intense competition from Korean and Chinese yards and, finally, it is freeing up the older sites and the 83 ha of SembMarine-owned waterfront land in Sembawang for potential redevelopment.\n\nAt the launch of the Sembmarine Integrated Yard @ Tuas yesterday, SembMarine chairman Goh Geok Ling said the integrated shipyard is being designed to accommodate all of SembMarine's Singapore yards, including the two largest and oldest ones - Jurong Shipyard built in 1963 and Sembawang Shipyard, a former British naval base.\n\nHe described Phase I of the new yard as just the beginning, and said that when Phase II is done in three to four years, \"we look forward to further expanding many of these facilities and continue to innovate our processes\".\n\nAs Singapore's leading builders of offshore rigs and floating production storage and off-loading (FPSO) vessels, SembMarine and Keppel Offshore & Marine (Keppel O&M) compete head on in some segments with South Korean shipyards like Hyundai Heavy, Samsung Heavy and Daewoo Shipbuilding; the rivalry is particularly in the building of semi-submersible rigs, FPSO vessels and, potentially, drillships. In recent years, even the China-based shipbuilding yards have started competing in the sector, using aggressive pricing to gain a foothold and make up for their lack of a track record.\n\nWhile the Korean and Chinese yards are primarily shipbuilding yards, the sharp decline in new orders for commercial ships has forced them to shift their focus to the relatively more lucrative, booming sector of offshore rig-building and offshore production vessels and platforms.\n\nIn his speech at the yard's launch event, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong outlined the challenges in this promising sector, which range from increased competition from the Korean and Chinese yards to the tightening of the foreign worker inflow here and the scarcity of land.\n\nThe question is whether SembMarine could have moved much earlier.\n\nIndeed, it has been more than a decade since its then-president and chief executive Tan Kwi Kin mooted the idea of building a new-generation shipyard. The idea, entailing the reclaiming of land in Tuas for the new yard, had received strong government support.\n\nSembMarine's \"sister\" company Keppel Corp has had a very positive experience in relocating its shipyards from their waterfront facilities in 1999.\n\nKeppel had moved its Keppel Shipyard out of Keppel Harbour to Jurong, which opened the way for the group to team up with Keppel Land to develop the site jointly into the classy waterfront homes of its Keppel Bay project.\n\nThese projects - its Carribean @ Keppel Bay, Reflections @ Keppel Bay and now, Corals @ Keppel Bay - have been well received by the market as unique waterfront homes.\n\nPerhaps SembMarine could also consider developing a Sembawang Bay residential development in 10 years.\n\nMeanwhile, the management of Keppel O&M's currently larger and relatively newer shipyard facilities are likely to be looking over their shoulders to size up the quickening expansion of SembMarine's shipyard facilities, likely to rival their own in the next decade.\n\nSometimes, timing makes all the difference.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Beyond various schemes and incentives to spur firms and workers to upgrade, what are needed are \"systemic improvements\" across entire sectors to achieve breakthroughs in productivity, Mr Tharman said as he singled out three industries in particular that the government is working on: construction, logistics and retail. To that end, \"we will be as aggressive as it takes, to support upgrading, on the job, outside the job and every form of upgrading by firms\", he added.\n\nIn that spirit perhaps, JTC tenants seeking to renew their leases on the government-owned factories will now have to pass some sort of productivity test. In an interview with BT, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Teo Ser Luck said firms will have to submit for consideration a proposal on how they plan to raise efficiency levels and \"set milestones\" - presumably a schedule of planned investments in plant and machinery, number and \"quality\" of jobs that will be created, etc. This will also apply to developers bidding for industrial land. All this is not good news for many SMEs, which, already faced with rising rents, will have to raise their efficiency game in short order, or be prepared to go to a commercial landlord - or relocate out of Singapore - if they are to stay in business.\n\nAs market principles go, the new JTC rule for lease renewals and land applications veers off the beaten track. While it is well meaning in that it seeks to address the longstanding problem of low efficiency across some industries that is perhaps rooted in outdated, labour-intensive ways of doing things, its practicality is questionable. For example, what measures of \"efficiency\" will be used, and how will these be tracked and assessed across a range of industries? What timeframe will companies have to achieve their milestones - bearing in mind that productivity gains accrue over a matter of years and vary from industry to industry? Some companies may even ask, quite reasonably, and with all due respect, what business is it of JTC - an industrial infrastructure specialist - to assess efficiencies in such specialised industries as semiconductors or chemicals.\n\nRather than getting involved in assessing the operations of companies in various industries (albeit jointly with Spring Singapore), JTC should stick to what it knows best, and what it is good at: creating and managing industrial space in ways that are innovative and land-efficient. While raising productivity is important, and companies want it too, it is a complex, long-haul process and not something that should be linked to lease renewals, even if this is practicable to do - which it is not.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It dived $12,499 to a seven-month low of $55,503.\n\nOne commercial vehicle dealer said dealers who had been aggressively clearing their existing stocks of heavy goods vehicles to beat the new 2014 emission standard have mostly finished doing so. New commercial vehicles have to be Euro 5-compliant from January next year.\n\nHe added that another reason for Cat C's plunge was that the recent strong orders for cement mixers and other heavy vehicles involved in the construction sector had been filled.\n\nAs for the passenger car market, the sales manager of a European dealership pointed to the weak overall market stemming from loan curbs and higher registration taxes introduced in February this year.\n\nSome dealers said they were still doing steady business in less expensive, entry-level models. But those in the luxury sector are generally feeling the pinch.\n\n\"Of course you still have cash-rich individuals buying cars but for a lot of other people, affordability is an issue with the mandatory 50 per cent cash downpayment,'' said the sales manager. \"It has taken a while but we are definitely seeing the vehicle financing restrictions starting to hurt buyers.''\n\nHe added that yesterday's slump in COE premiums did not come as a big surprise because it was a \"timely correction''.\n\n\"The sharp increases in late September and early October were overdone,'' he explained. \"Premiums rose too high and too quickly without corresponding real demand, especially when there aren't many new Cat B models to entice people.''\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

This resulted from lower contributions from its dry bulk shipping and shipyard operations.\n\nThe group, which owns 51 per cent of the largest shipyard group in China, Cosco Shipyard Group, said yesterday that its turnover for the three months ended Sept 30 rose 6 per cent year-on-year to $989.4 million from $937 million owing to increases in shipyard revenue.\n\nEarnings per share for the quarter were 0.19 cents, down from 1.19 cents a year ago.\n\nTurnover from shipyard operations rose 5.7 per cent to $976 million in Q3 from $923.5 million the previous year, boosted by revenue from the marine engineering segment. This more than offset the lower revenue contribution from the shipbuilding and shiprepair segments.\n\nTurnover from dry bulk shipping and other businesses held steady at $13.4 million, as most of the current quarter's short-term charter rates were secured earlier in the last quarter at an average Baltic Dry Index (BDI) rate of 888, which is comparable to rates received in the same quarter last year.\n\nGross profit fell 36.4 per cent to $73.2 million for the quarter from $115.1 million last year, mainly due to lower profit contributions from the shipbuilding and marine engineering segments as a result of inventory write-down and provisions for expected losses recognised on construction contracts.\n\n\"Our industry outlook remains cautious amidst the uncertain global economic climate and difficult operating conditions. The shipbuilding projects currently under construction for contracts secured at lower value during the market slump in the recent years will exert downward pressure on our profit margins.

The NTSB concluded that the pilot and co-pilot did the exact opposite of what was needed to save the plane after it lost speed and stalled.\n\n\"This will give our pilots the most advanced training available to handle emergency events that they may experience,\" said FAA administrator Michael Huerta. \"This is one of the most significant updates of air carrier pilot training in the last 20 years.\"\n\nMr Huerta said that the complexity of implementing change explained why it took \"a long time\" to achieve. \"The important thing we're trying to do is raise the bar on safety,\" he said.\n\nThe rules announced on Tuesday are among several mandated by Congress in the aftermath of the Colgan crash. It follows rule changes that required that pilots get a minimum of eight hours of sleep and 10 hours off between flights. The crash came after one pilot slept in an airport lounge and the other flew cross-country to meet the flight in Newark.\n\nThe newly announced rules require additional pilot training on preventing and reacting to aircraft stalls, better tracking of pilot training and performance, and additional training on handling planes in crosswinds and gusty conditions.\n\nMr Huerta said that he would invite the airlines and safety experts to Washington later this month to discuss additional steps to improve safety and pilot training. - WP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Air travel has become a product with multiple attributes that may include in-flight Wi-Fi, extra legroom or lounge access, as opposed to just a seat on an aeroplane. Travellers can build their own trip experience by selecting which options will add value to the journey.\n\nOn airline websites, customers have access to these additional products and services. But for the 60 per cent of tickets (by value) that are sold via a high-street travel agent or travel website, information available to agents is more basic, because distribution technology used by agents currently is limited to little more than fares and schedules.\n\nThe 2013 Iata Global Passenger Survey (GPS) of nearly 8,000 travellers confirms the existence of an information gap between airline websites and other shopping channels. For example:\n\nThere is a long explanation for why this gap exists. But the short version is that distribution via travel agents is built on pre-Internet messaging standards. These don't have the same capabilities as XML (eXtensible Markup Language), the language of Internet-based commerce.\n\nThe International Air Transport Association (Iata) is working with our travel agent and travel technology partners to close that gap through the New Distribution Capability (NDC). Simply put, NDC is an initiative to update the existing messaging standard between airlines and agents to XML. It's true that global distribution system (GDS) companies are working to make it possible for airlines to merchandise their products through travel agents in a manner more consistent with airlines' own websites. But each is working on its own proprietary solution. NDC will be an open standard available to any and all who want to use it, including the GDSs and non-Iata airlines.\n\nSpecial offers\n\nIn addition to enabling airlines to display and sell the full range of their offerings through travel agents and travel websites, NDC will permit customisation and personalisation that consumers have come to expect.\n\nAccording to the GPS, nearly half of all travellers are interested in sharing such things as travel preferences, age, interest/hobbies and frequent-flyer status in order to receive special offers or products and services from airlines tailored to their needs, and a fifth would share their social media profile as well.\n\nCreating the NDC standard will unleash innovation - and that will mean change. But NDC will operate within the same privacy laws that govern every other business. That is no change from today. By giving travel agents more information, there will be greater transparency for consumers. Systems incorporating the NDC standard will enable much richer comparison shopping for travel products, not just the base fare, but the entire spectrum of offerings.\n\nConsumers may continue to shop anonymously, as today, but for those who choose to identify themselves, such as by providing a frequent flyer number for example, airlines will be able to personalise offers.\n\nIata's raison d'etre is to set global standards to enable harmonisation and greater efficiency across the entire industry. Standards are pro-competitive and cost-effective. By facilitating the adoption of new technology, they create value.\n\nWe have made strong progress over the past year. Our application for approval of Resolution 787, which is the foundation document for NDC, is before the US Department of Transportation (DOT), and we are optimistic of a positive outcome in the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\nThe NDC pilot programme was launched in February 2013. Five pilots are underway and a number of others are in the process of getting started. We expect the pilot phase will last through 2014. In 2015, the initiative should move into a deployment phase, in which a number of airlines will have adopted the initial version of NDC. A global rollout is expected to begin in 2016.\n\nConsumers already enjoy rich shopping experiences on retail platforms such as Amazon.com, so shouldn't they expect the same level of transparency and choice when buying a plane trip?\n\nThe writer is director of financial and distribution services transformation at the International Air Transport Association\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Brokerages also began to put their own restrictions on various penny stocks.\n\n\"The market pulled back not just out of caution, but also as a result of all the curbs in trading houses,\" he said.\n\nPhillip Securities analyst Ken Ang noted that seasonally, the end of the year is usually more quiet for equity activity, \"but right now, there's an additional impact of lower market confidence\".\n\n\"We don't see this as a long-term thing, though. We expect (securities) trading to pick up in January.\"\n\nMonth-on-month, activity also came off from a higher base of $30.3 billion traded in September. September had seen heavy trading after the Fed in mid-September opted to leave its asset-purchase programme unaltered, leading investors to unwind their pre-tapering positions, said Mr Ng.\n\nDerivatives volume, however, rose 20 per cent year-on-year to 8.5 million contracts, although it slipped from nine million contracts in September.\n\nOpen interest, or contracts not closed or delivered at month's end, rose 63 per cent to 3.8 million contracts. It reached an all-time high of 3.811 million contracts on Oct 29.\n\nMr Ang said that these are \"pretty good numbers\" that point at growing market interest and a more optimistic environment towards SGX's derivative business, specifically its equity index futures.\n\n\"The nature of derivatives is that they are volatile based on market sentiments, but for quarters now, they have been able to improve quite nicely.\"\n\nThe jump in open interest numbers means that more traders are holding their overnight positions via the exchange, even if it means having to place collateral with the clearing house.\n\n\"So either existing traders are holding more open positions, or more market participants are coming onboard.

Revenue a year ago was US$17.8 million.\n\nThe firm had sold its two jack-up rigs, of which it owned 45.5 per cent indirectly, in August.\n\nThis contribution from the drilling services division resulted in the group's overall average gross profit margin for the quarter rising from 26.5 per cent last year to 44.5 per cent.\n\nRevenue from its oilfield services division also rose from US$5.4 million last year to US$35.8 million, boosted by the procurement of a one-off short- term contract and an increase in the provision of sundry services during the quarter.\n\nRevenue from its marine division increased from US$10.4 million to US$17.8 million, as more vessels were deployed.\n\nFalcon Energy said that it is optimistic about business prospects going forward, due to buoyant demand and stable oil prices conducive for higher levels of exploration and production activities.\n\nThe group sees strong growth in its marine division, with improved utilisation rate of vessels at higher charter rates, and on longer contract terms.\n\nOne of two 78-metre multi-functional support vessels that it ordered in October 2011 has been delivered, and is now used on a three-year bareboat charter by a Mexican firm.\n\nThe second will be delivered by the end of this year.\n\nIn preparation for higher demand for offshore vessels, Falcon Energy said that it plans to invest in newer vessels.\n\nIts oilfield services and oilfield project divisions continue to do well, despite facing stronger competition and lower margin, it added.\n\nVoyage Research analyst Ng Kian Teck said that even after taking aside the increase in profit from the one-off gain, the outlook for the firm is improving, especially in its marine division.\n\n\"The utilisation rate (of the vessels) has been steadily increasing. In the first half of the year, it was about 75 per cent. In the second half you may see about 85 per cent,\" he said.\n\nMr Ng has a \"buy\" call on the firm with a target price of 55 cents, and expects the group to turn in positive results for the next half of its 2014 financial year.\n\nFalcon Energy recorded a loss of US$4.5 million in the first quarter, after its associate CH Offshore Ltd made an allowance for doubtful trade debts.\n\nFalcon Energy's board has declared an interim dividend of 0.5 cent a share.\n\nThe counter yesterday closed unchanged yesterday at 41 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

However, some check-in counters manned by staff will still be on hand to cater to passengers.\n\nFurthermore, unlike the existing terminals where immigration and pre-boarding security screening take place at different points, these will be centralised at T4, cutting down the number of staff and amount of equipment required. CAG said the area will be designed and managed in a way to prevent bottlenecks.\n\nTo be located on the site of the former Budget Terminal, the hybrid T4 terminal will have a handling capacity of 16 million passengers a year - nearly three-quarters that of Terminal 3 - but at 195,000 square metres will span roughly half of T3's size.\n\nT4 will cater to both full- service and budget airlines, with 17 aircraft parking stands for narrow-body planes and four for wide- body planes. To link T4 to the other terminals so that passengers can catch connecting flights, complimentary shuttle services will run, both landside and airside, for a seamless connection.\n\n\"It will be the first terminal where we fundamentally re-think our check-in processes to add speed and efficiency while reducing manpower needs for our airline partners,\" said CAG's chief executive Lee Seow Hiang at the ground-breaking ceremony yesterday.\n\nTransport Minister Lui Tuck Yew, who was guest- of-honour at the event, said Changi must build capacity to meet growing passenger traffic, especially as travel demand in the Asia-Pacific moves at a clip that is set to make the region the largest aviation market worldwide by 2031.\n\n\"Airports require sufficient capacity to attract new airlines, add new city- links and increase frequencies. Without this, airlines would turn to other airports that can better facilitate their growth, and Changi would risk losing connectivity and consequently, its mantle of being Asia's premier hub,\" he warned.\n\nOther airports in the region are striving to boost capacity, with Kuala Lumpur International Airport seeking to ramp up handling capacity to 100 million passengers per year by 2020 and Hong Kong International aiming to hit 97 million by 2030.\n\nT4 will take Changi's handling capacity to 82 million per year, up from 66 million now, while T5 will be able to handle a massive 50 million passengers per year on its own. Changi's passenger traffic is forecast to grow at about 5 per cent per year for the rest of this decade, from around 51 million in 2012.\n\nAt the sidelines of yesterday's event, AirAsia Singapore chief Logan Velaitham said the charges for airlines to operate at T4 would ultimately play a deciding role in whether the budget carrier relocates from Terminal 1. \"That would be the key driving factor,\" he told BT.\n\nCAG, which has started discussions with airlines, said that charges would be \"reasonable\".\n\nAround $600 million is being invested towards building T4 while a further $680 million will be put aside for supporting infrastructure, such as aircraft parking stands, ancillary buildings as well as road and drainage works.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Washington state officials are also working on incentives to keep the work local.\n\nUnion officials with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents workers at Boeing's Washington state factories, confirmed that they are talking with the company. Boeing declined to comment.\n\nUnder the proposed deal, final assembly of the 777X would be at Boeing's Everett plant near Seattle, home to all its wide-body production except the 787 Dreamliner, whose assembly is split between Everett and North Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nThe plane's expansive wings would be built in the surrounding Puget Sound region, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the talks remain confidential.\n\nTalks are \"in the final stages, but are not done yet\", one source said, adding that the negotiations, which were initiated quietly around a week ago, were \"intense\". The timing of the talks suggests Boeing wants to lock in a labour deal before formally launching the 777X, which is expected at the Dubai Airshow that starts on Nov 17.\n\nIndustry sources say there is pressure on all sides to make concessions. Boeing is keen to control costs on its new 777, as it faces competition from the all-new Airbus A350-1000.\n\nThe talks are aimed at a multi-year extension to the existing machinists' contract expiring in 2016, said one source familiar with the talks.\n\nAnother source said the contract would run until the middle of next decade.\n\nUnder the deal being discussed, machinists could receive a bonus payment if an agreement is approved by union membership, one of the sources said.\n\nHowever, Boeing has warned union leaders it will open talks with other potential locations if the discussions break down, the source added.\n\nBoeing has told the union that in the absence of a deal \"all bets are off\" as to the location of final assembly and wings production, the source said.\n\nA union official confirmed that the talks are taking place and had intensified recently, but declined to be specific.\n\n\"There are and have been discussions about the 777X,\" said Frank Larkin, national spokesman for the machinists. \"I'm unaware of any proposed deal at this point and what shape that deal may or may not take.\"\n\nDesigned to carry up to 406 people on some of the world's longest routes, the 777X is due to enter service in 2020 and is expected to be produced well toward the middle of the century.\n\nThe US planemaker is expected to launch the latest version of its popular 777 mini-jumbo jet with at least 100 orders from Gulf carriers at the Dubai Airshow this month.\n\nBoeing has signalled recently that it was diversifying beyond the Seattle area where the current 777 was designed and is being built. In an internal memo obtained by Reuters last week, Boeing told employees it would place a significant amount of engineering design work for the 777X in a handful of cities around the United States and overseas.\n\nThe dispersal of engineering work was seen as putting pressure on Everett, and Washington state, to prove they could handle the project at low cost compared with other locations.\n\nWashington state also is working on tax cuts and other incentives to help win the 777X work.\n\n\"We've been led to believe the incentives are just as important\" as the labour deal, said Alex Pietsch, director of the Governor's Office of Aerospace for Washington State.\n\nIncentives include a 16-year extension of tax breaks passed in 2003 and set to expire in 2024, and funds to improve roads and transportation to reduce traffic congestion. Boeing says its drivers cover 8.5 million miles a year in Washington state, or close to the Earth's circumference every day.\n\nBoeing's decision on where to build the plane and its advanced composite wings will have long-term implications for the aerospace industry, including its chain of suppliers.\n\nThe location talks also suggest Boeing wants to bring more design and construction under its direct control after costly mistakes from outsourcing much of the 787 Dreamliner.\n\nRob Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said the moves suggest \"a broader trend from Boeing towards more make/less buy in order to control production better, and potentially capture more aftermarket revenue\".\n\nAfter a revamp of its smaller 737, the 777X will be the last major new commercial project on Boeing's drawing board for at least 15 years, and the final choice could determine the location of high-tech composites work for decades to come. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Mr Gross and Mohamed El-Erian, the co-chief investment officers of Pimco, didn't return e-mailed requests for comment.\n\nInvestors started to flee bonds this year on concerns that the US Federal Reserve will taper its bond-buying programme, which could lead to higher interest rates and a decline in fixed-income prices.\n\nStocks have rallied on rising corporate earnings and forecasts that the US economy will accelerate in 2014.\n\nUS bond mutual funds saw net redemptions of US$117 billion in the four months through September, while stock funds received US$35 billion, according to the Investment Company Institute in Washington.\n\nThe Vanguard index fund attracted US$14.5 billion in contributions this year, including US$2.1 billion in October, according to estimates from Chicago- based Morningstar.\n\nMr Gross' fund more than doubled in size between 2008 and 2012 as investors deserted stock funds after the financial crisis for the perceived safety of bonds. The fund attracted US$50.1 billion in 2009 and US$22.6 billion in 2012, Morningstar data show.\n\nPimco Total Return gained 4.8 per cent in 2008 as Mr Gross sidestepped the collapse of the US housing market.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 37 per cent that year, including reinvested dividends.\n\nThe fund trailed 74 per cent of rivals in 2011 as Mr Gross missed a rally in Treasuries. In a letter to clients, he called the year \"a stinker\".\n\nPimco Total Return lagged behind 56 per cent of peers this year and beat 77 per cent over the past five years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Vanguard fund was buoyed by a 27 per cent return in the CRSP US Total Market Index this year, a benchmark that includes stocks of different market capitalisations.\n\nVanguard, the biggest US mutual fund firm, with almost US$2.4 trillion in US fund assets, has grown as the champion of indexing.\n\nIndex funds represent 63 per cent of Vanguard assets, Mr Woerth said. Company founder John Bogle argued that most investors can't beat the market and advised them to buy low-cost funds that track indexes. Vanguard also offers funds in which the managers pick stocks and bonds.\n\nVanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund has more than tripled in size since the end of 2008.\n\nIndexing has also grown with the popularity of exchange-traded funds, nearly all of which mimic indexes and can be traded throughout the day like stocks.\n\nVanguard is the third largest US provider of ETFs, behind Boston-based State Street Corp and New York-based BlackRock Inc, Morningstar data show. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

If accepted, the new fare formula will apply from 2013 to 2017.\n\nIn his Facebook post yesterday, Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew said that he was grateful to see the committee's recommendations focused on ensuring that public transport fares remain affordable for all commuters.\n\n\"We must do this while recognising the need to keep the public transport system in Singapore financially viable,\" said Mr Lui.\n\nPointing to the last fare exercise in 2011, the minister said that the proposal to allow for a smoothening of significant fare increases over two years using a rollover mechanism was \"helpful\". The FRMC proposes that the Public Transport Council be given the discretion to roll over a portion of the quantum of fare adjustment in a particular year to the next fare review exercise.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

At the recent annual conference of the sector's trade association, Interferry, the chief executive of the Britain-based P&O Ferries, Helen Deeble, urged members to speak in a united voice when dealing with governments.\n\nShe said: \"We need to be involved pre-regulation because he who shouts loudest wins. There is a fundamental conflict between our industry, which is essentially long term, and the short-term objectives of politicians. Governments may be huge, unwilling to change course and focused on getting re-elected. But there are some good guys out there and we can promote our industry if we find them.\"\n\nThe 250 conference delegates heard of the political, technical, operational and commercial challenges facing the industry; safety was a recurring theme, with discussions made more poignant by the loss of more than 100 lives in August with the sinking of the Philippine ferry St Thomas Aquinas after a collision.\n\nP&O Ferries fleet director John Garner said that, with 80 per cent of accidents caused by the human element, it was vital to look beyond technical aids and address the \"soft\" side in developing a company-wide safety culture.\n\nJan Helge Pile, the senior vice-president of Marine & Technical at Color Line, agreeing, said there was more to gain - and probably at lower cost - by focusing on the crew.\n\nGrandi Navi Veloci president Roberto Martinoli added: \"Focusing on operational measures would definitely give better results. As an industry, we believe we are over-regulated, but when something happens, we are going to be responsible, even if we have all the certification. That's part of our business, whether we like it or not.\"\n\nNevertheless, there is considerable pressure on the ferry industry to improve design, particularly to prevent a sinking in the event of flooding.\n\nProfessor Dracos Vassalos of the Britain's Strathclyde University welcomed the introduction of goals-based rather than rules-based damage-stability regulations, saying this opens the way for life-cycle risk to be addressed at the design stage.\n\nExpressing alarm over the so-called \"Grandfather Clause\" which exempts existing ships from the new rules, he warned: \"As a result, the bulk of contemporary knowledge is channelled into new ships - (which make up) one per cent of tonnage, leading at best to marginal safety improvements for the whole fleet.\"\n\nProf Vassalos said the \"grandfather provisions\" leave a regulatory gap that undermines and inhibits progress on vulnerability to flooding, and that the disparity between old and new ships was increasingly becoming a chasm.\n\nEven the newest ships could soon be left behind by proposed safety rules. Interferry's executive director of the European Union and IMO Affairs Johan Roos warned that the IMO sub-committee on ship design and construction was expected to consider a proposal to increase the statistical survivability of new ships by adding more bulkheads.\n\nHe said: \"We are deeply concerned that such a measure would jeopardise the entire ro-pax (roll-on, roll-off passenger ship) concept, possibly without adding to the actual safety level.\"\n\nInterferry's view is that, before adding more steel, much more emphasis should be placed on enhanced operational safety. Current regulations only address physical alterations of designs. The trade association argues that enhancements to an already safe ferry system should focus on a different approach: Instead of trying to design a ferry that can withstand any plausible damage, the emphasis should be on avoiding the accident to begin with.\n\nThat could be a hard-sell at IMO. The reality is that the current generation of roll-on, roll-off ferries are far safer than those built 20 years or more ago, but politicians do not easily forget names such as Herald of Free Enterprise and Estonia - and they should also not try.\n\nNevertheless, with accidents continuing to occur on old ferries, such as the St Thomas Aquinas, surely the immediate focus ought to, as Prof Vasallos argues, be on upgrading or replacing those ships.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The one-time \"dark continent\" is now starting to glow. The World Bank projects that its economic growth will average 5.6 per cent this year - respectable even by Asian standards. Eleven of the world's 20 fastest growing economies are now in Africa. The continent also boasts high rates of urbanisation, growth in discretionary incomes and infrastructure spending - all of which have opened up huge investment opportunities.\n\nAlthough the quality of governance is mixed across the continent, there have been major improvements over the last decade in several countries, including Botswana, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. Security concerns, while still present, are nowhere as serious as they were 10 years ago. Africa is also open for business, with fairly liberal economies and investment regimes. Indeed, many studies show that investment returns in both manufacturing and services are higher in some African countries than in even China, India and Indonesia.\n\nWhile a few Singapore companies have been active in Africa for many decades, it is only in recent years that high-profile companies such as Hyflux, Olam and Surbana have ramped up their activities on the continent. But there is reason to believe that Singapore's commercial engagement with Africa is far below potential. Its total trade with the whole continent last year was less than $18 billion, which is slightly more than half of its trade with India and about one-third of its trade with China. Only an estimated 55 Singapore companies operate in Africa, compared to several hundred in each of Asia's larger economies.\n\nThere are many potential opportunities for Singapore companies in Africa, including low-cost manufacturing, energy, telecoms and other infrastructure, urban planning, housing, consulting and advisory services. Moreover, Singapore companies are well positioned to partner those from other countries in the region that are active in Africa, such as companies from China, India and Australia. IE Singapore has a memorandum of understanding with China - the biggest investor in Africa - which can facilitate co-investment by Chinese and Singapore companies. And Singapore has free-trade agreements with both Australia and India, which can help with doing business in third countries.\n\nThere are also local organisations such as the Africa Business Group, established by the Singapore Business Federation that can help pave the way to doing business on the continent through the sharing of knowledge and contacts. Singapore companies should consider placing Africa on their radar screens -it's certainly not too early to explore the opportunities on offer in this underexplored and promising frontier market.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

He also served on the boards of various public service organisations.\n\nMr Cheng came to Singapore from Hong Kong in 1974 to take over the Wing Tai business that had been founded by his father and uncle in 1963. Back then, Wing Tai was a garment manufacturer.\n\nMr Cheng made the move into property, foreseeing its potential. Wing Tai is now known for luxury projects, such as Helios Residences at Cairnhill and the upcoming Le Nouvel Ardmore. The group is also in the retail business, behind international brands such as Topshop and Uniqlo in Singapore.\n\nMeanwhile, the hunt for Temasek Holdings' next chief executive to succeed its current CEO Ho Ching goes on. Its chairman said soon after his appointment that the investment firm will continue its search until a suitable candidate is found.\n\n\"Then we will have to judge whether the timing is right for us to make a CEO change,\" Mr Lim had said. \"It is about the right person first, then the right time.\"\n\nIn July, then-chairman Mr Dhanabalan said that Temasek also had plans to add more non-Singaporeans to the Temasek board. He said that, given that Temasek and its stable of Singapore-based firms have grown more global, their boards have to change to reflect that.\n\nTemasek owns a $215 billion portfolio as at March 31, 2013, with 71 per cent of its underlying assets in Asia and 25 per cent in the mature economies of North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yesterday, he emerged from the shadows to defend the BOJ's record in contributing to the country's improving economic situation.\n\nThe highly upbeat tone of his public remarks is likely to reassure financial markets that Abenomics is still firmly on track, analysts said.\n\n\"What I recognised when I assumed the role of the governor of the Bank of Japan in March this year was that we must bring Japan's economy out of deflation that has lasted for almost 15 years,\" he told business leaders in Osaka.\n\n\"The greatest challenge facing Japan's economy in the immediate future is a prompt overcoming of deflation, and the role the bank has to play to that end is critical.\"\n\nThe BOJ's policy of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing \"has been steadily exerting its intended effects\", he said.\n\n\"Japan's economy is expected to grow above its potential as a trend, amid a continued virtuous cycle among production, income and spending, and is likely to steadily follow a path towards achieving a 2 per cent price stability target,\" he noted.\n\n\"Since the turn of the year, real GDP has registered high growth of about 4 per cent on an annualised basis for two consecutive quarters (and) while exports have generally been picking up at a somewhat slower pace, domestic demand, notably private consumption and public investment, has been firm,\" he said.\n\n\"Domestic demand is likely to maintain firmness as external demand is expected to increase the virtuous cycle among production and income, and spending is likely to be maintained. Japan's real GDP growth in fiscal 2013 is now projected (at) 2.7 per cent, partly reflecting a front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike.\"\n\n\"What sets Japan's current economic recovery apart from past false dawns is that it is domestic demand-led, with the non-manufacturing sector as the main driver,\" the BOJ governor noted.\n\nMr Kuroda rejected criticisms by many economists that Abenomics policies were not leading to an increase in wages and personal consumption cannot continue to increase in this situation.\n\nHe said the employment situation continued to improve moderately but steadily, with both the unemployment rate and the ratio of job offers to applicants having almost recovered to the level before the Lehman shock. \"There has also been an increasing sense of a labour shortage on the firms' side,\" he added.\n\n\"This improvement in the employment situation has started to influence wages. The year-on-year rate of change in nominal wages per employee has gradually stopped declining on the whole, partly due to growth in summer bonuses for the first time in three years.\"\n\nThe improving trend in the employment situation is likely to continue as the economy recovers moderately, and nominal wages per employee are expected to be put under upward pressure gradually, Mr Kuroda argued.\n\n\"From a somewhat longer-term perspective, wages will likely show a clear uptrend as the effects of tightening supply and demand conditions in the labour market emerge and inflation expectations rise.\"\n\nAbenomics has also been criticised on the grounds that it is not leading to any significant improvement in private capital investment.\n\nMr Kuroda dismissed this criticism as well.\n\n\"Reflecting the major feature of the economic recovery this time, business fixed investment has been resilient in the non-manufacturing sector,\" he noted, adding that there were also signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector.\n\nResponding to concerns that the proposed two-stage hike in the national consumption tax from next April could derail economic recovery, Mr Kuroda said: \"While there will be a swing due to the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand, Japan's economy is likely to continue growing at a pace above its potential, as a trend.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

All three recorded better than expected Q3 earnings due mainly to good growth in broad-based customer-related businesses with credit quality remaining strong.\n\nDBS posted a net profit of $862 million, up one per cent year on year, despite getting the call on tapering wrong.\n\nAt the bank's results presentation, Mr Gupta said: \"We basically got the call on Fed tapering wrong.\"\n\nThe market had expected the US Federal Reserve to begin pulling back on its quantitative easing or bond purchases in September and when it didn't happen, bond prices rallied.\n\n\"We pared down some of our Treasury holdings in the long-end and took out hedges for some of our Treasury positions. Clearly when the Fed didn't taper . . . the hedges . . . went out of the money,\" he said.\n\nSeptember trading income fell to $32 million, from the monthly average of $95 million for Q2.\n\nAt OCBC, net trading income too fell to $47 million in Q3, from $144 million in Q2. OCBC's Q3 net profit fell 59 per cent to $759 million, from $1.85 billion a year earlier, which included a divestment gain of $1.126 billion.\n\nExcluding the non-core gains last year from the divestment of stakes in Fraser and Neave and Asia Pacific Breweries, the core net profit of $759 million was actually 5 per cent higher than the year-ago quarter's core earnings of $724 million. It also beat the $658 million average of eight estimates in a Bloomberg survey.\n\nWhat stood out in Q3, as was the case in Q2, was the continued brisk loan expansion for the banks.\n\nMr Gupta said DBS has been gaining market share in both business loans and mortgages.\n\nDBS' total loans grew 19 per cent year on year while its Singapore loans rose 18 per cent year on year.\n\nData from the Monetary Authority of Singapore showed that September lending for the industry grew 15.7 per cent year on year, up from August's 15.4 per cent but down from July's 17.6 per cent.\n\nOCBC said Q3 loans growth was up 16 per cent year on year but Singapore loans rose a slower 11 per cent. OCBC's core non-interest income was strong, underpinned by higher fee income and better insurance performance from its Great Eastern Holdings unit.\n\nFees and commissions rose 16 per cent year on year to a quarterly record while profit from insurance was up 26 per cent.\n\nUOB said loans gained 15.8 per cent year on year while Singapore loans rose a faster 18.4 per cent.\n\nIt was also the only bank among the three which saw its net interest margin stabilising at 1.71 per cent, unchanged from the previous quarter.\n\nDBS and OCBC said their net interest margins continued to slide, due to the low interest rate environment and repricing of Singapore mortgage loans. For DBS, it was down two basis points from a quarter ago while it was one point lower for OCBC.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Gupta said DBS expects full-year 2013 loans growth at 15 per cent. For 2014, loans should grow 8-10 per cent, he said.\n\nOCBC chief executive Samuel Tsien said OCBC will seek growth opportunities mainly in its key overseas markets of Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China as the higher margins elsewhere make up for the slim ones at home. Hence, Singapore's contribution to group revenue, which stands at about 60 per cent, may dip below that level.\n\nUOB loans pipeline remains healthy and the bank is confident of achieving low to mid-teens loans growth for full year 2013, said Jimmy Koh, managing director, investor relations.\n\n\"For 2014, despite global moderation, we are expecting high single-digit loans growth due to projected resilient pan-regional trade flows. While mortgage approvals have come down, UOB's mortgage growth has remained resilient due to a strong pipeline,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The majority, or 19 out of the 30 stocks in the Straits Times Index, are expected to hand out better payouts in the next 12 months, with three expected to pay special dividends, said Markit Dividend Research.\n\nBut while payouts are expected to be better, the picture is somewhat gloomy in dividend yield terms, especially in banks and telcos, and that is because share prices have risen.\n\n\"Focusing on dividends for the next 12 months to be declared by stocks in the FTSE Straits Times index, we expect 19 out of the 30 stocks to raise their returns to shareholders and six to cut them. The remaining stocks are projected to maintain zero dividend growth,\" said Markit in its first research piece on Singapore dividends.\n\nIt forecasts three to pay special dividends.\n\n\"Sembcorp Marine and Singapore Technologies Engineering have been paying special dividends consistently for the last four years at least, so we believe it will continue to pay them unless circumstances become dire.\n\n\"Separately, Sembcorp Industries had declared specials in FY'10 and FY'11 but chose to omit it in FY'12. On better projected earnings for the current fiscal year and one-off gains from the IPO of Salalah, we think that this year's payout could be augmented by a special dividend,\" said Markit.\n\nSembcorp had owned 60 per cent of Salalah which went public in September, and was required to dispose of a 20 per cent stake for the IPO.\n\nDBS Group Research in August estimated that Sembcorp would book $109 million from the IPO.\n\nYield chasers should brace for falling yields from the index stocks.\n\n\"Comparing the expected 12-month forward dividend yield with the corresponding period a year ago, yields have fallen for more than half of the stocks in the index,\" said Markit.\n\n\"Based on our current dividend forecasts, five out of 10 sectors will see a lower average yield for the 12 months ahead. These are the banks, industrial goods & services, media, real estate and telco sectors.\"\n\nBanks are the main drivers of dividends in the STI, accounting for over 20 per cent of aggregate dividends paid by all the stocks in the index last year, said Markit. \"We expect dividends to edge up for all three banks in the coming year, but expect yields for OCBC and DBS Group Holdings to trend lower, falling 24 basis points (bp) and 42 bp to 3.4 per cent and 3.47 per cent respectively.\"\n\nSeparately, the dividend yield for United Overseas Bank is projected to rise 7 bp to 3.63 per cent this year, it said. UOB declared a special dividend of 10 cents in FY'12. \"We do not expect this to happen again this year, but are forecasting a growth in regular dividends so that the total payout meets its historical target of 40 per cent and above.\"\n\nSingTel and StarHub have always maintained a high dividend payout based on the proportion of earnings, it said. Earlier at its Q1 release, SingTel guided for the group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to decline by a low single digit level for FY'14 on a weaker Australian dollar outlook.\n\n\"We expect dividends to stay flat, even if this could represent a payout slightly higher than its targeted range of 60-75 per cent of underlying earnings.\"\n\nStarHub, on the other hand, has guided flat dividends for the remaining two quarterly dividends this year. \"Despite higher capex, given that the uncertainty of the 4G spectrum pricing is over, we think there is scope for increased dividends in FY'14 alongside improved earnings.\n\n\"This would come after four years of flat dividend growth. In yield terms, projected yields for SingTel and StarHub are at 4.50 per cent and 4.90 per cent respectively.\"\n\nBoth are lower than the year-ago yields of 5.25 per cent and 5.38 per cent.\n\nTop yielders are trusts and SPH.\n\nBoth Hutchison Port Holdings Trust and Capitamall Trust aim to maintain full distribution of profits to shareholders, it said.\n\nHPHT leads the pack with a projected yield of 6.83 per cent. A year ago, HPHT dividends would have yielded investors 8.16 per cent, it said. \"We do not expect the absolute level of dividends for the next couple of years at least to reach 2012 levels as it had struggled to meet the previous year's dividend commitment with a deferral of capital expenditure.\"\n\nFor SPH, last year was a bumper year for shareholders with a special payout arising from the listing of SPH Reit.

The unabashed gold bug's Euro Pacific Capital Inc manages a US$20 million mutual fund that invests in stocks related to gold and lost 6.4 per cent since it began in July. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Gold and Silver Index slid 1.5 per cent in the same period.\n\nMr Schiff, 50, isn't fazed that gold is heading for its first annual price drop in 13 years, or that Goldman Sachs Group Inc has called it a \"slam-dunk sell\". He predicts that bullion will reverse its 21 per cent year-to-date decline and probably surge 52 per cent to reach a record US$2,000 an ounce within a year. That's just the beginning: Mr Schiff said that he would \"be amazed\" if the US dollar didn't collapse and gold failed to skyrocket before President Barack Obama leaves office in 2017.\n\n\"I'm waiting for the dollar crash, I'm waiting for the real crisis to hit that I know will benefit gold,\" Mr Schiff said on Oct 18. \"The longer it takes, the longer I have to wait for that payday. But the longer it takes, the bigger that payday is going to be.\"\n\nWith inflation at or below the Fed's 2 per cent target for the past 11 months, the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index reaching record levels and the US dollar strengthening against major currencies in the past year, Mr Schiff knows his forecasts make some people laugh. He's used to it. They also scoffed in 2006 when he predicted on television that housing prices would plunge, lenders would go bankrupt and stocks would plummet, as they did two years later.\n\n\"They should take him seriously - he was right with a lot of other ones,\" Ron Paul, the former Republican Representative from Texas who has called for abolishing the Federal Reserve and auditing the US gold depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, said on Oct 23. Mr Schiff was an economic adviser to Mr Paul's presidential campaign in 2007.\n\nMr Schiff's predictions don't persuade Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Mr Obama.\n\nGold bugs, investors who buy the metal as protection against a collapse in financial assets, fail to understand that the Fed's pumping money into the economy only offsets banks' tighter lending and stockpiling cash, Mr Goolsbee said. Until credit conditions return to \"normal\", there's no danger of inflation, he said.\n\n\"They have been saying that for literally four-plus years, and they have been egregiously wrong,\" Mr Goolsbee said on Oct 30. \"As a matter of mathematics, they're just adding up the numbers incorrectly to say that they think there's going to be 200 per cent inflation.\"\n\nJeff Currie, the head of commodities research at New York-based Goldman Sachs, said at an Oct 8 conference in London that gold would fall after lawmakers reached a deal on the US debt limit. Mr Schiff went on CNBC Europe to say that Goldman Sachs had it backwards: allowing more government debt would push gold higher.\n\nGold, which closed at US$1,316.20 an ounce on Nov 1, will decline to US$1,050 by the end of 2014 as the US economy improves, the US dollar strengthens and the Fed reduces its bond-buying programme, Goldman Sachs analysts said in an Oct 18 report.\n\n\"Nobody really understands gold prices and I don't pretend to really understand them either,\" Fed chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee in July. Other central banks kept expanding reserves after gold peaked in 2011, losing US$545 billion in value.\n\nAssumptions such as Mr Currie's on why investors have lost faith in gold as a store of value are false, according to Mr Schiff. The economy is only growing because of government spending, so debt continues to swell, he said.\n\nTo hold interest rates low, the Fed will have to keep buying bonds, which means printing more dollars, Mr Schiff said. Foreign countries use them to buy US bonds - in effect lending the US more money to pay back what's already owed. Governments such as China eventually will balk, he says. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Her public mien is gentle and engaging, qualities that are likely to expedite her confirmation process and also influence her leadership of the Fed.\n\nThings were not always so in Fed land. Historically, Fed chairmen ran the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) with iron hands, imposing their will on their colleagues and policy and often dropping policy shifts as unexpected shocks on the markets and the economy. However, the Alan Greenspan Fed embarked on a practice of driving policy more by consensus among FOMC members, with regular public statements as to the intentions of Fed policy and the likelihood or inevitability of future policy changes. Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has intensified each of these trends, and we would expect chairman Yellen to follow suit.\n\nEven apart from collegiality, there is reason to think that a Yellen Fed would be at least as communicative as its two predecessors. Short-term interest rates remain at the zero bound. The US banking system, the traditional transmission mechanism from Fed policy to the economy, is still essentially flat on its back. The one policy tool the Fed has left in its arsenal is forward guidance on its intended future path of short rates. To maximise the usefulness of forward guidance, a Yellen Fed would need to be just as communicative as Mr Bernanke's.\n\nMs Yellen would certainly bring an activist stance to Fed policy. Her statements indicate that she believes current employment levels are too low and that she believes it's the Fed's responsibility to address that problem. How would she go about that? Her writings provide insight here. Ms Yellen's recent statements offer two alternatives to the Taylor Rule, which has achieved some credence among policymakers and economists in recent decades.\n\nThe Taylor Rule provides a formula describing how short-term interest rates should be adjusted in response to shifts in inflation and real growth. If inflation were at its target with real GDP (gross domestic product) at full-employment trend levels, as understood by the Fed, then the funds rate should be set at two percentage points above the inflation rate. Each percentage point move in inflation above target should elicit a 0.5 per cent hike in the funds rate and vice versa, and each percentage point move in real GDP below target should elicit a 0.5 per cent point cut in the funds rate, and vice versa. Notice that the Taylor Rule responds equally forcefully to movements in real GDP away from target as to movements in inflation.\n\nMs Yellen has proposed what she calls a balanced approach, consistent with her concern about low employment levels stemming from a weak economy. Such an approach would take the same basic structure as the Taylor Rule, but react twice as forcefully to movements in GDP as to movements in inflation.\n\nThus, if real GDP were 1.0 per cent below target and inflation 1.0 per cent above target, this approach would still call for short rates to be 0.5 per cent below their \"normal\" level, 1.5 per cent above the inflation rate. (The Taylor rule was introduced by Stanford economist John Taylor in his 1993 paper Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice. He formulated the rule as an equation describing how Fed policy could be said to have operated over 1987-92.)\n\nNow, what relevance do these rules have when the funds rate is essentially at zero and further cuts are impossible? For example, presently, most formulations of trend GDP growth and inflation targets would prescribe a negative funds rate even under the Taylor Rule and all the more so under a balanced approach. Desired funds rates would have been even more negative during and just after the 2008-09 recession. If the funds rate can't be lowered to the (negative) desired levels, an alternative approach is to guide forward rates lower for a long period of time in the hope that guidance lowers present term yields to much the same levels as would hold if the funds rate were at the negative levels the Fed desires but can't attain.\n\nThis gets us back to forward guidance. It also paves the way for the optimal control approach Ms Yellen has introduced. Under that approach, different forward paths for the funds rate would be run through the Fed's macro model of the economy, and the resulting estimated paths for inflation and real GDP would be fed into a \"loss function\" that rates the outcomes based on the amounts of deviation of each from desired paths. The policy path with the best loss function result would then be the path the Fed would announce and embark on. The idea here is that by including in the mix not only present but also future outcomes - or at least the Fed's estimates of future outcomes - a Yellen Fed could determine the optimal amount of forward guidance to provide to markets today in order to overcome the zero-bound constraint.\n\nIn an ideal world, optimal control would work perfectly. Of course, in an ideal world, we wouldn't need models, nor forward guidance nor even a Fed. So, what possible real-world challenges might arise?\n\nFirst, there is reason to think Fed models' estimates will prove inaccurate. If inflation and GDP behave differently from model specifications, prescribed policies could be sub-optimal.\n\nSecond, we've predicted that a Yellen Fed would be as consensus-driven as its immediate predecessors, but it is hard to envision what there would be to reach consensus on, should policy be model-driven. Fed district presidents will not have as much influence as Board members over the structure of the Fed Board's model or the loss function employed. However, once these are chosen, policy is all but determined, and it is not clear what would then be left to reach consensus on. On what grounds could dissent be voiced or prevail? Similarly, should the model or the policy prescriptions prove unsatisfactory, how could a Yellen Fed gracefully back away from them?\n\nA third issue is whether an optimal control policy is indeed a policy rule at all. Taylor and others meant for his rule to impose discipline on policymakers and minimise their discretion. It is clear that Ms Yellen has introduced both the balanced approach and the optimal control approach in order to achieve more leeway - if not discretion - than the Taylor Rule affords. Also, it is hard to know whether periodic \"refits\" of the Fed model or the loss function would be free of discretion. So, the credibility of an optimal control policy would be an issue.\n\nOf course, the same could be said with respect to Fed forward guidance. Just because the Fed announces it will keep short rates at zero until mid-2015 and thereafter raise them only gradually doesn't necessarily mean it will actually act thus.\n\nAnd, if forward guidance is not credible within the markets, its impact on yields and on the economy is suspect. In the same way, optimal control policy in practice would only be as optimal as it is credible and understandable to the public. Economists call this the \"time inconsistency\" issue with policy pronouncements. Optimal-control policy announcements would be just as subject to this issue as the announcements we now receive.\n\nIn other words, the success of an optimal policy approach would be dependent in part on the avoidance of disconnects between Fed intentions/announcements and market reactions. An example of such disconnects is provided by the bond market's selloff this spring and summer in response to the Fed's \"guidance\" on possible tapering of quantitative easing (QE) and Mr Bernanke's subsequent displeasure.\n\nNote also that tapering of QE is a much simpler concept than policy paths arising from model simulations and loss functions.\n\nMr Greenspan's policies were applauded - at the time at least - for their simplicity and clarity. Amid the upheaval of the last six years, Mr Bernanke has resorted to more complex operations with less than clearly satisfactory results. Ms Yellen appears willing to up the ante yet further, by possibly resorting to model-driven policy that may be hard to explain clearly to the markets.\n\nThe balanced approach she proffers in her writings provides a reasonably clear policy rule. It would provide Ms Yellen more scope to address her policy concerns, but not unlimited leeway, and it would require retrenchment when and as the occasion arises (that is, when GDP and unemployment have attained their targets).\n\nIn the near term, none of this makes much difference. The time for tightening is far away. Meanwhile, Ms Yellen should be credited for advancing the discussion of Fed policymaking and transparency. Whatever one might think of her proposed policy approaches, she has introduced and discussed them openly and well in advance of the day when they might take hold. This itself is yet another advance from the lack of communication that characterised Fed policymaking in prior decades.\n\nThe writer is product manager/economist with Western Asset Management, a wholly owned affiliate of Legg Mason Global Asset Management\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The median estimate of seven forecasts collated by Bloomberg was 51. A reading above 50 denotes expansion while one under 50 points to contraction.\n\n\"The stronger PMI reading suggests that growth momentum could strengthen in Q4,\" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch economist Chua Hak Bin. With this, he expects the government to raise its full-year GDP growth forecast to between 3.5 and 4 per cent, from the current 2.5-3.5 per cent forecast.\n\nUnderpinned by further expansion in new orders, new export orders and higher output, October's stronger PMI also reinforces the surprise surge in September's factory output that the Economic Development Board reported two Fridays ago.\n\nElectronics manufacturers, whose output surged 20 per cent in September, also reported higher activity levels in the latest PMI survey. The electronics PMI rose to 51 in October from 50.3 in September, SIPMM said. Sub-indices showed growth in both local and foreign new orders, as well as higher output.\n\n\"Overall inventory continued to contract for the third consecutive month, indicating that the new orders could be expected to beef up production and imports in the coming months,\" said Janice Ong, executive director of SIPMM, which compiles the monthly index from its poll of more than 150 industrial companies' purchasing managers.\n\nThe drop in inventories - the overall inventory sub-index fell to 48.9 while that for electronics sank to 46.4 - suggested that producers are either finally shipping them out, or writing excess inventory off, said Barclays economist Joey Chew. \"In any case, it's good for manufacturing and exports to get rid of this inventory hangover,\" she said.\n\nGlobally, the latest PMIs for the US, Europe, China, Korea and Taiwan, which have all shown expansion in manufacturing, bode well for an export recovery too.\n\n\"Despite the dip in consumer sentiment in October from the US government shutdown and fiscal drama, it appears that producers and retailers are still gearing up for a strong Christmas shopping season,\" said Ms Chew.\n\nIf, however, Singapore's export performance continues to diverge from industrial production as it has in recent months, that may flag a loss of competitiveness. With inventories now correcting, the only explanation for a export-production gap would be that Singapore's producers have cut export prices and sacrificed profit margins to secure orders, Ms Chew said.\n\nBut SIPMM's Ms Ong reckons that lower input costs may have helped. \"Factory output has been boosted by lower input prices, suggesting that our local manufacturers have been focusing on cost-reduction strategies to stimulate demands of their manufactured goods,\" she said.\n\nLooking at the details of the PMI report, Mizuho Bank economist Vishnu Varathan said there was insufficient evidence in the data so far of significant manufacturing growth.\n\nThough the appreciable uptick in employment sub-indices does set a \"fairly upbeat tone for Q4\", the smaller rise in new export orders shows uncertainty over whether the rebound in global demand will last. \"The danger is being carried away with one round of rather effervescent data, whereas the underlying reality is more grounded,\" he noted.\n\nAfter all, businesses themselves are less optimistic than before, said OCBC economist Selena Ling.\n\nEDB's recent quarterly business expectations survey showed that more manufacturers expect the business outlook to deteriorate over the next six months than those who expect improvement. A quarter earlier, the number who were optimistic outnumbered the pessimistic.\n\nIn any case, Q4 will not be without its challenges. Mr Varathan believes export demand could be dampened if fiscal uncertainty in the US holds back business activity, or if the lagged effects of the stronger Singapore dollar cascade down to manufacturing.\n\nVolatile external demand dynamics aside, ANZ economist Daniel Wilson said local producers will \"continue to contend with increased cost pressures driven by rising rents and wages\" through Q4 and into 2014.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The UK banking industry avoided the market following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 because of regulatory requirements to meet stricter capital rules.\n\nGreater competition on commercial property loans has narrowed lending margins by as much as two percentage points in the past year, said Anthony Myers, a real estate executive at Blackstone Group. With UK commercial property values rising for the first time since 2011 and balance sheets on the mend, British banks are increasingly willing to offer loans backing offices, stores, and industrial properties.\n\n\"Having to compete against the renascent energy being shown by the banks, the amount of fat in the margins has been squeezed out considerably,\" said Ashley Goldblatt, head of real estate lending at Legal & General (L&G) Group's investment management unit. The company set up its real estate lending business three years ago and is on track to have loaned \u00a3500 million (S$992.5 million) by the year-end.\n\nFifty real estate lenders entered the market in the 12 months through June, according to London-based broker Savills. Aviva, Great-West Lifeco's Canada Life, Jones Lang LaSalle's LaSalle Investment Management affiliate, and Prudential's M&G Investments unit are among companies that have loaned \u00a3100 million or more on deals in the past year, said William Newsom, a senior director at Savills.\n\nGreater competition is narrowing interest rate margins and starting to slow the influx of new entrants, Mr Newsom said in e-mailed comments.\n\n\"I'm sceptical about the amount of business the senior debt funds are likely to do because interest-rate margins have come down,\" Mr Newsom said. \"They have to provide investors with a certain level of return, so they're in a bit of a bind.\"\n\nBritish lenders showed increased willingness to provide commercial property debt for the fourth straight quarter in the three months through September and that's expected to continue through the end of the year, according to the Bank of England's quarterly credit conditions survey.\n\n\"The improved economic climate and business confidence levels in recent months has seen an uplift in the commercial real estate market in general and hence an increase in demand for finance from a range of providers,\" Susan Geddes, managing director of structured real estate finance at Banco Santander's UK unit, said in e-mailed comments.\n\nLloyds Banking and Banco Santander have increased their commercial-property lending in the past six to nine months, Chris Bates, head of European real estate finance at Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers said by phone. The company, which has US$28 billion of debt investments in the US, started lending for UK real estate a year ago and now has a \u00a3260 million loan book.\n\n\"This increasing liquidity has meant pricing in London in particular has come down quite dramatically,\" Mr Bates said.\n\nThe UK commercial real estate values rose for the fifth straight month in September, posting the biggest gain since April 2010, Investment Property Databank said on Oct 14. The recovery in commercial property prices has also helped attract banks back to the loan market.\n\nBanks and building societies provided 85 per cent of all loans to commercial property companies last year, according to data compiled by De Montfort University in Leicester, England.\n\n\"The reason banks only did 85 per cent last year is because, for the majority of the year, they had to pull their reins in,\" L&G's Mr Goldblatt said. \"This year, they're back out in force.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

Under the company's construction segment, revenue remained at the $68 million mark.\n\nFor the property investments segment, quarterly revenue halved to $449,000 because no rental income came from its vacated Queen Street property in Melbourne, Australia, which is being redeveloped as Tower Melbourne.\n\nDespite property development revenue fluctuations, net profit for the quarter did not drop as much.\n\nPre-tax profit was boosted by a $27.9 million share of results from associates, up sharply from $186,000 a year ago.

More than just a piece of plastic, Mauritius's new ID card contains an electronic chip that stores each citizen's fingerprint and biometric data.\n\nThis is one of many projects in which both countries are partnering at the government level, fronted here by the Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (SCE).\n\nEstablished in 2006, SCE shares Singapore's public sector expertise with interested foreign parties, with the aim of generating economic spin-offs for the private sector here.\n\nApart from offering visit programmes and training initiatives to foreign governments, SCE manages and implements overseas projects. By pooling public and private sector expertise, SCE tailors solutions to match foreign countries' needs.\n\nSaid SCE's chief executive officer, Kong Wy Mun: \"It's difficult for a company to go directly into an unfamiliar emerging market, because they can't be sure whether the government may change the rules halfway, whether they can negotiate for good terms, or whether they can even receive payment at the end of it.\n\n\"But when we come in as a government entity and contract on their behalf, we help to mitigate these risks for companies. With our access to a foreign country's top leaders, we can ensure that things are transparent and done properly.\n\n\"Likewise, for the foreign government they feel assured contracting through us because they know we are not a fly-by-night entity. Some governments have been played out before with companies that over-promise, so naturally they can be hesitant to contract other foreign companies directly. So it makes sense for (both our) Singapore businesses and the governments we partner,\" noted Mr Kong.\n\nRetired civil servants with deep knowledge of Singapore's nation-building experience are sometimes called in to assist with overseas projects. For instance, SCE has worked with the former CEO of the Central Provident Fund Board, Liew Heng San, and SPRING Singapore ex head honcho Lee Suan Hiang.\n\nWhile SCE has only recently moved into Africa, it is finding that the continent abounds with opportunities.\n\n\"When we first started, Africa was really a very very small component of our total project value,\" said Neo Poh Ling, director, Sub-Saharan Africa, SCE.\n\nIn the next three years, SCE estimates that Africa will make up at least 60 per cent of the group's total project value. To date, it has done about $90 million worth of projects on the continent - a long way from its initial $4 million figure in 2008.\n\nNational ID project\n\nPart of this includes its various partnerships with Mauritius - a country almost three times Singapore's size and with a population of 1.3 million. Collaboration between the two nations was first sparked after Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam was impressed with Singapore's system of managing identity documents and its national registry database while on a visit to the city-state five years ago.\n\nKO Fong Weng-Poorun, senior chief executive in the Prime Minister's Office, told The Business Times: \"At the time, we were already looking to replace our ID cards - which dated back to 1986 and were just paper-based cards - so we decided to knock at the door of Singapore.\"\n\nSCE brought together a team of experts, helmed by Singapore e-government company CrimsonLogic, to analyse Mauritius's needs.\n\nPrior to the launch of its new ID card - which sports a soft pink colour similar to Singapore's NRIC - Mauritius's national registry consisted of three handwritten ledgers dating back to the 1800s: a blue book for births, a black one for deaths and a red book for marriages.\n\nBut data sets were often incomplete and incorrect, because surnames were not updated after marriages occurred, which sometimes led to double counting. Whole fields were often missing, too. No back-up copies were available either, which posed a security risk.\n\n\"Sometimes people say that our ID project is just about producing a card. But it's (so much more than) that - it's the management of the database, making sure the information is secure,\" said Mrs Fong Weng-Poorun.\n\nThe new card, launched in October, allows Mauritians to set up a bank account without their birth certificate and proof of current address, since this information is stored on the card.\n\nThe government has plans to integrate the card with future e-government systems, including health and tax services. So far, the country has spent 1.1 billion Mauritian rupees (S$50 million) on its ID project.\n\n\"If we are serious about improving Mauritius's position as a thriving economy and a business hub, we need to have the facilities to achieve this objective. You cannot have a modern country and have a small piece of paper as your identity card,\" added Mrs Fong Weng-Poorun.\n\nOther collaborations\n\nIn addition to the national ID card scheme, SCE is collaborating with the Mauritian government to build a light rail transit system as well as improve its prison security framework.\n\nR Jayachandran, Singapore's High Commissioner to Mauritius, believes there is scope for future partnerships. \"Given that Mauritius is also an island state like Singapore, our wealth of expertise and experience in managing air and sea ports is perhaps one area we could explore with Mauritius in the near future.\"\n\nMauritius has also turned to Singapore for help with its water management processes. It loses about 60 per cent of its water because of 100-year-old worn-out pipes. This results in island-wide water shortages and rationing, and some residents even lack access to water, sometimes for up to 12 hours.\n\nDev Aukle, general manager of Mauritius's Central Water Authority, told BT: \"Singapore is helping us realise that there are other ways to (minimise) water losses. Maybe we don't have to change all the pipes but we can pay closer attention to managing what we already have, perhaps with more sophisticated detection equipment.\"\n\nSCE's team includes Singapore's PUB and environmental services firm CH2M Hill, who are working to bring down the amount of water lost in Mauritius from 60 per cent to 25 per cent. Singapore loses only 5 per cent of its water.\n\n\"It's important to remember that Singapore stands as an example because we've done this before,\" said Kumar Nadarajah, principal engineer at CH2M Hill. \"Like Singapore, Mauritius is an island, it is water-stressed, and I think the main Singapore story is that it has turned adversity into success. So why can't Mauritius do the same?\"\n\nTaking a different angle, Alvin Lim, SCE's director for Middle East, North Africa, Central Asia and Latin America who oversaw the national ID card project, reckons Singapore has much to learn from the countries it assists.\n\n\"I think these collaborations offer us good opportunities to examine ourselves, and understand what we can do better. If we don't do that, we may fall into the trap of thinking that our way is the right way, the only way,\" said Mr Lim.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The airline's fiscal year runs to the end of March.\n\nRyanair added that net profit rose 1.0 per cent to 602 million euros in the group's first half, or in the six months to the end of September, as traffic rose 2.0 per cent to 49 million passengers.\n\n\"We are pleased to report slightly increased first half profits, particularly against a backdrop of softer fares this summer,\" Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said in the statement.\n\nAside from exchanges with customers on Twitter and plans for a simplified website, Ryanair is also seeking to improve its public image as it flies into tougher market competition.\n\nCustomers being hit by fines at the airport for failing to print off their tickets and for carrying too much weight in their luggage are among some of the biggest grievances, even if Ryanair's policy is posted on its website.\n\nRyanair recently simplified its online booking process, and will launch a new homepage later this month, after customers regularly complained about the confusing and long procedure.\n\nThe airline also said it would allow passengers to carry a second bag of hand luggage from December.\n\nRyanair's chief operating officer Michael Cawley has said that while changes are being introduced, there will not be a shift from the basic principles that transformed Ryanair into one of the biggest carriers in Europe.\n\n\"The idea that there's going to be wholesale changes is wrong. There's some changes announced and there will be more changes but we don't want to throw out what's good about Ryanair,\" he told an aviation conference in Dublin last month.\n\n\"We need to be perhaps a little bit less vigorous in the implementation of (our policies). When we're taking 70 euros from someone for a bag that doesn't fit we should do it not with glee but with sympathy,\" he added.\n\nRyanair had in September issued a shock profit warning that it blamed on intense competition and falling airfares, sparking a share-price plunge across Europe's airlines sector which highlighted its influence on the market.\n\nFollowing the profit warning, outspoken chief executive, Mr O'Leary declared that the company would strive to be less abrasive.\n\n\"I'm conscious that we need to eliminate a lot of minor things that irritate,\" Mr O'Leary told the company's annual general meeting (AGM).\n\n\"We do need to soften the image when things go wrong. We need to be quicker and more responsive.\"\n\nIn summing up he added: \"We should try to eliminate things that unnecessarily pisses people off.\"\n\nThe airline came under fire in the run-up to the AGM for charging a Dublin-based neurosurgeon 188 euros to change flights after his wife and three children were killed in a house fire in England.\n\nThe airline later apologised to the customer.\n\nMr O'Leary also admitted that the company needed to reduce its \"macho\" culture and subsequently took part in a rather amusing but forthright question-and-answer session on social-media site Twitter, under the hashtag GrillMOL.\n\nDonal O'Neill, aviation analyst with Goodbody stockbrokers, said that September's profit warning should be distinguished from the customer service changes.\n\n\"They're partly related long term but in the near term they are quite different issues,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"In order to differentiate itself and in order to keep growing, Ryanair has to offer a slightly different product to its passengers and that's with a longer-term view to appeal to those kinds of consumers that traditionally used legacy carriers (like British Airways and German airline Lufthansa).\n\n\"A lot of these services are focused on trying to continue to take traffic from those carriers and also to try to win new traffic and maybe slightly higher-end traffic,\" Mr O'Neill added.\n\nRyanair transported almost 81 million passengers across Europe in the year to the end of October, its own data revealed on Friday.\n\nRyanair added that from February it will move to fully-allocated seating on all flights, ensuring that families sit together. - AFP\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

It will be developing the project on a 99-year leasehold site that it clinched in April.\n\nIt paid $1,162.86 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), a record for 99-year private housing land offered at a state tender. The group is targeting to launch the condo in the first half of next year, said a KepLand spokeswoman.\n\nMCC Land received URA's provisional nod to develop a 599-unit condo in Tampines Avenue 10.\n\nOn a freehold site on Hoe Chiang Road in the Tanjong Pagar area where Keppel Towers and GE Tower currently stand, KepLand unit Mansfield Developments obtained provisional permission in Q3 for a mixed development project comprising 249 apartments, about 25,630 sq m (about 275,900 sq ft) gross floor area (GFA) of office space and around 6,140 sq m (66,090 sq ft) of retail space.\n\nEarlier in Q1 2011, Mansfield had obtained URA's approval to redevelop the same site into 590 apartments and 16,800 sq ft of retail space. A KepLand spokeswoman said the submission for the revised development proposal is part of the group's \"ongoing efforts to evaluate all possibilities to ensure best use of this freehold site, which is located close to Tanjong Pagar MRT Station\".\n\nA couple of projects in the fast-developing Jurong Lake District on sites sold by the state clinched URA's provisional nod in Q3.\n\nOne is a proposed development by Resorts World Singapore's unit Tamerton Pte Ltd for a 560-room hotel along Jurong Town Hall Road in the Lakeside zone and about 22,170 sq ft GFA of retail space.\n\nAt a URA tender that closed nearly a year ago, Tamerton paid $1,167.35 psf ppr for the 99-year leasehold site - a record for a hotel site at the time. The first hotel development site to be sold in Jurong, the 0.9-hectare plot drew 11 bids.\n\nThe other Jurong project that won URA's provisional nod in Q3 is Sim Lian's project in Venture Avenue in Jurong Gateway to build about 625,500 sq ft of offices and 69,500 sq ft of retail space. Talk in the market is that Sim Lian is looking to strata title the office component for sale; a launch is expected in first half next year. BT understands it has yet to decide whether to keep the retail component for rental income or sell it as well. Jurong Gateway and Lakeside are the two zones that make up Jurong Lake District.\n\nAlso receiving provisional permission in Q3 were Changi Airport Group to develop approximately 130,350 sq ft of retail space and 88,800 sq ft of offices at Terminal 4, and Laguna National Golf and Country Club to develop a 199-room hotel.\n\nIn the industrial property space, BS Capital linked-Kranji Development clinched URA's provisional nod for a warehouse development in Jalan Lam Huat in the Kranji location. The proposed project, with about 1.17 million sq ft GFA, will come up on a freehold site it bought from a unit of City Developments last year.\n\nUnited Engineers received URA's approval to build an extension to its UE BizHub Central in Ang Mo Kio. The extension, which will come up on a surface carpark site, will have GFA of around 259,400 sq ft. UE has given the just listed Viva Industrial Trust a right of first refusal to purchase UE BizHub Central.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Although the $730 million was down 6.8 per cent quarter on quarter, it was higher than analysts' expectations of $703 million in a Bloomberg poll.\n\nAnnualised earnings per share were $1.74, down from $1.97 in Q2 but higher than $1.69 from a year ago. Return on equity was 11.7 per cent, lower than 13.1 per cent in Q2 and 12.1 per cent from a year ago. For the nine months, net profit was up 6.1 per cent year on year at $2.24 billion.\n\n\"The group has achieved another decent set of results this quarter, driven by steady core income and continued growth in our regional franchise. This was underpinned by stable margins and healthy asset quality as we stayed disciplined in pursuing sustainable growth,\" said UOB chief executive Wee Ee Cheong.\n\nOperating profit grew 3.4 per cent quarter on quarter in Q3 to $949 million and 2.8 per cent year on year, with net interest income crossing the $1 billion milestone for the second consecutive quarter. Loans rose by 2.1 per cent in the quarter, led by the region which grew 4.4 per cent excluding currency effects. Gross customer loans rose 15.8 per cent year on year to $177 billion and were broad-based.\n\nLoans from Singapore increased a faster 18.4 per cent while the regional countries grew 12 per cent.\n\nNet interest margin stayed unchanged quarter on quarter at 1.71 per cent as the bank has had a good mix of assets in the last few quarters, said Jimmy Koh, UOB managing director and head of investor relations. Margins were down 13 basis points from a year ago. \"Longer term, as we move our asset mix into the region, we should see margins improving.\"\n\nNon-interest income fell marginally from Q2 as an increase in trading and investment income was partially offset by lower contributions from wealth management, fund management and loan-related income arising from uncertainty in financial markets. Expenses rose 4 per cent year on year and fell 1.5 per cent quarter on quarter to $715 million. Cost-to-income ratio held steady at 43 per cent. UOB is in the final phase of a refresh of its regional banking platform.\n\n\"This lays the foundation for improved efficiency, enhanced risk management system, speed to market and seamless customer service across our franchise in the coming years,\" said Mr Wee.\n\nCredit quality remained strong and non-performing loan ratio was unchanged at 1.2 per cent from the previous quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, the region will continue to be impacted by the uncertainty surrounding QE tapering, and US fiscal cliff issue, said Mr Wee. \"Despite the near term headwinds, the fundamentals of the region remain sound, underpinned by growing intra-regional trade and rising consumer affluence,\" he said.\n\nOn loans, Mr Koh said the bank was confident of achieving low to mid-teens loans growth for full year 2013. \"For 2014, despite global moderation, we are expecting high single-digit loans growth due to projected resilient pan-regional trade flows. While mortgage approvals have come down, UOB's mortgage growth has remained resilient due to a strong pipeline,\" said Mr Koh.\n\nUOB shares closed trading yesterday at $20.80, up two cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/sgx-should-consult-public-hft", "site_title": "SGX should consult public on HFT", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSGX should consult public on HFT\n\nPublished\n\nMon, Nov 4, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHERE is a sense of painful resignation, infused with no small amount of frustration and even impending doom among retail players and their brokers following news that the Singapore Exchange (SGX) is pressing ahead with plans to introduce high-frequency trading (HFT) to the local equities market. Since it appears to be a question of when and not if, the exchange should address the myriad issues before opening its doors to a mode of trading that is controversial and has yet to prove beneficial to markets as a whole.\n\nThe first thing that the SGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore should note is the absence of a proper understanding of how exactly HFT works, the activity being so complicated that very few individuals can properly claim to have full understanding or to be experts.\n\nIf anything, the fragmentary knowledge that can be gleaned from surfing the Internet or from anecdotal testimony of traders has probably created more confusion than clarity.\n\nA natural consequence of ignorance and the shock of the new is, of course, fear - and this has manifested itself in complaints to the press and vitriolic criticism of SGX making its rounds in cyberspace and in dealing rooms.\n\nThe exchange may well counter that these fears are unfounded and that HFT offers boundless liquidity and efficiency benefits that would ultimately improve the lot of all traders.\n\nBe that as it may, it's worth noting that HFT's advantages are as yet unproven and the fear of the unknown pales in comparison to the fear of losing one's livelihood. For this reason, the exchange would do well to tread carefully.\n\nOver the past few years, retail brokers have suffered a massive loss of income because of declining commissions (inevitable, given deregulation and ultimately to the benefit of end-users but painful nonetheless); thinning volume; a cancelled lunch break; a China or S-chip segment mired in governance scandals whose crash is seen as largely responsible for keeping retail customers away; and more recently, sudden trading curbs imposed by the exchange that appear to have driven all but the most die-hard retail punters from the market.\n\nGiven this background, it's hard not to see HFT as another blow to trading representatives who serve small customers. The perception now is that SGX, bent on enhancing liquidity and therefore its coffers, is only interested in big players that can move millions in a second, and is not really after retail business.\n\nThat said, HFT traders cannot spend the day trading among themselves - eventually, the game will descend into a meaningless technological arms race to see who can develop faster computers with no real end in sight. Vibrant retail participation is therefore essential. How then, should the issue be approached?\n\nEducation might be a good starting point. It would be fair to say that most market players, whether dealers, remisiers, investors or speculators (as well as the journalists who cover the market), have only a fleeting understanding of HFT.\n\nYes, everyone knows that it involves super-fast computers that can execute millions of transactions per second and yes, everyone knows that this means traders who have slower computers or reflexes would probably lose out.\n\nHowever, there is so much more to HFT that needs careful study before it can be embraced as a legitimate market activity. For example, even if HFT isn't an appreciable presence currently in the local equities market yet, what about algorithmic trading? This is present, so how does this differ from HFT?\n\nHow is it that algos can enter quotes and withdraw them quickly repeatedly and not face sanctions by the exchange - or if they are, this is not public knowledge - yet when individual brokers do the same, they are hauled up for questioning?\n\nWhat is \"predatory algos\" and \"dark pool pinging\" and would these be allowed?\n\nThen, there's \"latency arbitrage\", which has evolved because each market player doesn't get the same information about stocks at exactly the same moment in time. Some get it sooner and some later, and the difference is known as latency.\n\nThis creates an arbitrage and profit opportunity because if a HFT trader can position itself even one foot closer to the exchange's servers and therefore gain a nanosecond's advantage over others, it can act on that information first.\n\nAccording to material available on the Internet, there is therefore an incentive to pay for faster access, even if this is only for a nanosecond. Does this mean those who pay more can situate their computers closer to the exchange and if that is the case, how does this fit with the exchange's duty of ensuring a level playing field?\n\nWould SGX consider a HFT tax on all high-speed transactions? Many countries already have this and some have taken it even further - Italy, for example, last month introduced a tax of 0.02 per cent for orders placed and cancelled within half a second.\n\nPerhaps the exchange should circulate a public consultation paper before rushing into HFT. After all, the attitude among regulators in many countries is this: HFT operators may claim it brings liquidity benefits but we're sceptical; this doesn't mean we'll bar it but before we allow it, we'll make sure there are plenty of safeguards first.

New York-based Blackstone did not disclose the dollar amount of its investment in the statement.\n\nChief executive officer Stephen Schwarzman is stepping up real estate investment in Asia, tapping the market for US$4 billion for the company's maiden property fund focused on the region. Blackstone, which has been among the biggest buyers of property in Australia and India, is further seeking to boost such investment in China as rising income and urbanization drives demand.\n\n\"With China's economy increasingly driven by domestic consumption, the retail sector has tremendous potential,\" Chris Heady, head of Blackstone's real estate business in Asia, said in the statement. \"There are only a few high quality shopping mall managers in China and SCP is one of the most experienced.\"\n\nSCP owns and manages 19 shopping malls under its Incity, SCP Plaza and One City brands, according to the statement.

Today, the same people will tell you it'd be a mistake not to be there,\" said Louis Tay, Surbana managing director for Africa.\n\nHis sentiments reflect ever-growing optimism about the continent's prospects. According to the International Monetary Fund, over the course of the next five years, half of the world's 20 fastest-growing economies will come from Africa.\n\nCurrently, there are an estimated 55 Singapore companies operating in Africa, though this number looks set to increase.\n\n\"While Singapore companies have primarily looked at Asia, we see more companies looking at emerging markets further afield, including Africa, which is considered to be one of the last frontiers for market expansion,\" said Jayakrishnan Gopalakrish- nan, IE Singapore group director for Middle East and Africa.\n\nInterest in the continent has partly been fuelled by its abundant resources. Africa boasts 60 per cent of the world's arable land, 82 per cent of its platinum reserves, 19 per cent of all gold, two-thirds of global cocoa production and 10 per cent of the world's global oil reserves.\n\nBeyond the resource story, Africa's demographics make the world sit up, too. With more than half of its close to a billion people under the age of 20, the continent will have the world's largest workforce by 2035.\n\nThis, coupled with rapid urbanisation, is creating vast business opportunities. According to McKinsey, half of Africans will be living in cities by 2030, up from 38 per cent in 2010, which will increase demand for infrastructure, housing, health care, and consumer goods.\n\nAccording to masterplanning group Jurong International, it is still early days yet, and the lack of infrastructure and urban planning in most African countries mean that there is great potential for development.\n\nSurbana's Mr Tay agreed: \"It's like the story about two guys who go to the same country to look for business opportunities. The first guy says 'I can't do business here, the people don't even wear proper shoes!'\n\n\"But the second guy says 'This is a great opportunity because we can sell them shoes.' It's obvious who's going to come out on top.\"\n\nIn addition to big-name investors such as Hyflux, Olam and Pacific International Lines (PIL), smaller homegrown companies have found a foothold in the continent.\n\nOne company that has capitalised on Africa's rising infrastructure needs is PowerPac, a manufacturer of road-making machines. It first entered the continent in 2004, starting with a small contract for a Nigerian customer. Since then, it has clinched a US$60 million (S$75 million) deal with the Nigerian Police Force to supply 2,000 units of highway police patrol vehicles.\n\nIt has also secured a $73.8 million contract from an unnamed east African country - which is five times more than an average contract PowerPac typically sees elsewhere.\n\nA player in the African car industry is Kheng Keng Auto, which sells and services cars. \"It's not like in Asia where you can easily get public transport or a taxi. Cars are very important there, and more roads keep being built so more people keep needing cars,\" said its managing director, Cher Kwang Siong. The firm entered the African market in 1999.\n\nAfrica's spending power looks set to ratchet up further. By 2020, the number of households with discretionary income is projected to rise 50 per cent to 128 million, accounting for an estimated total consumer spending of US$1.4 trillion.\n\nThis bodes well for Christina Tan, CEO of GMT Investcorp, a Johannesburg-based distributor of luxury goods. GMT is the sole retailer of Patek Philippe watches in South Africa and the franchisee of international brand names such as Gucci and Bally.\n\n\"When we went in in 1995, South Africa already had fantastic infrastructure and beautiful shopping centres. But we realised that luxury goods brands were completely lacking - there were no such things as flagship stores,\" said Ms Tan.\n\nShe opened Africa's first Gucci store one year later, enabling well-heeled Africans to snag an upmarket handbag without having to travel to Europe, where Africans have traditionally gone to buy luxury goods.\n\n\"Obviously, we only serve the top end of the population. But even if we can capture one per cent of South Africa's 50 million people, I think things could be quite interesting,\" added Ms Tan, who sees the affluent country as a stepping stone to the rest of the continent, especially oil-rich countries such as Nigeria.\n\nCody Lee, director, Middle East & Africa, Singapore Business Federation (SBF), reckons that Africa is the last remaining continent where one can dream big. \"Currently, Africa's rate of return is equivalent to what we saw in China and India in the 1980s. Africa is the only place where you can see a 20-30 per cent return on investment.\"\n\nStill, he warns that \"not everything is so rosy\", given concerns about security and corruption. In September, an upscale shopping centre in Kenya became the target of a terrorist attack that claimed more than 70 lives.\n\nBut Kenya is just one of 54 countries on the African continent, Mr Lee pointed out. \"Its security situation is not indicative of the whole continent. Places like Mauritius, Botswana and Rwanda are very safe,\" he said, noting that the three countries have \"exemplary corporate governance\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

ING, the Netherlands' biggest financial services company, said last week that the current market value of the bonds is about 71 per cent of the face amount. The government may see a gain of almost 800 million euros (S$1.3 billion), Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem told Parliament.\n\nThe pay-off for the Netherlands and the consequences for the US$800 billion market for US mortgage bonds without government backing will depend on how well it can unwind the bet with the help of BlackRock Inc. The sales, which require European Union approval, are targeted to be finished within the next year. Risks over that period include the forecasted reduction of the US Federal Reserve's unprecedented economic stimulus, potential continued sales of the debt by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the possibility of more budget battles underlying US lawmakers like the one that roiled global markets last month.\n\n\"Timing is everything,\" said Michael Canter, head of securitised assets at AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees more than US$250 billion in fixed income investments. \"If they try to sell when there's not a lot of liquidity out there, it could be a really bad thing. But if the markets are in a good place, it definitely could be absorbed without a hitch.\"\n\nING received a 10 billion euro capital injection in October 2008, when mortgage-backed securities held at its US units plunged in value after foreclosures soared and property prices plunged. In a second round of aid in January 2009, the Netherlands assumed 80 per cent of the risk on the 27.7 billion euro portfolio of mortgage bonds.\n\nING sold the securities to the Dutch state at a discount, while giving the government a loan, which shrank as the mortgages defaulted or were repaid.\n\nWhile down from post-crisis peaks reached earlier this year, prices have gained in 2013, ratifying the Dutch decision to hold. Typical prices for a type of Alt-A bonds among the holdings rose last week to 73.75 cents on the dollar, from 65 cents in January, Credit Suisse Group AG data show. The debt, tied to borrowers who often qualified with limited documentation or bought investment properties, rose as high as 75 cents in May.\n\nThe rally in US non-agency home-loan bonds fuelled by a housing recovery and the Fed's US$85 billion in monthly debt buying was interrupted in June as speculation grew that the central bank would scale back the purchases. It resumed after the Fed unexpectedly said in September that it would hold off on tapering.\n\nOver the past month, securities backed by option adjustable-rate mortgages, another type held by the Dutch, have gained two US cents to 70 US cents, according to Barclays plc data. The notes, tied to loans that can allow borrowers to pay less than the interest that they owe by increasing their principal, fell as low as 33 US cents in 2009.\n\nThe Fed is now expected to delay the first reduction of its bond-buying programme until March, according to the median estimate of a survey conducted on Oct 17-18.\n\nThe Dutch government is seeking to return money to taxpayers after it provided more than 95 billion euros to rescue companies including ING, ABN Amro Group NV and SNS Reaal NV.\n\n\"This is a clear step closer to being detached from state aid,\" said Cor Kluis, an Utrecht, Netherlands-based analyst at Rabobank International. \"If ING will now pay back the remaining capital, it will be fully government-free.\"\n\nING could repay the state aid by mid-2014, ahead of a schedule agreed on with EU regulators last year, Mr Kluis said. He recommends that clients buy the shares.\n\nThe EU approved ING's rescue with some conditions, including that the company return the financial aid with premium and interest. Other strings attached included a ban on management bonuses for as long as aid is outstanding. The company also said that it will not pay dividends to shareholders before completing repayment.\n\nTo maximise proceeds, the Dutch will invite competing bids throughout the sale process, which can be halted at any point, Mr Dijsselbloem said in a letter to lawmakers. Progress and results will be published on the Dutch State Treasury Agency website, he said. ING will pay about 400 million euros to the Netherlands from a provision that it took in 2009 to unwind the transaction, meaning that the state may see a gain of almost 800 million euros.\n\nLarge sales of non-agency mortgage securities have met with mixed consequences. A sale of US$8.7 billion of debt by Lloyds Banking Group plc in May resulted in a pretax gain of \u00a3540 million (S$1 billion) for the lender that boosted the group's core Tier 1 capital, a measure of financial strength. Still, it weighed on the market with the offering completed as speculation grew that the Fed could begin reducing its bond buying.\n\nAuctions in 2012 of non-agency securities acquired by the US central bank during the rescues of American International Group Inc and Bear Stearns Cos proved a catalyst for market demand. The previous year, the Fed's sales as it sought to unwind the portfolios exacerbated a slump in the market as Europe's debt crisis deepened.\n\nThe non-agency market, or home-loan bonds not backed by the US government, is regularly shrinking as foreclosures get completed and homeowners refinance into new loans. The amount of the debt outstanding fell to US$849.2 billion as at June 30, from a peak of US$2.3 trillion in 2007, Fed data show. It probably will contract an additional US$60 billion next year, according to Barclays analysts including Sandeep Bordia and Jasraj Vaidya.\n\nThe involvement of BlackRock as an adviser to the Dutch suggests that a programme similar to the unwinding of the Fed's Maiden Lane vehicles is possible, the analysts wrote in Nov 1 report. At the same time, it is unclear whether the nation will sell the bonds in blocks or individually, and at what pace, they said.\n\n\"We do not expect this sale by itself to have a huge effect on prices, especially if the sales are conducted in a manner that is cognisant of market conditions,\" they wrote.\n\nOne risk is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the US-backed mortgage companies that own about US$150 billion of privately issued residential and commercial bonds, may continue with auctions of the assets, according to AllianceBernstein's Mr Canter and Barclays. As part of sales ordered by regulators to shrink their illiquid holdings this year, they have already sold many of the investment-grade securities that are easiest to trade, Barclays said.\n\nThe Dutch probably will be \"try to be smart about it\", Mr Canter said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": []}

The increase was largely driven by $80.5 million in progressive revenue recognition from the sale of residential projects Signature at Lewis, Skyline 360 and Waterscape at Cavenagh, compared to the $24.9 million that was recognised a year ago.\n\nHiap Hoe said of its outlook: \"As the Singapore's property sector is expected to remain challenging in the near-term, the group will continue to step up its marketing efforts to drive sales for its remaining unsold residential units.\"\n\nIt added that it will \"continue to adopt a prudent approach in its land acquisition programme\" in Singapore, and will \"continue to evaluate opportunities by seeking well located land sites and quality completed properties to strengthen its regional property portfolio\".\n\nDuring the quarter in August, Hiap Hoe made its maiden foray overseas, snapping up three developments over two months in Melbourne. One is a 3,795 square metre site in inner Melbourne that cost A$28.8 million (S$34 million), where it plans to develop a 425-unit residential-hospitality project.\n\nThe second is a A$43.8 million commercial building in Melbourne's central business district (CBD), while the third is a a A$105 million mixed use retail and office asset, also in Melbourne's CBD.\n\nIt is rolling out a tender and selection process this month for two hotel operators for its planned hotels in Melbourne.\n\nThe group's landmark integrated hotels-cum-commercial development, Zhongshan Park Integrated Development, is also fully operational and is expected to contribute to its recurring income stream from Q4 onwards. The office block is fully leased, while the retail mall is over 90 per cent leased, it said.\n\nSaid Teo Ho Beng, Hiap Hoe's executive chairman and CEO: \"Moving forward, we will continue to evaluate opportunities in Singapore and the region, so as to identify well-located land sites with strong redevelopment potential and quality assets to grow our portfolio of investment assets and generate attractive returns for our stakeholders.\"\n\nFor the nine-month period, net profit rose 65.2 per cent to $72.8 million. Revenue was 58.1 per cent higher at $191.7 million.\n\nHiap Hoe shares closed flat at 81.5 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Investment incentives are one thing, but RPGT is another matter. Already there are two different RPGT rates for locals and foreigners. Will there now be two different rules, one for the special zone and for outside the zone?\" asked a Kuala Lumpur-based consultant who did not want to be named. \"If so, who is to say the exemption can't next be extended to 1MDB's Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) for example?\"\n\nTRX, the proposed mixed development in Kuala Lumpur, already enjoys a number of incentives as the government hopes to draw investors to the aspiring \"financial hub\" in Kuala Lumpur which has yet to get off the ground.\n\nAnother consultant was not surprised by IRDA's action. \"I predicted this would happen because if not, investors would be deterred from investing in Iskandar.\"\n\nHe said that the concern was not so much for Iskandar but Medini which, at 901 ha, makes up only 0.004 per cent of Iskandar.\n\nUnder the masterplan, Medini is earmarked as the central business district for Iskandar.\n\nCurrently, the five flagship zones have been given a number of incentives. On top of these, developers, special status companies and workers in Medini can avail themselves of an additional package of perks. Qualified companies, for example, do not have to pay RPGT on the disposal of land and buildings if they start operations in the node before the end of 2015.\n\nFurthermore, Medini developers have a freer hand in that they are not bound by bumiputra ownership quotas or foreign ownership caps. This is also the case in Putri Harbour. In other parts of the state, foreigner ownership is capped at 50 per cent of residential high-rise and 30 per cent of landed real estate.\n\nAccording to realtors, Iskandar state planner Iskandar Investment Bhd and government-owned UEM Sunrise are two of the bigger land owners in Medini.\n\nFrom 2014, non-Malaysians will have to pay 30 per cent RPGT on gains if they dispose of a property within five years of purchase, and 5 per cent in subsequent years. Malaysians will pay 30 per cent for disposals in the first to third year, 20 in the fourth year and 15 in the fifth. In the sixth and subsequent year, no tax applies.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The latter included $165,000 from discontinued operations. Revenue from continuing operations rose 9 per cent to $15.4 million.\n\nViking said yesterday that it is partnering Singaporean rig building veteran Chan Kwan Bian to construct a drilling jack-up rig at a cost of about US$180 million. The rig is a cantilever drilling jack-up CJ46-X100-D GustoMSC designed for use in waterdepth up to 114 metres and can accommodate 120 men during operation.\n\nViking, through newly set-up investment holding subsidiary Viking Asset Management (VAM), has entered into a conditional agreement to acquire a 30 per cent stake, valued at US$5.4 million, in Mr Chan's Smart Earl Investment, which has the rights to build the jack-up rig.\n\nIt has also entered into an agreement to place out 40 million new shares worth $3.2 million to Tan Boy Tee, another Singaporean rig building veteran. This agreement includes an option of the same quantity and amount, exercisable within 90 days.\n\n\"With this share subscription, Mr Tan will become a substantial shareholder of Viking. If he exercises the option, his shareholding will represent 10.1 per cent of the enlarged issued and paid-up share capital of the Company, which will be approximately 793 million shares,\" said Viking.\n\nMr Chan and Mr Tan are co-founders of Labroy, a former SGX-listed offshore and marine specialist which was sold to Dubai Drydocks World in 2008.\n\nThe drilling rig will be built by state-owned Chinese yard China Merchant Heavy Industries. It is expected to be completed within 26 months.\n\nDaniel Lin, executive director of Viking and son of Andy Lim, chairman and controlling shareholder of Viking, has also been appointed the CEO of VAM. Viking shares, in which trading was halted yesterday, last changed hands at 8.2 cents last Friday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

You have malls. You have stadiums. You don't normally screen 50,000 people going into a stadium for weapons.\"\n\nLast Friday's shooting began at a TSA checkpoint, whose purpose is keeping bombs and weapons off planes. No matter how far the initial line of defence is pushed outward from those vulnerable targets, the risk couldn't be eliminated for the men and women on guard, said security specialists, consultants and a congressional committee chairman who oversees the TSA.\n\n\"The TSA is there to make sure it doesn't happen on an airplane,\" said George Hamlin, a former Airbus executive who runs Hamlin Transportation Consulting in Fairfax, Virginia. \"How do you set up a system to protect the protectors?\"\n\nTSA administrator John Pistole said last Saturday the agency is discussing airport security issues \"writ large\" with Congress, including whether officers should be armed. The agency will study its policies and procedures to determine what can provide the best possible security, he told reporters in Los Angeles.\n\nThe agency was created after the Sept 11 attacks to bolster protections against terrorists boarding aircraft. US House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, whose panel oversees the TSA, promised fresh attention to in-airport security on Sunday.\n\n\"How we typically stop a lot of these things is through good intelligence,\" said Mr McCaul, who cited parallels between the Los Angeles incident and the Sept 16 Washington Navy Yard massacre, in which a gunman with a history of mental illness killed 12 people.\n\nThe alleged Nov 1 shooter, identified by authorities as Paul Ciancia, 23, left a note in which he wrote of wanting to kill TSA agents, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said. Ciancia's family alerted authorities in New Jersey, and Los Angeles police visited Ciancia's home the morning of the attack, Mr McCaul told CNN.\n\nCiancia is accused of killing one TSA officer and wounding two other TSA employees and a civilian passenger, according to a criminal complaint filed on Saturday in Los Angeles federal court, and was shot by airport police.\n\nMr Pistole, the TSA chief, is looking to expand the use of Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response Teams with stepped-up local law enforcement to enhance airport security, Mr McCaul said. Having more law enforcement officers on display will help, even though it's difficult to provide foolproof security, he said.\n\nWhile some of the best-known instances of airport violence have occurred outside the US, such as terrorists' 1985 attacks on ticket counters in Rome and Vienna targeting El Al Israel Airlines, the US hasn't been immune.\n\nA gunman killed two people at the El Al counter in Los Angeles in 2002. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Bankers will have to show what would happen to the value of leveraged loans they hold, the impact of another housing bust and how they'd fare if a firm that owes them substantial sums collapses.\n\nThe test was designed in part to build resiliency against what some see as emerging asset bubbles, said a Fed official who spoke on a conference call with reporters. The counterparty failure test aims to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis, when distress at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group Inc. threatened to destroy their biggest trading partners.\n\nCounterparty credit risk \"has been a very big concern since the crisis,\" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a Washington regulatory research firm whose clients include the world's largest banks. \"This is an intervening supervisory step while the broader rules are pending.\"\n\nThe Fed is using the tests - based on hypothetical adverse conditions and not forecasts - to encourage the 30 biggest banks to build capital cushions against economic turmoil. Twelve banks will be subject to the capital review for the first time.\n\nThe six banks with large trading operations - JPMorgan, Citigroup, Bank of America Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co - will be required to test how their portfolios would perform against a global shock to financial markets. Details of that scenario will be released \"soon\", the central bank said. New York-based JPMorgan is the biggest US bank by assets, followed by Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America and New York-based Citigroup.\n\nThose six banks, as well as Bank of New York Mellon Corp and State Street Corp, also will have to test against a scenario in which one of their counterparties experiences an \"instantaneous and unexpected\" default. Previous tests focused merely on incremental defaults as the economy eroded, a Fed official said.\n\nThe test shows Fed officials remain concerned that banks might still rely too heavily on a single counterparty to hedge potential losses, a practice that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIn the \"adverse\" scenario, banks will be tested against global flight from long-term debt that pushes the US into a recession, with unemployment rising to 9.25 per cent. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury note jumps to 5.75 per cent by the end of 2014, and corporate bond and mortgage rates also rise.\n\nIn the Fed's \"severely adverse\" scenario, the jobless rate peaks at 11.25 per cent, stocks fall almost 50 per cent and US housing prices slide 25 per cent, while the euro area sinks into recession. Developing economies in Asia also experience a \"sharp slowdown\", the Fed said.\n\nThe Fed said that the larger drop in US house prices in this year's severely adverse scenario is \"particularly relevant for states or metropolitan statistical areas that have experienced brisk gains in house prices over the past year\". - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Before this, national broadcaster MediaCorp had been the sole outfit charged with producing PSB content.\n\n\"StarHub was invited to come onboard the PCFS as it has demonstrated a strong commitment to developing fresh, innovative local content,\" MDA said yesterday.\n\n\"StarHub's entry into local television content production will also help to introduce a new level of competition to the broadcast sector, as StarHub adopts industry best practices through its commissioning work with local television producers.\"\n\nStarHub's content produced under this scheme will be aired on two of its self-packaged channels, E City - a Chinese entertainment channel - and SuperSports Arena. The latter might develop an additional focus on sports-related infotainment and education, on top of its existing specialisation in sporting events.\n\n\"For instance, a reality programme could be produced to offer insights into the lives of local athletes. SuperSports Arena will also ramp up the broadcast of local sporting events such as marathons and school competitions to support local sports,\" StarHub said yesterday.\n\nOn the initial run, the programmes will be available only to StarHub subscribers on those two channels and the operator's mobile TV service, TV Anywhere. Six months after the initial broadcast, however, the content will be made available for free through TV Anywhere.\n\n\"StarHub is proud to be the first pay-TV operator in Singapore to come onboard the (PCFS) by MDA. Being a local company, we have always strived to bring content closer to Singapore viewers not only by offering programmes across multiple platforms and with shorter telecast windows, but also to produce localised content that strikes a chord with them,\" said Lee Soo Hui, head of StarHub's Media Business Unit.\n\nStarHub has also committed itself to commissioning more local content, beyond the funding of the scheme.\n\nNext Monday, it will hold a briefing at StarHub Green for production companies on the commissioning of original programming.\n\nEach proposal will be evaluated based on criteria such as creativity, audience appeal and credentials of the production company and its team, StarHub said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The paper said that the two sides were locked in a tug-of-war.\n\nAir France-KLM's conditions, it said, included the removal of Alitalia's board of directors and a restructuring of its debts of nearly one billion euros (S$1.68 billion) to reduce them by 70 to 80 per cent.\n\nThe 5,000 job cuts would be more than double what Alitalia's CEO Gabriele del Torchio has pencilled in as part of a revised restructuring plan to keep it in business, the newspaper said.\n\nA source close to the matter said that Air France-KLM, which is in the middle of its own restructuring, had asked for \"many job cuts\" but fewer than 5,000, without giving a figure.\n\nThe Franco-Dutch airline declined to comment on the report and a spokesman for Mr Lupi was not immediately available for comment.\n\nAir France-KLM gave its approval to a 300 million euros capital increase in the ailing Italian national carrier along with Alitalia's other investors, but is not obliged to participate and has always said that it would attach strict conditions before giving any help.\n\nPart of a wider bailout, the cash call is seen as only a stopgap solution before talks on a possible tie-up between Alitalia and Air France-KLM, although Mr Lupi has said that Italy would seek a different international partner if Air France-KLM does not subscribe to the capital increase.\n\nOn Thursday, Air France wrote off the value of its stake in Alitalia, which has not made a profit for more than a decade. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

What are the pros and cons of contract hiring, and how should the benefits for contract employees be packaged vis- a-vis perks for permanent staff?\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSaw Ken Wye\n\nCEO\n\nCrimsonLogic Pte Ltd\n\nHOW work evolves is going to be part of the new normal. Just as cloud computing has come into the fore as enterprises realise that they need a flexible and scalable resource at affordable prices, the way we employ people will change. Having a good strategy for contract workers will allow an organisation to plan its workforce around projects and tasks it needs to accomplish. It caters for the peaks and troughs. A risk mitigation strategy needs to be in place to make sure that corporate insights and knowledge doesn't walk away with the contract worker when the contract is over.\n\nLim Soon Hock\n\nManaging Director\n\nPlan-B ICAG Pte Ltd\n\nTHOSE of us who have worked for multinational corporations (MNCs) will testify that contract hiring is an effective way to circumvent headcount freeze, minimise costs and above all, build flexibility in managing and regulating manpower needs. It is a regular feature of our manpower planning. Many, if not all, contract employees tend to be administrative or non-executive staff. But they all perform a useful role and contribute to the operational and business efficiency of the company.\n\nWhen I was in Compaq, our contract employees were treated, where or whenever possible, as though they were our full-time colleagues. For example, they were all invited to the company's town hall meetings, functions and events, as well as permitted to enjoy employees'benefits such as free beverages, subsidised canteen food and use of gymnasium. There was little discrimination and differentiation. As part-time employees are potential full-time staffers, it is in the interest of the company to treat them well, fairly and with respect. Even if they do not become full-time employees, they can be great ambassadors for the company; they are likely to promote the company as an enlightened and progressive employer.\n\nI hope that more of our local companies can follow the example of MNCs to not treat contract employees as second-class workers. In our tight labour market, every headcount matters to increase productivity. I would advocate that companies regard every worker as an investment rather than an expense. It will influence and determine how everyone in a company is treated. Employees - irrespective of whether they are full time or on contract - are more likely to be highly motivated when treated well. They will give their best to the company. It is a win-win for both employers and employees.\n\nPascal Lambert\n\nChief Country Officer, Singapore and Head of South-east Asia\n\nSociete Generale CIB\n\nWITH possibly the exception of information technology (IT) services, we do not see a major trend in contract hiring in our banking industry. For Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Singapore, a non-permanent workforce would comprise mainly of interns and trainees who are fresh from business school and university.\n\nAs we are committed to providing long-term employability to our staff here in Singapore, our first priority would be to hire staff on a permanent basis rather than a contract basis. While contractors help with meeting seasonal needs and do allow for a more flexible workforce - and our strategy is to use them to supplement the work done by our permanent staff - there are also associated limitations. Such negatives include increased costs, potential operational risks as a result of increased turnover, which also affects knowledge transfer, potential confidentiality issues and impact on the morale of permanent staff.\n\nIn Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking Singapore, contractors represent a very small proportion of our total staff. We generally utilise contractors if there is a short-term need or a requirement for specific expertise. However for many of the reasons above, we do not systematically use contractors as a way of maintaining flexibility within the business.\n\nRaman Singh\n\nManaging Director\n\nMundipharma\n\nCONTRACT employment has definitely seen an upsurge of late with the recent tightening of hiring policies and streamlining of company workforces due to smaller recruitment budgets. While contract employees do add value by bringing broad skill sets and contributing through their depth of experiences, there is always the risk of losing them to competitors who may offer them a permanent position.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, there is a growing need to implement carefully-devised work improvement programmes and retention strategies that lead to greater productivity for the entire workforce - whether permanent or contract. Given the growing demand for subject experts in a functional role, employing the right talent becomes all the more important. As a pharmaceutical company, Mundipharma aims to cultivate a global community of experts functioning as brand ambassadors. Ultimately, the objective is to ensure that each and every employee remains flexible and prepared for change.\n\nSerge Shine\n\nManaging Director South-east Asia\n\nSpring Professional\n\nGIVEN Asia's dynamic markets, balancing contract and permanent employment is an opportunity for organisations to inject flexibility into their businesses. This will help them be more competitive and adaptable to volatile market conditions, while maintaining reputation and stability through pools of permanent staff.\n\nSimilarly, employees should not dismiss contract employment as a career path. As Asia continues to make headway in the IT and engineering industries, the flexible nature of contract employment will allow the broadening of resumes and experience. The promise of flexible work schedules for a heightened work-life balance and a compensation plan comparable to that of permanent employment should also be a draw.\n\nJoe Marten\n\nCEO\n\nAluminaid Pte Ltd\n\nCONTRACT hiring is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and is closely related to business needs and size. We currently employ 22 full-time workers in which we have invested a significant amount of time and money. As a start-up, it makes little sense to invest in short-term contractors during this crucial time of growth.\n\nHowever we expect that over the next two years, our employee base will grow tenfold. We predict that our hiring needs will also evolve. As we move our manufacturing operations to Singapore, we expect that our need for skilled workers will rise sharply, and our business may then sustain a contract worker model. Overall, there needs to be enhanced accountability for smaller and medium-sized recruitment agencies to look for lasting solutions that offer long-term value, rather than quick fixes and easy commission derived from contractors.\n\nYeoh Oon Jin\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nPwC Singapore\n\nCONTRACT hiring is definitely on the rise in Singapore. The more volatile economic cycles have resulted in companies flexing their total workforce to remain cost competitive as the demand for goods and services change. Many companies are also outsourcing non-core functions - for example administrative and security services - to service providers which typically adopt the contract employment model. Regulated clients such as banks are also turning to the contract employment model when running large projects, particularly when there is a regulatory deadline.\n\nContract hiring allows employers to retain flexibility to manage costs. Outsource providers that specialise in providing dedicated functional contract workforce can often improve work output due to scale. However, unless managed and negotiated well, the flexibility associated with this variable costing model can be more expensive in absolute terms. On an hourly basis, contract employees are usually paid higher wages but would have significantly less benefits, largely because certain benefits such as leave and health insurance tend to be annual benefits that are suited for permanent staff. At PwC, we have plans to work with our service providers such as insurers to adjust the benefit programmes to cover contract employees.\n\nWe believe that in the long run, companies that are innovative and which can balance the mix of permanent and contract employees would yield the highest risk-adjusted results.\n\nRonald Lee\n\nManaging Director\n\nPrimeStaff Management Services Pte Ltd\n\nBEING in the recruitment industry ourselves, we have witnessed first-hand that contract employment is a growing market trend in Singapore. This trend has been especially prevalent in the last few quarters. Indeed, contract hiring is a strategy that we recommend to recruiters, particularly if their organisation is experiencing a permanent headcount freeze. We believe that contract hiring is a trend that is here to stay.\n\nEver since the global financial crisis of 2008, the business landscape has changed, and volatility has become the norm. Companies now realise that they need to be more agile in order to respond to market dynamics. Besides enabling an organisation to fill skills gaps quickly, contract employment provides organisations with more flexibility should the need to restructure their workforce arise. It also allows the organisation to try out a candidate before offering him a permanent position. Some of the disadvantages of contract hiring are that it can be disruptive to teams, as contract staff come and go, and the quality of work produced by different contract workers may be uneven.\n\nThere are already certain market benchmarks when it comes to packaging benefits for contract workers vis-\u00e0-vis permanent staff. As a rule of thumb, the rates for contract employees tend to be higher than the salaries of permanent staff with comparable portfolio and experience, as the contract arrangement does not include the suite of benefits that would be extended to a permanent employee. But it is interesting to note that employers have been increasing the benefits for contract workers of late, to include a little more of the perks that permanent staff enjoy.\n\nHugues Delcourt\n\nCountry Executive\n\nABN AMRO Bank NV Singapore and\n\nCEO of ABN AMRO Private Banking Asia & Middle East\n\nABN AMRO in Singapore is hiring as we are successfully growing our business. While we are mostly hiring permanent staff, contract employment is one of the ways which help us adapt to fast-changing business conditions. Talent gaps, mainly in the middle and back office functions, can be filled swiftly with contract employment to ensure the continued provision of quality support services. Depending on the nature of work, contract employment is also used to augment complex project work. Contract staff are very valuable, and should be integrated in the organisation as well as any other staff. Thus, over and on top of market remuneration, we also ensure that our contract employees are given opportunities to advance their careers with us and most importantly, welcomed and included in our employee activities. We are pleased that over time, many of our contract staff become permanent employees.\n\nAllen Ang\n\nMD\n\nAldon Technologies\n\nFOR ages, contract employment is common practice in the construction industry. Painters are usually employed temporarily for the duration of the project. Because of the seasonal nature of their business, contractors find it cost-deficient to hire permanent painters. Since the 2008 financial crisis, more organisations, including statutory boards, employ executives on contract for specific periods and may subsequently convert them to permanent employees if found to be suitable. This gives the organisations flexibility to try out a new employee before absorbing him. However, the jury is still out if this is an effective way for a company to recruit talent.\n\nIn the IT sector, more and more certified project management professionals prefer to work independently and take on IT projects on a project basis. Companies also prefer to tap the pool of these highly qualified and experienced project managers, and engage them on a project basis for their specific skills which are not needed when the project is completed.\n\nOn the other hand, contract employment may not be suitable for some manufacturing activities. At Aldon, our manufacturing process requires highly specialised precision engineering skills. Our workers are trained on industry best practices, and such training requires a sustained period of training. Under such circumstances, contract employment is not suitable for us.\n\nToby Koh\n\nGroup Managing Director\n\nAdemco Security Group Pte Ltd\n\nTHERE is certainly a clear trend for hiring on a contract basis in Singapore. Most companies do so to remain flexible on the human capital deployment front. However, I am personally more in favour of permanent employment, particularly for Singaporeans. In the current Asian mindset, there is still a stigma attached to contract jobs. More importantly, it is the feeling of belonging that permanent employment can bring which is critical in these competitive times. The labour market is still extremely tight, and employers would tend to keep all the good talent that they can find. Benefits are mostly similar no matter whether contract or permanent, which helps us bridge perceived differences in employee status and foster team spirit.\n\nGuy Day\n\nCEO\n\nAmbition Group Ltd\n\nAMBITION has certainly experienced an increased demand for contract staff as employers not only recognise the relief that it provides during crunch periodsbut also as a staffing solution to combat shrinking headcount budgets. We have witnessed a shift as talents are becoming more open to contract roles, which can represent an opportunity towards a full-time conversion, and also provide the chance to gain experience in different companies. During headcount freezes, contracting is an effective way to bring on talent until those constraints are lifted.\n\nIf there is a downside to contracting for employers, it is retaining high-calibre staff, especially if permanent opportunities present themselves in a talent-short market such as Singapore. For candidates, there is the need to kick-start the job hunting process when the contract ends.\n\nTo attract more people into contracting jobs, companies need to structure benefits so that they are comparable to permanent staff, including items such as annual leave, sick leave and health care. Providing similar benefits is motivational, it makes contract staff feel part of the organisation and avoids alienation.\n\nIn markets such as the UK, Germany or Australia, where contracting is often seen as a career choice, contractors benefit from a higher salary, increased benefits as well as a retention bonus to ensure that they complete the contract. While benefits offered to contract staff in Singapore have improved, it has been from a very low base and there is still a long way to go before contracting is seen as a viable career option for the majority of job seekers.\n\nFlorence Ng\n\nManaging Director, Founder\n\nStraits Talent Pte Ltd\n\nCONTRACT employment offers a good interim solution to companies with labour shortages during periods of need, large-scale projects, or crisis, and in some cases, headcount constraints. In more developed labour markets such as in the West, one will see that contract employment is often viewed as a good alternative to the traditional permanent mode of employment. While contracting is starting to gain some traction in Singapore and, indeed Asia, I believe that we are still a long way behind mature markets such as the UK, US or Australia.\n\nIn the corporate world where the talent pool is finite and growth is imminent, it is about the demand and supply of talent. Here in Singapore, where we boast a tight labour market and an average unemployment rate of less than 3 per cent, one can therefore expect that the contracting market will remain small, due in large part to the lack of available talent. The reality is that in Asia, \"face\" plays an important part in one's career choices. I know many job seekers who shun good paying contracting roles as they relentlessly pursue permanent roles, because permanent employment is seen as a hallmark of a more successful and stable career path, with the promise of career progression. Until the mindsets of job seekers change, which will take time, companies will continue to struggle to find professional contractors to fill interim positions. One way is to provide perks such as annual leave and medical coverage (these are not automatically given to contractors) and throw in completion bonuses, to sweeten the deal financially.\n\nRonnie Tan\n\nGroup EVP, Asia-Pacific and Global Talent Management\n\nRight Management\n\nIN this age of uncertainty, finding and mobilising the right talent is critical. The challenge facing businesses is to begin building the frameworks, structures, strategies and systems that will allow businesses to compete and thrive. One such strategy is through contract employment. A comparison of the top five markets ranked for contingent workforce availability shows that most of the highest ranking countries are in Asia-Pacific. These countries generally demonstrate higher cost efficiency along with availability, but tend to have lower productivity and more restrictive labour regulations.\n\nAs businesses realign their workforce to keep pace with changing business demands, contract employment helps businesses attain the required high skill talent as Singapore further transforms and moves up the value chain in the region. The magic is in the mix of the labour components that best meet the need of the business.\n\nMichael Smith\n\nCountry Director\n\nRandstad Singapore\n\nTHERE has been a recent surge in the supply of contract roles, especially in banking and financial services and information technology. For employers, they offer not only a swift solution to plug gaps with a high level of expertise, but also provide the flexibility to hire per project and remain agile to meet changing workforce demands and business requirements.\n\nFor employees, contracts offer flexibility and an opportunity to work in a variety of projects and build up new skills sets. Contracting often acts as a stepping stone to a permanent position, which was agreed by 80 per cent of employees in Singapore, according to Randstad's Q2 2013 Workmonitor Report.\n\nAs contract employees often do not enjoy the same benefits as their permanent colleagues, employers should compensate by offering higher remuneration packages to make sure that they secure the talent that they need to drive business growth. The Singapore contracting market is relatively immature compared with more mature markets such as the US or Australia. In the future, we should see some levelling out in this area.\n\nVictor Chia\n\nCEO\n\nDairy Farm Singapore (Food)\n\nGIVEN the current extremely tight labour supply, especially in the retail sector, there is definitely a critical need to tap a \"new additional\" workforce on part-time/contract/flexible arrangements. This will supplement the existing shrinking pool of full-time workers set against a challenging backdrop of an ageing Singaporean population and tightened control on recruitment of foreign workers.\n\nPeople who look for flexi work want to maximise their free hours, enjoy work-life balance and be exposed to varied work experiences with potential opportunities to find their career niche. It is on this premise that Dairy Farm Singapore will be launching its flexi work scheme on Nov 7 with the aim of building a regular pool of flexi staff to complement our permanent workforce.\n\nSam Yap\n\nGroup Executive Chairman\n\nHTwo Investment Holdings Pte Ltd\n\nCOMPANIES and businesses have to resort to various options in hiring staff to get their work projects moving. Getting suitable and qualified staff to carry out certain job functions can be challenging in this current tight labour market. I believe that many employers are not closed to the idea of contract employment for some of their business activities.\n\nIn some situations, contract arrangements may be more efficient and cost reducing. Contract employment may work for some jobs or tasks but not all. Employers must be very clear as to what jobs can be done on contract. Short-term projects requiring specialised expertise or skills, for example, can use contract staff. Overall, salaries for contract services may be lower compared to permanent positions as some benefits will not be included. Employers happy with the services of a contract staff may offer permanent employment in the long term. So it is a good testing period for both employers and employees. I feel that as the economy grows, employers have to be innovative in their hiring practices and be open to various hiring options that work for them, without compromising standards and quality.\n\nChris Comer\n\nCEO and Property Developer\n\nCastlewood Group\n\nBEING a Singapore-based company, Castlewood Group invests heavily in its full-time staff and has seen clear evidence of the long-term benefits. When it comes to the hiring of contracted staff, we often consider it as \"panning for gold\" as it allows us to identify potential superstars in various disciplines, and thus enables the company to introduce talented, enthusiastic new blood into the fold on a permanent basis, having had the benefit of previewing performance and attitude beforehand. Contracted staff seeking a permanent position thus ensure they give 100 per cent effort 100 per cent of the time as they want to be recognised as potential full-timers. It also avoids any poor work ethic or a \"temp\" mindset.\n\nPhilippe H J Huinck\n\nRegional Managing Director, South and South-east Asia\n\nInternational SOS\n\nTHERE is a growing trend for companies to hire more contract workers. Some of the reasons are due to the economic downturn and uncertainties in recent years, and a need for more business flexibility. The tighter labour market has also resulted in companies being more creative in their hiring strategies.\n\nThere are some factors that companies should consider before hiring contract workers. While they bring benefits such as added help and relief in pressing situations and flexibility in operations and projects without adding to the headcount, the primary consideration in the hiring process should be the short- and long-term business and operational requirements that the new hire will contribute towards. The nature of business and continuity plans should be other key factors as well.\n\nAt International SOS, our global reach and the unforeseeable nature of medical epidemics and crisis mean that we employ additional contract staff to maintain the high level of service and medical protection for our customers in times of need. For our concierge business at Aspire Lifestyles, the additional contract staff during peak periods ensure that our customers receive a positive call experience at all times, and that we are well equipped to meet their requests. Having the option of hiring contract workers provides our businesses with flexibility in both our operations and overheads.\n\nDhirendra Shantilal\n\nBoard Director & Head of Asia-Pacific\n\nFircroft\n\nAS economic cycles become shorter, contract employment will allow businesses greater flexibility to scale their operations up or down. It also helps to aid labour market transitions, boosting employment by turning available work into jobs. In fact, contract work is more the norm than the exception in the energy and resources industries in which Fircroft specialises. These industries depend largely on project-based wins. Teams are adjusted according to the size, length and complexity of the projects. In recent years, the energy industry has been booming, especially in Asia. This has resulted in the rise of contracted specialists in this region. Singapore is Asia's leading oil trading hub and is one of the world's top three export refining centres. Now with a new LNG terminal and a greater push by the government to develop more energy sources, Singapore can greatly benefit from this hiring trend.\n\nAnother related trend to note is that companies in these sectors tend to use technical recruitment firms to manage their contract employees - everything from recruitment to other human resource needs such as payroll and relocation services. As contract employees in these technical sectors have had exposure to a greater variety of work environments, they are often highly sought after for their experience and niche skills. Hence they can often command remuneration and benefit packages that match or surpass that of permanent staff.\n\nLim Tit Meng\n\nChief Executive\n\nScience Centre Singapore\n\nSCIENCE Centre employs many contract staff to work on the numerous projects and events that we organise. We have around 160 permanent staff and routinely take in new staff on two-year contracts with the option to extend for another two years, and then be placed on a permanent basis.\n\nThe demand for contract employment has arisen as firms seek a more flexible workforce that brings varied skill sets, look to better meet changing market conditions and as a solution to headcount constraints. In a downtrending economy in particular, it helps organisations keep labour overheads low while maintaining productivity. Figures from the Ministry of Manpower have indicated a slight increase of workers on term contracts - 192,200 last year, up from 188,400 the previous year.\n\nThere are downsides to contract employment, of course, including finding quality candidates and a lack of commitment or loyalty to the company from contract staff. To overcome these issues, Science Centre extends the same benefits to our contract staff that all permanent staff enjoy, thereby making no distinction between contract and permanent staff.\n\nJack Chua\n\nCEO\n\nERA Singapore\n\nCONTRACT employment has much to do with the nature of the job. Positions which are of an ad-hoc or project basis are more likely to be filled by contract staff. However, for positions which are permanent, and where it is beneficial to the company if the staff understands the history and knows the culture of the company well, then contract staff will be considered too transient. In addition, where loyalty and sense of belonging is important, then permanent positions should be considered.\n\nGenerally, as contract workers are better paid than permanent workers, they do not enjoy the benefits of permanent workers, such as increments and bonuses. There have to be some trade-offs in both positions, to be fair to the company and to the workers too. Those who value freedom and flexibility can consider contract employment while those who want security and career advancement can look for permanent employment.\n\nFrom the company's perspective, the best option is to have a mixture of both permanent and contract staff, so that the company has more control and flexibility in managing its manpower needs and operating costs in the long run.\n\nChristophe Duchatellier\n\nCEO\n\nAdecco Asia\n\nTHE dynamic yet tight market allows for much more mobility and opportunities for jobseekers. Jobseekers now have several options to choose from, and contract hiring provides great benefits to both jobseekers as well as employers.\n\nContract hiring allows for higher mobility and flexibility as well as providing companies with much needed support, particularly during busy periods. Contract employers are generally exposed to a variety of projects and have a wide breadth of experience and can provide valuable insights for organisations. Firms are encouraged to recognise the value that these employees bring, and these employees should be seen as part of the whole team and not as an \"external\" team. Most organisations already provide leave and medical benefits. Other benefits include CPF, insurance and career planning.\n\nNatalia Shuman\n\nSenior Vice President, General Manager\n\nEMEA & APAC\n\nKelly Services\n\nCONTRACTING is a strategic option for employers as it provides them with the flexibility to inject specialist skills for specific projects without incurring the long-term costs of a permanent hire. Contractors can also benefit from this flexibility as it allows them to drive their own careers by choosing the projects that they would like to work on.\n\nWe are seeing more Singapore-based companies offer competitive packages to attract contract candidates with niche skill sets. However, the majority of employees still prefer the certainty of permanent positions to the flexibility of contract work.\n\nKaren Cariss\n\nCEO\n\nPageUp People\n\nCONTRACT hiring is on the rise in Singapore and other markets as it allows companies to better manage costs, especially under volatile market conditions. But while cost could very well be the biggest driver for contract hiring trend, there are other benefits that companies could derive from flexible employment. Contract workers provide firms with greater agility, productivity boost or temporary cover as and when needed. For example, retail companies usually hire additional staff on contract basis to fulfil requirements during peak periods. Contract hiring is also a solution, albeit a short-term one, for talent gaps in specific industries or job scopes.\n\nWhen it comes to compensation and benefits, contract employees definitely have a more tailored package that takes into account the candidate's skills set and experience, the responsibilities associated with the job, the duration and conditions of employment. Permanent staff are typically entitled to more long-term and fringe benefits and professional development opportunities. In the end, there are no hard and fast rules to managing a talent pool with a growing contract base but they can be supported by strategies and HR technologies to better track and manage costs on contract hires, with features such as mobile administration of timesheets, contract spend trend analysis, computerised alerts, instantaneous reporting and bulk actions are intended to decrease expenses for organisations.\n\nDoina Palici-Chehab\n\nCEO\n\nAXA Insurance Singapore Pte Ltd\n\nAT AXA, we are constantly on the lookout for great talent to join us - and this certainly includes contractors, for specific needs. Within the marketplace, there certainly is an increasing trend of more contract based employment being offered - and it is one that is beneficial to both companies as well as the contractors. Contractors are usually more readily available, with a wider range of different corporate experiences, from which they can draw on to bring value into your company. While this may come at a slight premium in pay, for a fixed duration and purpose this can be worth the cost. While you do need a strong core of permanent employees, contractors certainly have a place within an organisation as well, which in many cases have also led to permanent positions.\n\nZaheer Merchant\n\nRegional Director (Singapore & Europe)\n\nQI Group of Companies\n\nTHERE is a real trend towards contract employment in Singapore, and increasingly the region. In Singapore, we are fortunate to have developed and progressive employment laws, which have added clear contractual certainty here. Contract hiring no longer labels an employee as the perennial part-timer.\n\nThe pros for both employers and employees outweigh the cons, given flexible contract length, easy work scope planning, productivity and deployment (including redeployment), salary scales without statutory or other benefits, while giving ambitious employees an opportunity to explore and develop their fullest potential. The simplest adjustment for equitable parity with permanent employees is to adjust contract employees' salaries upwards to mitigate their position. Offering other simple on-job benefits, such as leave, are effective package perks. Ultimately the \"contract-to-permanent basis\" employment is also an available incentive. As Forbes journalist Kerry Hannon succinctly puts it - \"(contract) staffing is the bee's knees these days\".\n\nToby Fowlston\n\nManaging Director, Singapore\n\nRobert Walters (Singapore) Ltd\n\nIN the last three to four years, we have seen contract and temporary recruitment methods emerging and being used by a variety of employers. In particular, there has been a surge in the last 12 to 18 months. Employers are favouring contract staff for various reasons. They are able to bridge a resource gap for a fixed period of time without increasing headcount, and they are given the option to manage long-term sick leave or maternity leave effectively without added pressure on existing teams. Contracting also allows companies to see first-hand how a candidate operates in a role, and integrates into the company culture. This enables an assessment before making a permanent offer at the end of the contract assignment. There is also the time benefit in that they are often available on short notice. For the above reasons, there is an increasing wage premium on hiring temporary or contract employees.\n\nSteve Melhuish\n\nCo-Founder and Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nPropertyGuru\n\nCONTRARY to the conventional practice where companies hire contract staff to overcome temporary shortfalls, my company PropertyGuru hires staff on a temporary basis to help us enhance our Internet and mobile technology products. In particular, we hire technology specialists for, on average, two to four months. These employees would come on board and provide support to our core team of technology specialists and help us brainstorm ideas to improve our current operating Android and Apple mobile applications, and digital discretionary products available on our website. As we are constantly looking for the next big thing, these contract employees provide us with a fresh view on our technology systems and give us third-party ideas on how they feel we can better expand our bandwidth of offerings.\n\nAlso, we do use contract employees to head out to the market and perform on-ground research and give us the latest statistics on what end-users want to see in their digital products. Another division in my company that is big on contract employment is the marketing and brand division. We like to call them our \"Go-To-Gurus\" as these recurring temporary staff support the marketing division in their active roll-out of the many brand outreach initiatives in each of our financial year. These Go-To-Gurus give us the additional brand audit and awareness that my company looks to each year to ensure that we are constantly communicating and speaking with our consumers. We ensure that feedback is listened and responded to by improving the way that we develop, operate and roll out our brand promises.\n\nAnnie Yap\n\nManaging Director\n\nAYP Associates Pte Ltd\n\nWITH today's economic uncertainty, there is a growing workplace trend of hiring contractors rather than permanent employees to perform necessary services. This is a result of a number of factors, including greater flexibility, reduced overall costs and often a greater specialisation that contractors bring to a project. The distinction, however, has wide-reaching implications for a company's practices. An employee has certain benefits that generally are not available to contractors. In some countries, the contractors are paid a higher salary than regular employees to compensate them for the instability of a contract role. Problems arise when companies have difficulty hiring contractors as most candidates prefer a permanent role. Nevertheless, there are some advantages of taking on a contract assignment as it is an opportunity to pick up new skills as well.\n\nDora Hoan\n\nCo-Chairman/Group CEO\n\nBest World International Ltd\n\nCONTRACT employment has indeed become more popular with employers. They can control manpower costs and operate within tight budgets as well as maintain staffing flexibility and avoid staff retrenchment in the event of poor business. The manpower costs can be lower because the benefits provided to permanent staff are normally not given to contract staff since they are often employed for a limited period to support short-term or special projects. But the quality of contract staff may not be satisfactory compared with permanent staff. And permanent employees might not be keen to give up their full-time jobs for lack of job security. In any case, employers may face difficulty in retaining contract staff till the end of the contract period because they would probably resign once they find a permanent job. Hence, to attract or retain talent for contract jobs, employers may wish to work on the benefits. They could, for instance, provide the same perks or draw up special benefits such as target objectives performance bonus or end-of-contract bonus.\n\nDavid Leong\n\nManaging Director\n\nPeopleWorldwide Consulting Pte Ltd\n\nCONTRACT staffing is an alternative engagement format. Permanent staffing will form the core of the corps. Contract staffing augments the core. The pros of contract staffing are that employers can engage staff flexibly, employing on a needs basis. This gives them predictability in tenure and the ability to cap liabilities. But on the other side of the coin, contract staff are short changed since they may not enjoy the full suite of benefits and entitlements. The cons of contract staffing is that it does not instill any sense of loyalty to employers, and employers will have little lien to these staff members.\n\nTo improve the compensation package for contract staff, companies can consider providing a gratuity payment at end of the tenure to encourage completion of tenure and better loyalty; providing portable medical benefits and insurance on co-share basis; providing pro-rated medical and hospitalisation cover.\n\nWorkforce balance and internal equity is important to sustain overall motivation and a sense of value and commitment to employers, notwithstanding they are permanent or contract. Fair consideration should prevail in any mode of engagement.\n\nAngeli Beltran\n\nManaging Director\n\njobsDB Singapore & Malaysia\n\nSINGAPORE'S successful positioning as an attractive business destination has led to numerous international bands to base their operations and IT infrastructure here. Often, an organisation's strategy to set up its new team would include hiring permanent resources, as well as outsourcing specific operations to various IT services companies and independent contractors.\n\nAn individual specialising in a technical field has two career choices - to take on the managerial career route or to become an expert individual contributor. Contracting is a very popular career path in Europe, the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand. This is due to the flexibility that it provides to an individual's lifestyle - contracting professionals often make use of the breaks in between contracts to pursue hobbies or travel plans.\n\nFrom an organisational perspective, there are many benefits of hiring talents on contract, for example, completing a six-month task in three months by employing an expert provides a more cost-effective solution to an organisation; having a pool of contractors offers more flexibility in maintaining the workforce balance in times of downturn; contracting offers an initial insight into new markets which will help in making manpower decisions in countries with stricter labour laws; headcount issues can be easily managed by hiring talent on contract and passing on the responsibility of HR administration to professional organisations instead; and lastly, organisations have the flexibility to transfer talent from one project to another based on appropriate skills-sets required for different projects. Before the global IT revolution, the working culture in Asia has generally been skewed towards job longevity and stability, thus resulting in the contracting option being a less popular method of hiring or working in Asia.\n\nI believe that contracting is here to stay, regardless of a challenging or booming market. There are definitely more options out there in the job market when one keeps an open mind to consider contract work. Job seekers should consider contracting for the following reasons: It opens the door to a new industry or a new profile.\n\nIt is a stop-gap arrangement for those in-between jobs.\n\nIt gives you the opportunity to try out a role before deciding to move long-term into a similar position, without having to commit to your employer.\n\nYou gain exposure to new technologies and projects across the industry in a much shorter time span.\n\nYou are provided with the opportunity to list additional knowledge and value to your CV with every new project undertaken.\n\nYou are provided with the opportunity to prove yourself in a large MNC environment and get recognised for better roles.\n\nYou have the opportunity to experience salary increments from one contract to another instead of having to wait for annual increments.\n\nFrom a lifestyle perspective, it provides you with more freedom to plan longer holidays in between contracts or to invest your time in training and courses to upgrade yourself and gain more skills.\n\nIn short, contracting definitely provides you with a more flexible lifestyle while broadening the limits and horizons for a professional, well-rounded and exponential career path.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

On top of that, a Kyodo News survey says that this government bill aimed at toughening penalties for leaking state secrets is opposed by 50.6 per cent of the public. What might be regarded as this very \"un-Japanese\" call to popular protest has been occasioned by the decision of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's (LDP) government to submit to the national Diet a Secrecy Bill designed ostensibly to protect state information that the government deems vital to national security.\n\nMr Abe says that the draft legislation is meant to protect confidential information and that it is \"a prerequisite\" for the country so as to win the trust of, and share intelligence with, other countries. The prime minister apparently hopes to pass the bill in time for the planned launch of a Japanese version of the US National Security Council, to better respond to security threats around Japan, especially in dealing with China's assertive maritime activities and North Korea's nuclear and missile threats. However, bar associations and other advocates of constitutional democracy have expressed deep reservations about the proposed amendment. They argue that any government's claims of a need for secrecy must be balanced against the people's right to know about the actions of their government agents. There are also fears that this revision to the Freedom of Information Act of 2001 could restrict the flow of ordinary information that people need to know.\n\nIt is being asked, for instance, if the proposed law could curtail public access to information on issues such as the Fukushima nuclear crisis and the ongoing problems at the tsunami-devastated region and the seas around it. Or, for that matter, how the new law would affect information about tension with China over the disputed islands. These are both highly sensitive issues for the government. The Abe administration has come under severe domestic and international criticism for its handling of the Fukushima issue while skirmishes between Japanese and Chinese patrol vessels over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands have been openly publicised up to this point.\n\nThe timing of the bill, which the government hopes to pass in the parliamentary session ending on Dec 6, might appear unfelicitous given the current outcry in the US - now spreading to Europe and Asia - over abuse of state power in gathering and use of information. As well, the fact that the Abe administration is introducing the bill at a time when it is also seeking to make revisions to the pacifistic Constitution - changes that, among other things, would vest more power in the state and thus less in the hands of individual citizens - is disquieting.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A full list can be found on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's website: http://www.hkex.com.hk/eng/stat/smstat/chidimen/cd_hmb.htm\n\nKeep in mind that the actual market capitalisation of the companies is far larger than what is in the table. The numbers here only reflect the value of shares outstanding in the Hong Kong market.\n\nAnother thing to note is that investing in Hong Kong dollar-denominated shares exposes one to exchange rate risk.\n\nAs the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, and the US dollar has steadily weakened against the Singapore dollar over the years, the strength of the Singapore dollar is a potential worry for investors looking to buy Hong Kong dollar-denominated stocks. While S$1 could buy HK$4.50 at end-2003, S$1 now gets you about HK$6.20.\n\nA quick glance at the 50 largest H-share stocks shows that many are related to finance and commodities. The largest five stocks are China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications and state-owned oil and gas company PetroChina.\n\nFamiliar names might also include telco plays China Telecom and ZTE Corporation, airlines Air China and China Southern Airlines, and beer producer Tsingtao Brewery.\n\nA quick screen of H-shares trading at valuations around their book value and price-to-earnings (PE) ratios below eight times at end-October throws up some names.\n\nThe well-known Bank of China, for example, is trading at a 10 per cent discount to its book value and a PE ratio of 5.2 times.\n\nA far smaller bank, Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank, is trading at around five times its earnings and at a 15 per cent discount to book value.\n\nIt was at HK$3 a share just a few months ago, and has recovered 30 per cent to HK$3.90 a share now.\n\nChina Petroleum, otherwise known as Sinopec, refines, produces and trades petroleum and petrochemical products. It is trading slightly above book value with a PE ratio of eight times.\n\nSinopec and PetroChina are China's two largest energy companies. Both recently reported increased profit because of a government policy in March that allowed them to raise fuel prices to match increasing costs.\n\nSinopec reported a 20 per cent jump in third-quarter net profit to 22 billion yuan (S$4.48 billion), while PetroChina reported a 19 per cent gain in profit to 29.8 billion yuan.\n\nAnother energy supplier, China Coal Energy, has fallen about 35 per cent year-to-date. The company is trading at a 40 per cent discount to its book value and around seven times earnings.\n\nCoal producers have been reporting weak earnings because of excess supply and weakening demand.\n\nLow coal prices, however, have benefited cement producers such as Anhui Conch Cement, which is the largest Hong Kong-listed cement maker.\n\nThe company had recovered from June lows of HK$20 a share by more than 30 per cent to now trade at about HK$27 a share, with a PE ratio of more than 17 and 2.3 times book.\n\nInvestors should also take note that H-shares trade at different valuations from A-shares, but commentators have said there is no easy way to gain arbitrage profits between the two because of the closed nature of the Chinese market - unless policymakers act to open it up.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Which is all very good if you're in River Cottage like Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstal where you know the name of the porker you're going to eat and the whole village makes a big occasion out of the slaughter; or if you at least have access to a butcher who buys entire pigs from a farm he's familiar with.\n\nTranslating that kind of thinking to Singapore is a little more tricky. Here, we're lucky just to know whether we're eating AirPork or not - never mind the conditions the pig was reared in, or whether the intestines and liver you buy are from the same animal or scooped from a common pool of entrails in an assembly line slaughterhouse while the remaining bits of animal are turned into dog food. I'm just saying ...\n\nOnce the lofty ideals are out of the way, it's possible to focus on the second half of Henderson's quote, which is, \"there is a set of delights, textural and flavoursome, which lie beyond the fillet\". That is true, and that would be the premise of Wolf, which is broadly inspired by Henderson's hip London restaurant. Where other eateries might stop at a chewy bavette of beef or bone marrow in the name of adventurous dining, Wolf explores a deeper culinary path paved with hearts, livers and intestines. All are nothing to flinch at in a Chinese restaurant, but in a Western eatery where you rarely see the face of a fish on your plate, it's no small matter to get this close to a pig's head.\n\nEven so, Wolf tiptoes around the nose-to-tail concept rather than going the whole hog, with a rather small menu that limits itself to the likes of salads with your choice of beef hearts, pig's ear or chicken livers. The day we are there, the very friendly and polished staff are offering the daily special of chitlins or chitterlings - a slightly gamey sausage made of intestines that they conceded were not made in-house. And it did taste like commercially made sausage with its too-fine texture and an imbalance of spices. We much prefer the house-made pig's head and trotter brawn ($18) - meticulously picked out head meat and trotter bits set in jiggly, collagen-enriched gelatinous slabs and served with thick toasted country bread. A salad of julienned endives in a mild aioli dressing with long strips of pig's ear and sweet pearls of pomegranate ($20) could have used more ears and a punchier dressing, but we can happily live with this pleasing textural mixture of cartilage and crisp-tender greens.\n\nWe're less happy with the \"grilled\" ox tongue ($38) where instead of taking up the challenge to grill fresh tongue - which if successful yields a tender, steak-like bite - the tongue is braised beyond resistance and then pan-fried. When you've been searching fruitlessly for a local equivalent of Japanese grilled tongue, this is yet another dead end. The braised puy lentils which are a few minutes short of tender and a salsa verde do not compensate either.\n\nApart from the heart-stopping deep-fried chicken skin snacks you get when you first sit down, the oxtail and lips stew ($32) is another diet-killing but comforting choice where all gristle and cartilage is broken down into a thick tomato-enhanced rich gravy lined with silky smooth potato puree and carrot chunks. If all that gelatine is too much for you, the wood-smoked kurobuta pork chop ($48) is pricey but its char-broiled fragrance and well-brined flavour offer familiarity and flavour. While served so pink that it's almost rare in the middle, it's still slightly dry. No fault of the chef's though - one has long concluded that there is no such thing as a moist and tender pork chop regardless of provenance - maybe Wolf should just stick its neck out and do a roasted pork collar instead.\n\nWith its solid staff, slick surroundings and very clever wall-etchings of a wolf's face and flying pigs, Wolf is a polished set-up even if you take away its nose-to-tail leanings. If anything, it seems to be too hesitant to take up a stronger stand with its menu in favour of being all things to all diners. There is a lot more to explore on this front, especially in the form of home-made sausages, blood puddings, liver and kidney fry-ups (perhaps pig's head every day instead of requiring a two-day advance order). One would hazard that greater exposure and experience for the chef would go a long way towards achieving the inherent confidence and maturity that Wolf needs if it's serious about developing this concept.\n\nAs it stands, it works as your above-average Club Street eatery with its fair share of strengths and weaknesses. But if it wants to go the whole nine yards in terms of respecting the animals that we eat, then Wolf needs more guts to prove it.\n\nRating: 7\n\nWHAT OUR RATINGS MEAN\n\n10: The ultimate dining experience\n\n9-9.5: Sublime\n\n8-8.5: Excellent\n\n7-7.5: Good to very good\n\n6-6.5: Promising\n\n5-5.5: Average\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Nokia's maps assets are based on its US$8.1 billion purchase of global mapping giant Navteq in 2008.\n\nNavteq's maps provide the base data for services such as Yahoo Maps and Bing Maps, as well as maps by GPS maker Garmin.\n\nThe use of maps on smartphones has become so common that Google and Apple decided to build their own maps for their devices, in large part to avoid licence fees to Nokia and competitor Tele Atlas, which started getting hefty because of usage globally.\n\nMr Halbherr said that Here maps have been made available for iPhones and Androids, as well as Windows phones and Nokia's more basic Symbian devices.\n\nThis takes away one of the touted differentiating features of Nokia's own lines of Lumia smartphones, but come 2014, that'll be Microsoft's problem. When the Lumia range was launched, one of trumped features was the presence of Nokia's maps installed in the phone.\n\nNokia is the only maps provider which allows entire cities to be downloaded, allowing a smartphone to navigate without a data connection and making it a reliable GPS device in a foreign country. Apple and Android maps allow some offline use via caching, but largely rely on connectivity for fuller features such as turn-by-turn navigation.\n\nNokia has also been touting the walking directions of its maps for years, by placing people on the ground in busy cities.\n\nThe Finnish company has plenty of growth ahead for maps. In 2012, Here contributed just 4 per cent of Nokia's net sales, while the rest was evenly split between its handset and networking infrastructure businesses. It already counts car makers like Ford, BMW, Audi and Toyota as its customers, and it is investing in new technology to get an edge over players like Google.\n\nLast month, its new True II mapping cars started trawling the streets of Singapore. It looks like a Google Street View car, but its technology does way more, said Kirk Mitchell, vice-president of Asia-Pacific sales and business development for Here.\n\nWhile the Street View cars feature a camera mounted on its top, taking pictures as it drives along, the True II car has rotating lasers which capture 700,000 points each second. The laser determines the distance between an object and the car, allowing the car to map a 3D model of its landscape, not just photos. It also has sensitive position sensors which measure any changes in the road such as bumps or tilts, to map out smoother travelling routes, said Mr Mitchell.\n\nAll of this technology is necessary, because we have barely scratched the surface of creating maps, said Mr Halbherr. \"Maps today are just digital representations of paper maps,\" he said.\n\nThe future of mapping should see us holding up our phones for augmented reality, and it should include voice recognition instead of typing, he added. In future, in-dash maps should also be connected to the Web, so that real-time changes and live traffic data can be pulled down, he said.\n\nMap-making is a technology-intensive process, he said. \"Making a map is always a moving target - once you create the map, it's out of date. Some 2.7 million updates are made to Nokia's maps every single day,\" he said.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, Nokia Here has 1,500 people based in Singapore, Japan, India, Korea and Australia. It also works with governments to get information such as traffic data.\n\nNokia announced in September the impending US$7 billion sale of its handset division to Microsoft.\n\nWhen the sale is completed, Nokia will be left with three business divisions: Here, the Nokia Solutions and Networks (formerly Nokia Siemens Networks) networking infrastructure business, and its Advanced Technologies division, which holds its R&D work and patent portfolio.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The figures were down from the previous week's 19 firms, 50 trades and $9.5 million.\n\nBuyers outweighed sellers with 14 companies that posted 25 purchases worth $4.8 million versus a paltry three firms with five disposals worth $768,000.\n\nAside from directors, the buyback activity fell last week with four firms that recorded five repurchases worth $463,000. The figures were down from the previous week's five companies, 17 trades and $1.57 million.\n\nThe bulk of the significant trades last week were purchases with buybacks in Soup Restaurant Group and XMH Holdings. On the directors' side, there were key insider buys in Jubilee Industries, Tee Land, and Grand Banks Yachts.\n\nOn the institutional shareholders' front, Templeton acquired more shares of Ezion Holdings. Lastly, there were conflicting substantial shareholder trades in Cordlife Group.\n\nSoup Restaurant Group\n\nRestaurant chain operator Soup Restaurant Group bought back more shares with 1.1 million shares purchased from Oct 9 to 31 at an average of 23 cents each. The trades accounted for 6 per cent of the stock's trading volume. The company last bought back 194,000 shares on Oct 31 at 25.6 cents each. The group previously acquired 4.735 million shares from Aug 7 to Sept 27 at 20 cents to 16 cents each or an average of 18.1 cents each. The repurchases since August are the company's first buybacks since the stock was listed in May 2007. The trades since August were made on the back of the rise in the share price since November 2012 from 11.8 cents. The counter is also sharply up since October 2008 from 4.8 cents. The counter closed at 26 cents on Friday.\n\nXMH Holdings\n\nMarine and industrial diesel engine, propulsion, and power-generating solutions provider XMH Holdings resumed buying back at higher than its previous acquisition prices with 760,000 shares purchased on Oct 31 at 37 cents each. The buybacks, however, were made on the back of the 20 per cent drop in the share price since June from 46 cents. The group previously acquired 1.16 million shares from March 13 to April 3 at an average of 27.4 cents each, 100,000 shares in December 2012 at 19 cents each, and 13.7 million shares from September 2011 to February 2012 at an average of 16.1 cents each. Also positive this year is executive director Tan Guat Lian with an initial 90,000 shares (deemed) purchased on July 25 at 39.3 cents each. The shares bought represented 0.02 per cent of the issued capital. She also has direct interest of 35.886 million shares or 9.32 per cent. That is her first on-market trade since the stock was listed in January 2011. The director's purchase price was sharply higher than the IPO price of 25 cents. The counter closed at 37.5 cents on Friday.\n\nJubilee Industries Holdings\n\nExecutive director Toh Soon Huat recorded his first on-market trades in plastic moulding services provider Jubilee Industries Holdings since his appointment in April with 2.67 million shares purchased from Oct 28 to 30 at an average of 17.7 cents each. The trades, which accounted for 19 per cent of the stock's trading volume, increased his deemed holdings by 11 per cent to 28.025 million shares or 11.94 per cent. The purchases were made on the back of the 40 per cent drop in the share price since April from 29.5 cents. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since October 2012 from eight\n\ncents. The corporate shareholder sentiment is not entirely positive this year as substantial shareholder Chua Kim Guan unloaded 11.76 million shares from September 24 to 27 at an average of 20.1 cents each, which lowered his deemed stake by 47 per cent to 13.388 million shares or 5.7 per cent. Those are his first on-market trades since the stock was listed in July 2009. Mr Chua's sale price was lower than the IPO price of 27 cents. The counter closed at 17.7 cents on Friday.\n\nTEE Land\n\nNon-executive chairman and independent director Er Dr Lee Bee Wah recorded her first on-market trade in property developer TEE Land Ltd since the stock was listed in June with 85,000 shares purchased on Oct 29 at 36 cents each. The trade increased her direct holdings by 94 per cent to 175,000 shares or 0.04 per cent. The acquisition was made on the back of the 37 per cent drop in the share price since June from 57 cents. Not surprisingly, the chairman's purchase price was lower than the IPO price of 54 cents. Three other shareholders have also bought shares since listing. Independent director Chin Sek Peng acquired an initial 60,000 shares from Aug 29 to 30 at 34 cents each. Non-executive director Timothy Ong, on the other hand, purchased 200,000 shares from Aug 21 to 22 at 36 cents each, which increased his direct holdings by 69 per cent to 490,000 shares or 0.11 per cent. He previously acquired 200,000 shares from June 10 to 12 at an average of 51.3 cents each and an initial 90,000 shares on June 5 in the IPO at 54 cents each. Lastly, substantial shareholder Koh Wee Meng acquired four million shares on Aug 5 at an estimated price of 38 cents each, which boosted his direct stake 17 per cent to 28.000 million shares or 6.27 per cent. He previously reported an initial filing on June 10 of two million shares at 52.5 cents each, which raised his interest to 5.37 per cent. The counter closed at 35 cents on Friday.\n\nGrand Banks Yachts\n\nIndependent director Basil Chan recorded his first trade in yachts manufacturer Grand Banks Yachts Ltd since February 2012 with 100,000 shares purchased on Nov 1 at 22.5 cents each. The trade increased his direct holdings by 6,667 per cent to 102,000 shares or 0.06 per cent. The acquisition was made on the back of the 41 per cent drop in the share price since October 2012 from 38.2 cents. The purchase was also made after the company announced on Oct 28 a first-quarter loss of $579,000 which was less than the loss of $1.446 million in the same period last year. Mr Chan previously acquired an initial 1,000 shares in February 2012 at 21 cents each. The counter closed at 22.5 cents on Friday.\n\nEzion Holdings\n\nTempleton International, Inc acquired more shares of offshore marine logistics and support services provider Ezion Holdings with a purchase-related filing on Oct 28 of 1.1 million shares at $2.24 each. The trade increased its deemed holdings to 68.476 million shares or 7.11 per cent. The filing was made on the back of the 9 per cent drop in the share price since August from $2.47. Despite the fall in the share price, the counter is still up since June from $1.98. The group previously reported a purchase-related filing on May 31 of 96,000 shares at $2.25 each. Prior to the notices this year, the fund manager acquired 17.86 million shares from Nov 25, 2011, to Feb 23, 2012, at estimated prices of 61.5 cents to 96 cents each and an initial filing on Nov 24, 2011, of 1.455 million shares at 62 cents each, which raised its interest to 5.18 per cent. Overall, Templeton's stake is up by 37 per cent since that initial filing in November 2011. The stock closed at $2.29 on Friday.\n\nCordlife Group\n\nThere are conflicting trades in private cord blood banking services provider Cordlife Group in October with purchases by Coop International Pte Ltd versus a sale by FMR LLC & FIL Ltd. Coop International purchased 2.3 million shares from Oct 4 to 11 and a further 564,000 shares on Oct 28 at an average of $1.21 each. The trades increased its direct holdings by 12 per cent to 27.319 million shares or 10.22 per cent. The purchases were made on the back of the 44 per cent rise in the share price since June from 84 cents. The counter is also sharply up since June 2012 from 43 cents. The group previously acquired 2 million shares in April 2012 at an estimated price of 55 cents each. Coop International became a substantial shareholder in March 2012 after it acquired an initial 18.45 million shares or 7.93 per cent via placement and off-market trade at 50 cents each. Overall, the group's stake is up by 8.87 million shares or 48 per cent since that initial filing in March 2012. On the negative side, FMR LLC recorded its first sale since the stock was listed in March 2012 with 69,000 shares sold on Oct 23 at $1.00 each, which lowered its deemed stake to 24.035 million shares or 8.99 per cent. The group previously acquired 803,000 shares from Oct 4 to 9 at $1.25 each and a purchase-related filing on Oct 3 of 53,000 shares at $1.34 each. Prior to its trades since October, the fund manager acquired a net 7.7 million shares from July 2 to Aug 6 at $1.06 to $1.14 each. Investors should note that CEO Jeremy Yee Pinh purchased 80,000 shares from Sept 4 to 13 at an average of $1.33 each, which increased his direct holdings to 1.731 million shares or 0.74 per cent. He previously acquired 25,000 shares in October 2012 at 58 cents each, 100,000 shares in August 2012 at 53 cents each and 200,000 shares from April to May 2012 at 56 cents to 47 cents each or an average of 51.2 cents each. The stock closed at $1.195 on Friday.\n\nThe writer is managing director, Asia Insider Ltd\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But analysts fear that the Bank of Japan's super-easy monetary policy is creating a runway for a steep take-off that will lead to a crash.\n\nThis comes amid a warning by rating agency Standard & Poor's that rising levels of mortgage-based financial leverage in Asian households could create risks for local banks.\n\nThe sharp spike in property values has been less visible than the surge in stock and bond markets in many parts of Asia because property transactions are less transparent. But this is precisely what makes the boom more threatening, say analysts.\n\nAfter the mega-crash in Japanese land and property prices following the collapse of the bubble economy two decades ago, real estate has been a quiet sector compared with other markets such as China, Hong Kong or Singapore.\n\nBut this could be about to change dramatically, said former Goldman Sachs (Asia) vice-president Kenneth Courtis.\n\nDespite having got their fingers burnt, banks are back in the mortgage market and are being pushed by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to lend more.\n\n\"With short-term interest rates at zero and long- term rates being driven down by an unprecedented monetary blitzkrieg launched by the (BOJ) with the aim of generating inflation, investors have been scrambling to take on as much Japanese real estate exposure as they can,\" Mr Courtis told The Business Times.\n\n\"In major metropolitan areas, prices are up sharply. In core Tokyo, prices for new, freehold residential real estate are up 22 per cent over the past year. That still means that valuations are but a quarter to a third of what they were at the peak 23 years ago, (but) I expect a further upward move in prices.\"\n\nGiven that the summer Olympic Games are due to be held in Tokyo in 2020, property prices could receive what some analysts describe as a \"steroidal boost\" - starting well before the games are held.\n\nIn fact, this is already happening. At projects close to the proposed Athletes' Village, the first 800 or so units that went on sale in August were snapped up.\n\nBuyers expect BOJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda's pledge to double the monetary base over the next two years to push up real estate prices, said Ryo Hashimoto, head of condo sales at Skyz Tower & Garden, an apartment building near the Athletes' Village.\n\nThe \"quanto easing in which Japan is currently engaged is simply gigantic\", said Mr Courtis. \"Japan today is pumping new liquidity into its financial system at three times the rate relative to GDP that the US is doing.\"\n\nHe is not the only one to call attention to rising prices. In Tokyo, the average price of new condos jumped nearly 10 per cent in the year ended June 30 to 686,000 yen (S$8,643) per square metre, said the Land Institute of Japan.\n\nLand prices are on the rise again in the major cities after slumping 85 per cent in the wake of the bubble economy crash, leaving banks with US$1 trillion of bad loans, according to Global Property Guide.\n\nIn the year ended June, the average price of land in Tokyo rose 5 per cent to 204,500 yen psm.\n\nJapan is by no means alone in experiencing property-price inflation. \"From China to Canada and London, fast-rising property markets are haunting the global economy again, five years after the US subprime mortgage bubble burst and triggered the worst financial crisis since the 1930s,\" Reuters said in a global survey published last week.\n\nIt noted, however, that \"except in a few cases, the warning signals are flashing amber, not red, and several countries have acted to cool overheating markets\".\n\nStill, it added, \"the confidence of policymakers that they can avoid another generalised boom and bust could be tested if central banks keep pumping out nearly free money to support economic growth by encouraging investment in riskier assets, such as equities and property\".\n\nMeanwhile, Asia's increasing household leverage - mainly from rising mortgages - could be risky for Asian banks'creditworthiness, according to an S&P report last week.\n\nThe report evaluated asset quality of banks in six economies: Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong and China. It noted that while banks in Asia have been operating under favourable credit conditions resulting from healthy economic growth for a few years now, a structural weakness appears to be emerging in some economies.\n\n\"Rising household debt fuelled by rapid loan growth and easy monetary conditions could weaken the credit quality of banks in Asia,\" said S&P credit analyst Ivan Tan. \"Potential asset bubbles and imbalances are building up in some countries, and could put the banks at risk.\"\n\nMalaysia, Thailand, Singapore and South Korea have the highest household debt in Asia, S&P noted.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

And while information technology (IT) and engineering professionals are known to command higher salaries, those who move cite other reasons.\n\n\"As a trend, I do see it increasing; we actually try to keep track of the numbers,\" said Vinnie Lauria, founding partner of tech incubator Golden Gate Ventures (GGV) which has offices in Singapore and SV.\n\n\"As the Singaporean network in SV gets stronger, it encourages more folks to make the jump - something they were afraid to do earlier.\"\n\nAlthough there are no absolute numbers to show, Mark Sin, president of SingaporeConnect, a grassroots organisation that supports Singaporeans living in San Francisco, noted that he is seeing more Singaporeans at get-togethers.\n\nFor James Chan, the founder-CEO of tech incubator Silicon Straits who studied and worked in SV from 2005 to 2009, said the increase was not obvious to him - until he came home.\n\n\"It got a lot more obvious after I returned to Singapore and tried to wrap my head around the shortage of startup-compatible software engineers here. Those who were sufficiently exposed to Western tech media tended to aspire to leave Singapore to work at startups in SV,\" he said.\n\nWhy SV? A major pull factor mentioned by many is surprisingly not the salary, but that there is a greater respect for tech and engineering professions there.\n\nSaid Shaun Lim, who moved to SV to work at PayPal after graduating from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2010: \"I'm a software engineer and this is arguably the best place to be for my profession.\n\n\"The work here is more interesting and meaningful. Even as a junior engineer, I was able to start projects of significant size from scratch and be responsible for design and implementation. I don't believe this is something engineers in Singapore enjoy.\"\n\nCaleb Chao, a fellow NUS graduate and now a software engineer at Google, said he appreciated the opportunity to develop and work on established and complex IT systems there.\n\n\"Large IT companies have offices in Singapore mainly for sales, marketing and technical support; development is mostly non-existent and at the very most a token presence,\" Mr Chao said.\n\nThe Valley's open, welcoming and progressive culture is another much-talked-about pull factor.\n\n\"Hours are flexible. If people want to take time off for appointments or errands, there's no need to specifically take vacation hours,\" Mr Sin said.\n\n\"SV is an inspirational place to be in. Words like 'disrupt', 'change' and 'new technologies' are all the rage; coffee shops are always packed with entrepreneurs working on startup ideas or pitching to investors. We also get to be at the forefront of and use the latest technologies before others do,\" said Jenn Ng, who worked at DBS and PwC Singapore before joining SV-headquartered software company Intuit.\n\n\"It's the only spot in the world that has kept up with its virtuous cycle of paying it forward, and celebrates failure as much as it celebrates successes,\" said Silicon Straits' Mr Chan.\n\nAgreeing, GGV's Mr Lauria said: \"It's a culture that rewards risk-seekers. Most people in the Valley are from somewhere else; 52 per cent of startups are by foreign-born entrepreneurs. These are the people who aren't scared of failure and will dare take a jump into the unknown.\"\n\nIn fact, one of the reasons why SV thrives is that it is a land of equal opportunities for immigrants, said Tan Yinglan, author of The Way of the VC and venture partner at Sequoia Capital.\n\n\"Anecdotally, immigrants in SV have been entrepreneurial, motivated, hungry and eager to improve their lot in life. This creates economic dynamism in the Valley,\" Mr Tan noted.\n\n\"It can be a pretty competitive place to be in. Analysts are expected to have a certain level of technical abilities such as coding skills. Many interns don't mind working for free, and it is still a male-dominated industry,\" Ms Ng pointed out.\n\nFor those who work for pay, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the software engineer in SV commanded an average annual wage of US$100,049 last year. This compares with the average annual salary of $57,936 drawn by a software engineer in Singapore.\n\nHuman resource consulting firm Robert Half International also ranked SV as the fourth metro area in the United States likely to offer the biggest pay raise in 2014.\n\nAnd while many places, including Singapore, have aspired to learn from SV's successes, observers said the island-state should not aspire to be the next SV. It has made significant strides in maturating its tech and startup ecosystem, and is better-placed to be Asia's startup hub instead.\n\n\"The 'SV label' carries with it a heavy burden of expectations that Singapore is still far from meeting. A good amount of entrepreneurial talent bled out of our ecosystem after the dotcom bust.\n\n\"We're only just beginning to see a revival of key elements in our ecosystem over the past two years - designers, engineers, entrepreneurs, capitalists, investments, acquisitions - yet, much remains to be done before Singapore becomes the 'SV of Asia',\" said Mr Chan.\n\nMr Sin added it is difficult for Singapore to claim the title with competition from bigger markets such as China and India.\n\nAnother hindrance to the startup scene here is that most people live with their families, unlike in the US, and this inhibits entrepreneurship and risk appetite, Mr Lauria said.\n\n\"The number of start-up teams that live and work out of the same apartment in SV is very high. It's amazing what you can do when you're all forced into a small apartment 24/7,\" he said.\n\nMr Lim of PayPal added: \"I do feel that like many things, entrepreneurship in Singapore is being driven largely from a top-down approach, and that can't be too healthy.\"\n\nBut many cited Singapore's stable economic and political systems, high cultural acceptance, strong government funding support and startup events such as Echelon and TechVenture, as beneficial in growing its tech ecosystem.\n\nSaid Steve Leonard, executive deputy chairman of Singapore's Infocomm Development Authority, at the 2013 TechVenture in September: \"It is not Singapore's goal to be another version of SV. We should find something to create for ourselves.\"\n\n\"It is great that Singaporeans are moving to SV. I anticipate that some of them will return home to start their new venture or work for local startups. But as the region's startup hub, it is good for Singapore to have close ties with the Valley,\" said Mr Tan.\n\nMr Lauria, who travels frequently to look up the startup scene in each country, said: \"Singapore really stood out for me because of the startup community here - it reminds me of SV in terms of openness and enthusiasm. There are few global cities as international and diverse as Singapore, and that's an asset for the startup scene.\n\n\"That said, I don't think being the 'SV of Asia' is a great goal to set. Singapore should figure out its place in the region and execute as a startup hub.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

In most of the cases covered by Freshfields, the company suffered a major blow - affecting its value, revenue and long-term reputation - from the inability to control reputational crises in the early stages.\n\nFifty-eight per cent experienced a significant disruption to their operations, while 53 per cent suffered a loss of revenue, and 27 per cent, a drop in share price.\n\nOn top of that, news of crises tends to stay in the media spotlight for months, rather than days or weeks. 53 per cent of cases were still in the public eye a month after the story first broke.\n\nThis clearly presents new challenges for companies today.\n\nStephen Revell, a partner at Freshfields' Singapore office, told The Business Times that the Singapore business community is definitely adjusting to the new paradigm.\n\n\"There is a clear recognition in many Singapore companies that we talk to about crisis management, of the importance of preparing for a crisis and the new ways a crisis can take hold.\n\n\"The large increase in PR (public relations) advisory firms opening their doors in Singapore suggests that there is a clear appetite in the market to get ahead of the curve in terms of crisis preparation.\"\n\nFreshfields' findings come from a survey of 102 senior crisis communications professionals from the United Kingdom, Europe, Asia and the United States. Those interviewed have advised on a total of over 2,000 significant reputational crises in the last year.\n\nThey said that businesses are just not moving fast enough to contain a crisis when it breaks.\n\nOn average, companies took 21 hours to issue meaningful external communications and more than 48 hours in 18 per cent of incidents. Only 15 per cent of companies managed to get a complete response out within the hour.\n\nMore worryingly, over four in 10 firms had no plan in place in case of a crisis. Only a third had relevant communications material ready, and just one in five had run a simulation exercise.\n\nHarald Spruit, a partner with Freshfields in Netherlands, said: \"Organisations seem to be much less prepared for dealing with the social media aspects of a crisis than they are with overall crisis planning.\"\n\nIn half of all cases, social media had a significant impact on how the story spread locally, while in almost a third of cases, it played a major role in how the story spread globally.\n\nThe communication professionals surveyed said that this failure to prepare effectively to handle the issue online left their clients open to \"trial by Twitter\".\n\nAlso, while two-thirds of the cases suffered only a temporary impact, the remaining third saw more serious long-term damage, such as product recalls, liquidity problems, material litigation and hacking of their IT systems.\n\nNews of close to two-thirds of crises crossed national boundaries, meaning that the impact of issues was restrained to the originating country in only one in three cases. On average, information about a corporate crisis spread to 11 countries.\n\nFreshfields stressed that it is important for companies to balance the need to respond promptly with the potential liabilities. Norbert Nolte, a partner with the firm in Germany, said: \"Companies must ensure that they balance the need to respond to the media at speed with appraising legal risk, otherwise those words could come back to haunt them.\"\n\nFifty-five per cent of the experts consulted said that the companies' legal advisers had a major influence on what was ultimately said to the media. It was found that the more closely the communications and the legal teams worked, the more effective and prompt the response.\n\nGeoff Nicholas, disputes partner and co-head of Freshfields global investigations practice, concluded: \"Companies need to have nimble structures and procedures to take advantage of these vacuums of time. The truly unexpected will inevitably have less that companies can fall back on but, most of the time, good preparation will make a real difference as to how successfully a crisis is ultimately handled.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

China became Africa's biggest bilateral trading partner in 2009, with the total volume of trade valued at $198.5 billion in 2012. This is expected to breach $380 billion by 2015.\n\nIn contrast, Singapore-Africa trade is far more modest and has been rising steadily to reach US$14.1 billion (S$17.5 billion) in 2012.\n\nSuch a formidable Chinese presence begs the question: Do Singapore companies even stand a chance in Africa, or have they missed the boat already?\n\n\"In my opinion, there is still scope for Singapore companies to venture into Africa,\" said Djoko Prihanto, senior vice president at Surbana Urban Planning Group. \"While China has come with investment, Singapore is known for its integrity, quality and professionalism, so for certain types of professional work the client may still value the Singapore branding.\"\n\nAdded Colin Tan, director and head of research and consultancy at Suntec Real Estate Consultants: \"China's strength is in their manufacturing capability and exporting of their construction services. But when it comes to advisory services, their quality and standards are some way behind us.\"\n\nIn large and booming economies such as Nigeria, for instance, Singapore's expertise would be especially valued, according to Bola Adesola, CEO of Standard Chartered Bank Nigeria.\n\n\"With a population of over 160 million people and there being a large infrastructure deficit in Nigeria, there are still opportunities that Singaporean companies can tap ... (It) can utilise its expertise in the service industry and focus on IT, finance and petroleum industries, among others.\"\n\nThe Republic's experience in water management is one area Nigerians are keen to learn more about. \"There is a need for potable water planning and development in Nigeria and this is a good example of where Singapore's reputation of being one of the most advanced countries in water management can be leveraged,\" added Ms Adesola.\n\nRwanda - despite being known for its 1994 genocide that killed at least half a million people - is frequently cited as an ideal investment locale for Singapore businesses.\n\nIn fact, President Paul Kagame dreams of his East African nation becoming \"the Singapore of Africa\". To that end, Rwanda's urban planning authority has enlisted Singapore's expertise in doing masterplanning for the capital city, Kigali.\n\n\"We are helping them to formulate the vision for the next 25 years to 2040,\" said Surbana's Mr Prihanto. \"What will Rwanda look like by then? How big will the population be? What should the key economic sectors be? This is what we're doing there.\"\n\nWhile Surbana declined to say how much the Rwanda contract was worth, Mr Prihanto said: \"Projects in Africa for urban planning are larger in scale and complexity, and command higher consultancy fees than (other) typical planning projects in Asia.\"\n\nSingapore businessmen say other bright spots include countries such as Angola, Tanzania and Uganda.\n\n\"Because of their colonial roots, many of these countries have different investment laws,\" said Cody Lee, director, Middle East & Africa, Singapore Business Federation (SBF). \"But there's not a single country on the continent that I know of that does not allow foreigners to do business there.\"\n\nWith a new memorandum of understanding (MOU) recently signed between IE Singapore and China, Singapore companies looking to penetrate the African market can now partner the China Development Bank, known to be a heavyweight financier of infrastructure projects with extensive networks on the continent.\n\nThe agreement will see both countries fostering strategic partnerships between their firms in third-country markets, with an initial focus on Africa and South-east Asia.\n\n\"There are many ways Singapore companies can actually leverage China's experience in Africa. For example, Singapore can do the planning for a project and China can chip in to fund and build the project. Both countries can share ownership of the entire thing,\" said Mr Lee.\n\nHe encourages companies to do their research, network with Singapore groups already in Africa and attend business and investment forums organised by IE Singapore and SBF.\n\n\"The important thing to remember is that Africa isn't some distant place that Singapore companies should stay far away from. It's not Mars, and people need to realise that.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Already, the country's government agencies are on guard and have tightened IT security, the regulator said.\n\n\"Government agencies have been on heightened vigilance and have enhanced the security of their IT systems in response to the declared threats against the government's ICT infrastructure,\" IDA said in a statement last night.\n\n\"Meanwhile, businesses and individuals are urged to take the necessary precautions to enhance cyber security.

However, this was rectified by 5.20 pm,\" it added.\n\nEven so, some maintenance works will continue over the next few days, which might mean intermittent access to some government websites, IDA said.\n\nYesterday, an IDA incident report dated last Saturday - uploaded by an unknown person to the Internet - mirrored the regulator's account of events.\n\nThe incidence report made references to a routing problem and a router that experienced hardware failure during an \"urgent scheduled maintenance . . . to test the implementation of a security solution for Internet access\".\n\nThe report said that as a result of the glitch, government agencies on the affected connection were unable to surf public websites from the internal government network, while members of the public were unable to access the government's Internet systems and e-services on the same connection.\n\n\"We are waiting for an incident report from the . . . service provider,\" the report said.\n\nYesterday, IDA stressed that \"maintenance of IT systems is part of the government's on-going efforts to enhance security\".\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But unlike previous years, this will not be done by introducing a string of schemes.\n\nInstead, the focus will be on refining and enhancing the many programmes that have already been implemented, based on feedback gathered by the recently formed SME Workgroup - a government-led body comprising business leaders, government agencies and grassroots advisers.\n\nTeo Ser Luck, Minister of State for Trade and Industry, shared this with The Business Times in a recent interview.\n\nHe said: \"One thing I won't do is to roll out many, many, many schemes. . . We need to focus on implementation, not rolling out more schemes.\n\n\"This means implementing existing schemes effectively and making the necessary changes, refining them based on feedback, and also making sure that we set up the infrastructure to make sure these schemes can be implemented.\"\n\nAny programme that will be introduced must \"make some real impact\", he added.\n\nThe decision to roll out fewer schemes comes amid feedback that there are currently too many programmes in place to help SMEs in Singapore.\n\nThe different names and aims of the programmes are often a cause of confusion, and their sheer number - some consultants put it past 200 - have made it difficult for SMEs to know what is available.\n\nBut this may soon be history. Mr Teo, who heads the SME Workgroup, said that plans are afoot to streamline the schemes such that they become \"so simple, so streamlined\" for SMEs to tap on.\n\n\"I think all the schemes are well-intentioned. But the way we have rolled them out has been too detailed, too many. So we are going to streamline them, that's for sure.\n\n\"I aspire to do that soon,\" said Mr Teo.\n\nSpring Singapore, the agency which oversees a large number of the SME-related schemes, said that it has already streamlined a number of schemes into what it now calls the Capability Development Grant. This was already announced in Budget 2013.\n\n\"We will however, continue to review and simplify existing schemes and programmes to ensure their relevance and usefulness. We will make announcements in due course if necessary,\" said Spring.\n\nSMEs can also visit the SME Centres, speak to the advisers there on the project they are working on, and have the advisers help with applying for all the schemes that they can tap on.\n\n\"That's also why we need to streamline the schemes, so that the advisers are more knowledgeable and it's easier to apply for and implement the schemes for the business.\"\n\nHe also hopes to help SMEs achieve cost advantages by beefing up industry or sector-related initiatives.\n\n\"We can centralise certain help, centralise certain backroom, so that they can all get economies of scale.\"\n\nBut SMEs need to play their part. They should tap on the help provided by the government as much as they can to defray rising costs, and look for new revenue streams wherever possible to continue and sustain the business, he added.\n\n\"So the SME Workgroup, whilst helping, trying to engage and accompanying SMEs along this journey, can't really spoonfeed because we cannot afford to do so. It is not sustainable. And business is not done this way. It's about survival.\"\n\nOverall, the SME sector needs to find ways to grow and strengthen itself.\n\nHe said: \"We need to strengthen our business sector in order to be successful in future, for our economy to have a real pillar of support - where companies are really strong and they can front many things.\n\n\"I'm not so ambitious as to expect them to be No 1 players in the world. I just need them to be strong enough locally and regionally. I think that would already help Singapore.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Designers take their sketches, scan them, and trace over them to make digital versions of their drawings, he said.\n\nUsing 3D technology changes the process: The sketches are done in-software, and trying out the design on a model is done virtually, based on the fabric chosen.\n\nBut getting the modelling to work means figuring out the physics and movement of different types of fabrics.\n\nFrench couture designer Julien Fournie, an ambassador for FashionLab who worked on modelling the behaviour of fabrics for Dassault's software, said: \"It's hard to work with a material such as jersey, for example, because it stretches.\"\n\nHe worked with engineers from Dassault, a 32-year-old company listed on the NYSE Euronext, to map out a jersey's properties so it could be added to its palette of fabrics.\n\nFashionLab's efforts are all designed to meet the fashion world's need for speed. \"Fast fashion\" requires designs to get from the catwalk to retail stores quickly, so being able to prototype a design virtually means saving physical material and the time needed to manufacture test versions of each garment before the final design is settled on, he said.\n\nMr Fournie estimates that shaving time off each step of clothes-making - from design to prototyping to eventual manufacture - could mean generating garments between 30 and 50 per cent faster.\n\nFashionLab is also testing out virtual stores and setting up avatars or exact digital representations of shoppers, which can try on new clothing designs.\n\nViola Tan, the co-founder of Singaporean e-retailer Love Bonito, said \"fast fashion\" for her means bringing on up to 15 new designs each week. She is keen on technology such as shopper avatars, which can assure shoppers that both the design and size are a good fit for them. It could raise revenue for the store, she said.\n\nDassault is not the only technology firm to have spotted opportunities for 3D technology in fashion. Even as 3D printing has gained momentum among technology players globally, 3D-printed fashions have hit the catwalk.\n\nDutch designer Iris van Herpen sent her models down the catwalk wearing her line of 3D-printed clothes; earlier this year, burlesque celebrity Dita Von Teese showed off a 3D-printed gown in nylon mesh to a convention in the United States.\n\nSan Francisco-based design lab Continuum is squarely focused on 3D-printed garments, and companies such as 3D-A-Porter focus on 3D body scanning technology, which brings the fashion world a step closer to getting virtual avatars to try on clothes.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The stock had fallen 80 per cent last Monday to 9.2 cents from 47 cents, but found a bounce as the week ended after Singapore Exchange (SGX) said that it had found \"no threat to fair, orderly and transparent trading\" in the stock's sharp fall.\n\n\"You remember night shooting (in the military)?\" the trader said. \"It's at night, all black, can't see a thing, people are waiting for the command, but when the tracer (bullet) comes, bang! Follow the tracer! I don't know if Sky One boosted the whole thing, but it probably did.\"\n\nAsiasons Capital, an investment firm, also rose 15 per cent on Friday for an 18.8-cent close. Blumont Group, a product sterilisation business moving into mining, gained 9 per cent to close at 12.7 cents. Gold miner LionGold Corp entered the weekend at 22.5 cents, up by 12.5 per cent.\n\n\"Some clients, the aggressive ones, some bargain hunters are definitely seizing the moment,\" the trader said.\n\nAll three companies had been suspended by SGX on Oct 4 before being allowed to trade under restrictions, which were lifted on Oct 21. Regulators have said they are reviewing the circumstances surrounding the trading of those three stocks.\n\nBut Friday's rally was hardly a runaway vote of confidence. To begin with, all the stocks were coming off from lower bases, so each tick higher tends to appear more significant on a percentage basis.\n\nIt can also be risky to extrapolate from one-day movements into a trend.\n\n\"Next week will be a good gauge of where we stand,\" the trader said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This was attributed to lower trading property sales (linked to lower sales recognition at The Trizon and The Excellency), and was partially offset by higher income from the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel.\n\nAlso mitigating the impact on net profit were factors such as a lower cost of sales and a higher share of results of joint ventures from the Archipelago development.\n\nSingLand's EPS for the quarterw was 12 cents, down from the 13.8 cents last year.\n\nFor the nine months ended Sept 30, 2013, net profit at both companies were higher than the corresponding period last year.\n\nFor UIC, the year-to-date net profit was 31 per cent higher than a year ago at $218.6 million. SingLand's earnings over that same period was $246.3 million, a 55 per cent surge year-on-year.\n\nThe driver for both companies' gains were fair value gains on investment properties and a higher share of results of associated companies. UIC closed 0.3 per cent down at $3.06 yesterday, while SingLand gained 0.5 per cent at $8.72. The results for the two companies were announced after markets closed.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Details of the Dominican Republic case were first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.\n\nEmbraer is cooperating fully with authorities, the company said in a statement, but it declined to comment on details of allegations due to the confidentiality of the investigation.\n\n\"The company requires that all its employees have a conduct of strict compliance with laws and regulations,\" said a spokesman in a statement on Saturday.\n\nComments were not available from officials in the US, Argentina and the Dominican Republic.\n\nInternational cooperation on the investigation reflects a rare instance of Brazilian authorities probing a local company for its foreign business practices.\n\nBrazil has criminal laws against bribing foreign officials, but no direct equivalent of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which gives US authorities grounds to investigate US-listed companies for bribery overseas. Embraer shares called American Depositary Receipts trade on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn 2008, as Embraer was trying to sell its Super Tucanos to the Dominican Republic, investigators say the company was approached by the director of special projects for the country's armed forces, now-retired Colonel Carlos Piccini. Piccini sought a payment of US$3.4 million to facilitate the sale, which Embraer delivered in 2009 through a shell company in Uruguay, according to investigators. Attempts to reach Piccini through the Dominican armed forces were not successful.\n\nEmbraer delivered the first two of eight Super Tucano aircraft to the Dominican Republic in December 2009 to be used to combat drug trafficking and run border patrol missions.\n\nThe Super Tucano is Embraer's top-selling military plane. A rugged design and low cost make the turboprop popular in counterinsurgency missions from Africa to South-east Asia. In February, the US Air Force ordered 20 Super Tucanos for missions in Afghanistan.\n\nIn documents reviewed by Reuters, officials also cite a corruption investigation raising red flags about dealings between Embraer and an Argentine public official involved in an airline deal.\n\nThe official helped negotiate a contract for 20 commercial jets for Austral Lineas Aereas Cielos del Sur between 2008 and 2009, investigators said, without elaborating in the documents on evidence of wrongdoing. In May 2009, Embraer announced an agreement to supply Austral, a subsidiary of state airline Aerolineas Argentinas, with 20 of its E-190 jets seating 96 passengers. Delivery of the planes started in September 2010.\n\nEmbraer has notified investors of the ongoing legal probe through its quarterly earnings reports. The company has said it voluntarily expanded the scope of its internal investigation following a 2010 subpoena to include sales in other countries, which it has reported to US authorities.\n\nEmbraer could face substantial fines or sanctions due to the investigation, the company said in its recent earnings report, but based on outside legal counsel the planemaker said there is no basis to estimate how much money to set aside. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

With a population of around 1.4 billion, almost a fifth of the world's population, and an emerging middle class that has a seemingly unlimited demand for consumer goods and commodities, the prosperity of the world will increasingly depend on how China's economy develops.

The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is languishing at around 2,100 points, not far away from 2009 lows and a world away from the 6,000 points recorded in 2007. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange Composite Index is not quite in the same situation, but at 1,000 points, it is off the peaks of 1,500 points reached in 2007 and 1,300 points in 2010. Stocks, which reached highs in the final quarter of 2007, had plunged during the global financial crisis, rebounded briefly and have been on a downtrend for the past few years. The slump is partly caused by a slowing economy and a lack of confidence in the country's financial system. Other than concerns over the manipulation of economic data, recent bugbears have included the credit crunch this June, when the Chinese central bank momentarily refused to add money to the banking system, concerns over too much lending especially to local governments, shadow lending by banks outside of their balance sheets to get around regulations, and potential bad debts that would result but cannot be estimated for certain.\n\nThe lack of reliable data caused outsiders to shun the Chinese market altogether. Analysts have argued that the risks taken do not justify the potential gains, and clearer returns could be found elsewhere. In the past year, institutional investors have bet on developed, well-regulated markets such as the US and Japan instead. Chinese capital markets are also not fully open to the outside world, and domestic retail investors make up most of the stockmarket activity at the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges.\n\nThe Third Plenum\n\nThings might change this week.\n\nInvestor attention might return to China as the top leadership of the Communist Party of China holds its third meeting, known officially as the Third Plenum of the 18th Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. The meeting will be held from Nov 9 to Nov 12, China Daily reported last week.\n\nChina President Xi Jinping will approve a document laying out China's priorities going forward. Expectations have been played up by Chinese officials for major reforms to be announced. Historically, the third plenary sessions have been used to draft the outlines of key economic reforms.\n\nMr Xi himself has said that the agenda for the meeting will be \"comprehensive\".\n\nIssues that might feature in the agenda include reforming the banking and financial system, the land-use system, addressing local government debt, the household registration system or hukou, among others. Social equity - a big issue in China because of rampant corruption - is expected to be addressed.\n\nA re-rating of Chinese stocks, currently in the doldrums, is possible if investors like the government's broad policy outlines laid out at this meeting and see them backed by details and concrete actions in coming months.\n\nChinese stock classifications\n\nIn China, companies can issue two types of shares. For the longest time, so-called A-shares were only accessible to domestic investors and are quoted in Chinese yuan. Foreigners could only trade in B-shares, introduced in 1992, which are quoted in US dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong dollars in Shenzhen.\n\nHowever, the B-share market has lost its relevance over time and is now beset by problems of illiquidity. Since 2003, some foreign investors could buy A-shares through a scheme. Moreover, Chinese companies can also list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE), issuing what are known as H-shares denominated in Hong Kong dollars. The number of H-share stocks has steadily increased over the years to 151 on the HKSE's mainboard at end-September, and the market has taken off as there are no restrictions on foreign investors.\n\nA lack of confidence\n\nChinese companies have also chosen to list elsewhere, such as on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and the New York Stock Exchange. However, many of these stocks have been plagued by a lack of investor confidence, making them easy targets for short-sellers.\n\nInvestors in Singapore will remember the case of Fujian-based vegetable producer China Minzhong. In late August, US-based shortseller Glaucus Research Group accused the company of fraud and financial irregularities. Within a couple of hours of the report coming out, China Minzhong shares fell more than 50 per cent, losing some S$300 million of market value in the process.\n\nAmong other things, Glaucus dug up filings of the company's two major customers before it went public in 2010, and alleged that the company faked sales to them.\n\nBut China Minzhong later produced tax filings to defend itself, arguing that the documents that Glaucus produced were meant for business registration and not meant to be as definitive as tax claims.\n\nIn any case, China Minzhong's major shareholder, Indofood Sukses Makmur, rode in with a general offer at the same price at which it previously acquired its stake earlier in the year. Investors were only too happy to sell, the company's share price rebounded, and the Indofood offer succeeded within days.\n\nInvestors in Singapore are justifiably jittery over Chinese counters listed on SGX, otherwise known as S-chips. In recent years, stocks such as Sino Techfibre, China Gaoxian, Hongwei Technologies and China Hongxing have all been hit by accounting irregularities.\n\nCertain unfortunate accidents also seem to befall Chinese counters. Late last year, China Paper Holdings said a fire had destroyed its financial records for all of 2011 and severely damaged records for the last few months of 2012.\n\nIn 2011, Sino Techfibre also said its financial records were destroyed in a fire. In 2009, auditors investigating missing funds at China Sun Bio-chem Technology Group were hit by a mysterious power failure, a missing disk drive, and were told that a truck transporting accounting records was stolen while the driver was having dinner.\n\nThe crux of the issue is that Singapore authorities have no legal jurisdiction over the board and management of Chinese companies, who are often based in China. These companies are also not registered in Singapore, but in places such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands, where regulators find it hard to enforce court rulings.\n\nAfter so many instances of S-chip scares or failures over the past few years, some brokers here appear to have given up covering them altogether. Right after the China Minzhong fallout, a local broking house ceased its coverage on the S-chip sector, with an analyst noting that the time and resources needed to do detailed forensic research on China Minzhong to ascertain the truth behind the Glaucus allegations was beyond his reach.\n\nSumming up investor sentiment, he wrote: \"We believe the lack of accountability by S-chip management makes it a weak investment case for S-chip investors in Singapore, notwithstanding their attractive growth prospects and valuations.\"\n\nBuying China A-shares through an index fund\n\nThe \"attractive growth prospects and valuations\" the analyst cited, nevertheless, might describe the situation for many Chinese stocks. Negative investor sentiment can often be an opportunity. The top 50 stocks on the Shanghai exchange by market cap and liquidity trade at a price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of eight, while the top 300 stocks on the Shenzhen exchange trade at a PE ratio of 11.\n\nJust a few months ago, Chinese banks were trading at around or below their book values, with dividend yields of over 6 per cent and PEs of around five. Some are still trading at these values today.\n\nIn comparison, the Straits Times Index in Singapore comprising the top 30 stocks here is trading at a PE ratio of 13. Other equivalent regional indices in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are trading at around 15 to 16 times PE.\n\nThose who do not want to take the risk of an individual China stock can look at investing in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They invest in a range of stocks and allow an investor to diversify away the risk that an individual company will fail.\n\nOn SGX, these include the United SSE 50 China ETF, quoted in Singapore dollars, which tracks the 50 largest and most liquid A-share stocks on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and the db X-trackers (dbxt) CSI 300, quoted in US dollars, which tracks the 300 largest and most liquid A-share stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\n\nFund sizes and fees vary. The United ETF has a total size of S$51 million at end-September and a management fee of 0.45 per cent per annum, while the dbxt ETF has total fund assets of US$908 million at end-September and an all-in fee of 0.5 per cent per annum.\n\nThese ETFs are classified as specified investment products. This means that they are deemed more complex for the retail investor to understand, hence investors have to be approved by their broker to buy them - after filling in a form about one's financial qualifications or passing a test designed by SGX.\n\nThe largest and most liquid China A-share ETF in the market is the Hong Kong-listed iShares FTSE A50 China Index, with total net assets of HK$53.8 billion (S$8.6 billion) at end-September and a management fee of 0.99 per cent per annum.\n\nOther considerations\n\nIn sourcing for a good China ETF to invest in, investors have to think about what stocks these ETFs are tracking.\n\nETFs tracking the Shanghai index have a higher allocation to financial stocks. If there is a domestic banking crisis, they will be affected.\n\nThe United SSE 50 China ETF, at end-September, has 66.4 per cent of its assets in financials, with the largest holdings in the fund being China Minsheng Banking Corp, China Merchants Bank, Industrial Bank and Ping An Insurance.\n\nThe dbxt CSI 300 ETF, meanwhile, has a slightly more balanced asset weighting, with 39 per cent allocated to financials at end-September, with a similar top five holdings as the United ETF.\n\nOther general issues with buying ETFs that investors have to take into consideration include tracking error, fees, foreign currency risk and their use of derivatives.\n\nH-shares, S-chips and other stocks\n\nThose with a bigger risk appetite can consider investing in individual China stocks listed on the HKSE. These H-shares can be bought through local brokers. The sidebar details some interesting ones. There are also ETFs tracking H-shares.\n\nAnd then there are the local stocks. Singapore has more than 100 S-chips, or Chinese companies listed on SGX.\n\nThere are also Singaporean companies doing a significant part of their business in China, such as property developer CapitaLand.\n\nInvestors can also make a bet on the Chinese yuan itself. We will cover these issues in future articles.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

So aside from office space, foreign interests are also on a hunt for a local partner.\n\nSingapore's GIC, for example, has teamed up with Indonesian investment house Rajawali Group to buy the 47-storey St Regis office tower planned on the city's busy Gatot Subroto Street. The building, one of only three Grade A office projects to be ready by 2015, will house the St Regis Hotel along with the head offices of multi-national corporations, luxury boutiques and high-end restaurants.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/bucking-trend", "site_title": "Bucking the trend", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nBucking the trend\n\nCompetition is stiff and labour is tight, but that hasn't stopped five F&B owners from expanding with new outlets and offshoot brands. Debbie Yong checks in on them\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nThe Provision Shop\n\nBlk 3 Everton Park, #01-79 Tel: 6225 9931\n\nHours: 11am-9pm daily\n\nVINTAGE formica dining tables: check. A pulley-operated Milo tin bucket holding spare change: check. A creaky old toilet door: check.\n\nAt first glance, The Provision Shop (TPS) has got all the trappings of the sundry-peddling \"mamak shops\" you typically find in the void decks of HDB blocks. But look again and you'll quickly discover that it's really a gourmet deli in disguise.\n\nThe 30-seater week-old eatery tucked amid the idyllic Everton Park cluster of HDB blocks is the latest addition to the Unlisted Collection stable of boutique hotels and eateries - and an offshoot of the group's Cocotte restaurant in its Little India hotel, Wanderlust.\n\nExplains Cocotte's head chef, Anthony Yeoh, who spearheaded the $90,000 venture together with the group's general manager of hotels, Charmaine Wee, and operations manager, Florence Guang: \"Our head office is in nearby Chinatown, where we were always pining for a place that would sell gourmet sandwiches and other quick takeaway lunches.\" It was a \"semi-entrepreneurial project\" for the trio, in a way, as Unlisted Collection's head honcho, Loh Lik Peng, merely took a consulting role in the setting-up process.\n\nWhile big sister Cocotte is a classic French bistro, TPS combs together Italian, American and even Polish influences. Menu highlights include a hearty Reuben sandwich ($10/$16) packed with chunks of corned beef and sauerkraut, and a rich, roasty tomato soup ($5).\n\nThere are less commonly found dishes too, such as Belinda's Pierogies ($5), a nod to Mr Yeoh's Sydney-based half-Polish half-sister, Belinda, who helped out with the branding for the store, and the sea-salt lemonade ($6), which has a dash of salt stirred in to temper the drink's acidic edge. Requests for Cocotte's signature roast chicken have been coming fast and furious, so Mr Yeoh may introduce it in the form of a sandwich soon. Sandwiches come in two sizes and all of the cafe's salads, sandwiches and soups can be packed to go.\n\nAt 650 sq ft, TPS is a fraction of the space occupied by 70-seat Cocotte. \"The Provision Shop is just about the size of our kitchen at Cocotte,\" laughs Mr Yeoh. But the space constraints mean the team had to be more creative in their kitchen and menu planning. \"It's tempting to buy everything ready made, as most smaller outfits do, but that's usually where it goes wrong,\" he says. Like at Cocotte, everything is made in-house as far as possible, from the pastas, ice creams and salad dressing to the delicious cherry compote in its brie and ham sandwich ($10/$18).\n\n\"The slight difference is that we try to use more simplified language to describe our food here, so we call things jams instead of compotes or coulis, for example,\" says Mr Yeoh. Not surprising then, that on a quiet weekday afternoon, the estate's aged residents can be be spotted sipping an afternoon coffee next to laptop-wielding creative types in the cafe. \"You can't bulldoze your way through a new neighbourhood without caring for the existing community. We want to service the residents too,\" says Mr Yeoh.\n\nAfter he found out from a friend that a wellness centre in the same block is popular with people seeking treatment for their gluten allergies, for instance, Mr Yeoh came up with a flourless \"blueberry cheesecake\" cake, now sold at the deli.\n\nAnd, as a throwback to another heritage neighbourhood in Singapore, TPS's toilet door was salvaged from heritage Tiong Bahru wonton mee shop, Hua Bee, where the group will be debuting their wonton mee-by-day and yakitori-bar-by-night concept, Bincho, later this month.\n\nThe Beast\n\n17 Jalan Klapa Tel: 6295 0017\n\nHours: 5pm-1am (Mon-Thu), 5pm-2am (Fri-Sat)\n\nIS it us or has Singapore's restaurant scene gotten a little animal-crazy lately? Hot on the heels of nose-to-tail restaurant, Wolf, on Gemmill Lane comes an even more savage peer: The Beast.\n\nBut there are will be no grisly bits of wild animals served here. Instead, The Beast is really an informal southern American kitchen and specialty bourbon whiskey bar - and sister outlet to Chupitos, a Spanish-inspired shots bar in Clarke Quay.\n\nSays the mastermind behind both projects, Jamie Koh, who started Chupitos in 2010 after winning the inaugural Martell VSOP The Ultimate Start-up Space competition: \"I got restless. I wanted to open something else, but I didn't want to do another Chupitos, because there isn't enough of a market in Singapore for another shots bar.\"\n\nChupitos itself took a hiatus last year when Ms Koh took time off to travel around the world as well as open a bar in Ho Chi Minh City. She has since sold her shares in the Vietnam venture and re-opened Chupitos in a different space within Clark Quay in February.\n\n\"I don't believe in simply replicating a brand in shopping malls. I like to create new concepts and I always have a few ideas in my mind inspired by things I've seen on my travels, but it's about finding the right concept for a particular space,\" she adds.\n\nWhen Ms Koh came across the 4,000 sq ft, three-storey shophouse in Kampong Glam in the middle of the year, the first thought that struck her was how much the building - with its high-ceilinged loft level - resembled an animal barn.\n\nThus, The Beast's quirky name and barn-inspired layout. She elaborates: \"The first floor of an animal barn is usually the playground for the animals, where they eat, drink and play.\" Plugged into the first floor, thus, is a casual 30-seater bar with an alfresco corridor for 50, where diners can graze on hearty snacks typical of the American South such as bourbon-glazed ribs and honey bourbon wings.\n\nThe space will also be Singapore's first bourbon bar, as it will carry more than 30 types of bourbon whiskey. Popular labels of American whiskey such as Wild Turkey or Maker's Mark will be tapped from the six large wood barrels that sit behind the bar, while an upper shelf will hold five types of barrel-aged whiskey cocktails such as Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.\n\nThe second floor is typically used for food storage in animal barns, hence it will be the setting for The Beast's 30-seater dining area. On the highest floor - where farm equipment is usually stored - a private event space with a kitchenette on the highest floor will open in a few weeks.\n\nFood-wise, expect Southern comfort fare such as shrimp and grits, chicken waffles and pecan pie, with flourishes such as a home-made bacon bourbon jam. Mains will range between $20 and $30, and cocktails start at $18.\n\nThe food direction arose from Ms Koh's unsatiated cravings ever since the alumna of Emory University moved home from Atlanta, Georgia a few years ago. Recipes for some of the dishes are based on grandmother's recipes contributed by some of her former university mates.\n\nAnd lest you fear it all descends into theme park-esque barnyard tackiness, Ms Koh assures there will be no plastic bulls or cowboy hats around. Instead, deep red cushioned chairs and dark wood panels accented by vintage lamps and rusted oil drums keep things chic, yet comfortable.\n\nMs Koh shares with a grin: \"'Unleash the beast' is the restaurant's informal slogan - we want people to come in, be themselves and have a good time.\"\n\nCafe Ergo Sum\n\n13 Duxton Hill Tel: 6327 9153\n\nHours: 9am-midnight, Mon-Fri\n\nAFTER uprooting from Market Street to Republic Plaza and again to Far East Square earlier this year, three-year-old sandwich bar, Smoke Shack, has finally found a site to launch its flagship outlet.\n\nCafe Ergo Sum takes over the Duxton Hill shophouse unit recently vacated by mod-Sin restaurant, Wok & Barrel, and the new space carries over all of Smoke Shack's popular signature items such as breakfast bagels, English muffins and sandwiches - all filled with meats smoked in-house.\n\nBut the menu will be augmented to also include pastries and Toby's Estate coffee in the mornings and more substantial dinner items such as pastas featuring smoked duck, scallops and prosciutto, alongside chilled soups with smoked toppings. Mains will range from $20 to $30.\n\nTo cater to the Duxton area's after-work drinks crowd, Smoke Shack founder Nick Iman has also roped in an in-house mixologist, Sofian Rahim, who has put in stints as a beverage manager at Bar-Roque Grill and the now-defunct Keystone restaurant to shake up a mix of classic cocktails and signature creations. Bar snacks with Spanish and Asian inflections such as croquettes, chicken wings and bruschettas will be served in the evenings.\n\n\"Unlike in Raffles Place, where it's all about speed, Duxton has a more relaxed vibe - people don't mind lingering over a coffee after lunch or a cocktail after work, so service will be laid-back too,\" says Mr Iman. Likewise, to encourage a convivial atmosphere, the 45-seater comprises two long communal tables that seat up to 20 each, plus 10 outdoor seats.\n\nSetting up a flagship outlet \"has always been an intention\" according to Mr Iman, but he wanted to seek out a suitable location, rather than rush into it. At 1,200 sq ft, the Duxton outlet is more than triple the size of his 400 sq ft sandwich counter in Far East Square, which will continue operating.\n\nWhile staffing is a challenge, Mr Iman gamely concedes that it is one that is \"part of the territory; I knew what I was getting into when I entered the F&B industry\". On a visit during opening week this week, the former private banker can be seen rolling up his sleeves to cook and serve customers personally. Still, he laughingly states: \"Compared to banking, this is less stressful.\"\n\nThe cafe's interiors were a personal labour of love, too. A giant wall mural by the entrance depicting an artwork from Henri Matisse's jazz album was handpainted by Mr Iman himself, while the books, jazz records and a vintage record player that kit out the rest of the space are from his personal collection.\n\nOf the name change, he says: \"People already know Smoke Shack as a sandwich shop, so if I start serving dinner and drinks, it might lead to an identity crisis.\"\n\nErgo Sum, on the other hand, means \"Therefore I am\" in Latin, \"because these are things that I like and which define who I am, and I hope that other people will find interesting too,\" he says.\n\nMarukyu\n\n116 Telok Ayer Street Tel: 6636 5608\n\nHours: 11am-10pm, Mon-Sat\n\nSOME people venture into the F&B business because it's their long-held dream to cook or run a restaurant, others do so when opportunity unexpectedly throws up a plum spot of real estate.\n\nWhen bespoke apparel designer Chong Han San found out that the tenant of the 1,200 sq ft unit below his second-floor studio on Telok Ayer Street was moving out a few months ago, he quickly roped in cousin-turned-business partner, Danny Chong, and moved in on the spot. After all, the CBD shophouse stretch has a ready catchment of daily diners and with Telok Ayer MRT station on the Downtown Line set to open on Dec 22, the area looks set to get even hotter.\n\nIdeas for new businesses such as a nail spa, sleeping pods or a massage parlour were tossed up, \"but we didn't feel passionate about any of them, until the idea of doing a restaurant was brought up\", says Mr Chong.\n\nSo the duo roped in local chef Derrick Lau, a 17-year veteran of the food industry who previously worked at Nadaman in the Shangri-La Hotel and later set up his own Japanese restaurant, Dezato, on Boat Quay, where the cousins were regular diners.\n\nThus, Marukyu was born. Maru means \"circle\" in Japanese, and the kyu suffix was chosen as a homophone for Q Menswear, the name of Han San's bespoke tailoring outfit. He also runs uniform tailoring business, Qu Division.\n\nAt the 48-seater Marukyu (there's also a private room for seven), chef Lau dishes out creations such as milk custard, truffle-inflected scallops, homemade umeshu and a selection of plump sashimi made from seafood that they claim is air-flown from Tokyo and Kyushu daily.\n\nHan San, meanwhile, focuses on the creative aspects of the business such as the restaurant's Zen-minimalist interior design, while Danny, who has a day job in banking, manages the accounts.\n\nLunch sets cost $68 and up and omakase dinners start at $108, and include luxe treats such as A5 Ohmi wagyu beef, a broth of Asari clams and Hokkaido snow crab legs topped with spicy mentaiko.\n\nRather than charging premium prices, Marukyu is targeted at those \"looking to make the jump from your regular mid-tier Japanese restaurant chains to an upscale omakase-only restaurant, but without the steep jump in their bills\", he adds.\n\n\"Bespoke fashion is what I do, and omakase is a culinary extension of that, where you leave it to the chef to design your meal,\" says Han San, who hopes to open more Japanese dining outlets such as a shabu shabu or yakitori joint with chef Lau if all goes well.\n\n\"Whether in fashion or in F&B, our ultimate aim is to make sure the customer leaves satisfied. If there's anything at all they are unhappy with, we will fix it immediately.\"\n\nThe Maison Ikkoku@Gillman Barracks\n\nBlk 39 Malan Road\n\nTel: 6294 0078\n\nHours: 9am-5pm Sat-Sun (cafe), 6pm to late, Fri-Sat (bar). From Nov to Jan 2014\n\nIT'S about time. Kandahar Street cafe-cum-cocktail bar, Maison Ikkoku, has been so busy packing in the hipster crowd for its past two years of operations that we're almost not surprised to hear that they are thinking of expanding.\n\nFrom today onwards, fans of Maison Ikkoku's homemade cakes, speciality coffees or bespoke cocktail concoctions can now get their fix from the outfit's second outlet in Gillman Barracks.\n\nOperated on a pop-up basis for now, the cafe-cum-cocktail bar is part of The U Factory, a three-month pop-up concept that will run from today till January next year.\n\nModelled on Andy Warhol's Factory concept from the 1960s and driven by creative consultancy Hjgher, The U Factory will also incorporate other elements such as a pop-up retail store by global lifestyle magazine, Monocle; a retail gallery by Creative Cultures showing made-in-Singapore designs; and a home bakers' studio by-day and laksa bar-by-night concept by home-grown F&B company, Preparazzi.\n\n\"The area has such fresh green scenery, we felt that it would be perfectly complemented with the smell of freshly brewed coffee in the day, and cocktails made with fresh herbs at night,\" says Maison Ikkoku's business development director and head mixologist, Ethan Leslie Leong. \"The idea is to give people the feeling of being on a short getaway, while still remaining in the centre of Singapore.\"\n\nMaison Ikkoku will launch at its new outlet the Vaara, a cocktail created exclusively in partnership with English perfumery Penhaligon's, and served in a martini glass with a miniature Aladdin's lamp and a scented handkerchief alongside.\n\nThe cafe, meanwhile, will feature a pared down menu comprising its best-sellers such as eggs benedict, and cupcakes and cakes in a jar in flavours such as s'mores, red velvet, nutella and rainbow caramel. A single brew bar will dole out Ethiopian Aramo coffee dripped through a Chemex filter while a rotating selection of single-origin coffees will be featured each week.\n\nThe cocktail bar began operations as a standing-room-only bar from yesterday, while additional seats and cafe operations will only be introduced from The U Factory's official launch next Thursday.\n\nPrices will be slightly cheaper at the new outlet, with cocktails costing between $16 and $25, and food from $8 to $18. The 1,200 sq ft outlet can hold 40 inside and 20 outdoors.\n\n\"We've planned for a second outlet for about a year now, before this space came by. I've started to train my stall for it,\" says Mr Leong.

Now, Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to dominate with over 100 orders.\n\nIt recently previewed what may be the start of a new ad war by showing financiers a slide illustrating three people squashed together at a restaurant, titled \"Would You Accept This?\"\n\n\"Boeing is proposing long-distance flying in seats narrower than regional turbo-props,\" said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.\n\nAs diets change, people get bigger but plane seating has not radically changed.\n\nBetween the early 1970s - when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel - and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American 40- to 49-year-old male increased by 10 per cent, according to US Health Department data.\n\nThe waist of the average 21st century American male is 39.7 inches, according to US health statistics, which equates to a diameter of 12.6 inches. This leaves two inches either side in many plane seats, which are narrower than at an average cinema.\n\nAirbus said that is not enough for long-haul travel and that its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average girth of the newly christened \"jet set\" was narrower.\n\nAirbus said that it has commissioned research suggesting that an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.\n\nBoeing disputed Airbus' figures on seat measurements, and said that it is not up to manufacturers to step into decisions on how airlines balance fares and facilities. It also said that research shows that cabin experience depends on more than the width of a seat.\n\n\"It really comes down to providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do the things that they believe they need to do to be successful,\" said Boeing cabins expert Kent Craver.\n\n\"They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable. They know their business better than anyone else.\"\n\nFor flyers, it is about more elbow room; but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect earnings.\n\nBehind the dispute is a race for plane orders with at least US$700 billion of estimated business at list prices in coming decades, enough to tip the scales of US and European exports.\n\nAs Reuters first reported in July, seat layout is exactly what drives the battle between the latest jets.\n\nBoth Airbus and Boeing claim 20 per cent better efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engined long-haul designs than the market leader in that segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-\n\n300ER.\n\nBoeing's performance claims depend in part on comparing the 10-abreast 777X with an original nine-abreast 777 design. The gain in unit costs is blunted compared with 10-abreast now in use.\n\n\"The reason Boeing is doing this is to cram more seats in to make their plane more competitive with our products,\" said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Europe's Airbus.\n\nOn the other hand, analysts said that full 10-seat-per-row cabins for existing 777s suggest that many passengers are voting for the denser layout, which may go hand in hand with cheaper fares.\n\n\"Eighteen inches in seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from a business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777,\" said cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.\n\nAirbus and Boeing do not supply seats but offer a catalogue of suppliers for airlines to choose from. Globe-trotting jet sellers even carry tape measures to check on competing layouts.\n\nWhile boasting comfort, all builders also offer jets with high-density layouts for low-cost airlines and regional travel. Airbus offers a 10-abreast A350 but said that it has not yet sold it.\n\nUntil recently, Airbus was stressing the need for more cabin customisation by offering wider aisle seats on some of its jets.\n\nWithout the support of the only other maker of large modern jets, experts said that its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to fly, but could distract from a wave of 777X sales. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Return on equity fell to 10.5 per cent from 11.2 per cent a year ago and 10.9 per cent for Q2.\n\nFor the nine months, net profit was up 4 per cent at $2.7 billion. Q3 net interest income or the core lending business rose to a record $1.41 billion, up 6 per cent yoy and 2 per cent qoq as loans grew 19 per cent yoy to $245 billion and 3 per cent qoq.\n\nNon-interest income of $744 million was up 11 per cent yoy but fell 20 per cent qoq due to volatile markets in September.\n\n\"We basically got the call on Fed tapering wrong,\" said DBS chief executive Piyush Gupta on the non-interest income quarterly fall at the bank's Q3 results presentation.\n\nThe market had expected the US Federal Reserve to begin pulling back on its quantitative easing or bond purchases in September and when it didn't happen, bond prices rallied.\n\n\"We pared down some of our Treasury holdings in the long-end and took out hedges for some of our Treasury positions. Clearly when the Fed didn't taper . . . the hedges . . . went out of the money,\" he said. September trading income fell to $32 million, from the monthly average of $95 million for Q2.\n\nThe third quarter's bright spot came from stronger-than-expected loans growth which helped cushion the drop in net interest margins (NIM) to 1.60 from 1.62 for Q2 and 1.67 a year ago. NIM is what the bank makes from lending out its deposits.\n\nDBS had earlier expected loans to grow 2 per cent for Q3 but they came in at a stronger 3 per cent, and which was broad based across trade, Singapore corporates and mortgages, said Mr Gupta. For the nine months since December last year, loans rose 13 per cent and now the bank expects full year 2013 loans growth at 15 per cent, he said.\n\nFor 2014, loans should grow 8-10 per cent, he said.\n\n\"Our business in Singapore, you look at the last couple of years, we've been able to gain market share on both the business side and the consumer side; so it's a very broad based performance.\"\n\nThe bank's market share of business loans in Singapore has gone up by three percentage points over the last three years, he said.\n\nIts share of the home loans market has also risen amid an almost 30 per cent drop in new bookings, he said. Mortgages were up $1 billion on the quarter.\n\nIn particular, DBS has gained from a new HDB home loan programme launched in April this year where the interest charged on the loan is capped below the HDB concessionary rate, he said.\n\n\"Today, almost 40 per cent of our HDB bookings are coming under the new loan programme . . . it has allowed us to actually suffer less losses than the market, it's also a better price programme,\" said Mr Gupta.\n\n\"The HDB consumer gets a much lower rate than they get from the HDB, but we get an improvement in our NIM, relative to the rest of the portfolio.\"\n\nOn next year's outlook, he said that he was surprised by the optimism of the Europeans from a board meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Washington he attended last month. \"I'm struck by the optimism of the Europeans . . . when Europe moves from minus-one to one per cent (growth), that 2 per cent delta is significant to the global economy,\" he said.\n\nThe eurozone is Singapore's single biggest trading partner.\n\nHe said that United States growth could be more challenging next year than what people might expect, while China's growth estimates of 7.5 per cent could be sustained.\n\nTo questions on whether DBS is bidding for the private banking arm of Societe-Generale, he said that it would not be appropriate to talk about Soc-Gen or any other acquisitions.\n\n\"We're open to acquisitions . . . if they're aligned to our stratgy,\" he said. \"Hypothetically, a private bank portfolio which is Asian centric . . . is interesting for us to look at.\"\n\nDBS Group is among banks reported to have advanced in bidding for Soc-Gen's private banking assets in Asia.\n\nIn the stock market yesterday, DBS shares fell six cents to $16.68.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

SIOW LI SEN reports\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nTHE US Federal Reserve is likely to begin tapering only in the second half of 2014 as the US economy remains sluggish, said Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs president and chief operating officer.\n\nLast week, following the release of what some in the market saw as a \"hawkish\" statement from the Fed, they are saying tapering or slowing down monetary stimulus could begin in the first quarter of 2014.\n\nBut Mr Cohn thinks the US economy remains in poor shape and the budget problems in Washington make it worse, so tapering is unlikely until next summer.\n\n\"I think the US is in a tough spot . . . the consumer in the United States is delevered . . . there is capacity in the consumer side,\" said Mr Cohn in a recent interview with The Business Times.\n\n\"You look at corporates in the US, basically corporates in the world are in phenomenally good shape, they've got more cash on their balance sheet than they've had in a long period of time,\" he said.\n\n\"They've been able to borrow more money than they need so corporate balance sheets around the world are flush with cash which is a very good thing for the economy to see economic growth,\" he said.\n\nBut the lack of progress over the budget in Washington is frustrating, he said.\n\nNew York-based Mr Cohn comes to Singapore three to four times a year to meet clients and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and last week's interview was the first time a senior Goldman Sachs executive has met the local media in over a decade.\n\nClients wanted to hear his views on the United States.\n\nFounded in 1869, Goldman Sachs, the fifth-largest US bank by assets, is a giant in the investment bank space. It has no retail business and regularly hogs the No 1 position for mergers and acquisitions (M&As) and equity issues.\n\nIn order to drive the US economy forward, among the things Washington can help business with is work on corporate tax reform, immigration reform and figuring out what to do with offshore money, he said.\n\n\"Unfortunately we're in a bit of a conundrum where the fundamental economy wants to grow, it's in pretty good shape and we need some leadership out of Washington and I'm not optimistic how soon we'll get that leadership, but we're all anxiously waiting for it to happen,\" he said.\n\nIn addition, while the unemployment rate has fallen to 7.2 per cent, the US is not really creating enough jobs, he said. The unemployment rate is down because the participation rate - the amount of people looking for jobs - has declined to a 35-year low, he noted.\n\nThe published data which the Fed uses as a trigger for beginning to taper is messy due to the government shutdown last month and also skewed by the upcoming holiday season.\n\n\"I still believe the Fed is not going to be in a position to taper until sometime next year,\" he said.\n\n\"We have the government shutdown in the third quarter, so third-quarter numbers are going to be skewed, fourth-quarter numbers are always sort of messy for the year end effect - the holiday shopping.\n\n\"You may not even get clean economic numbers in the United States until March, and so I think the Fed's on hold through the first quarter of next year; more realistically it could be summertime before we see them talking of tapering.\"\n\nOn the business in Asia, he said it is very important to the firm though he did not provide a revenue breakdown as the firm does not look at its contributions geographically.\n\nIts business here has expanded rapidly over the last couple of years. Headcount of 800 has tripled in the last three years and the strongest growth was in the private wealth business which was up 40 per cent over the year, he said.\n\nThe firm looks at how it performs vis-a-vis its rivals, hence the importance of league tables.\n\n\"Our business in Asia is very important to the firm,\" he said. \"When at the end of the year I look at the global league tables, I look at the M&A league tables, I look at the equity capital market league tables, I look at the debt capital market league tables, I look on a global basis how are we doing.\"\n\nWhat's important is that Goldman Sach is in the biggest deals, he said.\n\nThe firm classifies business by the way it earns the revenue, he said.\n\n\"For me it's important that we're involved in the most important and the biggest transactions in the world.\n\n\"And I think we're thriving at that and to be out there in the biggest and most important transactions, you have to have a global footprint today,\" he said.\n\nClients are very global today and those in emerging markets move very quickly, he said.\n\n\"They're becoming more and more global, our clients are expanding their footprint in new markets all the time, and we're never quite sure which markets they're looking to expand into.\n\n\"A year or two ago, one of the big flows was China to Brazil, today China to Brazil flows, as far as corporate activity has slowed down dramatically.\n\n\"If you don't have a strategy that allows you to have a global footprint and a presence on the ground in each of these markets, you aren't prepared to deal with the shifts in the market.\"\n\nThe shifts happen relatively quickly in the more volatile emerging and growth markets and one cannot overreact, or end up missing the business, he said.\n\n\"You have to keep your footprint relatively steady . . . you can't be trying to modulate your footprint size based on the market, we have learned that through trial and error,\" he said.\n\nIts Singapore business covers global interest rate products, currencies, commodities trading, advisory businesses, asset management and private wealth.\n\nGoldman does not have a foreign exchange (FX) trading desk in Singapore though it is considering setting up one, he said.\n\nOn this trip, Mr Cohn did talk to the MAS about setting up a FX trading desk here.\n\nSingapore is the world's third-largest FX centre, behind London and New York.\n\nIt used to be fourth, behind Tokyo.\n\n\"We're always trying to figure out how to serve our clients better, we're aware of trends in the market.\n\n\"And if more of the foreign exchange volume has moved to Singapore which the latest data shows, we're not ignoring the data,\" he said.\n\nThe Singapore office is expected to grow 5 per cent and it has stepped up recruitment from the three local universities as Goldman diversifies hiring and not just look at candidates from the US Ivy League schools.\n\nWorldwide, it has about 32,000 people and it hires about 2,300 to 2,400 fresh graduates to its much-envied analyst programme.\n\nThis year, it hired 83 graduates from universities (both undergraduate and graduate programmes) for the Singapore office. Of that, 45 or 54 per cent were graduates from Singapore universities.\n\nlisen@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A remarkable feat on its own, it's even more memorable given that Kerridge has been garnering such acclaim for staying true to his convictions as a chef who believes in serving down-to-earth, unpretentious food in equally modest surroundings.\n\n\"These are all incredible accolades and ones that I am very proud of,\" says the affable British chef who is in town from tonight to give diners a second helping of, as he likes to call it, \"proper pub food\" - which is also the name of his cookbook and TV show.\n\n\"The book and television has gone hand in hand,\" he adds, \"and it's an honour that the BBC have asked me to be involved in this.\" Besides gaining in popularity, the show has also helped him to achieve a wider aim which is \"to showcase British pubs, which is something that is very close to my heart\".\n\nHe says that he was approached to take part in 4XFour by Darren Chen, executive director of Savour Events, which made its debut last year at the F1 Pit Building as a pop-up, upscale gourmet funfair which saw visiting and local chefs serving up their signature dishes fast-food style. This year's 20-day event will take place in a fully fitted out, temporary restaurant built on Bayfront Avenue, next to Marina Bay Sands.\n\n\"Having been to Singapore before, I thought it would be a great opportunity to showcase British food and what we do here at The Hand and Flowers,\" says chef Kerridge. \"And a great chance for a couple of my guys to experience the delights of another part of the world.\"\n\nSince this is his second stint in Singapore, \"we are a little more organised, the menu is structured a little better and the food is simplified\", says the chef. While gutsy, hearty flavours are the cornerstone of pub cooking, there's no fear of being overwhelmed by the food in Singapore's hot climate. \"The recipes are scaled down to still be big, strong and rich, and designed to be over a four- or eight-course meal. You should leave the table feeling that you have eaten something proper. The produce available in Singapore is growing from strength to strength, so I'm confident we'll be able to showcase our two Michelin star standard of food in a not so conventional setting but with a similar experience.\"\n\nGiven that all the dinner seats for chef Kerridge's stint from today till Nov 13 are sold out (with only some lunch seats available on Wednesday and Thursday), anticipation is high, and chef Kerridge is more than up to the task. Fame may be a by-product of his efforts but food is still what drives him.\n\n\"Who knows what the future holds - as long as it's fun and food-related, I'll be a happy guy!\"\n\nTom Kerridge cooks from today until Nov 13.

Cisco has the vision and savvy to help our Academy's young scientists and Nobel Prize winners inspire children throughout the world on an unprecedented scale - through the application of the IoT.\"\n\nThe Global STEM Alliance will allow for the seamless integration of technology and content - effectively linking the New York Academy of Sciences' local programmes to locations around the world through in-person and online platforms.\n\n\"This partnership will enable sharing of knowledge resources to every corner of the world - humanising science, through the use of technology, by connecting science-interested people of all ages across geographic boundaries,\" Mr Elfrink said.\n\nHe added that the Cisco Networking Academy programme will help individuals prepare for globally recognised certifications and entry-level ICT careers in virtually every type of industry.\n\n\"Courses are offered in multiple languages through a blended learning model that combines classroom instruction with online curricula, interactive tools, hands-on activities, and online assessments. The Networking Academy, in collaboration with education institutions, currently reaches over one million students in 165 countries,\" he added.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

This will work to the advantage of tanker operators with ships already on the water.\n\nSome of these are privately owned, such as Fairfield Chemical Carriers Inc, Navig8 Chemicals, Nordic Tankers and Tokio Marine Asia Pte Ltd, an affiliate of insurer Tokio Marine Holdings Inc. Of the publicly traded operators, Odfjell has a fleet of 96 chemical tankers. By 2015, Ardmore plans to have a 20-tanker fleet that will include 18 ships capable of carrying chemicals. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Despite talk of a bubble, investors unwilling to jump onto the buyers' bandwagon can still take bets on property developers themselves.\n\nJubilee Industries Holdings - formerly loss-making plastic injection mould producer JLJ Holdings - appears poised to be the latest intriguing Iskandar play on Singapore Exchange.\n\nA proposed reverse takeover (RTO) announced in mid-October will see Singaporean businessman Dennis Ng inject Tenderside Ventures, a subsidiary of his Malaysian property development company Jewelstone Properties, into Catalyst-quoted Jubilee.\n\nThe deal gives a well-connected and established family a foothold in a listed entity in Singapore.\n\nMr Ng is executive director of United Malayan Land (UMLand), of which his father, Ng Eng Tee, is deputy chairman and also executive director.\n\nUMLand, a Johor-based property developer with decades of track record, was an associate company of property giant CapitaLand and listed on Bursa Malaysia. It was privatised last year by the elder Mr Ng and his business partner, Syed Mokhtar Al-Bukhary, a well-connected bumiputera entrepreneur who is said to have close relationship with the current Malaysian political leadership. UMLand also has an undeveloped land bank of about 810 hectares in Johor, according to media reports.\n\nTenderside will be acquired by Jubilee for RM150 million (S$59 million) through an issue of new Jubilee shares to Jewelstone. The deal, which will boost Jubilee's issued shares to around 508 million, will result in Tenderside gaining a 54 per cent stake in Jubilee.\n\nRising condo prices\n\nAnd here's where it gets interesting.\n\nTenderside owns a 60 per cent stake in Viridea Lakeside Sdn Bhd. Viridea will acquire the Viridea @ Medini Lakeside project in Johor on roughly three hectares of land. For comparison, the Medini area comprises 890 hectares of land. The estimated gross development value of the mostly residential project, or what it can be sold for when completed, is RM800 million. Out of that, a profit before tax of RM300 million is expected to be generated, out of which 60 per cent or RM180 million will be guaranteed to Jubilee.\n\nThis guaranteed profit before tax works out to about 14 cents a share.\n\nInvestors and developers, however, have some concerns about Iskandar plays.\n\nNumerous aggressive launches of high-rise condominiums have pushed prices to Kuala Lumpur property levels.\n\nOn Oct 25, the Malaysian government's budget included measures to cool the property market that is fast rising out of the reach of ordinary Malaysians.\n\nNotably, a 30 per cent real property gains tax will be levied on gains on property disposed within five years. The minimum price for foreigners to buy a Malaysian property will also go up to RM1 million from RM500,000.\n\nDevelopers in Medini, however, have a unique advantage.\n\nThe area is a special zone in Iskandar that is exempt from price caps and bumiputera quotas which can affect developer profits - a deal introduced several years ago to attract foreign investment. Developers there also enjoy various income tax incentives.\n\nMedini is also a short 10-minute drive from the Second Link connecting Johor to Singapore, so investors who prefer to live there have quick and convenient access to the Republic.\n\nIskandar's planners envisage Medini to be a commercial and business district, with malls, offices, high-end homes and a hospital. Theme park Legoland is located just a stone's throw away.\n\nNot surprisingly, properties there have been selling like hot cakes. In June, Afiniti Residences, a 147-unit wellness themed condominium project that is a joint venture between Temasek Holdings and counterpart Khazanah Nasional, was sold out on launch day. Selling prices for the project, located beside Legoland, were RM850 to RM1,000 per square foot.\n\nHow much might Jubilee be worth?\n\nThe company's last reported net asset value by end-June was 19.6 cents, before the completion of a deal that saw former Novena Holdings CEO Toh Soon Huat lead a group of investors to inject $15 million into the company.\n\nRTO process\n\nMr Toh and company bought in at 15.4 cents a share then. On Oct 29, he bought another 750,000 shares at an average price of 17.7 cents.\n\nMeanwhile, the company placed out shares to Jewelstone at 22 cents each.\n\nCurrently, the company is trading at around 17 to 18 cents. Support might be found around the 15 cents level that Mr Toh originally bought in for, giving opportunities to investors if prices fall to or below that.\n\nInvestors, however, have to note that the RTO process usually takes around half a year, and there is never a guarantee that any takeover will go through.\n\nAny investment in Jubilee - or in similar Iskandar developer plays such as Rowsley and Albedo - is also a bet on the long-term economic sustainability and political stability of the Iskandar region. Sentiment in Iskandar property might already be affected after Malaysia's latest budget measures. Also, the next few years could see more supply come up on both sides of the Causeway. Then there is the prospect of a potential tightening of US monetary policy.\n\nThat said, Medini enjoys special exemptions from the Malaysian authorities.\n\nIf and when the RTO goes through, Jubilee will need to build and sell its residential project fast.\n\nAlthough the company could be vulnerable to short-term fluctuations in share prices in the event of a property market downturn, with the UMLand pedigree behind it, Jubilee is a long-term play. This is a company worth watching in the years to come.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

A separate final PMI index published by HSBC and Markit rose to a seven-month high of 50.9.\n\nWhile both surveys breached the 50-mark separating growth from contraction, they gave differing readings on new orders and new export orders - falling in the official PMI and rising in the HSBC/Markit PMI. The official PMI is weighted more towards bigger and state-owned enterprises, while the HSBC/Markit survey focuses more on smaller and private-sector firms.\n\nBoth sets of data point to a stabilisation of the world's second-largest economy.\n\n\"This upbeat headline official PMI supports our view that steady growth can be sustained in the range between 7.5 per cent and 8 per cent. On the ground, we have reported that some new infrastructure projects have started. Housing sector activities are robust,\" said Dong Tao, China economist at Credit Suisse. Agreeing, Hongbin Qu, HSBC's chief economist for China, reckoned that the economy was on track for a gradual recovery.\n\nAnother independent survey published yesterday also showed strong demand in the property sector, with average prices of new homes in 100 major Chinese cities jumping 10.7 per cent year on year.\n\nBut analysts question the strength and sustainability of the recovery, which they contend has been based on an investment and export-dependent growth model. This has fuelled double-digit GDP increases over the past decade but also brought about economic distortions and high levels of debt.\n\nBeijing now wants to encourage domestic consumption, and has made it clear that it will accept lower growth rates as the economy undergoes transformation.\n\n\"The foundation for a recovery is not yet solid,\" said Zhang Liqun, an economist at the Cabinet think tank Development Research Center. Noting that order, inventory and purchasing price sub-indices declined, he said this suggested that \"companies are still rather cautions about the future outlook\".\n\nThe economy grew 7.8 per cent year on year in Q3, and economists expect growth to moderate to 7.5 per cent in last quarter. This would still be enough to reach the government's target of 7.5 per cent for 2013.\n\nAccording to the official PMI, strong output was the main driver, rising to 54.4 from 52.9. This was offset by weakness in new orders and new export orders, which both dipped 0.3 points to 52.5 and 50.4 respectively.\n\nThe survey also showed that smaller firms continued to underperform larger ones, with new orders in large enterprises reaching 53.8, while small businesses suffered a contraction at 48.8.\n\nSaid Credit Suisse's Mr Dong: \"This is consistent with our view that while the economy is stabilising, this is not a very strong rebound. The stabilisation is still largely relying on infrastructure investment and the housing market. The generic investment from the private sector still seems to be missing. Structural reforms are needed to re-engage private investment and to push the economy back on the right track.\"\n\nThe final HSBC/Markit PMI was unchanged from a preliminary flash estimate released last week, and showed a uptick in both new orders and new export orders.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is set to meet next week for its third plenary meeting, where major economic reforms are expected to be unveiled.\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Usually, economists would anticipate the steady growth of 2013 to pick up momentum in the fourth quarter. But hundreds of thousands of temporarily laid-off government workers will hurt October sales data and jobs figures alike.\n\nThe few remaining stores that report monthly sales, including clothier Gap, will likely reveal the damage wrought on their bottom lines from the shutdown in October. The nine retailers tracked by Thomson Reuters are anticipated to show a meagre 0.4 per cent growth in sales from a month earlier - the slimmest margin of growth since the end of the recession.\n\nSimilarly, economists, on average, expect the unemployment rate to have risen to 7.4 per cent in October from 7.2 per cent in September when the Labor Department reports the data on Friday.\n\nWith another shutdown an outside possibility in early 2014, government workers may not be as eager to splurge this year as previously. The questions is: has Congress ruined Christmas?\n\n\"The dust kicked up by the government shutdown is beginning to settle,\" said portfolio strategists at Barclays Wealth & Investment Management, in a note to clients.\n\n\"While those charged with governing our country tend the wounds inflicted by the recent budget/debt ceiling battles, economists and statisticians are making numerous and varied attempts to calculate the impact of this legislative bumbling on US output. A glimpse of the cost will be revealed next year when fourth-quarter GDP is reported.\"\n\nThe third-quarter earnings season has been a tale of haves and have-nots. Industrial and raw materials conglomerates from truck engine maker Cummins to steel maker US Steel reported disappointing results while \"new technology\" companies such as Netflix and Facebook reported growth far in excess of targets.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the 355 Standard & Poor's 500 companies that have reported third-quarter earnings so far have topped the Wall Street target, according to data from Thomson Reuters. In the technology sector, 84 per cent of companies have beaten estimates but that quotient drops to 66 per cent for materials companies.\n\nBut Eric Marshall, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital, says \"cyclical\" companies such as Cummins have reached the trough of the latest cycle from where things can only get better.\n\nAfter years of postponing investment in plants and equipment, companies will soon be forced to repair or replace machinery, Mr Marshall said.\n\n\"There's still a lot of uncertainty (about) capital expenditure, but companies are finally moving forward with spending plans,\" said Mr Marshall.\n\n\"We're seeing it across the board - from companies that make cardboard boxes to trucking companies that haven't replaced tractor trailers (in years) to companies adding new capacity within building materials.\"\n\nEven the airline industry, which has been in retreat since fuel prices spiked nearly 10 years ago, is rebuilding fleets of aircraft with new models from Boeing and others.\n\nMuch of the coming round of corporate investment will be driven by advances in technology, Mr Marshall said. For example, new fuel efficient planes will generate demand even among cash-strapped airlines.\n\nFor manufacturers, the emergence of three-dimensional printers, which instantly reproduce widgets designed on the computer screen, is comparable to the emergence of the Internet, Mr Marshall said.\n\n\"It's an industry that reduces manufacturing costs, it saves time to (get products to) market, reduces research and development spending,\" said Mr Marshall. \"There's a strong business case in a lot of areas for using 3-D printing and 'just-in-time manufacturing'.\"\n\nThis does not mean that companies like 3-D Systems, which make the printers and reported brisk quarterly earnings growth last week, are going to make it big.\n\n\"When (the Internet) was first invented, we knew everybody was eventually going to figure out a way to use Internet in their business but there were only a handful of\" Internet companies that survived, Mr Marshall said.\n\nAnother hot stock that's been humbled recently, electric car maker Tesla Motor, will try to live up to investors' high expectations this week.\n\nThis week could be a throwback to the Internet euphoria of the late 90s as one of the most popular online services plans a public offering. Underwriters have learned their lesson from Facebook's flop at its initial public offering.\n\nTwitter will be offered at US$17 to US$20 a share - a valuation of roughly US$12.8 billion for the whole company. But the banks assisting the micro-blogging service, which uses a bird insignia as its logo, hope shares will take flight from that relatively lowly beginning. Some venture capitalists expect Twitter to double in value almost as soon as it arrives on the stock market.\n\nIf the IPO stirs up enthusiasm, this week's stock market performance could be one worth tweeting about.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Sony also unexpectedly posted a second-quarter loss, missing analyst estimates for a return to profit.\n\nMr Hirai, who took over amid four straight annual losses, cut jobs and emphasised digital imaging, games and mobile devices in an effort to win back sales from Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co. Instead, he lowered annual projections on Thursday for TVs, cameras, personal computers and video recorders as Sony's film unit lost money.\n\n\"It's hard to picture earnings growth at Sony's electronics operation without a sight of conventional hardware businesses bottoming out,\" Takashi Watanabe, a Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc analyst, said in a report yesterday. \"Significant recovery hinges on whether the company can draft a drastic reform plan.\" He cut his share price forecast 5.3 per cent to 1,800 yen.\n\nEven with Japan's weaker yen, five of Sony's nine divisions posted operating losses in the second quarter. The company, which rejected investor Daniel Loeb's push for a partial sale of its entertainment assets, is trying to recover from flops that prompted criticism from the billionaire.\n\nSony fell to 1,668 yen in Tokyo, narrowing this year's gain to 74 per cent, after the stock was cut to hold from buy by Jefferies LLC analyst Atul Goyal. Competitor Panasonic Corp, which doubled its forecast on Thursday after paring phone and TV operations, surged 6.2 per cent.\n\n\"A year ago both of these companies needed radical change,\" said Yuuki Sakurai, chief executive officer of Fukoku Capital Management Inc. \"Sony stuck with TVs and they probably need to get out that business. Panasonic had its back to the wall and they had no choice but to change.\"\n\nSony's film studio stumbled in the summer box-office season that runs from May to early September. Big-budget tentpoles After Earth, with Will Smith, and White House Down, with Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, failed to connect with audiences.\n\nRecent releases Captain Phillips and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 have been well-received by audiences and critics. Last month, subscription streaming service Netflix Inc ordered a 13-episode series from Sony Pictures Television, by the creators of the drama Damages.\n\nSony's net loss totalled 19.3 billion yen in the three months ended Sept 30, compared with the 14.8 billion yen average profit of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe company needs to cut costs and undertake \"more aggressive reform\" of its product portfolio and entertainment business, Fitch Ratings said in a statement yesterday. Sony's BB- credit rating, which is three levels below investment grade, may be downgraded, it said.\n\n\"Management has a planning problem,\" said Junya Ayada, a Tokyo-based analyst at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. \"There is a risk for a TV volume downswing even though the company has already reduced its forecast.\"\n\nSony is betting its Xperia Z1 handset, introduced in September, will propel it to third place in the global smartphone market, leaping from seventh and narrowing the gap with Samsung and Apple. The phone features a 20.7-megapixel camera and showcases Mr Hirai's strategy to boost internal collaboration to make stronger products.\n\nThe company maintained its annual smartphone sales forecast at 42 million while raising its projection for game consoles at it prepares to release the flagship PlayStation 4 this month. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

By Nicholas Yong\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nOUT in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, Asheville is undiscovered country - at least for Singaporeans more enamoured of the big city lights of New York, Boston or Washington.\n\nOne link to the pop culture psyche would be that Asheville was the main shooting location for the hit movie, \"The Hunger Games\" (2012). But Asheville's allure goes beyond the odd Hollywood connection.\n\nNew residents such as chiropractor Marty Hughes, 32, and his naturopathic physician wife Robyn, 33, settled here two years ago, drawn by the outdoor recreational activities such as hiking and cycling, the restaurants, food culture and climate. \"Asheville is one of the few mountain towns in the US that has consistently good weather,\" notes Mr Hughes.\n\nPerhaps the most striking landmark in Asheville is the 3,240-hectare Biltmore Estate, once the largest home in America. Built by the railroad tycoon George W Vanderbilt with the help of architects Richard Morris Hunt and Frederick Law Olmsted, it opened in 1895 as a private getaway for Mr Vanderbilt's family and friends. Today, it still belongs to the Vanderbilt family, and is maintained by some 1,800 employees. About a million people visit every year, and even during the off-peak season, admission is a costly US$49.\n\nReminiscent of the Gardens of Versailles - it was built to resemble a French chateau - Biltmore Estate is best described as a monument to opulence. Biltmore House, the main building on the estate, has 250 rooms. Its banquet hall alone is several stories high and adorned with 16th century Flemish tapestries. Its centrepiece is an oak table big enough for 38 people to have dinner at, replete with fine linens and china, family silver and crystal wine glasses. It feels very much like Downton Abbey, the acclaimed British TV series about an early 20th century aristocratic family.\n\nBiltmore House was one of the first homes in the US to have a private bowling alley - although not the kind you're thinking of. Automatic pinsetters hadn't been invented at the time, so the servants had to manually set up the pins and retrieve the balls.\n\nThe house also had a 265,000 litre indoor swimming pool that's now empty. An interesting anecdote on the audio guide hints at the reason: many years ago, the owners filled up the pool, not knowing that it was leaking. The next morning, the pool was empty, and the basement flooded.\n\nSet aside half a day to traipse through the entire estate, which includes family rooms, guest rooms, servants' quarters, themed gardens, a conservatory, winery and a vineyard - and there is still a lot more to be seen. By the time you leave the estate, the inevitable thought comes to mind: no one needs such a big house, but with that kind of money, wants obviously outweigh everything else.\n\nBeyond the house, though, is what drew Mr Hughes and his wife to Asheville - the natural beauty of the region. There is an abundance of it in DuPont State Recreational Forest, a 40 sq km tract of land that is accessible by car, with friendly terrain that makes trekking for both families and dogs a breeze. A reward awaits you at the end of a four km trek to Triple Falls - the breathtaking sight of a three-tier waterfall that you can jump right into at certain points.\n\nBut Bridal Veil Falls, where the water cascades down a 37-metre-long, 45 degree granite slope, will easily top that experience. Standing at the foot of the falls as the water crashes towards you, you have to suppress the urge to run, as it feels as if it might overwhelm you. But you remain bone dry, and the view is magnificent.\n\nMrs Hughes says: \"The best thing about Asheville is how such a small city of just 80,000 people can offer many of the amenities of a much larger city.\"\n\nThat includes 12 Bones (www.12bones.com), a restaurant famous for its slow-smoked, baby back ribs that counts even US President Barack Obama as a regular patron. In four visits to Asheville, Mr Obama has reportedly eaten at 12 Bones three times.\n\nIn North Carolina, unlike its southern counterpart, the ribs are drier, with vinegar-infused sauces. It's sometimes a subject of fierce debate with their regional neighbours: comedian Stephen Colbert jokingly referred to North Carolina as \"those barbarians to the north\". He added: \"I mean, who makes barbecue sauce with vinegar? That's what you use to clean a toilet.\"\n\nBut 12 Bones proves him wrong. Order a half rack of the brown sugar-rubbed ribs and a quarter chicken (light meat), accompanied by potato salad, corn pudding and cornbread, with a choice of sauces like blueberry chipotle and jalapeno. It's easy to see why Mr Obama keeps going back: the meat is sweet and tender, the atmosphere convivial and the cost extremely affordable at US$23 (S$28.50).\n\nExcellent food can also be found at Nine Mile (http://ninemileasheville.com/), a Caribbean-inspired eatery which does a mean More Fyah (US$10.55) - grilled jerk chicken with fire-roasted tomatoes served over linguine or basmati rice. You can choose your spice level, and portions are generous, accompanied by bread and a salad. The Raggy Road (US$12.55), or grilled cajun tilapia with peppers, squash and zucchini in a white wine, coconut sauce, is another good choice.\n\nAnd of course, the Asheville experience isn't complete without beer. After all, this is the craft beer capital of the US, producing tens of thousands of barrels of beer a year. Over at Wicked Weed (www.wickedweedbrewing.com), prices start from US$9 for four ounces. Interesting flavours include the Coolcumber - made with cucumber, basil and juniper berries - and the Impeached Wheat, a fruit beer made with peaches.\n\nIf you've already done the city route in the US, maybe it's time to get off it. With good food and beer, and the rush of roaring waterfalls in your ears, Asheville will make you glad you did.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Reports by AMIT ROY CHOUDHURY\n\nPublished\n\nSun, Nov 3, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\n[BARCELONA] IT industry leaders gathered at this trendy and high-tech Spanish city last week and pledged to work together to implement standards for what is being described as the next big thing in technology: the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nSpeaking at the inaugural IoT World Forum, Cisco's chairman and CEO, John Chambers, said that by 2020, IoT will result in US$14.4 trillion in profits for companies worldwide. The company believes that this year alone, businesses could generate more than US$613 billion in profits from IoT.\n\nA raft of top technology companies were present at the event, like Oracle, SAP, Qualcomm, Schneider Electric and Zebra Technologies. Apart from these, there were a number of specialist IT firms present at the Barcelona forum.\n\nOne of the challenges the industry faces is to explain what exactly is IoT. A broad industry definition of IoT is a bunch of uniquely identifiable objects and their virtual representation on the Internet through an IP address. Interestingly, the idea of IoT was first proposed way back in 1999. However, it is only now that industry players have started to realise the potential of IoT.\n\nOne of the highlights of the IoT forum has been the setting up of a committee to draw up a set of guidelines, based on open standards, for development of devices and software so that the IoT devices can \"talk to each other\", much like how computers can \"talk to each other\" over the Internet.\n\nSpeaking to BizIT, Mr Chambers notes that the inflexion point in the IoT industry has been reached, with technology and cost making it feasible to embed most devices with a sensor that can connect to other devices through the Internet.\n\nThe numbers are impressive. Talking to BizIT, Vernon Turner, research agency IDC's senior vice-president for research, points out that today, less than one per cent of objects (or things) that could be, are connected to the Internet. IDC projects that by 2020, there will be 212 billion \"things\" in the world and that by 2017, 3.5 billion people will connect to the Internet, 64 per cent of them via mobile devices.\n\n\"People and connected things will generate massive amounts of data, an estimated 40 trillion gigabytes, that will have a significant impact on daily life; it will enable faster response times to medical or public safety emergencies and save lives, it will improve the quality of citizen life by providing direct and personal services from the government, and it will uncover new information about how our cities work, thus enabling city leaders to use resources more efficiently and save money while providing superior services,\" says Mr Turner. This will be a major driver for smart cities.\n\nMr Chambers notes that the five big inventions by humans since the industrial revolution - printing press, electricity, transportation, telephone and connected PCs - have all transitioned to the Internet and this is creating opportunities to push more devices on the Internet with unique IP addresses which would allow them to send and receive information.\n\nInternet of Everything\n\nAccording to a Cisco study, these \"things\" add capabilities like context awareness, increased processing power and energy independence. \"As more people and new types of information are connected, the world is going to enter into the world of Internet of Everything (IoE) - a network of networks where billions or even trillions of connections create unprecedented opportunities as well as new risks,\" notes Mr Chambers.\n\nAt the forum, Cisco announced that it has formed what it calls the IoT Group, which brings together existing internal teams working in adjacent fields and tasked with evolving and developing solutions for customers that provide connectivity for varied and disparate sources of data, machines and people.\n\nThis group will focus on developing vertical business solutions that connect the previously unconnected networked sensors, devices and \"things\" so as to enable IoT to transform business processes into dynamic, intelligent, data-driven and innovative business operations.\n\nMr Chamber notes that his company will have spent US$1 billion on IoT by the end of this year. \"If you look over the next five years we look to spend another billion on it terms of approach; in parallel we are going to spend around US$50 million as venture capital to fund small start-ups which have great ideas in the IoT space.\"\n\nThe Cisco boss adds that the company has, over the past five to seven years, seen this trend coming in areas like smart electricity grids, smart cities, in manufacturing, agriculture and mining, and in a huge variety of industries.\n\n\"We have taken the different groups within Cisco that were set up to do these and joined them to create a single organisation which is a IoT product group. Within this organisation where we are going to spend a bulk of the money.\"\n\nHe adds that the company will focus on three areas. The first is infrastructure which includes products for which Cisco is well known, including switches, routers, wireless and mobility. It will also include security and services - all the infrastructure that was designed for the Internet now gets redesigned for IoT.\n\nThe next area is software. \"We are pulling together our software platforms that allow us to take our infrastructure and expose it to the application development community with programmatic APIs (application programming interface).\"\n\nThe third layer is the development of apps that enable Big Data, analytics and all of the components that are required. \"A number of technology companies come to play here like SAP, Oracle, Intel and Schneider Electric, among others.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIF you see a bespectacled Japanese man dressed in a jacket watching your moves at the Flower Dome at Gardens by the Bay, don't be alarmed.\n\nIt's only landscape artist Kazuyuki Ishihara. He is no stalker, but rather, is observing visitors taking photos of plants so as to improve his landscape displays.\n\n\"No landscape garden is ever 100 per cent perfect,\" he says. \"I view my gardens in a certain way and visitors may see them in another way. So I try to see it from their point of view such as which angle they like, what flowers they like taking pictures of and improve on my landscaping.\"\n\nThe 55-year-old has been participating annually at the Chelsea Flower Show since 2006, and is a five-time Gold Medal winner. He is no stranger to Singapore, having competed at the Singapore Garden Festival (SGF) in 2008 and 2010. His Japanese-themed garden won a Gold and Best of Show winner at the 2008 SGF.\n\nHe is back again, this time to create a floral display at the Flower Dome for Christmas. This is the first time that the Gardens is collaborating with an external designer for its ever-changing floral displays.\n\nCalled Christmas Sugar Mountain, Mr Ishihara's display will have edible produce, such as strawberries, pineapples, pumpkins, watermelons and tomatoes. \"I want to show children what these fruits look like,\" he says.\n\nThe display will be at the Flower Dome from Nov 20 to Jan 5, 2014. Visitors cannot touch or eat the display, but Mr Ishihara promises that \"when children see it . . . they will definitely be wowed\".\n\nWith each garden that he does, his goal is simply to amaze visitors. \"A well-designed garden should not need any explanation. It should just make a person go 'wow',\" he says.\n\nBorn in Nagasaki, Mr Ishihara was a former motorcycle racer before he had to give that up because of poor eyesight. At 22, he started learning ikebana, the art of flower arrangement, which triggered his interest in landscaping. He has no formal training in landscaping but says that \"after designing thousands of gardens, I know what works\". He says it is a high point for him when he sees visitors taking photos of his creations.\n\nHe says there is no need for large amounts of green in a garden, so long as it has a few elements that make an impact. \"A garden like this is also easier to maintain,\" he says. Some of his gardens are lit up by artificial lighting, so they look different in the day and night. And for other gardens, he makes use of \"natural\" lighting by introducing fireflies into them. \"I create an ecosystem in the garden, so that the fireflies can survive,\" he says.\n\nAmong the landscapes he has created are private gardens as well as public ones, such as for Haneda International Airport and The Westin Tokyo.\n\nHis gardens don't just look good, but often serve a purpose, sometimes unconsciously for the user. \"I think about who the garden is for and what its purpose is,\" he says. For example, mall owners want shoppers to stay as long as possible in the mall, so Mr Ishihara uses plants to create an ambience that will make \"shoppers feel safe and welcome, so they will stay longer\".\n\nWhen creating a landscape for an elderly home, he tries to incorporate some farming activity into his gardens, to get the residents involved with their surroundings.\n\nFor Christmas Sugar Mountain, he is using food in his display as he believes in its power to bridge disparities in society.\n\nInspiration for his designs can come from anywhere, he says. \"It can be from movies, anime . . . and sometimes ideas pop into my head when I am having a beer,\" he quips. His choices of plants vary according to the design, but Mr Ishihara prefers using local plants and trees, and the cherry blossom is one of his favourite.\n\nHis home in Tokyo has a small verandah, leaving little room for a garden. But it's a different story in his office. \"My office is like a jungle,\" he says. There is greenery in the office, and he slips in that there is even a monkey and an owl. \"Yes, yes, they are real,\" he deadpans.\n\nMr Ishihara grew up with animals and having done projects for Ueno and Asahiyama Zoos, \"I want to have animals around me.\"\n\nNo wonder his clients often go \"wow\" when they come to his office.\n\nFor the father of three, nothing pleases him more than seeing children enjoy his creations. He even insists that the gardening staff have a \"childlike mind\" when constructing the garden.\n\nMr Ishihara, himself, is pretty much like a child. He wears multi-coloured striped socks, poses with his thumbs up for pictures, and gamely does jump shots. \"You can call me the crazy gardener.\"\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

About 65 million people visited it last year.\n\nHowever, that figure is not enough for mall owner Emaar Properties. Five years after its opening, the mall is currently expanding so that it can welcome over 100 million annual visitors. DP Architects is in charge of the expansion.\n\nThe Dubai Mall will grow by another 1 million sq ft, and the fashion portfolio of the mall will be further strengthened, enhancing the city's high-end retail offerings.\n\nAngelene Chan, DP Architects' deputy CEO says that while the scale of The Dubai Mall has not yet been replicated in Singapore, there were lessons that the firm applied from its many years of retail experience.\n\n\"Ease of circulation is paramount - both for the visitors and, just as importantly, for the service staff and retailers who need to seamlessly operate their businesses. Operational efficiency is the lifeblood of any mall, regardless of the size. Similarly, clear and predictable way-finding ensure that mall guests continue to come back,\" says Ms Chan.\n\nThe Dubai Mall is DP's first project as designer and overall lead consultant. The firm previously did the master planning for the Dubai World Trade Center and the Dubai Internet City.\n\nThe firm's relationship with Emaar Properties began in 1985, when DP built Wisma Atria and the client was represented by Mohamed Alabbar who would later become the Chairman of Emaar Properties. The two firms tried to work together but none of the potential projects materialised until The Dubai Mall.\n\nAs one of the directors involved in the mall's construction, Ms Chan did not have to relocate to Dubai but was frequently flying there. Dubai's climate posed a major challenge for her and the team, \"both in terms of how to design a comfortable environment and the ability to construct under tight schedules\".\n\nFor example, the heat, which can reach 50 deg C in summer limits the hours that workers can safely be outdoors and, coupled with frequent sandstorms, the environment can be hostile to both man and building.\n\nThe Dubai Mall also lies within relative proximity to areas of seismic activity so the building had to be designed to factor in movement. \"Humidity can also be surprisingly high, which can affect architectural finishes, so we had to be extremely careful in our procedures to ensure that we were operating a safe and efficient project,\" says Ms Chan.\n\nIn terms of building codes and compliances, many of the existing codes in Dubai were not sufficient to cover all of the aspects of the building. When there was insufficient regulation, the team adopted Singapore standards and these were subsequently added to the local guidelines.\n\nThe other differences are more cultural, says Ms Chan. While the working language was in English, the project was truly international.\n\nShe adds that, \"working on a project of this scale brings together a talented group from all over the world, and it was important that all of us were respectful of the many cultures and differences that we all brought to the table.\"\n\nAlthough the expansion is headed by another director, Ms Chan is unfazed by the mammoth task of adding another 1 million sq ft of retail space. \"The planned expansion of The Dubai Mall is a testament to its success as a retail and lifestyle destination.\"\n\nFor her, it is also a clear indication that retailers always need to be forward thinking as the \"refresh rate\" of shopping malls has been increasing in order to stay competitive.\n\n\"The Dubai Mall has exceeded its projected visitor numbers every year since its opening - the expansion is a move to ensure that the mall continues to be a world-class shopping experience,\" says Ms Chan.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Yet, strong and specific policy support for a better business environment for social enterprises (SEs) has been slow in taking shape, although attempts have been made with varying degrees of success in Europe and Asia.\n\nHistorically, Europe and in particular the United Kingdom have been at the forefront of the social enterprise movement. But policy influencers and social entrepreneurs point out that Asian states could do better with stronger policy support.\n\nA recent dialogue held in Berlin among European and Asian policy influencers and social entrepreneurs found that there was still scope for greater collaboration between Asia and Europe to better communicate and reinforce the impact of social enterprises. And, such dialogues can give Asian policymakers more support to widen the scope and reach of the SE sector in the economy.\n\n\"In Asia, countries such as Thailand and South Korea have progressive policy support for their social enterprises. However, in a large part of the region, there is still a lack of capacity and funds to assist SEs to be fully financially sustainable. There is still a significant gap in policy support that can help these SEs scale up,\" said Karsten Warnecke, the Singapore-based deputy executive director of the Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF). \"I believe these are areas where both regional and inter-regional bodies, such as ASEF, can play a role in increasing awareness and in facilitating networking and cooperation,\" he told BT. \"We have started addressing these by creating platforms to share expertise and experiences within and across both regions. Such exchange of ideas and best-practices can help practitioners and policymakers create environments conducive for social businesses.\"\n\nASEF and the British Council are two organisations working towards strengthening policy support for social enterprises and promoting the implementation of such support in countries with no existing policy frameworks. They feel the time is ripe for consolidating existing policies and analysing their outcomes, to strengthen support for social enterprises, especially from governments.\n\nIt is with this backdrop that ASEF and the British Council assembled senior policy influencers from 24 countries in Berlin for a policy dialogue and exchange of experiences. They were responding to a need for increased opportunities for sharing experiences between Asian and European social entrepreneurs and to develop the support structures.\n\nThe notion of social enterprise achieving maximum social good and not maximisation of shareholder profit, while remaining a sustainable venture is gaining more acceptability at a time when the rough edges of extreme capitalism are beginning to grind on the social conscience. A renewed attention on social enterprise is now being followed up with more specific policy support to existing government initiatives in areas of taxation, public procurement, financial market rules and regulations and other entrepreneurship supporting schemes.\n\n\"There's a growing interest in social enterprise - it's the sector where entrepreneurs are choosing to set up businesses. This fact speaks volumes about people's motivations and a desire for change in the way that businesses behave and their contribution to society,\" says Peter Holbrook, chief executive of Social Enterprise UK (SEUK), the national body championing social enterprise in the United Kingdom. The social enterprise approach is increasingly seen as a way in which innovative solutions can be found for unmet needs, and a market is \"created\" or \"stimulated\" to address these.\n\nBut the lack of specific structures was a recurring theme in the Berlin discussions. Muhammad Rumee Ali, the head of Bangladesh's biggest and most successful social enterprise, BRAC, feels that at the policymaker level, there has to be a clear and a 'shared' understanding of the definition of a social enterprise, if an effective policy response is to be formulated. Equally important is the need to define the basic architecture of an SE, he told BT following the Berlin meeting.\n\nBritish entrepreneurial leader in social enterprise Penny Newman does not see social enterprise just as business with a conscience. \"It is about actively delivering change, often tackling entrenched social and environmental challenges, where others, be it government or businesses, have either feared to tread or have failed.\" Ms Newman has worked for the past 20 years in organisations that help relieve social injustice in a way that builds an organisation sustainably, including a stint as CEO at Jamie Oliver's Fifteen, the celebrity chef's chain of restaurants where disengaged young people are trained for long-term careers in the restaurant industry.\n\nBut whatever the definition or structure, all agree that policy or governmental support is crucial. SEUK's Mr Holbrook contends that social enterprise movements need to influence governments and policymakers at the highest level, \"to make sure social enterprise is at the top of the business and political agendas\". Mr Holbrook, who led the main dialogue session in Berlin, also noted that SEs needed to work with government partners and mainstream businesses to strengthen their work.\n\nA UK survey on the state of social enterprise found that the sector is thriving and attracting a wave of entrepreneurs and outperforming mainstream bodies. The poll also revealed that SEs scored in its innovativeness - 56 per cent of social enterprises (in UK) developed a new product or service in the last 12 months compared to 43 per cent of SMEs. New product or service development is often used as a proxy-indicator of business innovation.\n\nWhile there is acceptance that evidenced social impact will be a primary criterion for funding and governmental support, rather than explicitly favouring SEs, there need be a more balanced approach. Policies could be framed to give some consideration to the social and environmental value of SEs. For instance, UK has a Social Value Act that benefits SEs.\n\nThe Berlin Dialogue produced some pointers for a better policy context for SEs in Asia and Europe to develop further. There was also a call for a legal form of the social enterprise eco-system and for more regulatory and tax breaks. There is a need for SEs to be more transparent if governments are to play a bigger role in providing a supportive framework for them, such as providing tax relief and start-up capital, the dialogue participants noted.\n\nMr Warnecke said that the Berlin Dialogue produced worthwhile findings for developing a better policy context for SEs in Asia and Europe. \"It was an opportunity to understand the concept as well as role of social enterprises from both Asian and European perspectives,\" he said, adding that the sector can do exceptionally well in Asia, as policymakers look seriously into developing it into an essential part of the economy.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Then it is another six hours by car or a two-hour helicopter flight, before Mr Prihanto reaches his destination - Oyo-Ollombo.\n\nFor the geographically challenged, Oyo-Ollombo is 400km north of Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of Congo.\n\nJust what is Mr Prihanto doing in Africa? The deputy managing director for urban planning at Surbana is heading an 18-person team, who are undertaking a master plan and feasibility study for Oyo-Ollombo Special Economic Zone (SEZ).\n\nThe country is planning to develop four SEZ - in Pointe Noire, Brazzaville, Oyo-Ollombo and Quesso.\n\nSurbana was introduced to the project by Singapore Cooperation Enterprise. Mr Prihanto and his team started on the project in February last year and the master plan was submitted in June this year. Pending the approval of the SEZ policies, the Oyo-Ollombo SEZ is expected to launch early next year.\n\n\"We plan how the city will grow and function as an SEZ in the future, including allocating sites for processing facilities and logistics; ensuring good connectivity between the airport, the river port and the neighbouring towns; preparing the expansion of the city to accommodate future population and providing the whole range of commercial, education, health and recreational facilities,\" says Mr Prihanto. \"Finally we envisioned Oyo-Ollombo to be the green capital of Congo as the centre of the agro-business, the model for sustainable development and the model of integration between urban development and nature.\"\n\nThis is Surbana's first project in Congo, which has a population of about 4 million. \"The government is inviting foreign contributors to develop the country,\" says Mr Prihanto.\n\nMost meetings with the clients, the Ministry of Grand Travauz and Ministry of SEZ, take place in Brazzaville, although sometimes site visits have to be made.\n\nFor each visit, the team stays about a week to 10 days. Mr Prihanto says \"Congo is generally a peaceful country, blessed with abundant land, water and mineral resources.\"\n\nApart from work, there is little else for the team to do in Brazzaville. \"There is not much entertainment, no shopping area nor good public places to visit. But there are some good restaurants with great views along the Congo River,\" says Mr Prihanto.\n\nFood is not an issue for the team. \"It is mostly French food, so that is not a problem. The local food is interesting, the people eat lots of bananas and cassava. There are three Chinese restaurants here as well.\" says Mr Prihanto.\n\nHe cites language as a challenge working in Congo. \"It is a French-speaking country. All the reports, documents received, presentation materials, database coding and communications have to be done in French,\" he explains. \"We have a French-speaking staff and we had to engage native speakers to get good standard translation as Congolese consider themselves the best French-speaking people in Africa.\"\n\nDespite Congo's distance and its lack of direct accessibility from Singapore, Mr Prihanto speaks fondly of it. \"You get to appreciate the greenery, dense forest everywhere, rivers and the biodiversity. In the course of the project, I am also enraptured by the spontaneousness of the local people, who will dance to celebrate and welcome visitors.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be available from next Friday.\n\nAn earlier incarnation of this service was launched on M1's fledgling Internet TV service, MiBox, in July.\n\nThe extension of All You Can App to M1's mobile customers, however, will make the app downloads available on up to three Android devices per subscription. As part of a launch promotion, M1 will give its customers a seven-day free trial of the service and a free download of an Electronic Arts app, such as Plants vs. Zombies or Bejeweled 2.\n\nM1 customers who subscribe to the service will be able to pay the monthly fee through their mobile-phone bill.\n\nBT understands that this service will not be available on the iOS platform, given Apple's closed architecture. Even so, Mobiroo, which launched this service in March, is intent on geographical expansion.\n\nDubbed the \"Spotify of apps\", All You Can App already has a similar tie-up with Malaysia's Celcom and has partnerships in the pipeline for North America and Latin America, according to Alan Wong, Mobiroo's president for the Asia-Pacific region.\n\n\"Content subscription services have been growing in popularity, with consumers looking for services that give them unlimited access to content,\" Mr Wong said. \"Our partnership with M1 brings this experience to the apps landscape, and we are very excited to provide M1 customers with this amazing value for an ultimate app experience.\"\n\nMobiroo, which has its global headquarters in Toronto, has another office in Miami and its Asia-Pacific headquarters in Singapore, which is staffed by three people.\n\nIndustry watchers have tapped buffet-style services such as All You Can App as a means of paving the way for greater data usage by consumers who are just making the transition to the smartphone.\n\nIn Germany, Deutsche Telekom has teamed up with music buffet app Spotify to offer a service that bundles unlimited access to music for flat monthly fee. In Singapore, M1's larger peers - SingTel and StarHub - have started exploring partnerships with app services in one form or another, in a bid to tie subscribers to telco-specific services.\n\nIn August, SingTel launched WhatsApp plans for its prepaid customers, ranging from 50 cents for a day to $6 for 30 days.\n\nTwo weeks after that, StarHub launched a free one-year premium subscription to note-taking app Evernote for its existing and new postpaid customers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Revenue declined to US$7.9 million from US$13.2 million due to lower utilisation and lower charter rates for two vessels.\n\nEarnings per share was 1.05 US cents for the quarter compared to 1.30 US cents last year.\n\nThe fall in earnings would have been steeper if not for a reversal of a provision and lower operating costs for other vessels.\n\nCost of sales swung from US$3.04 million a year ago to a credit of US$221,000. During the previous financial year, CH had made a US$2.68 million provision for the demobilisation of two of its vessels, after they had completed their contracts in the Americas. However, both vessels secured charters in the same region, which commenced in September this year. As a result, the provision for demobilisation was reversed. This, coupled with generally lower operating costs of the other vessels, meant that CH had a credit balance in its cost of sales for the first quarter.\n\nCash generated from operations was US$5.92 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased 7.8 per cent to US$70.8 million from end-June.

It also beat the $658 million average of eight estimates in a Bloomberg survey.\n\nThe rise in core net profit was helped by higher fee income and insurance profitability.\n\n\"Loan growth came in better-than-expected based on the management's previous guidance, which was more conservative,\" Ken Ang, an analyst at Phillip Securities, said. \"We're likely to see strong loan growth year-on-year for FY2013. We'll also see a strong showing in terms of contributions from Great Eastern Holdings.\"\n\nCustomer loans rose 16 per cent to $162 billion from the year-ago quarter, lifting net interest income 4 per cent to a quarterly high of $978 million.\n\nNet interest margin - a measure of profitability - declined to 1.63 per cent from 1.75 year-on-year, given the low interest rate environment and the re-pricing of existing Singapore housing loans, OCBC said. The non-performing loan ratio stayed unchanged at 0.8 per cent.\n\nNon-interest income, excluding divestment gains, rose 3 per cent year-on-year to $779 million. The boost came from record-high fees and commissions, as well as contributions from its insurance unit Great Eastern Holdings. Net trading income, however, fell 68 per cent to $47 million.\n\n\"The challenging market conditions associated with the uncertainty over the timing of the US Federal Reserve's tapering of bond purchases have reduced our income contribution from trading and market-related activities,\" CEO Samuel Tsien said.\n\nAnnualised earnings per share for the three months ended September was 85.2 cents compared with 80.7 cents a year ago.\n\nFor the nine-month period, OCBC's net profit was $2.1 billion, down 38 per cent from $3.3 billion a year ago, which included divestment gains. Excluding such gains, net profit fell 5 per cent.\n\nOCBC will seek growth opportunities mainly in its key overseas markets of Malaysia, Indonesia and Greater China as the higher margins elsewhere make up for the slim ones at home. Hence, Singapore's contribution to group revenue, which currently stands at about 60 per cent, may dip below that level, Mr Tsien said.\n\nHe added that the bank will deepen its commercial, wealth management and insurance presence in these countries. \"With respect to expansion versus acquisitions, we'd like to expand based on our current infrastructure. Should market opportunities present themselves, we'd then look at those.\"\n\nWhile Mr Tsien declined to address rumours that OCBC is considering a bid for Wing Hang Bank, he said Hong Kong is \"a market that people will pay attention to\" as it offers greater access to mainland China. The bank currently has only one branch in Hong Kong, specialising in wholesale banking.\n\nOCBC closed four cents lower yesterday at $10.36 a share.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It is centred around a large landscaped courtyard garden area with extensive facilities, including a swimming pool, cafe, study centre and gymnasium.\n\nCenturion said the existing student accommodation presents asset enhancement opportunities to increase its bed capacity in the future.\n\nIn addition, the car-park building may be redeveloped into new apartment buildings for university students and/or staff working in the healthcare industry in the vicinity.\n\nGiven that it is an operational asset, the proposed acquisition of RMIT Village will be earnings-accretive, and is expected to contribute to Centurion's bottom line when the acquisition is completed, which is expected early next year.\n\nRMIT Village is managed by Campus Living Village, one of the largest student accommodation operators in the world, which owns, manages and is developing more than 35,000 beds for around 50 educational institutions in Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the United States. This arrangement will continue after the acquisition by Centurion.\n\nAffiliated to RMIT University as its student accommodation facility, the property benefits from an arrangement whereby the university may reserve beds for its students before the start of each academic year.\n\nTypically, RMIT University reservations account for 70 per cent of the total occupied beds annually. Occupancy at RMIT Village has been close to 100 per cent in the past three years.\n\nRMIT Village is located on the northern edge of Melbourne's central business district in a well-established education precinct on Flemington Road, in close vicinity to RMIT University and the University of Melbourne.\n\nCenturion's counter ended 1.5 cents higher at 55 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The technology involves drilling a steel-encased hole into the coal seam and with the pressure from the seams extracting water and gas to the surface.\n\nOf these two, Mr Bond said: \"There's not gas in every bit of shale or coal that you drill into.\"\n\nThe energy advantage in the US has created an \"absolute energy gap that is driving America forward\", he said. While some of these is expected to be exported in the form of liquefied natural gas to Asia in the near future, \"by the time you put it on the ship and send it to Asia, it's just as expensive as Australia's (gas)\".\n\n\"No matter how you play the game, there's going to be a gap. They need UCG,\" said Mr Bond. \"You want to keep importing gas? Energy independence is a major issue for every country in the world.\"\n\nCompared to shale gas or coalbed methane, coal is plentiful.\n\n\"(But) you can only do one thing with coal - you can burn it, make steam, and turn a turbine. That's it. It was invented at the turn of the last century for the industrial revolution. The way forward is clean gas,\" said Mr Bond. \"As long as you've got coal, I can turn it into gas.\"\n\nUCG was first used by the Soviet Union during the 1930s, but failed to progress beyond the experimental stage after the discovery of extensive natural gas reserves. High energy prices in recent years have rekindled worldwide interest in it.\n\nThere is currently only one commercial UCG operation in the world in Uzbekistan, run by a subsidiary of Linc Energy.\n\nLike fracking, however, UCG is not without its detractors.\n\nSome say that it remains an unproven technology, and can cause serious groundwater contamination.\n\nThese concerns have caused the Queensland government in Australia to put on hold commercialisation of UCG.\n\nUCG's reputation in Queensland had been tarnished after a test plant by another firm, Cougar Energy, was shut down in 2010, because it allowed cancer-causing chemicals to leach into groundwater supplies.\n\nThe lack of support from the government led Linc Energy to close down its underground coal gasification pilot plant in Queensland earlier this month. The plant has been used for operational trials and research for almost 14 years.\n\nDespite these setbacks, however, the firm is actively developing plans for new plants in South Africa, Russia, and drilling in Alaska and Poland.\n\n\"UCG is on the cusp of being an energy platform that is going to fill the gap for Asia, Europe, Africa.

The modest family drama was a dark horse in the race and the first-time director faced stiff competition from the other heavyweight veteran nominees in the category.\n\nIn the end, the victory might have been a narrow one but is significant all the same. Singapore Film Society's programming manager David Lee, who attended the ceremony and followed Taiwanese press reports, says the media there revealed Mr Chen won by just one vote after four rounds of voting by the jury which was led by Lee Ang.\n\nJohnnie To's Drug War was eliminated first, followed by Wong Kar Wai's The Grandmaster and Jia Zhangke's A Touch of Sin. In the end, Mr Chen's Ilo Ilo beat Best Director winner Tsai Ming Liang's Stray Dogs by just one vote to clinch the honour, which is considered the most prestigious prize in Chinese cinema. In addition, the film also bagged Best New Director and Best Original Screenplay for Mr Chen, as well as Best Supporting Actress for Yeo Yann Yann; making it four wins out of its six nominations.\n\nMr Lee recalls being congratulated by various guests and filmmakers at the ceremony even though he was not involved in the making of Ilo Ilo. \"It's good brand-building for Singapore and shows the Golden Horse recognition of Chinese cinema being more than just movies from Taiwan, Hong Kong or China,\" he says.\n\nStanding ovation\n\nThe victory capped an eventful six months for the 29-year-old filmmaker after he first premiered Ilo Ilo at Cannes in May to a 15-minute standing ovation and then made international headlines for winning the Camera d'Or award. The film, which cost $500,000 to make, had a modest run at the local box office, raking in about $800,000 during its initial run. (Surprisingly, it grossed about as much in France, where it even cracked the Top Five charts.)\n\nIndustry players here agree Ilo Ilo's Cannes and Golden Horse honours is a coup for local cinema and bodes well for those in the industry.\n\nBut it's also not the first local film to receive recognition on the world stage; about two decades back, Eric Khoo's 12 Storeys was the first Singapore film to be invited to take part in the 1997 Cannes Film Festival. Following that, his 2005 drama Be With Me opened the Director's Fortnight at Cannes and three years later, his next film My Magic was nominated for the Palme d'Or award.\n\nThe veteran filmmaker, who's now a European festival regular and whose works arguably attract more attention overseas than here in Singapore, remarks that Mr Chen's win at Cannes was a \"milestone\" but the Golden Horse ones were even more \"incredible\".\n\n\"People are going to watch out for Singapore films now,\" he says. Hence, it's crucial to strike while the iron is hot. \"We have to move fast - the next two years are going to be crucial - in fact, I'm already thinking of making my next film,\" he half-jokes.\n\nIndependent producer, Juan Foo, adds that now that Singapore is in the public eye, it's time to decide on a cinematic identity - \"Should we be known for (Jack Neo's smash hit army comedy) Ah Boys To Men, which is actually not bad because it has box-office mettle or Ilo Ilo?\" Personally, he feels there should be a 50-50 balance where Ah Boys' dollars and cents potential can meet Ilo Ilo's cinematic soul.\n\nHe also points out that Mr Chen's Cannes and Golden Horse awards were no flukes and boils down to the latter understanding how the industry operates besides just being artistically good at his craft. \"Those who know Anthony and his background will tell you he's one of our best filmmakers because it's rare that one understands and takes the effort to learn the business of filmmaking on top of just being artistic and creative,\" he says of Mr Chen's efforts in finding the right partners and developing Ilo Ilo right from the start.\n\n\"It's not just about making a good film - you have to actively engage the industry and go to various markets - sitting in Singapore, banging tables and asking why won't anybody fund your film won't work.\"\n\nAs a result of Mr Chen's intensive networking and business savvy, Ilo Ilo won the Best Project Award at Tokyo's International Film Festival, FILMeX as far back as three years ago and caught the attention of influential French arthouse sales agent, Memento Films, which was also behind the Iranian film, A Separation. The drama won the Best Foreign Film Oscar last year and with Ilo Ilo now set to be Singapore's entry for the same award at next year's Academy Awards, history could well repeat itself.\n\nMr Foo adds that Mr Chen had control over the film as he was also one of the producers and the dual roles he played is an important one because Mr Foo notes there are not enough producers in Singapore. \"It's the symptom of a young industry because everybody just wants to be a director,\" he says.\n\nSingapore Film Society's Mr Lee says Mr Chen, being the \"man of the moment\" and \"poster boy for Singapore cinema\", will hopefully lead to more young people getting involved in every aspect of the local film industry. \"As a young man, he will be an inspiration for others to not only be directors themselves but also distributors or even just the audience - it takes everyone to make up the industry, not just filmmakers themselves,\" he notes.\n\nHuge push\n\nBut Mr Lee warns that with Mr Chen's accolades and the spotlight now being focused sharply on Singapore, for better or worse, everybody will be forced to work harder. The Golden Horse victory has already attracted some backlash online from naysayers who pooh-poohed Ilo Ilo's win and Singapore being a backwater for Chinese cinema since it's the first time any local film has had the honour of winning Best Picture.\n\n\"I've always felt that as an art form, film is easily accessible but it's also a business,\" Mr Lee adds. \"Anthony has opened the doors so this is a huge push for us... hopefully it will lead to more things like more corporate support and sponsorships, which other art forms like theatre already have a head-start in.\"\n\nMr Chen's win could also mark a significant turning point in Singapore films as the world begins to pay attention to it. After all, it was probably how the Taiwanese film industry experienced a resurgence after over a decade of slump when the likes of Tsai Ming Liang, Edward Yang and Hou Hsiao Hsien were criminally ignored by domestic audiences during the 1990s. But as Mr Khoo notes, the critical acclaim they received from overseas critics and moviegoers kept people interested in Taiwanese cinema and it has revived itself in the new millennium with films such as Cape No 7, Monga and You Are The Apple of My Eye which have all become box-office smashes both at home and abroad.\n\nMr Foo attributes part of that to the ebb and flow nature of cinema - \"It's a natural evolution; you can't hit the mark all the time but you need to keep at it; the next wave could come five years down the road but, at least, with each wave, we get to understand what the market is all about.\"\n\nBut like Mr Khoo, he hopes Mr Chen's win doesn't lead to a rush of directors jumping on the bandwagon and trying to copy Ilo Ilo.\n\n\"Instead of making another similar film in the hope that it would win hearts, minds and money; do perhaps think about how your own film is able to stand out,\" advises Mr Foo. \"If you are pressured and feel you will not be able to top this milestone, then don't even attempt to make anything yet. Go back to film school, the drawing board, the story.\"\n\nThe importance of a strong plot is a sentiment shared by Malaysian-born, Singapore-based writer-director Lee Thean Jeen, who has worked extensively on both the big and small screens. \"The hook is the story,\" he says. \"In my opinion, it's important not to think whether you want to make a commercial or festival film because both have their own audiences.\"\n\nIlo Ilo finds its sweet spot by aiming for the middle so despite its slow pacing, the movie struck a chord with local cinemagoers because the 1997 Asian financial crisis and plight of foreign domestic helpers hit home. As Khoo, whose company Zhao Wei Films also represents Mr Chen for commercial works, puts it, \"For many Singaporeans, this isn't an arthouse film; it's a good drama!\"\n\nMr Foo is also more than happy a film that is slightly culture-specific has managed to win over an international audience. \"Singapore is a complex place with so many voices; (I'm) glad that this one is (being) heard,\" he says. \"Too many people want to be filmmakers for the wrong reasons; too few remain for the right.\"\n\nIlo Ilo has been re-released for a limited run from now till Dec 4 at selected Golden Village cinemas\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The Straits Times Index could trade in the red and sentiment could be weak because of overseas worries but low-priced stocks could easily double, treble and in some cases, rise more than 10 times in a relatively short space of time, in some cases accompanied by eye-catching corporate announcements but in many others with no fundamental backing.\n\nAll of this has now come to a screeching halt following action by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and broking houses, the former when it slapped designations on three speculatives and suspended trading for two weeks, the latter because of trading curbs on not just the same three but also dozens of others.\n\nThis week was probably the most painful for those caught in the pennies, a situation made worse by the sudden crashes in SkyOne and Tritech Group on Monday which brought on worries that SGX would intervene.\n\nIn response to the subsequent public clamour, the exchange said it did not see the need to act in SkyOne's case but did so in the case of the three original speculatives Asiasons, Blumont and Liongold because of a threat of disorderly trading.\n\nDespite this clarification, brokers said the damage was already done - daily volume, which used to regularly cross 3 billion units (albeit with an average unit value of 20-40 cents), this week hovered around the 1 to 1.3 billion unit mark. In yesterday's session, when the STI fell 9.47 points to 3,201.2, turnover was a very weak 2.2 billion units worth $871 million for an average of 40 cents per unit.\n\nNot surprisingly, this has made for a grim and depressed mood in most trading rooms, with retail brokers reporting virtually no interest from clients. \"Everyone is scared of which might be the next stock(s) to be designated by SGX,\" said a dealer. \"This is paralysing the market.\"\n\nIf penny stocks were largely down for the week, so were blue chips. The drop in the STI yesterday brought its five-day loss to four points.\n\nThis was despite two blue-chip stalwarts DBS and OCBC reporting better-than-expected Q3 figures - DBS's profit was $862 million and OCBC's was $826 million.\n\nIn its look yesterday at the banks, OSK DMG analysed loans growth and said that despite a pick-up in September's loans growth, it did not foresee growth momentum to continue into Q4 2013. \"This will partly be due to seasonality and the property market cooling measures taking effect,\" said the broker. \"We forecast slower loans growth for banks in the quarters ahead, and maintain our NEUTRAL call on the sector.\"\n\nThe main market-moving event was Tuesday and Wednesday's US Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Stocks surged ahead of the meeting on expectations that the Fed would provide \"dovish\" guidance on how long it will delay tapering its monetary stimulus.\n\nInstead of answering the question of \"how long?\" with the hoped-for answer \"quite a bit longer\", the Fed's statement amounted to \"not that much longer'', which introduced an element of mild panic into Wall Street and by extension, the rest of the world. Financial research firm Ideaglobal said from a reading of the FOMC minutes that the Fed still believes downside risks to the economy and the labour market have diminished.\n\n\"This keeps the FOMC on a data-dependent path and offers no rubber stamp of market expectations for full throttle QE until March or April or beyond,\" it said.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By Tay Suan Chiang\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nARCHITECT Chan Soo Khian has a soft spot for New York. \"I went to university in the East Coast and used to go to New York every year,\" he says. Mr Chan obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington University and Master of Architecture at Yale University.\n\nIt's only natural, then, that the founding principal and design director of SCDA Architects \"always wanted to build in New York.\"\n\nThat dream is coming to fruition with Soori High Line, a boutique residential development located in lower Manhattan's West Chelsea district. This is Mr Chan's first project in the United States.\n\nThis is his second Soori brand - the first being Alila Villas Soori, the resort and private residences in Bali. The biggest challenge about Soori High Line he says, is finding the site. \"I have been looking for suitable sites for several years. The city is almost fully built, and there are always more bidders than available land spaces,\" he says.\n\nThe 14,813 sq ft land he found and bought is minutes away from the High Line, the 1.45 mile long city park built on a section of the former elevated freight rail road.\n\nIt is also near the upcoming Hudson Yards development, where famed architects such as Zaha Hadid and Foster + Partners also have buildings. Fronting West 29th street, the 11-storey development comprises a mix of two- to five-bedroom apartments, ranging from 1,416 sq ft to 6,075 sq ft. There is also a three-storey penthouse that has its own private terrace and rooftop pool.\n\nEach apartment has double volume living and dining spaces, with ceilings reaching between 14 and 18 feet high. All apartments will come with their own fireplace and automated winterisation devices installed in the floor windows and balcony.\n\nOf the 27 apartments, 16 of them will have their own private heated pools. The pools are accessible from the bathroom, and run from the master suite along the living areas to overlook West 29th Street below, with transparent pool edges.\n\nPools in apartments are not new for Mr Chan, who created similar ones in Singapore for SC Global's The Marq which has 23 private pools.\n\nThey are however, believed to be a first for private apartments in New York. No surprise then to hear that the pools proved to be a challenge for the building authorities there.\n\n\"There are very strict building regulations, and I had to convince the authorities to allow for pools in the apartments. I also had to ensure that the pools would be handicap-compliant,\" says Mr Chan.\n\n\"I am bringing a contemporary, Asian design and resort concept to New York City, as reflected in the private residence pools, oversized bathrooms, fireplaces and double-volume ceilings. This type of lifestyle design is often found in Singapore, but is new to New York City,\" he adds. \"Therefore it was important to provide examples of my established work, such as with Nassim Park Residences in Singapore with 120 private pools, and ONE KL in Malaysia, which features 96 private pools, and to assure we have a team of experts who are adept at creating high-design features that are also fully compliant with building regulations.\"\n\nHe is insistent on having the pools, as \"they are not just for swimming, but a way to blend the outdoor and indoor spaces in a seamless way\".\n\nHe adds, \"In the tropics, pools are transition spaces, and I wanted to test this same theory in New York.\"\n\nMr Chan notes that the planning control in Manhattan is \"more pro-urban design,\" and his building facade attests to that - vertical steel fins lined with timber form a staggered veil in front of large glass facade panels, giving it a distinctive look.\n\nMr Chan is not only the architect for Soori High Line, but its interior, landscaping and product designer as well. The project is being developed by Blackhouse Oriel Development, a New York and Singapore-based real estate development firm, of which Mr Chan is a major shareholder.\n\nThe apartments will have fittings from top brands such as Poliform, Verena and Boffi. Mr Chan is designing a bespoke line of furniture for Soori High Line through Poliform, which will include chairs, love seats and coffee tables. These pieces will be introduced at the Milan Furniture Fair next year.\n\n\"I want to bring the Asian lifestyle to Manhattan,\" he says.\n\nHe adds, \"Manhattan is difficult to break into, so this is all very exciting for me.\"\n\nSoori High Line will be launched for sale in the first quarter of next year. Already, Mr Chan has received \"expressions of interest from friends and clients\". It is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2016.\n\ntaysc@sph.com.sg\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Because we are doing all that, then of course Singapore becomes a fulcrum for that (engagement),\" Mr Wagar told The Business Times. While acknowledging that there may be differences between the US and Singapore, he noted that there are several values Singapore as a nation has grown to embody which underpin bilateral ties - a relationship he said US President Barack Obama values.\n\n\"Singapore is a country that by its example shows what can be accomplished by open markets, rule of law and really, by lifting all of its citizens up. That is important for us to have that friendship here and to work with.\"\n\nHe added that Singapore has been the intellectual power behind bringing peace and stability to South-east Asia and that leadership has also led to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) evolving as an economic architecture across the region.\n\nThe 44-year-old lawyer by training, who was sworn in as US Ambassador to Singapore in September, revealed that the completion and implementation of the TPP was the top-most priority in his posting here. Describing the TPP as a \"game-changer\", Mr Wagar sees the partnership as being critical in enhancing American relations with Singapore and the region. It also provides an open market to the US and Singapore from Latin America to South-east Asia, he said.\n\nHe singled out the US-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (USSFTA) as a factor that has strengthened ties between both countries. With Singapore emerging as a top 10 trading partner for the US in the first half of this year, he believes the USSFTA is the best-performing FTA the US has signed.\n\n\"But as someone who has always been trying to get an A-plus, I haven't figured out where we can improve it yet but if I can, I will,\" he said, adding that the US-Singapore relationship reflects the benefits of trade to other countries in the region.\n\nHe noted that US foreign direct investment (FDI) to Singapore was healthy, being twice the level to China and five times the amount to India.\n\nThat said, he felt more could be done to improve the reverse flow of capital from Singapore to the US. While geographical distance may be a deterrent for some Singapore companies to invest in the US, he said the US Department of Commerce has set up the Select USA scheme to provide a one-stop service to help foreign businesses who wish to invest in the US.\n\nBefore being posted to Singapore, Mr Wagar was the managing director of a law firm in Miami and served on the advisory board of the Export-Import Bank.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Based on a land area of about 197,992.3 sq ft, this translates to gross floor area (GFA) of about 494,980.6 sq ft.\n\nOng Kah Seng, director at R'ST Research, said he expects the site to garner a top bid of about $110-$130 per square foot per plot ratio. The site should be relatively well received, given that the government has recently outlined its plans to develop Woodlands into a work-live-play regional centre.\n\n\"With Woodlands set for rejuvenation, with increased commercial and residential development, the industrial properties in the area will consequently get some spillover benefit from the added accessibility, as well as commercial and residential vibrancy of Woodlands,\" he said.\n\nTan Boon Leong, executive director of industrial services, project and sales, Colliers International, said he expects demand for the site to be healthy, given that land zoned for heavier industrial use is limited. The site could potentially fetch a top bid of between $90 and $120 per square foot per plot ratio (psf ppr), he said.\n\nTaking the nearest comparison, the plot next to the site was sold for $161.02 psf ppr in July this year. That being said, the 1.68 hectare site boasted a unique feature - an integrated heavy vehicle park for a minimum of 80 heavy vehicle parking lots, which was excluded from the computation of the development's maximum gross floor area. In addition, the 80 lots could be sold as a single strata lot.\n\nAccording to Mr Tan, that was the first time the state has sold an industrial site where the heavy vehicle parking lots were not counted as part of the GFA, and also the first time the developer was allowed to have a separate single strata lot for the heavy vehicle parking lots.\n\nMr Ong said he expects the plot to attract about seven bids.\n\nSeparately, three other smaller plots in Tuas were also launched.\n\nPlot 33 has a land area of about 79,998.4 sq ft; Plot 36, about 79,994.1 sq ft; and Plot 37, about 76,606.7 sq ft. These sites have a lease of 21 years 6 months and a maximum permissible gross plot ratio of 1.0.\n\nColliers's Mr Tan said he expects the sites to fetch between $70 and $90 psf. Compared with earlier sites which ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 square metres, and were sold at about $90 to $95 psf, these sites may fetch a slightly lower price in psf terms given that the size is larger, he said. Mr Ong said he expects at least five bids for each site, with the top bid ranging from between $80 and $100 psf.\n\nThe tender for all four sites closes on Jan 10, 2014, at 11am.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Its subsea division recorded an operating profit of US$30.8 million, treble the US$10.3 million of the previous year.\n\nAt the associate level, the group's offshore jack- up drilling business, held through its 33.77 per cent stake in Asia Offshore Drilling (AOD), swung to a profit of US$4.4 million, on partial contribution from a US$530 million contract with Saudi Aramco. Two jack-up rigs, AODI and AODII, started work on May 1 and July 13 respectively, while AODIII started its contract on Oct 10.\n\nAOD is managed by Norwegian offshore giant Seadril, which holds the remaining 66.23 per cent of the company.\n\nFor FY2013, Mermaid's management has recommended a final and special dividend of 0.36 US cent and 0.50 US cent per share respectively, or a payout of about 80 per cent of earnings. Mr Mahagitsiri said this was to reward shareholders who had believed in the company through the years, and he was hopeful the firm would do better in coming years.\n\nHe said that when he first took over as CEO, his priority was to build up a strong team, \"which is one of the first key assets\". The focus was to get the team to work like a family, he added, \"where we communicate and exchange information with each other as much as possible in coming up with solutions\".\n\nThe group then went on to secure US$690 million in contracts backlog, as well as some US$170 million in contracts for its newly built jack-up drilling fleet.\n\nAt least one broking house is convinced. CIMB, in a recent research report, has an \"outperform\" rating on the stock. It has projected FY2014 earnings growth of 1.9x year-on- year to US$43.4 million, and expects positive contributions from all segments.\n\nIt also expects Mermaid's earnings to be underpinned by its subsea order book of US$590 million, of which 48 per cent is expected to be recognised in FY2014. Based on CIMB estimates, Mermaid's FY2013 price-to-earnings ratio will drop from 28 times to 10 times and 9.5 times in FY2014 and FY2015 respectively.\n\nThe counter closed 2.5 cents higher at 42 cents yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Secondly, it has ordered brand-new Airbus 330-300s, he told The Business Times in an interview yesterday.\n\n\"This particular period is exciting because we are launching our long-haul services. We've started flying to Dubai, and our plan is to ultimately roll out at least eight new aircraft over the next three or four years,\" he said.\n\nThe current fleet stands at 47 aircraft. If the airline's plans to extend its network of destinations are realised, it will double its number of international long-haul flights by the end of next year. He said he sees huge demand at both ends of the market in the long-haul space.\n\nThe airline is now flying its A330s to Singapore and South Korea, but the \"sweet spot\" for the A330s lies in longer flights of seven to 10 hours, he said.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are within that flight radius, and are the top two places where Filipinos are hired and re-hired; going by figures from the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, 259,546 of them are deployed there. He said a key challenge in the airline business lies in managing over-capacity in the industry.\n\n\"You don't know how much capacity your competitors are putting in, so you have to manage the things under your control,\" he said, citing unit cost and service quality as controllable factors.\n\nCebu Pacific has ordered 49 new aircraft - 30 A321Neo, four A330s and 15 A320s - but these will be paced over an eight-year period to 2021. \"So it's not as dramatic as it sounds,\" he said. Some will be replacement aircraft, as older aircraft are disposed of.\n\nOf over-capacity, Mr Gokongwei said: \"Now that we are a significant player - with over 50 per cent of the domestic market and 17 per cent of the international market (flying out of the Philippines) - we would create problems for the entire industry, including ourselves, if we expand extremely rapidly from a larger base. So we are trying to pace new aircraft arrival with what we predict growth will be.\"\n\nHe said that historically, the Philippine airline industry has been growing by 15 to 16 per cent per year, but from a larger base now, and that constraints in capacity in Manila airport have cropped up. \"We think we have to plan for slower growth in the high single-digits.\"\n\nWith rapid growth over the past five years, the number of slots available for take-offs and landings at the Manila airport is now limited; already, no more slots are available between 7am and 7pm. \"Our advantage is that as the single largest airline, we already control the largest number of slots in Manila. There are opportunities to improve slot utilisation by using larger aircraft and by using the slots for international flights rather than just domestic flights,\" he said.\n\nOther solutions include building more traffic after 7pm or before 7am, and creating more hubs outside Manila. The airline now has six hubs for flights out of the Philippines, and growth is limited to perhaps another two, he said. \"The right thing to do is to increase the density in an operating hub, rather than introduce new ones, so that will be our focus,\" he added.\n\nIronically, his view is that competition among airlines in the Philippines has shrunk; the number of major players now stands at four, the other three being the Philippine Airlines group, the AirAsia Zest venture and the Tiger SeAir venture.\n\nAsked why Cebu Pacific was turning to the long-haul segment, he replied: \"We have done a good job building the brand domestically, then regionally, so the next challenge is building the long-haul market. \"We recognise that we are a point-to-point carrier, so our focus is to build that point-to-point traffic between hubs which have a heavy concentration of Filipinos, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\"\n\nThe carrier's Manila-Dubai flight was the first such direct flight for a Philippine carrier in 15 years. To tap the Japan market now under-served by low- cost carriers, Cebu Pacific plans to offer daily Manila-Osaka-Manila flights from next month, up from thrice-weekly flights now.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/sustainable-and-effective-weight-reduction", "site_title": "Sustainable and effective weight reduction", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nSustainable and effective weight reduction\n\nTaking a practical, comprehensive lifestyle approach will help reduce the risks of complications\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 29, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIN most affluent societies, an increasing proportion of the population tends to be overweight or obese and hence it is not surprising that weight loss has become a common desire for many, both for aesthetic and medical reasons. Before jumping onto the weight loss bandwagon, understanding the latest American Heart Association guidelines published in November 2013 in the Circulation Journal provides one with a practical approach to the management of excessive weight gain.\n\nWho needs to lose weight?\n\nMany people who undergo weight-loss programmes do it primarily for aesthetic reasons rather than for medical reasons. From the medical view point, it is good to understand which individuals can benefit from weight loss. Most criteria for the definition of overweight or obese condition utilise the Body Mass Index (BMI) calculation. BMI can be calculated as weight in kilogrammes divided by the square of the height in metres. Current US definitions consider a BMI (kg/m2) of 18.5 to less than 25 as normal weight, 25 to less than 30 as overweight, 30 to less than 35 as class 1 obese, 35 to less than 40 as class 2 obese and 40 and above as class 3 obese or extreme obesity. These definitions categorise individuals into different risk categories for heart disease and obesity related conditions.\n\nOne of the important factors to consider before deciding whether the individual will benefit from weight-loss programmes is to determine whether there are pre-existing medical conditions. The overweight or obese individual has to be assessed for evidence of heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. For those whose BMI is 25 to less than 35, a waist circumference measurement of more than 88cm (or 35 inches) for women and more than 102cm (or 40 inches) for men indicates an increased risk of heart and metabolic disease. Obese individuals are also more likely to have sleep-related problems as a result of obstruction to their air passages in the nose and throat region.\n\nThe latest recommendations state that those who will benefit from weight loss are those who are in the obese category with a BMI of greater than 30. However, overweight individuals (BMI 25 to less than 30) who have at least one risk factor for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, elevated waist circumference or obesity-related medical problems will also benefit from weight reduction.\n\nWeight management goals\n\nThe most important starting point for any successful weight management programme is to set realistic goals for weight loss. While it is understood that the greater the weight loss, the greater is the potential benefit, a realistic initial goal will be to set a target weight loss of 5-10 per cent within the first six months.\n\nSustainable weight loss regimes require a net energy loss by burning up calories in the body and reducing the calorie intake. It is recommended that a net energy loss of at least 500 kilocalories (kcal) be achieved daily. Depending on the physical activity of the individual, this can usually be achieved with a daily calorie intake of 1,200-1,500 kcal/day for women and 1,500-1,800 kcal/day for men.\n\nGenerally, very low-calorie diets (below 800 kcal/day) are only to be commenced under medical supervision. In some individuals with pre-existing medical conditions such as Gilbert's disease, the individual can become jaundiced within a few days of commencing on a very low calorie diet. As Gilbert's disease, a benign hereditary condition, has an estimated prevalence of 5-10 per cent of the population, proper assessment must be performed before commencing on such diets.\n\nComprehensive lifestyle approach\n\nA comprehensive lifestyle approach is key to successful weight loss programmes. Effective weight management programmes require that lifestyle adjustments be made during regular face-to-face visits of at least fortnightly frequency. Such programmes must include a reduced calorie diet with a planned daily energy deficit of 500 kcal or more, commencement of a regular physical exercise regime beyond the individual's usual activity level, and motivational drivers for adherence to a reduced calorie and increased physical exercise regime. Generally, a weight reduction of 5-10 per cent is achievable at the end of six months with adherence to such a programme. The weight loss will plateau and weight will stabilise after six months. Further weight loss will require adjustments to the calorie intake and physical exercise to maintain further net energy deficits.\n\nFor those who are unable to achieve or maintain a weight loss despite undergoing a comprehensive lifestyle programme, other adjunctive measures may be considered such as drug treatment with medication such as Xenical (orlistat).\n\nWeight reduction procedures\n\nThere are some who are unable to achieve a sustainable weight loss despite undergoing comprehensive lifestyle adjustment programmes. Those in this category who have extreme obesity (BMI of 40 or more) or BMI of 35 or more in the presence of at least one risk factor for heart disease, weight reduction surgery (bariatric surgery) can be considered if there are no contraindications.\n\nBariatric surgery reduces weight by reducing the size of the stomach or by reducing the capacity to absorb food or by a combination of both. The combined approach surgery, also called the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, is considered as the \"gold standard\" weight reduction surgical procedure. The advantages of these surgeries are rapid weight reduction, significant decrease in death from heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. The net effect is a 40 per cent decrease in death. An analysis of several databases by Buchwald, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2004, stated that almost two in three had reduction in blood pressure, almost three in four had reduction in cholesterol and diabetes improved or resolved in five out of six. The Swedish Obese Subjects study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2004, showed that after bariatric surgery, there was a 72 per cent reduction in risk of heart disease at five years, with sustained benefits at 10 years and 59 per cent reduction in death from heart artery disease at 15 years. Bariatric surgery has also been shown to benefit obese individuals with impaired heart function resulting from obesity. As a result of the significant beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on diabetes, being an obese type 2 diabetes mellitus with BMI of 30 or more is now considered as one of the indications for bariatric surgery.\n\nSustainable weight loss\n\nThere is never an easy way to lose weight without restricting calorie intake and increasing physical activities. While becoming increasingly popular for removing fat, liposuction is not a recommended method of weight loss and it carries no evidence of sustainable health benefits and yet carries a real risk of serious complications, including death.\n\nUltimately, weight loss is a matter of will. I am reminded of an obese patient of mine who has been seeing me for 20 years. During his regular visit earlier in the year, he came for his regular review in my clinic and expressed delight with his significant weight reduction of more than 10 kilogrammes within six months. After 20 years of obesity, he suddenly took a decision to walk 45 minutes on his treadmill machine every morning and night, and made a conscious effort to restrict his calorie intake. The result was a healthier person with normal BMI, achieved purely by willpower. Remember that there is no easy way out, and spending thousands of dollars at a slimming centre or on slimming foods can rarely produce sustainable weight reduction without willpower.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

In the last three months, the travelling American couple have not directly spent a single red, government-backed cent to get here: they have paid for everything in Bitcoin, the virtual currency used by a few and understood by even fewer.\n\nYesterday, in this corner of Singapore, the pair ended the final and 102nd day of their experiment called Life on Bitcoin, after having made pit stops in Berlin and Stockholm to meet fellow Bitcoiners.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Beccy told BT: \"We've had people ask us, 'You've cheated, right?' But we haven't cheated at all.\"\n\nThe couple's experiment with Bitcoin - to be turned eventually into a documentary - started the day they returned to Utah from their honeymoon. To kick off the project, Beccy, who works with a data centre, converted her salary into Bitcoin. The couple paid their landlord in it. He took some persuading to accept this currency which is sent through the Internet - but not before taking a 10 per cent premium for his pains.\n\nIn their hometown, the couple persuaded a family-owned grocery store to take Bitcoin. To pay for petrol, they found a kindred Bitcoin spirit, an employee at a petrol station known to them only as Furb. They had to drive 80km from their home for the petrol though.\n\nThen came the time to start their travel. In the last three weeks, the couple have driven cross-country to New York City, from where they visited Stockholm, Berlin and then Singapore.\n\nAustin said: \"I was curious about how to become involved in Bitcoin because neither of us is a cryptographer, programmer or an economist. As a concept, Bitcoin is really interesting.\"\n\nTheir trip has been equal parts madcap and careful planning. Their flights and hotel accommodation were arranged though Simply Travel, an online travel agency that accepts Bitcoin.\n\nBut getting a meal in Stockholm proved challenging. They wandered the streets ravenous late at night, in search of a restaurant that would accept Bitcoin. At a Burger King outlet, they found their US-issued gift card - paid for with Bitcoin - useless.\n\nBeccy said of the Burger King staff: \"They were like, 'We don't even have a way to accept this'. We looked crazy.\"\n\nSince arriving in Singapore last Sunday, they have eaten at two cafes that accept Bitcoin. One of them, Artistry Cafe, has been doing so since July.\n\nWhere a direct Bitcoin transaction with a merchant is not possible, the couple rely on a fraternity of Bitcoin enthusiasts. In Singapore, a Bitcoiner helped them buy a local prepaid data plan for their cellphone in the conventional way, and accepted compensation in Bitcoin.\n\nThe couple's first Bitcoin transaction took place at a train station as they tried to get home from Salt Lake City's airport, post-honeymoon.\n\nAustin said: \"The first people we talked to had never heard of Bitcoin before, but we explained it to them.\n\n\"They said 'OK', and bought the train tickets, which we then bought from them with Bitcoin.\"\n\nThe experiment has been expensive: For the train tickets that cost US$18 in total, the couple parted with a physical Bitcoin - called a Casascius coin - worth US$45 then. Thanks to the rapid rise of Bitcoin's value, that coin is now worth about US$100.\n\nThe appreciation in Bitcoin's value that caused the couple to inadvertently enrich people in their wake made headlines in Norway recently. In 2009, engineer Kristoffer Koch bought US$24 in Bitcoin and promptly forgot about them. Four years later, that stash of Bitcoin rose to nearly US$886,000 in value, enabling him to buy an apartment in a swanky part of Oslo.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is approaching a full circle of sorts. It is now also available in physical coin and paper form, which contain \"private keys\" that give access to their digital value.\n\nFor all the pockets of euphoria about Bitcoin, the currency's value has a vexing tendency to plunge as suddenly as it spikes. In April, the price of a Bitcoin fell 70 per cent to US$70. Since then, the price has regained dizzying heights, trading at US$213 yesterday.\n\nCompounding the volatility, Mt.Gox - the world's largest Bitcoin exchange - has earned the unwelcome attention of the authorities, becoming the subject of several raids. At last count, more than US$5 million has reportedly been seized from Mt.Gox accounts by the US government.\n\nLittle wonder then, that in the button-down world of bottom lines and shareholders, large corporations have backed away carefully from the Bitcoin concept.\n\nAustin and Beccy found that for their project, buying a cellphone directly with Bitcoin was impossible. Austin said: \"If a company is large . . . they say, 'We'll need to address that to corporate headquarters and that can take weeks or months or years if we can even get the conversation going'.\"\n\nEven smaller businesses keep one wary eye on the vagaries of the Bitcoin world. Prashant Somosundram, owner of Artistry Cafe, puts a per-head cap on bills settled with Bitcoin. He told BT: \"I'm quite conscious that this is still very nascent and any small technical issues could wipe out everything.\"\n\nEven so, the going is good for now. In the last four months, 50 Bitcoin transactions have taken place at his cafe, which has seen the currency appreciate in value by 50 per cent.\n\nDespite the uphill battle that Bitcoin faces, the converted have grown more fervent, drawn to its decentralised nature and the fact that it is impossible to counterfeit and is relatively free of transaction fees.\n\nAustin said: \"After all the difficulties we've been through, I'm still very much a believer.\"\n\nSome time after the BT interview, a minor triumph was scored in Little India, where the couple convinced a henna tattoo artist to take Bitcoin as payment. \"Beccy is the happy new owner of a henna-tattooed arm,\" Austin told BT in an email update.\n\nSomewhere in Little India sits a mildly bemused owner of what might just be a piece of the future.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It comes with retail amenities such as a mini-mart, restaurant/cafe and a medical clinic that offers services ranging from specialist consultation, diagnosis, basic treatment, observation and recuperation.\n\nWhile not the biggest development in Zaisan, Zaisan 18 is a unique and upmarket development that is targeted at the sophisticated crowd seeking the comforts of modern living and healthcare. The name \"Zaisan 18\" started off as a project name, which the client, who is in the goldmining business, later decided to adopt because of the number 18's association with prosperity.\n\nMr Lim explains that Ong&Ong Mongolia is one of the very few foreign architecture firms in Ulaanbaatar, and the only one from Singapore. \"The client was impressed by Singapore's rapid progress, so they wanted a Singaporean architecture firm to take on the Zaisan 18 project,\" he says.\n\nDesigned by Andrew Lee, another Ong&Ong director, the design concept was for Zaisan 18 to resonate with the rugged Mongolian terrain.\n\nZaisan 18 has two towers, where the apartments and communal facilities such as the gym, children's area, sky lounge and meeting rooms are housed. At the bottom of the two towers are the commercial areas, for the mini-mart, restaurant and clinic. It is expected to be completed in two years.\n\nMongolia is uncharted territory for Mr Lim, but even on his first visit, \"I fell in love with this fast emerging market.\"\n\nThe country is fast developing, with most of the activities concentrated in its capital city, Ulaanbaatar. Zaisan is located on the southern side of the city, in an area on the slope of a hill. \"It has clean air and blue skies, without the city noise and congestion - while flaunting a full view of the city,\" says Mr Lim.\n\nHe cites communication as a challenge when working there. \"The Mongolian language is not easy to master,\" says Mr Lim, who is getting informal lessons. When communicating with the locals, his friends and staff from the office help to translate.\n\nThe harsh weather is also new for him. Temperatures in the summer are about 30 deg C, but it can fall to as low as minus 40 degrees in the winter. Mr Lim has since cultivated the habit of checking the weather forecast and always being prepared. \"Thankfully, after some time, my body has adjusted to the weather,\" he says. He also had to get used to the food and culture.\n\nBut there are similarities between Singapore and Mongolia. \"Both countries are constantly working towards developing the population, improving infrastructure and providing a better standard of living,\" says Mr Lim.\n\nMr Lim is overseeing two more projects in Mongolia: Zaisan Towers, another mixed-use development and Steppez, a residential development project currently at its planning stage.\n\n\"The Mongolians are eager to learn and improve, and their enthusiasm attracted me to stay in Mongolia.\"\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

More should be done to preserve the interests of small investors and to give them at least a fighting chance in a market which is already dominated by house traders, proprietary desks and algorithmic players using super-fast computers.\n\nOne suggestion made by a remisier with 20 years' experience is worth considering. In an email to BT this week, he called for SGX to uniformly implement a stop-loss feature in its GL trading system for retail players and to constantly emphasise the need to use this feature in its educational seminars.\n\nA stop-loss level is the price beyond which losses will be too painful. So if someone buys a stock at $1 and will only tolerate a 10 per cent loss, then the stop-loss will be pegged at 90 cents.\n\nIn effect, having such a facility amounts to allowing each retail player to tailor their own circuit breaker based on their individual risk tolerance. In this way, every small trader has a better chance of preserving his or her capital and managing the finances.\n\nAccording to dealers, SGX's GL system does have a stop-loss option under the \"Tactics\" column on the trading screen but this is not activated for all houses. SGX should look at correcting this and at actively encouraging retail investors to use it in their day-to-day trading.\n\nA second suggestion is one that's been made in this column before, and that is to revive the cash market.\n\nFor those who remember it, this was a segment that existed for years throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, running in tandem with the \"ready\" and \"odd-lot\" markets. For reasons unknown, it was scrapped in 1994 and repeated calls over the years to resurrect it have not been successful.\n\nYet the cash market offered investors many benefits. It was a segment where scrip could be obtained at very short notice if cash was paid upfront. So where the ready market initially operated on (T+5) delivery before it was shortened to the present (T+3) in 2000, delivery in the cash market was (T+1), with T being the transaction day.\n\nHaving a cash market readily on hand offers retail traders many advantages. Perhaps the most relevant is that those with outstanding short-sold positions at the end of each day would not have to worry about the exchange forcibly filling those positions via its \"buying-in\" - a daily exercise which, despite having been fine- tuned over the years, is still criticised for being overly heavy-handed on inadvertent errors.\n\nWith a cash market, anyone who had oversold a position on date T could immediately fill it the next day and avoid being caught short on (T+3) - and thereby escape a potentially large loss when the exchange's buying-in was executed.\n\nIn addition, having a segment on hand where settlement and payment are based on (T+1) offers investors greater choice and flexibility in daily money management - surely an advantageous feature of any developed capital market.\n\nIt is important to note that a cash or immediate-delivery market would only complement - not replace - the exchange's buying-in process, because the latter would still be needed for positions that might not be covered via cash market purchases.\n\nSo if revived, the cash market would run in tandem with buying- in, simply offering market players a viable alternative to obtaining scrip at short notice.\n\nAgain, the main beneficiaries of such a segment would likely be retail players. In a market becoming more and more lopsided in favour of the big boys, this is surely a worthwhile pursuit.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The value of M&A investments in the world's high-growth economies has totalled more than US$723 billion since 2008.\n\nFreshfields found that the higher the stakes in a deal, the greater the chances of it hitting a problem. Thirty-eight per cent of the deals valued at US$2 billion or more encountered an issue, compared with 21 per cent of deals valued at between US$1 billion and US$2 billion, and 26 per cent of those between US$750 million and US$1 billion.\n\nRegulatory probes were the most common among the issues faced, affecting half of the troubled deals. Litigation impacted 35 per cent of the affected deals, while disputes such as activist protests and quarrels with landowners and employees were also prevalent, impacting 22 per cent of the deals.\n\n\"M&A deals in growth markets usually have a different risk/reward profile when compared to M&A transactions in more mature markets,\" said Freshfields corporate partner Stephen Revell. \"This research underscores the importance of thinking through the likely issues, and putting in place effective and resilient risk mitigation solutions. No deal team at any listed company wants to deliver the message to the board that its big emerging market investment has hit an unexpected and significant obstacle.\"\n\nNotably, there are particular markets in Asia that are more susceptible to difficulties during a transaction than others.\n\nIndia has proved particularly challenging, with 83 per cent of the deals there encountering problems - regulatory issues proved the biggest setback, affecting half of the troubled deals.\n\nMeanwhile, 60 per cent of deals that took place in Indonesia encountered a setback, while 25 per cent of deals in China faced issues.\n\nMr Revell said that, as the volume and size of deals in the region (in particular, South-east Asia) increase, buyers and sellers alike will have to react to the heightened risks of doing business in particular countries.\n\n\"As the developing markets in our region continue to grow, we will see far more large-scale transactions taking place. This means that the stakes are increasing for global players looking to expand their businesses in South-east Asia. They will need to pay particular attention to the specific challenges within a jurisdiction.\n\n\"Ultimately, the only way to mitigate trouble in deals is through an abundance of expertise during the execution,\" he said.\n\nOf the cross-border M&A deals that faced significant issues, Indian telecom giant Bharti Airtel's US$10.7 billion acquisition of Nigeria's Zain Africa in 2010 encountered four major hurdles. Nigeria's High Court declared its ownership null and void, the Congo Republic launched a regulatory dispute over its telecom licence, an employee attempted to block the sale, and the Kenyan government initiated a tax investigation.\n\nVodafone ran into trouble when it acquired Ghana Telecom in 2008. Dismissed Ghana Telecoms workers filed a writ of summons against Vodafone Ghana over termination of their appointments, the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office asked officials to investigate allegations of irregularities in Vodafone's African dealings, activists staged a protest, and the deal faced heavy government opposition.\n\nAnd US retail giant Wal- Mart faced opposition from the South African government when it acquired Massmart Holdings in 2010. After a two-year battle, Walmart had to set up a US$27.5 million supplier development fund for the acquisition to go ahead.\n\nFreshfields says there are six recurring themes that any investor should consider before making its move:\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But for U-Theatre's artistic director Liu Ruo-Yu, it has resulted in a tangible piece of work - Meeting with Bodhisattva (literally meaning \"enlightened being\").\n\nThe production tells the story of a warrior who goes through the six stages of the path to self-actualisation, and the fears he has to overcome along the way. It is based on the teachings of the god of wisdom, Vajrasattva.\n\nLiu explains that she first got the idea after a 36-day meditation retreat that she attended on a small island just outside of Taiwan.\n\n\"During the retreat I saw my absurd inner self, sometimes laughing, sometimes crying, and started to understand some new selves I hadn't seen before in my life,\" she says.\n\nShe then worked with U-Theatre's musical director, Huang Chih-Chun to put together a production of dance and martial arts movements staged in a simple and modest set inspired by the architecture of the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, where the Dalai Lama used to live.\n\nMeeting with Bodhisattva was first performed at the Taipei National Theatre in 2002, and has since travelled all over the world, from the US to Hong Kong, Belgium, and Australia.\n\nTrue to its Eastern roots, the show makes use of chants, live vocals and recorded music. One unique feature it incorporates is the use of live percussion sounds created with a technique that U-Theatre developed where long sticks are used to beat drums instead of the traditionally shorter and heavier sticks.\n\nIt may sound rather simple, but perfecting this drumming technique was actually the biggest challenge for U-Theatre performers as they had to train themselves to integrate the long sticks into their martial art forms.\n\nOn her rationale for creating this production, Liu says it was meant as a reminder, not just to her audiences but also to the U-Theatre performers, that the journey of \"self-cultivation needs great courage, and a strong heart.\"\n\nMeeting with Bodhisattva runs at 8pm on Dec 6, at The Star Performing Arts Centre on 1 Vista Exchange Green.

Recurrent net profit excludes acquisition, divestment and performance fees, as well as finance income and costs.\n\nReit management fees for the quarter and the first nine months grew 6 per cent to $27.9 million and 13 per cent to $84 million respectively.\n\nWhile no dividends were declared for the third quarter, management highlighted that the group would continue to sustain its dividend policy of paying a total of five cents per share per annum, comprising 2.3 cents as interim dividends and 2.7 cents as final dividends.\n\nThe fund manager had recently formed a strategic alliance with The Straits Trading Company Ltd whereby the latter bought a 20.1 per cent stake in ARA, making Straits Trading its largest shareholder, followed by ARA CEO John Lim and Cheung Kong Holdings.\n\nAt a press teleconference, Mr Lim said that it would be exciting times ahead for the group as it embarks on the next growth phase with the joint alliance. However, he said that it was too early to comment when asked if the Straits Trading Building, the shareholder's flagship office asset at Battery Road, would be injected into Suntec Reit.\n\nHe also said that the group was unlikely to relaunch its long suspended Dynasty Reit IPO in the next 12 months given the still weak market conditions. Instead, he said, the group would look at new markets in South Korea, Australia and Japan.\n\nThe Dynasty Reit IPO was suspended in late October last year due to weak market conditions and waning demand. The IPO would have been Singapore's first yuan denominated Reit offering.\n\nARA said that its assets under management (AUM) grew 3.6 per cent from Dec 31, 2012 to $23.4 billion as at Sept 30, 2013. With the Straits Trading strategic alliance, AUM growth is expected to be bolstered with $100 million in seed capital for a new development fund, as well as $830 million in a real estate portfolio to be managed on a separate account.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

By May Yip\n\nPublished\n\nFri, Nov 1, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nSmells like Brit spirit\n\nALTHOUGH its pedigree may have been overpowered by that of the French, the British perfumery industry in fact boasts an ambrosial history. From Grossmith, one of England's oldest perfume houses, to the successfully revived house of Penhaligon's, which has set up shop here at ION Orchard and Marina Bay Sands, British fragrance institutions are as highly regarded for their fine scents as they are for their storied heritage. Now, Atkinsons is another fragrance brand hoping to draw upon its 200 years of English eccentricity, style and impeccable manners to entice new devotees to its unique concoctions.\n\nAnd while Queen Victoria and Kate Middleton were said to have been inspired by The Nuptial Bouquet scent for their own wedding bouquets, why not try the house's signature blend, 24 Old Bond Street, as a primer to the marque? A cocktail of juniper, rose and black tea, deepened with an eccentric note of oak-casked whisky, this is as close to English elegance as you can get, short of a night's stay at Claridge's.\n\nUp-Scale jewels\n\nHERMES has long been known for its use of exotic skins, with crocodile being one of its most precious materials. After all, major fashion houses use only the top 10 per cent of the predators' skins, and with frequent snapping at one another being very much a part of a croc's life, harvesting bite-free, quality skins doesn't come easy. Now, the French luxury label has further elevated the status of the ferocious beast, unveiling a jewellery collection named Niloticus, inspired by the Latin name of the Nile Crocodile. Its fine jewellery designer Pierre Hardy has created rings, bracelets, necklaces and ear studs from mesh-jointed rose-gold scales, which move with the slightest tremble of its wearer. And as if to highlight the delicacy of the fine hinges, diamond studs adorn the corners where the scales meet.\n\nTaking 10 months of artistic and technical development to create, the pieces are wearable works of art. In particular, the Plastron necklace, a head-turning statement accessory studded with tourmalines, red jasper, water sapphire and peridot at its centre, took 420 hours to create. Who still covets a croco Birkin when you can flaunt such a decadent take on the exotic hide?\n\nKnotty and nice\n\nTHIS is so not an adaptation of Granny's favourite macrame wall hanging. Instead, fashion newcomer Joyce Wong has created a complex woven pattern for her signature dress, which accentuates one's hourglass figure.\n\nThe designer of the label Duo took eight hours to braid the embellishment by hand, and another 15 to hand-stitch it to the garment. Meanwhile, black side and back contrast panels create a visually slimming effect so you don't actually have to hit the gym to look like a wasp-waisted knock-out.\n\nThat's not all, the best part about spotting a design newbie is that insider cachet, which almost guarantees that you won't be seeing your hot new buy on just about everyone else. Ms Wong's body-flattering designs have only just been launched for the Fall/Winter season, after she honed her design skills working alongside a renowned Malaysian designer for the past four years. The Raffles Design Institute grad also crafted some artsy-looking necklaces for those who want to ease into this woven trend without breaking the bank.\n\nThrills afoot\n\nWITH the current reign of menswear e-stores, aspiring street-style blog stars and discerning old-world dressers alike could own a pair of John Lobbs or George Cleverleys with just a click of the mouse. So what's a home-grown footwear start-up got to do to stand out from the international competition?\n\nFor a start, the \"Goodyear-welted\" tag is practically de rigueur for any self-respecting men's shoe brand; and serves as a selling point for Singapore-designed label Atelier LLYER. (Aside to cobbling neophytes: note that the particular method of construction has nothing to do with car tyres). Rather than being glued, the technique requires for the outer and inner soles to be sewn together with a strip of material for waterproofing and durability.\n\nCryptic nomenclature aside (pronounced \"ley-yer\", the label is named after a Welsh mythological figure), the less-than-a-year-old company also boasts hand-finishing and the use of full-grain Italian calf leather for its upper and outsoles, all while maintaining a price range starting from $365 - practically a steal considering the price of a super-simple Celine shopper (sorry, ladies). Slightly more adventurous dressers can try the Tristan, a longwing brogue in muted-tan leather on grey suede. Its two-tone design and details like burnished toe and bevelled waist makes it perfect for a dandy-esque get-up, so show them off with ankle-hitting trousers.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Oxley picked up the site, which houses six bungalow buildings known as 149 to 159 Jalan Ampang, at RM446.7 million (S$174 million) from an estate sale.\n\nThe group intends to redevelop the land, subject to obtaining all the necessary approvals, said Oxley yesterday. The site is in close proximity to Petronas Twin Towers, Suria KLCC, Grand Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, and various luxury condominiums, such as Four Seasons Place, Dua Residency, Binjai Residency and The Troika. There is also a diverse array of amenities including shopping malls, upmarket restaurants, nightspots and international schools.\n\nThe developer, which made its name in shoebox developments here, has within a few months groomed an impressive stable of overseas pipeline projects.\n\nThese include a mixed-development site which will proffer more than 3,400 residential units along with a mix of commercial, retail, leisure and educational facilities. It will sit on a site with a gross effective area of about 363,000 sq m, at London's Royal Wharf.\n\nOver in China, Oxley, through a 10 per cent stake in GD Capital, also has land use rights for two plots in the Xuancheng Economic and Techncial Development Zone in Anhui province.\n\nThe deal, which was valued at 35.71 million yuan (S$7.3 million), also allows Oxley to participate, with up to 30 per cent interest, in the development of five other land parcels in the same economic zone.\n\nThe developer marked its first overseas acquisition on May 29, when it announced that it had bought a Malaysia-incorporated company that had clinched the rights to acquire a 99-year-leasehold mixed-development site measuring about 1.9 hectares on Jalan Hang Tuah in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe deal, which was valued at RM267.9 million, was quickly followed by a 2.2 ha plot acquisition in Sungai Buluh in Selangor, which is zoned for commercial development.\n\nIncluding the latest acquisition, this brings to six the total number of its pipeline projects in Malaysia.\n\nAlso within South-east Asia, Oxley picked up three plots in quick succession in Phnom Penh in July and entered into a joint venture to develop a fourth. One of the sites picked up in July is to be amalgamated with another plot acquired in June; this brings the total number of pipeline projects in Cambodia to four.\n\nOn Wednesday, Oxley surprised the market by announcing that its net profit for the first quarter ended September surged to $250.8 million, from $6.6 million a year ago, on the back of a 13-fold leap in revenue to $686 million, from $50 million a year ago.\n\nOxley's counter ended trading yesterday up four cents at 47.5 cents.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

But operating expenses rose 9.5 per cent to $213.52 million from a year earlier resulting in operating profit falling 39.1 per cent to $5.33 million.\n\nItems contributing to higher operating expenses include staff costs (up 12.6 per cent at $98.84 million), repairs and maintenance (up 14.7 per cent at $28.33 million) and higher energy costs (up 2.7 per cent at $44.82 million).\n\nSBST is Singapore's biggest bus operator. The unit of land transport giant ComfortDelGro also runs a smaller rail network.\n\nEarnings per share were 1.15 cents, down from 2.04 cents in the same period a year ago. No dividend has been proposed.\n\nRevenue from bus operations climbed 8.7 per cent to $167.43 million on an increase in average daily ridership. But there was an operating loss of $880,000 - down from a $1.8 million loss in the same period a year ago - stemming from higher staff costs, repairs and maintenance costs, fuel cost, depreciation, premises costs and other operating expenses.\n\nRevenue from rail operations was up 8.3 per cent at $37.94 million on increases in average daily ridership and average fare.\n\nBut rail suffered an operating loss of $2.6 million - versus an operating profit of $371,000 previously - because of higher staff costs largely from the preparation for the start-up of the Downtown Line (DTL) and higher repairs and maintenance costs. SBST said that excluding DTL start-up costs, operating profit for rail would have risen 10.4 per cent to $2.5 million.\n\nRevenue from the advertisement and rental businesses was down 18 per cent at $8.44 million and up 15.3 per cent at $5.04 million, respectively. Operating profit for advertisements was 31.1 per cent lower at $4.76 million, while operating profit for rental was up 22.2 per cent at $4.05 million.\n\nFor the first nine months ended Sept 30, net profit was down 39.3 per cent at $9.52 million, though year-to-date revenue climbed 7 per cent to $632.95 million.\n\nEarnings per share for the nine-month period was 3.09 cents, down from 5.08 cents previously.\n\nThe group's net asset value per ordinary share was $1.11, unchanged from nine months earlier.\n\nSBST said it expected bus and rail riderships to increase at slower rates. Staff costs are also expected to be higher due to headcount increases, salary adjustments and increases in foreign workers' levy.\n\nWith the renewal and expansion of the bus fleet, depreciation and financing costs are expected to increase. More costs will also be incurred with the gearing up of DTL1.\n\nSBST shares closed two cents lower at $1.36 yesterday.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Excluding vehicles, retail sales fell 2.5 per cent.\n\n\"September car sales were boosted after the announced recategorisation of certificate of entitlements (COEs) - Category A will now have an additional criterion of 130 brake horsepower (bhp), which would push nearly half the cars in Category A to the more expensive Category B - as car buyers brought forward their purchases of affected cars,\" Citi economists Kit Wei Zheng and Brian Tan said in a research note.\n\nThis offset the negative impact from the government's introduction of the total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) framework in late June, they added.\n\nCompared with a year ago, sales of motor vehicles and telecommunications apparatus and computers slumped 26.3 per cent and 13.4 per cent respectively in September.\n\nOther categories which reported lower sales included furniture and household equipment (-5.9 per cent) and wearing apparel and footwear (-1.4 per cent).\n\n\"The softness in sales was particularly concentrated in furniture and household equipment, and information and communications technology (ICT) products, and we think this is related to lower transaction volume in the housing market,\" said Barclays economist Joey Chew.\n\nCategories which chalked up stronger year-on-year growth in sales included food and beverages, up 5.4 per cent, and medical goods and toiletries, which were up 4.1 per cent.\n\nThose which saw lower sales in September over August include recreational goods, which went down 7.7 per cent, and wearing apparel and footwear, which fell 5.7 per cent.\n\nBarclays's Ms Chew noted that the volume of sales for the third quarter as a whole, stripping out cars and adjusted for inflation, was 0.8 per cent lower quarter-on-quarter (seasonally adjusted), owing to lower sales of luxury watches and jewellery.\n\nThis was likely to have been caused by waning expenditure by Asean tourists as a result of the strong Singapore dollar. Locals also appear to be curtailing spending on non-essential items, she said, noting the lower sales for ICT.\n\nHowever, Citi's Mr Kit and Mr Tan expect that the slight softening in consumption will be cushioned by the tight labour market.\n\nFor the Food & Beverage Services Index, sales of F&B services increased 2.2 per cent year on year in September, and inched up 0.4 per cent month on month (seasonally adjusted).\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

We had expected them to hold off for another month, but were happily surprised by the decision.\n\nMeanwhile, US data, while still difficult to read because of the government shutdown, was better than expected. A large majority of commentators are now arguing that \"good news is bad news\". In that line of thinking, good news on the economy is bad news for financial markets as it makes early tapering of asset purchases by the Fed more likely and we have seen over the summer what the effects will be. I think the \"good news is bad news\" argument will prove to be wrong.\n\n'Good news is bad news': rubbish\n\nMarkets have recently regularly responded negatively to good economic data, unleashing a new religion: the \"good news is bad news\" faith. In that line of thinking, good economic news triggers expectations of tightening of monetary policy, which is considered bad for markets for risky assets. The supporters of this view point at what happened after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke first mentioned tapering of asset purchases in early May.\n\nYields on 10-year US government bonds rose by 140 basis points over a four-month period. This was actually similar to the bond market's response to the unexpected rise in official rates in February 1994. That period has gone down in the history books as a savage bear market in bonds.\n\nThe rise in yields earlier this year had a big impact on capital flows in the world. Emerging markets saw large outflows and the S&P 500 lost 100 points (initially, and then recovered all of the lost ground, and more.) The good-news-is-bad-news school teaches that something similar will happen when the Fed actually tapers and strong data brings that moment closer.\n\nI think this argument makes no sense whatsoever. I have several reasons for this. First, tapering is not a matter of if, but of when. That makes the recovery of markets for risky assets after the Fed's failure to taper in September all the more surprising.\n\nWhy would holders of risky assets stay in them and, in fact, rebuild positions, knowing that the moment of truth is coming anyway, be it in December or a couple of months later? One would be pushing one's luck if one tried to stay until the last day before a big correction starts.\n\nMy colleague Nick Kounis has referred to the period following the first mention of tapering as a \"dry run\". Markets responded strongly and nervously, but in the end nothing happened, the Fed did not taper. The dry run gave everybody time to reflect.\n\nVirtually all emerging market economists that I have read responded by arguing that the negative reaction of the market was overdone as most emerging economies are in a much better position now than they were before previous US tightening cycles.\n\nMarket participants appear to have taken that view on board, and emerging equities have regained more ground than they had originally lost. So why would they panic again when the tapering actually starts?\n\nPushing up emerging equity markets in the meantime seems a stupid thing to do unless one is convinced of the argument that emerging economies will be better able than before to cope with a change in the direction of US monetary policy.\n\nA second argument for not fearing the tapering is what happened to borrowing costs during the various programmes of quantitative easing. Just before and at the very beginning of the first QE programme, US government bond yields fell sharply. That however, was largely an announcement effect. Bond yields subsequently rose during the programme.\n\nThe knee-jerk announcement effect of lower yields was much smaller in the case of QE2 and QE3. In fact, bond yields were higher at the end of QE2 than at the beginning and the same seems likely in the case of QE3.\n\nMuted impact\n\nThe conclusion I draw is that the effect of QE on bond yields is less impressive than people think and the reversal of the QE programme may equally have little impact.\n\nA third argument is that the Fed must have been unpleasantly surprised by the market's response to Mr Bernanke's remarks in May. As it turned out to have been only a dry run, the Fed can study the consequences carefully. One of their findings surely will be that the economy cannot cope with a rise in borrowing costs as large as occurred over such a short period of time and therefore the process of tapering must be cautious and well managed.\n\nMarkets for risky assets have done well in recent months and it is only natural that they would take a breather. But the case for risky assets remains overwhelmingly strong and is not weakened by the prospect of tapering in my view.\n\nAccelerating growth will improve credit quality and provide another push to profit growth. And with central banks now perhaps a little more mindful of inflation undershooting their targets, it seems very unlikely that they will follow a particularly restrictive monetary policy.\n\nThe combination of accelerating growth, easing inflation, at best modestly rising borrowing costs and return prospects for other assets looking unattractive, mean that the appeal of risky assets continues to be strong.\n\nThe writer is chief economist of ABN Amro Bank\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nWealth & Investing\n\nSTI\u2019s gains reflect \u2018concrete steps\u2019 by Temasek companies to address business fundamentals\n\nJul 14, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nGrasping the mettle of geopolitics in portfolios\n\nJul 14, 2025 06:00 AM\n\nPrivate credit lures ultra-rich sitting on US$3.1 trillion\n\nJul 13, 2025 09:00 AM\n\nFed independence tested, but investors shouldn\u2019t expect a pivot\n\nJul 12, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nAsia will both drive and gain from dollar asset diversification\n\nJul 11, 2025 07:00 AM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nJack Ma-backed Ant to add Circle\u2019s stablecoin to global net: sources\n\nJul 10, 2025 05:47 PM\n\nAmundi expects retail investors to drive \u2018massive\u2019 ETF growth in Asia and Europe\n\nJul 08, 2025 08:30 PM", "images": []}

Another said that the issue had good institutional participation.\n\nThe initial indication was that the coupon would be in around 4.9 per cent, according to a term sheet sent to investors yesterday.\n\nThe subordinated, unsecured, non-cumulative, non-convertible perpetual capital securities qualify as Tier 1 capital for the bank and are Basel III-compliant.\n\nThe proceeds will be used for general business purposes.\n\nUOB, Credit Suisse, Nomura, Standard Chartered Bank and UBS are handling the sale.\n\nUOB's July transaction was the first Basel III-compliant issue by a local bank. The proceeds were used to redeem preference shares which were callable on Sept 16, 2013.\n\nBoth the July deal and yesterday's $500 million issue can be written down in full or in part upon notification of non-viability by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\n\nUnder Basel III rules, bank investors must share the burden in the event of a bank failure before public money is used to rescue the bank.\n\nFollowing the 2008 global financial crisis, which saw governments bailing out many Western banks, regulators tightened rules to shift the burden of losses to investors.\n\nUnder MAS Notice 637 effective Jan 1, 2013, Tier-1 securities have a point of non-viability (PONV) loss-absorbing feature. What this means is that investors or debt-holders will have to face a partial principal writedown or conversion into common equity when the PONV is triggered by MAS.\n\nPONV is triggered when MAS decides that a bank is no longer viable, or when public sector support is required.\n\nDBS Group Holdings last week offered to buy back $800 million of an outstanding $1.7 billion preference share issue in exchange for new notes that will be Basel III compliant.\n\nExisting note holders can, via a tender, exchange at par the new notes, which will pay out 4.7-4.9 per cent, and has a call date in November 2019, DBS said.\n\nThe callable date for the existing preference shares is 2020. The non-cumulative non-convertible non- voting class N preference shares have a payout of 4.7 per cent.\n\n\"Very glad UOB has gone out today, the market will see value in DBS's offer,\" said a DBS banker.\n\nA UOB banker said that the DBS offer of 4.7-4.9 per cent does not offer much premium over the existing preference shares given that the new perps would be more risky as they have the loss-absorbing feature.\n\nGenerally, investors are keen on the banks' perpetuals, given the continued low interest rate environment that also means that issuers get to lock in funding at favourable levels, said a banker who is neither from UOB nor DBS.\n\n\"Heard the UOB perps were snapped up very quickly . . . interest rates wouldn't rise till 2015-2016,\" he said.\n\nTapering fears or the start of slowing bond purchases by the US Federal Reserve seems to have been pushed to year-end or even the middle of 2014.\n\n\"For new issues, interest rates will definitely be a factor,\" said Clifford Lee, DBS Bank head of fixed income.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The examples quoted were a Mouton Rothschild 1993 magnum and one of Trimbach's Riesling Clos Ste Hune 1981. Last week two more such bottles were enjoyed which so strongly exemplified this that they deserve to appear in this column.\n\nNuits St Georges 1er cru Les Vaucrains 1978, Domaine Henri Gouges\n\nNotes: Colour a transparent medium-hued orangey-red, with a magical and beautiful aroma, indeed an ethereal perfume of pure Pinot Noir with strawberries and a light touch of ripe oranges. Haunting. It made you return to stick your nose in the glass repeatedly. On the palate, a delicately light taste of perfectly ripe fruit, with a gossamer transparency. An exquisite wine.\n\nThe wines of Nuits St Georges are difficult to characterise, at least for me, compared to those of Vosne-Romanee, Chambolle-Musigny.\n\nThey are, to put it in a colloquial way, not quite \"user-friendly\", rather closed and tight in their youth, although unmistakably Pinot Noir in origin. They are therefore not as often seen on the table.\n\nNuits wines are not soft and lush like those of Vosne-Romanee, they do not possess the seductiveness and ethereal beauty of the Chambolle-Musigny. They are not deep and dense as those from Gevrey-Chambertin, nor do they show the soft fruitiness of the Volnays. They are Pinot Noirs with a gravity of countenance, always showing good minerality, but requiring lots of bottle age before they sing.\n\nStudents of Burgundy know that 1978 was one of the greatest vintages for both Burgundy and Bordeaux. It was the most recent great vintage to look for, in Bordeaux, red and white Burgundy. I recall scouring the lists and stocks of wine merchants in Central London - Loeb, Justerini & Brooks, Berry Brothers, etc - every time I happened to be in London at that time in the mid-1980s when this collection started. This was a truly great bottle, purchased while in London from the venerable old wine firm of OW Loeb. The only bottle left, sadly.\n\nHenri Gouges was Mayor of Nuits-St-Georges and his Domaine one of the oldest and most respected Domaines there. Its wines were never easy to approach when young, needing long bottle age. Now run by his grandsons Pierre and Christian Gouges, the Domaine's reputation remains capably upheld by wines which continue to be made in the same way.\n\nCorton-Charlemagne Grand Cru 1988, Domaine Joseph Faiveley\n\nOne of the last remaining bottles of a case purchased from the local distributor in 1991.\n\nI had opened the first few bottles when the wine was seven to 10 years old, and they were not ready. I put the rest away - and forgot about them. Last week scouring around looking for a mature white, I saw this bottle! Drank it last week with Cantonese cuisine.\n\nBright, shining light golden colour, its bouquet full of fresh ripe oranges announced a great chardonnay wine at the height of its maturity. Not a sign of age.\n\nFirst sip revealed a wine at the height of its development, delicate and refined in its texture, rapier-like in its freshness, very rich and intense on the palate, leaving a long lingering taste of dried orange peel. A beautiful Corton Charlemagne in full flight.\n\nThis wine from Faiveley came from the era of the elder Faiveley, Erwan's father Francois. I had in a previous column remarked on the great length of time that Faiveley's wines of the 80's and 90's needed in bottle to mature.\n\nThis Corton Charlemagne well exemplifies that at 25 years! On the basis of this bottle, it was well worth it. And that, in turn, raises the question, will the current style of Faiveley's wines develop with the same excellence that this bottle has? A question that can only be answered in another 25 years.\n\nThese two bottles also raise the same question discussed in an earlier column. How to get them and where? Regular wine merchants even the big ones in UK hardly stock these wines today.\n\nThere are a small handful of wine merchants who specialise in old vintages. Peter Wylie in the UK and Jan Paulson in Germany. Another source is wine auctions, such as Sotheby's and Christies. The big problem apart from availability is provenance.\n\nPeter Wylie and Jan Paulson are very careful about provenance. My experience with them has been favourable. With auction wines it would be advisable to check with the auction house.\n\nI know Sotheby's is very careful and their catalogues can be relied on. If more information is required, it is always available by contacting them by email or telephone.\n\nFinally there is a sure recourse but this is for the future. Buy young and store for 10 to 20 years. I am aware that most wine lovers here resort to wine-cooler cabinets. Purpose-built wine cellars are the exception, except with landed properties.\n\nApartment dwellers have the additional problem, apart from spare space, of the load-bearing capacity of the floor of their apartments, unless they happen to be on the ground floor. Having been there before, it would not be a good thing to happen to you to have a neighbour immediately below you complain about the cracks in his ceiling! Can be very painful on the pocket.\n\nI had suggested in an earlier column that the use of two wine-chillers of 100-bottle capacity each would seem a fairly attainable compromise. Designate one for current drinking and the other for long-term storage.\n\nAlso, if you buy in small lots, such as six bottles you could design a strategy. Decide to drink up to three or four bottles in the coming year, so as to check if worthy of long-term storage - and, of course, to enjoy them in their youth.imp Set aside the other three or four bottles for long-term storage, put a sticker on them: Do Not Open Before 10 Years -an invaluable reminder!\n\nA 100-bottle capacity would be able to hold 25 to 30 different wines for long-term maturing. I know of friends who possess three to four coolers, giving a reasonable storage capacity depending on individual capacity.\n\nWith the maximum size of 200 bottles, that allows for an 800-bottle cellar. Very adequate but well worthwhile to check floor-loading capacity in this case. Dealing with an angry neighbour below you is best avoided!\n\nOne final point. There are only great bottles, not great wines. Because there is bottle variation even with bottles from the same case.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

It will be moving out of 77 Robinson Road. DTZ is said to have advised Rabobank.\n\nAt Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3, Booking.com has inked a lease for 45,000 sq ft. It is expected to relocate from its existing premises at Suntec City. CBRE brokered the deal.\n\nBT understands that another recent tenant which has signed up in the building, which was completed last year, is Gunvor. The Europe-based commodity trading group, which provides integrated trading products and logistics services for the global oil and energy markets, is taking 22,000 sq ft.\n\nAt Asia Square Tower 2, financial services firm Citco has agreed to lease 11,000 sq ft.\n\nChris Archibold, head of markets at Jones Lang LaSalle, said the Singapore office market is experiencing strong leasing activity for spaces under 30,000 sq ft, with demand coming primarily from smaller financial institutions, such as fund managers, and business consulting groups.\n\n\"Petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals are still strong. So is insurance,\" he added.\n\nThere is also good demand for clinic space, especially from specialists, in locations within 10 minutes' walking distance from hospitals. \"In the Orchard area, we're seeing clinics displacing office tenants in some buildings as doctors can pay $13-15 psf (per square foot) in monthly rent, compared with probably $8-10 psf for a typical office occupier,\" said Mr Archibold.\n\nWord on the street is that vacancies seem to be falling in a number of older CBD office buildings as existing and new tenants absorb space vacated by occupiers who have moved to newly completed projects.\n\nThis has led to landlords starting to push up rents. For instance, a year ago, Centennial and Millenia Towers were achieving monthly rents of $8-9 psf. Today, the figure is $10-12 psf.\n\nA seasoned office leasing agent said rents at older CBD office buildings were being driven up by leases for small areas. For instance, in buildings such as Six Battery Road and Tung Centre, signing rents are about $11-12 psf for areas below 2,000 sq ft.\n\nHowever, for bigger spaces, tenants enjoy lower monthly rental, by about 50 cents to $1 psf.\n\nAt Orchard Gateway, serviced office operator Regus is believed to have signed a lease for two floors, adding up to around 12,000 sq ft. The remaining 24,000 sq ft of office space in the development is expected to be signed up soon.\n\nMarket watchers believe rents are around the $9 psf mark for Orchard Gateway's office component, which is coming up on the former Orchard Emerald site and is expected to be completed around March next year. Savills is the sole marketing agent for Orchard Gateway.\n\nOpposite Raffles Hotel, where the South Beach Tower is expected to rise by early 2015, rents are said to be nearly $10 psf a month. It will have 34 levels of office space, adding up to about 520,000 sq ft of net lettable area. Floor plates will range from 15,000-19,000 sq ft.\n\nJones Lang LaSalle, the sole marketing agent for South Beach's office and retail space, confirmed that more than 100,000 sq ft of office space in the development was under negotiations but declined to comment on the Rabobank transaction.\n\nIn a report issued this week, Savills said the office leasing market will continue to favour landlords due to the improving occupancy rates of CBD Grade A buildings, currently hovering above 95 per cent.\n\nNet absorption of CBD Grade A office space for the first nine months of this year totalled 958,000 sq ft, slightly shy of the average annual take-up of nearly one million sq ft in the past five years.\n\n\"If the momentum in the leasing market continues in the last quarter, the net annual take-up of CBD Grade A office space is expected to surpass 2012's 1.17 million sq ft,\" it added.\n\nThe average monthly rental value for Savills' basket of CBD Grade A office buildings rose for the third successive quarter, increasing 0.7 per cent quarter- on-quarter to $8.48 psf in Q3. Savills said the average monthly rent for AAA Grade office buildings located mainly in the Marina Bay area stabilised at $10.29 psf, while those for AA and A Grade office space climbed to $9 psf and $7.94 psf, respectively.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

Now, with a resurgence of home equity lending, they're ready to pay for the best.\n\n\"People don't want granite countertops - they want marble costing at least 25 per cent more,\" said Mr Mroz, owner of Michael Robert Construction in Westfield, an affluent town less than an hour's commute to Manhattan. \"Money is so cheap today, people can splurge on US$1,000 faucets.\"\n\nSpending on home renovation is rising to record levels as banks such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase increase lending for home equity lines of credit, or Helocs, after US property prices this year gained at a pace not seen since the last housing boom.\n\nHeloc originations could rise 16 per cent this year and reach another five- year high next year, according to Mustafa Akcay, an economist for Moody's Analytics, powering the earnings of Home Depot and boosting the economic expansion.\n\nHelocs are making a comeback as the US housing market recovers enough to make the junior mortgages a safer bet for banks more than seven years after the beginning of the housing crash that saddled them with billions of dollars of losses.\n\nThe median price for an existing home probably will gain 11 per cent this year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, after plunging about 33 per cent during the crash.\n\n\"The biggest use of Helocs is renovations, and the biggest spur for renovations is Helocs,\" said Kermit Baker, director of Harvard University's Remodelling Futures programme in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"When the two fuel each other, it has an enormous impact on the economy.\"\n\nAfter home prices began rising last year, the number of Americans with negative home equity - those who owe more on their properties than they are worth - began tumbling.\n\nAt the beginning of last year, that was the case with almost 16 million home loans. By the third quarter of this year, that number had dropped to 10.8 million, property data firm Zillow said in a report last week.\n\n\"There is an increase in the amount people are willing to spend on their homes as the values go up,\" said Joe Emison, chief technology officer at BuildFax, a real estate data company. \"A lot of them feel in a better position today as the job market and the economy have improved.\"\n\nHelocs typically are held by banks in their mortgage portfolios rather than being sold in the secondary market to be securitised by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, common for primary home loans, said Keith Gumbinger, vice-president of HSH.com, a mortgage data firm in Riverdale, New Jersey.\n\nLenders use them as a hedge against rising rates because they rise in tandem with bank borrowing costs, Mr Gumbinger said.\n\nHeloc financing costs usually are tied to prime rates, the interest charged by banks to their most creditworthy customers, with the addition of a margin predetermined by the lender that often is around two percentage points.\n\nThe biggest Heloc holders are Bank of America, with US$81.4 billion in the third quarter, Wells Fargo with US$79.8 billion, and JPMorgan with US$70.1 billion, according to Federal Reserve data.\n\nHelocs were used during the housing boom to cash in on surging property values to spend on cars or take vacations. Often, lenders allowed the loans to exceed property values by 25 per cent on the supposition that home prices were only going up, Mr Gumbinger said.\n\n\"If you walk into a bank today and apply for a home equity loan, they are going to want to know what you're using it for,\" Mr Gumbinger said. \"In addition to requiring you to have the best credit and retain at least 20 per cent equity in your house, they want to know your intentions are good. No more using your home as a cash register to have some fun.\"\n\nUS banks hold US$529 billion of home equity loans on their books. That's down from a record US$674 billion in early 2009 as banks wrote off Helocs made worthless by foreclosures, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance.\n\n\"These loans usually are in second-lien position, so they don't recoup any money until primary mortgage investors get all their money back,\" Mr Gumbinger said. \"The money just disappeared as home prices went down.\"\n\nThe national average prime rate has been 3.25 per cent since the end of 2008, as measured by Bloomberg. The average rate for a US$30,000 Heloc was 5.18 per cent last week, the lowest since 2009, according to Bankrate, an interest-rate aggregator based in North Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 4.22 per cent from an eight-week high of 4.35 per cent, Freddie Mac said in a statement last week, as investors speculated that the Federal Reserve will keep buying mortgage bonds to push down borrowing costs.\n\nHeloc originations will increase to US$91 billion this year and rise to US$97 billion next year, according to an estimate by Mr Akcay, the Moody's economist. Both are the highest levels since 2008.\n\nIn 2007, banks originated a record US$310 billion in Helocs, Mr Akcay said.\n\nPatrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts, said: \"The difference between today and 2007, besides volume, is the quality of loans. Banks were making really bad loans back then, with very loose standards. Today, they're more cautious.\"\n\nHome equity production at Bank of America for the first nine months of this year was US$4.4 billion, an increase of 69 per cent from the first nine months of last year when production stood at US$2.6 billion, according to Terry Francisco, a spokesman.\n\nVeronica Clemons, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, and Jason Lobo, a JPMorgan spokesman, said that their firms also have increased home equity lending, without providing specifics.\n\nThe gains won't be enough to offset this year's industry-wide plunge in loan refinancings, said Mr Francisco.\n\nApplications for mortgage refinancing fell 71 per cent to a four-year low between May and September, according to Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n\"We've seen the number of closed loans increase over the past year, but not to the point it could make up for the significant drop in refinancing,\" Mr Francisco said.\n\nRenovation spending this year probably will rise to an all-time high of US$146.1 billion, according to Harvard's Mr Baker. Last year, the spending was US$126 billion, he said.\n\nAccording to Remodeling magazine, a trade publication, most projects don't add the full cost to the value of the home.\n\nRemodeling a basement probably would recoup 70 per cent of the outlay when it's time to sell, and a family room addition likely would see a 63 per cent return.\n\nA major kitchen renovation is worth 69 per cent when the house is on the market, and a master suite addition will return 63 per cent, the publication estimates on its website.\n\nSpending on renovations is benefiting retailers who sell construction supplies. Home Depot, the largest, last week boosted its fiscal 2014 earnings forecast after reporting that its third-quarter profit was 43 per cent higher than a year ago. That compares with a 17 per cent year-over-year gain in the prior quarter, the Atlanta-based company said.\n\nMr Mroz, the New Jersey contractor, is working on a two-storey addition in Westfield that expands a home's kitchen and family room. Most of his customers last year wanted crawl spaces under additions as a cost-saving measure, Mr Mroz said. These owners, who declined to be identified or discuss their financing for the project, had Mr Mroz dig a full basement with an extra-high ceiling, he said.\n\nThe second floor of the addition has a dormer window protruding from the roofline. Instead of covering it with asphalt shingles to match the rest of their roof, the customers upgraded to copper as an architectural accent, he said.\n\nHome values in Westfield rose 9.1 per cent to US$646,300 in the past year, according to Zillow, a real estate data firm in Seattle. In the nearby towns of Summit and Plainfield the increase was about 7 per cent, and in Short Hills the gain was 6.2 per cent, according to Zillow.\n\n\"People aren't cheaping out anymore because more of them are getting Helocs instead of saving up cash,\" said Mr Mroz.\n\nGetting a Heloc is \"a lot easier to do with home prices coming back\", he said. - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nProperty\n\nShould capital gains tax replace seller\u2019s stamp duty on homes?\n\nJul 14, 2025 11:45 AM\n\nCapitaLand sells 94% of LyndenWoods at average S$2,450 psf; IOI\u2019s W Residences Marina View suffers poor take-up\n\nJul 13, 2025 03:04 PM\n\nTrump\u2019s 50% copper import tariff said to cover refined metal\n\nJul 12, 2025 09:13 AM\n\nGetting real on Good Class Bungalow prices\n\nJul 11, 2025 02:05 PM\n\nUS mortgage rates climb after five straight weeks of declines\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:46 AM\n\nQ3 wave of condo launches will test demand for Singapore prime projects above S$3,000 psf benchmark\n\nJul 10, 2025 06:01 PM\n\nManhattan rents hit another record with more increases to come\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:32 PM\n\nGoldman buys 262 billion won hotel, retail assets in Seoul\n\nJul 10, 2025 10:28 AM", "images": [{"image_url": "https://d2kxlefydm4hr1.cloudfront.net/image/businesstimes/c7a0681c3024839cbf4d13048b6e663306cfeac79ab8617ad9cceaa768246e16?w=1520&f=webp", "alt_text": "Hail Heloc: The resurgence of home equity lending by banks such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase is boosting the earnings of retailers that sell construction supplies as well as the US economic expansion. - PHOTO: AFP"}]}

Many of these diagnostic and therapeutic techniques in the area of heart disease involve the use of ionising radiation (harmful radiation) which includes X-rays and radiation from radioactive isotopes injected into the body. While the use of these diagnostic and therapeutic options with ionising radiation in the management of heart diseases have both been indispensable to physicians and beneficial to patients, resulting in decreasing death rates and prolonging survival, repeated exposure to significant doses of radiation may have adverse consequences.\n\nRadiation risks from cardiac procedures\n\nThere is no absolute consensus as to what the limit of radiation is that can be deemed harmful to the body although there is complete consensus that high radiation exposure increases the risk of cancer.\n\nMuch of the data on the impact of radiation on humans comes from the Life Span study (published in Radiation Research journal in 2007) which examined the survivors of the atomic explosions in Japan and who had a mean radiation dose exposure of 29 mSv; and the 15 Country Study on more than 400,000 radiation workers (published in British Medical Journal in 2005 and Radiation Research journal in 2007) whose average radiation dose exposure was more than 19 mSv. Both these studies demonstrated an incremental risk of cancer of about 2 per cent.\n\nThere is also epidemiological data from patients who have suffered a heart attack. In a publication in the American Journal of Cardiology in 2012, Canadian researchers reported on the radiation exposure for patients suffering their first heart attack during a 10-year period.\n\nThe paper showed a doubling of radiation doses over the years for patients who were admitted to hospital with an acute heart attack. This was due to an increasing trend to attempt to immediately open blocked heart arteries using balloon and stent techniques upon admission to the hospital - resulting in an average radiation exposure dose of about 12 millisieverts (mSv) within the first month of an acute heart attack.\n\nThe increase in radiation exposure is balanced by the life saving benefits of opening a blocked artery as quickly as possible. In the subsequent two years of the acute heart attack, the average cumulative radiation in this study group from heart scans and procedures was about 19 mSv.\n\nIn an earlier 2011 publication by the same team of Canadian researchers, from 1996 to 2006, of the close to 64,000 patients in the study who had their first heart attack, slightly more than 12,000 (about 19 per cent) were diagnosed to have new cancers. The authors concluded that increased exposure to radiation from cardiac procedures was associated with an increased risk of subsequent cancer. The authors estimated that for every 10 mSv of harmful radiation, there was a 3 per cent increase in the risk of cancer over a five-year period.\n\nBenefits of cardiac diagnostic procedures\n\nHowever, the risks of radiation exposure have to be compared to the risk of dying from a heart condition. In a 2012 publication in the European Heart Journal which examined radiation from cardiac imaging, the authors provided estimates of cancer risk from cardiac procedures as compared to risks from underlying heart disease.\n\nFor example, males in their sixth decade with no symptoms but who have more than one risk factor for heart disease, the 10-year risk of dying from heart disease is 1,000 per 10,000. For these patients, the lifetime incremental cancer risk resulting from radiation exposure from a low-dose cardiac imaging test, such as a low radiation dose coronary CT angiogram using the appropriate techniques, is about 2 per 10000.\n\nSimply put, in this example, if 10,000 patients with this profile were to undergo a low radiation dose heart scan, 1,000 heart deaths may potentially be prevented at the risk of two additional persons developing cancer. While the calculated risk from radiation is a lifetime risk, the heart risk given in this example is only based on a 10-year risk and hence, will also increase substantially when a longer period is considered.\n\nFor patients with chest symptoms, the likelihood of finding significant heart disease is much higher than in those with no symptoms. Hence, the benefits of doing heart scans when compared to radiation risks are even more substantial.\n\nBenefits and risks of therapeutic cardiac procedures\n\nCardiac procedures that are used to treat heart conditions may sometimes carry significant risks. In a recent 2013 editorial in Circulation Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology journal, the author addressed the issue of treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF), the commonest abnormal heart rhythm in the elderly.\n\nAs AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, one of the techniques currently being used is radiofrequency ablation which involves the insertion of catheters into the heart and burning a ring around the heart tissue to isolate foci which trigger AF. However, in recent years, concerns have been raised about the presence of asymptomatic strokes following radiofrequency ablation, with a reported incidence of asymptomatic stroke as high as 39 per cent. In a worldwide survey by Cappato published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in 2009, the major complication rate was 4.5 per cent. For every 10,000 procedures, there were 15 deaths, 23 major strokes and 71 transient strokes. In addition, the success rate is about 2 out of 3 and there is a high rate of recurrence of AF following radiofrequency ablation.\n\nHence, given the risks of the procedure and the high recurrence rate, medication should be considered first before considering radiofrequency ablation as an option. In contrast, there is very little doubt that opening the blocked heart artery during an acute heart attack with balloon and stent techniques has substantial benefits for the patient as compared to the risks.\n\nGolden rules\n\nWhen you are required to do a heart test or procedure, do remember a few Golden rules: Firstly, when a diagnostic heart test is required, a non-invasive option which has no harmful radiation is preferred.\n\nSecond, if blockage of the heart artery is suspected, always opt for a non-invasive test first before considering an invasive test.\n\nThird, if invasive coronary angiography is proposed to confirm the presence of significant blockage of the heart artery, a CT scan of the heart arteries may be considered as an alternative as it is non-invasive. For young adults and women, a magnetic resonance imaging scan of the heart arteries, if available, will be a good alternative for women and young adults as the procedure carries no radiation risk and does not require any injection.\n\nFourthly, before undergoing any non-invasive scan of the heart that has harmful radiation, it may be good to understand the amount of radiation exposure from the test.\n\nLastly, if you are undergoing a heart procedure, you may want to understand the risk of both major complications and the risk of \"silent\" complications such as \"silent\" strokes. While the \"silent\" strokes may not be obvious, they can contribute to memory and cognitive impairment in later years.\n\nThis series is brought to you by Heart, Stroke and Cancer Centre.

They took everything - everything that we had - including clothes, toiletries, electronics.\"\n\nThey also took the ship's cargo. The Maltese-flagged vessel was carrying about 10,000 tonnes of fuel oil belonging to France's largest oil company when it was attacked by 15 pirates off the coast of Gabon in West Africa. The hijackers kept control of the tanker for seven days as they siphoned off the fuel.\n\nWhile Total SA eventually got its fuel oil back with the help of Ghana's navy, Mr Varma's story is becoming increasingly typical as Africa's west coast replaces Somalia as the world's most piracy-prone area. The attacks, which are getting more frequent and more violent, threaten shipping in sub-Saharan Africa's largest oil-producing region.\n\nWest Africa's Gulf of Guinea had 40 piracy attacks in the first nine months of the year, compared with 10 incidents in waters around Somalia, according to data from the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Centre (IMB PRC). As well as stealing from ships, kidnappings are on the rise. Last month, two US citizens were seized from a supply ship before being released after more than two weeks.\n\n\"Initially they were interested in holding the ships, stealing the cargo, taking this ship's crew possessions and money, and leaving,\" said Roy Paul, a director at Maritime Piracy Humanitarian Response Program. \"This year, we've seen an increase in taking hostages\" for ransom.\n\nNigeria, Gabon, Ghana and other countries around the Gulf of Guinea produce more than 3 million barrels a day, or about one-third of Africa's output, according to data compiled by BP Plc. The region's crude, often so-called sweet grades that are refined into high-value motor fuels, is shipped to refiners in the US, Europe and Asia. Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea are also leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters.\n\nThis year, piracy has spread through the region from Nigeria, where theft from ships has long been common, and ships are being attacked further offshore, according to the IMB. Boardings or hijacks have been reported off Togo, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Guinea.\n\nPiracy's rise in West Africa has been mirrored by its decline off Somalia, where kidnappings spurred a response from shipowners and Western governments. The deployment of warships and the use of armed guards has resulted in the number of incidents plunge this year.\n\nThe use of private security may be less appropriate in the Gulf of Guinea because the pirates are more violent, said Jan Fritz Hansen, who chairs the piracy task force at the European Community Shipowners' Association.\n\n\"They are becoming more and more organised,\" Mr Hansen said in an interview. \"You can't really rely on private armed guards. It should be a stronger force from governments. The criminals down there are a bit better equipped and armed.\"\n\nInternational oil companies exporting from the region are taking steps to protect ships from attack. \"We take extra precautions on all our LNG tankers for security,\" said Andrew Gould, chairman of UK- based producer BG Group Plc, which exports all of Equatorial Guinea's natural gas. \"We have a procedure in place. We have warned people.\" - Bloomberg\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Prices rose in 69 of the 70 cities tracked by the government.\n\nShenzhen and Shanghai this month raised minimum down payments for second homes to 70 per cent, following a similar move by Beijing in March, as local authorities struggle to contain price gains.

The opposition has accused them of corruption and trying to pass laws to whitewash Thaksin of a graft conviction.\n\nCivil servants fled as groups of demonstrators surrounded the interior, agriculture, tourism and transport ministries in blockades that have plunged Thailand into its deepest political uncertainty since it was convulsed by the bloodiest unrest in a generation in 2010.\n\n\"Getting rid of the Thaksin regime is not easy,\" said protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister under the previous Democrat government, in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe demonstrations \"might be longer than the three days originally planned\", he said.\n\nThough Ms Yingluck is expected to prevail in tomorrow's confidence vote, it is unlikely to defuse a crisis fuelled by anger over the electoral and legislative power the Shinawatra family has long held, and is accused of abusing.\n\nIt is uncertain how long the confrontation will go on. Ms Yingluck might, analysts say, seek to bolster her legitimacy by calling an election she would likely win, as Thaksin has done before, but that could be risky.\n\n\"She would first need to be absolutely sure there were no undemocratic forces preparing to fill the power vacuum that would be created,\" said Kan Yuenyong, director of the Siam Intelligence Unit think-tank. \"Right now, it's brinkmanship. The other side knows an election would only create another Thaksin government . . . The best scenario for both sides is negotiations, but the problem is, they don't trust each other.\"\n\nThe uncertainty is driving foreign investors out of Thai financial markets, making the baht the second-worst performing emerging Asian currency in November, having lost 2.7 per cent this month. Thai stocks have retreated about 6 per cent.\n\nA court issued a warrant yesterday for the arrest of Mr Suthep in connection with the raid on the Finance Ministry. Together with former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, he has been charged with murder for allowing troops to open fire in 2010 protests by Thaksin's supporters.\n\nA year later, their Democrat Party was routed in an election that swept Ms Yingluck to power. - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nNew Articles\n\nThevar 2.0 shows off mod-Indian cuisine in a new light\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:50 AM\n\nEU, Indonesia strike political agreement to advance free trade deal\n\nJul 13, 2025 08:26 PM\n\nMalaysia ex-PM Mahathir, 100, discharged from hospital\n\nJul 13, 2025 04:47 PM\n\nSpaceX to invest US$2 billion in Musk's xAI startup\n\nJul 13, 2025 07:09 PM\n\nXi\u2019s price-war campaign creates buzz in China\u2019s stock market\n\nJul 13, 2025 05:05 PM\n\nAsean agrees Myanmar election is not a priority, Malaysia says\n\nJul 11, 2025 03:35 PM\n\nA low-profile property trust\u2019s data centre gambit\n\nJul 11, 2025 05:00 AM\n\nUS weekly jobless claims fall unexpectedly\n\nJul 10, 2025 09:07 PM", "images": []}

Another 21 airports are to be built within a decade.\n\nOverseas interest in Indonesia has been rising for years.\n\nFrance's Vinci, Germany's Fraport AG, South Korea's Incheon, Japan's Mitsubishi Corp and Sojitz Corp have recently approached Indonesian companies about possible investment opportunities, said two senior officials with state-owned air operator Angkasa Pura I.\n\nBut no foreign firm has been able to grab a major stake in any of Indonesia's major airports due to restrictive government regulations and land acquisition issues. The country's airports are currently operated by either the government or state-owned companies. \"Many foreign companies have come to us. They are asking and waiting for their opportunity,\" Tommy Soemoto, president director of Angkasa Pura I, said earlier this month. \"It is up to the government now.\"\n\nIndonesia's airports are on a \"negative investment list\", which limits foreign involvement in areas deemed sensitive. Under the regulations, foreign companies are limited to owning no more than 49 per cent of domestic airports.\n\nIndonesian officials have proposed removing airports, ports and airport services from this list to help revive a slowing economy. The measures need the approval of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.\n\nIndonesia's investment chief Mahendra Siregar said that minor details of the proposal were still being finalised, and should be approved in early December.\n\nIndia's GVK Power & Infrastructure said that Indonesia's plan to allow 100 per cent foreign direct investment in airport development would \"facilitate not only capital infusion but also the much needed management, technical and operation expertise\". India's largest private airport operator is expected to become the first foreign company to hold a major stake in an Indonesian airport when it teams up with Angkasa Pura I next year to build a second airport in the central Java city of Yogyakarta.\n\nThe US$700 million project is expected to be finalised next year with operations starting as early as 2017.\n\nAngkasa Pura I also hopes next year to spin-off five of its most profitable airports, including the Ngurah Rai International Airport in Bali, to enable foreign investment for its expansion plans, Yudhaprana Sugarda, head of corporate planning, said earlier this month. \"Up to 900 new planes will be delivered into Indonesia in the next decade,\" he said. \"We must seek cooperation to improve our infrastructure to be ready.\" - Reuters\n\nShare with us your feedback on BT's products and services\n\nFeedback\n\nmore in\n\nTransport & Logistics\n\nActing Transport Minister Siow announces global maritime and aviation training initiatives, new support scheme for small island nations\n\nJul 14, 2025 10:00 AM\n\nLondon's Heathrow eyes higher fees for \u00a310b upgrade\n\nJul 11, 2025 08:31 PM\n\nMusk's Tesla marks formal India entry with Mumbai launch event\n\nJul 11, 2025 04:33 PM\n\nTesla plans robotaxi expansion to California and Arizona\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:07 PM\n\nFedEx partners Singapore startup QuikBot to deploy robots for deliveries in commercial areas\n\nJul 11, 2025 12:00 PM\n\nDelta Air Lines offers upbeat outlook on travel demand, lifting shares\n\nJul 11, 2025 06:42 AM\n\nJapan\u2019s carmakers slash export prices to US to offset tariff hit\n\nJul 10, 2025 01:51 PM\n\nBYD, other EV battery makers face more pressure to cut emissions\n\nJul 10, 2025 11:30 AM", "images": []}

Ship owners ordered large numbers of new vessels between 2007 and 2009, just as the global economy ran into its biggest crisis since the 1930s.\n\n\"A big chunk (of the shipping portfolio) will go into the bad bank and the intention is to sell it down as quickly as possible,\" one source said. \"They will definitely also exit a number of relationships, even on performing loans. It will be a much smaller exposure for a much smaller bank. This is coming from outside of the shipping business.\"\n\nThe sources said that an estimated US$4 billion to US$5 billion of shipping loans are expected to go into the bad bank, with the total shipping portfolio now standing at an estimated US$16 billion.\n\nRBS declined to comment on its shipping business on Friday.\n\nThe bank, 81 per cent owned by British taxpayers, said this month that it would create an internal \"bad bank\" to fence off its riskiest assets, part of a series of measures designed to heal its relationship with the government and speed its eventual privatisation.\n\nTrade sources last week said that RBS was in discussions to sell a shipping loan worth close to US$800 million.\n\nBritain aims to offload its stakes in RBS and state-backed rival Lloyds Banking Group as soon as possible, having pumped in a combined \u00a366 billion (S$132.6 billion) to keep the banks afloat during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nEarlier in the week, sources said that Lloyds had sold between US$500 million and US$550 million of shipping loans after divesting a separate US$750 million tranche last year.\n\n\"RBS may try the Lloyds approach to selectively sell or package loans down the road - US$500 million now, US$500 million in six months - and get the best pricing, especially if the market keeps improving,\" another source said. \"Or they could select the most toxic assets in the bad bank and have a fire sale, get 20 per cent on the dollar and take a huge loss on a small part of the toxic stuff. That would help their overall ratios and buy some more time. It's a huge portfolio and it would be very difficult to sell wholesale.\"\n\nSeveral European banks including RBS and Lloyds are seeking drastic reductions to their shipping loan portfolios as they clean up their balance sheets to become less risky while regulators demand that they hold more capital.\n\nRBS had been among the top lenders to the sector, with its shipping boss, Lambros Varnavides, one of the industry's most influential players. Mr Varnavides helped the bank to build a particularly strong presence in the lucrative Greek market.\n\nSeveral industry sources said Mr Varnavides is expected to retire soon.

So it is with both excitement and some sorrow that theatre lovers get to see the last title of the much celebrated series next week.\n\nAdapted from a short story by Can Themba, The Suit is an unusual tale of infidelity set in the apartheid era of 1950s in South Africa.\n\nNonhlanhla Kheswa plays a woman who is married to an honest man played by Ivanno Jeremiah. One day, he comes home to find her in bed with another man. The latter flees in his underwear, leaving his suit behind.\n\nInstead of throwing away the lover's suit, the cuckolded husband decides to punish his wife by insisting that she keep the suit and bring it with her wherever she goes. The suit becomes a painful reminder of the woman's infidelity and eventually tears their union apart.\n\nActor Jordan Barbour plays the man's best friend who becomes the story's moral conscience as he witnesses the tragedy unfold but can't decide how he should help the couple.\n\nHe explains: \"This is no ordinary story of infidelity, because it is set in South Africa, where the horrible discrimination that the blacks face affect the way they treat each other.\n\n\"Here, the man chooses to not physically abuse his wife because, in a way, he wants to rebel against his oppressors' methods. But instead, he ends up playing this mental game of humiliation with her as a way of getting back at her, which ultimately brings about the same kind of destruction to their lives.\"\n\nAs an African-American, Barbour says that he understands how the history of subjugation and humiliation runs deep in the psyche of black South Africans.\n\n\"In America, it's common for black kids to receive spanking and beating from their families. Scholarship points to the beating of black slaves by their slave masters, and how these black slaves in turn beat their children, who grow up and beat their own children . . . The cycle of violence becomes commonplace and not questioned.\"\n\nCrucial to the production of The Suit is the live band on stage, which plays a wide range of music from Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday to Schubert.\n\nBarbour says: \"Music was remarkably important to the South African people because it helped them survive, it helped them smile through this horrible thing that they were going through. Hence, The Suit is told with a lot of music and singing - which doesn't so much support the storytelling as to be a crucial element in the story.\"\n\nBarbour gets to sing only one song - but it's perhaps the most affecting number of them all: the classic song Strange Fruit by Billie Holiday, which is about the lynching of blacks by whites racists in America's south.\n\nThe lyrics go: Southern trees bear a strange fruit/ Blood on the leaves and blood at the root/ Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze/ Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.\n\nBarbour says: \"The story of The Suit may be quite unique to this specific couple. But the story of struggle is not, and the story of subjugation is not, and the story of colonialism and imperialism is not.\"\n\nThe Suit directed by Peter Brook and presented by the Esplanade and the Singapore Repertory Theatre plays at the DBS Arts Centre - Home of SRT, Robertson Quay, from Nov 22 to Nov 25, Fri-Mon: 8pm, Mon and Sat: 4pm.

This will be used for up to 500 SMRT buses for the next three years.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Acma said Femto was also exploring similar business opportunities with other local transport and logistics providers.\n\nThe agreement with SMRT was signed by Femto's Singapore authorised distributor Enermax Pte Ltd, a company wholly owned by Christopher Quek and Quek Mei Hsien, respectively the son and daughter of Acma's executive chairman and controlling shareholder Quek Sim Pin.\n\nFemto was incorporated in July 2012 as a joint venture between Russian and Singapore shareholders to manufacture and sell fuel-saving products based on nanotechnology.\n\nAccording to Acma, adding Femto's product to engine oil results in reduced friction and lower fuel consumption.

{"article_url": "https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/lifestyle/drinking-wine-you-food-you", "site_title": "Drinking wine you like with food you like", "publish_date": null, "content": "SUBSCRIBERS\n\nDrinking wine you like with food you like\n\nPeople now have their own rules, mostly as a result of their individual experiences with adaptation, says NK YONG\n\nPublished\n\nThu, Nov 14, 2013 \u00b7 10:00 PM\n\nIT indicates the degree of development and maturity of the wine culture here that the question asked today is more often: \"What shall we drink at dinner tonight?\" rather than \"Shall we drink wine at dinner tonight?\" It has been a gradual maturing, which I think began in the late nineties, gathering speed since the turn of the century.\n\nGrowing up in colonial Singapore, my wining and dining practices were naturally influenced by Western, basically British, colonial culture. The British brought with them to Singapore Scotch whisky (naturally!), gin, cognac, port, champagne and French red and white wines. And British dining culture. For readers too young to know what that means, it meant that the evening would generally begin with cocktails, or brandy or whisky with soda, or the ubiquitous gin and tonic, champagne being considered a great luxury and reserved for very special occasions, eg birthdays or weddings. Dinner would then begin with a sherry, usually a dry amontillado to accompany the soup, almost de rigeur. This was followed by a white, a burgundy generally, with the seafood. A red, usually Bordeaux, would be standard practice with the main (usually beef or lamb) course.\n\nThe next and very civilised custom would be the after-dinner practice of retiring to the library for port with cigars or cigarettes while the ladies retired to the dressing room to repair their make-up. Standard English culture; all by the book. Boring? Not really at the time. For us natives, rank amateurs, all this dining culture was totally foreign, but very useful and stands us in good stead when travelling in Europe.\n\nFast-forward three decades and the scene here has changed beyond recognition. Wine is part of the dining culture today as we know it. To say we have become more sophisticated in our dining culture smacks of elitism and smugness. Rather, it is that we do not even think about it and drink wine as we would water. The results are very interesting. Take the subject of wine and food matching. Those of us who first tiptoed into the wine culture three decades ago were given to understand that you do not drink red wine with seafood as the tannins in red wine would clash with some substances in seafood, especially seafood with shells. This we duly noted and kept the faith. Red wine with red meat was another dictum which was \"no sweat!\" as that was what we liked to hear. And so on . . .\n\nNow. what has happened is that as our experience with the use of wine with food grew, our tastes and perceptions began to change, undergoing adaptation and acceptance. This phenomenon of adaptation is well-known and understood. A sensory experience initially perceived as unpleasant, distasteful, or even painful, if experienced repetitively and for a long-enough period, becomes tolerable to varying degrees, and sometimes to the extent of eventually being perceived as the norm. One's sensory capacity comes to accept the new environment as the norm. Thus, the sensory clash between oysters, for instance, with anything else other than a dry white wine, eg Chablis, becomes tolerable, acceptable, allowing therefore drinking a red with shellfish.\n\nTo a varying extent, we have formulated our own rules, which in many cases are more of personal rules, the result of our individual experiences with adaptation. The new adage, \"drink the wine you like with the food you like\", has replaced the ones we were initiated with, \"white with seafood, and red with red meat\" and \"no red wine with shell fish\". With that new acquired culture and new approach to the subject of wine with food, anything goes - almost! One cannot go far wrong if you drink the wine you like with the food you like because you will mentally and sensually accept the combination and think that is the norm, even if at first it jars. Because you want to eat the food you like with the wine you like. And that is the driving reason. Deriving from my own experience, it is almost as if I was dealing with the different tastes with two difference centres in my brain.\n\nTake our fondness for spicy foods or chillis and accompanying them with wine. \"Mon dieu!\" the French would say. I have long held the view that we, Asians, who are used to spicy chilli-hot food and who drink wine with it, have developed a most useful mental capability of evaluating the taste of the wine against a background of spicy hot tastes. It is as if we use two different parts of the sensory cortex, one that handles and interprets the sensory reception of nerve impulses set off by the taste of curry, and a separate one which does that for nerve impulses set off by the wines. At least, it seems to me that is how my brain behaves! I can sense the taste of curry in the background as I drink and taste the wine. It always appears to me that I am using two different parts of my brain.\n\nHow does this impact our dining culture? Quite simple. We do not hesitate to drink what we like with our meals. Take sashimi. I like sake but I do not know enough about it - something to be rectified in the near future - and besides this, it is drunk in small mouthfuls which does not quite quench one's thirst after the wasabi. So wine it is. Fish. White wine? Yes, of course, but red? The obvious answer is \"Pinot Noir\". Its soft tannins do not clash with the fish.\n\nI am reminded of our experience with a very famous tempura chef in Osaka. The first time I went there, two years ago, I spotted on the kitchen counter behind him a bottle of German Pinot Noir among the sake, a Friedrich Becker Spaetburgunder. Right place for dinner! When asked for wine/sake choice, I pointed to the Becker Spaetburgunder, asking if we could have that. It turned out that it was not on the restaurant list but was the chef's personal wine! My spirits sank. But back came the cheerful reply: \"Yes, of course!\" It was a lovely German Pinot Noir; we drank just about two-thirds of it and left the balance to the chef. All I can remember of the wine was that it was a typical Becker Pinot Noir, and very good indeed if you adjust your mental band-wave and do not expect a Burgundy red.\n\nPost-script:\n\nLast year, we went back to Osaka and to the same tempura restaurant. I brought the chef a French Burgundy, Nuits St Georges 1er cru Clos de la Marechale 2006, Domaine J F Mugnier.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.

The tea industry creates employment for almost two million people, or 10 per cent of the population, directly and indirectly. Export earnings in 2012 contributed 17.5 per cent to government coffers and at US$1.5 billion, it's the highest among all tea-producing countries of the world.\n\nIn terms of global production, Sri Lanka is the fourth largest manufacturer of tea after China, India and Kenya, but it's the second largest tea exporter after Kenya since China and India have a large domestic consumption.\n\nMost of the tea (76 per cent) is produced by smallholders while 24 per cent is produced on corporate estates. For now, the majority of Sri Lanka's teas are shipped to Russia and the Middle East. Japan is also a key market.\n\nValue-added tea exports - which encompass the blending, bagging and branding of teas - account for 45 per cent of Sri Lanka's total export volume, which is about 22 million kilos of teabags a year.\n\nCopyright SPH Media.
